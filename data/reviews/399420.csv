The game itself tells a subtle story about two simple characters that are looking to gain their freedom, while being watched by a being called the Prism. The game itself plays nicely, eases you into levels while slowly increasing difficulty. The story tells itself in a subtle way, explaining what has happened before and who the characters are. The music and artwork create a very calm atmosphere, with beautiful environments. As the game progresses you lose and unlock different abilities, which makes the game's playstyle and content constantly move around and change. Overall this game is great, could use a little tweaking when it comes to options menu's though.\n\nI give it a solid 8.5/10","September 13, 2015","true","0.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

Why does this game have mixed reviews? (at the time I wrote this)\n\nThis review is written with currently only 1.5 hours put into the game. I have quite liked so far of what I have played and figured I would give it a quick review.\nSo far what I have played makes me realize how under-rated this game really is. This is a one of a kind puzzle game that I have not seen anything like before.\nI'm usually a total newbie when it comes to puzzle games but The Prism was simple enough at the start for me to pick up as well as constantly introducing new level elements as the game progressed.\n\nGameplay\nThe main gameplay of The Prism is you controlling two cubes. As long as one of those two cubes reaches the exit then you progress.\nThe creator claims its similar to the game 'Thomas was Alone' and I have to agree with them. It is quite similar to that game.\nThere are some levels that feature new random mechanics that come into play for only that level. This keeps the game interesting and I honestly like that a whole lot, even though you may never see those mechanics again.\n\nThere are some issues with the collision detection however as sometimes, '02' and '03' can get stuck in each other if you make them jump into each other.\nThis is only a minor issue however, it doesn't take away much from the game.\nAlso the resolution seems to be all over the place between levels, The game auto stretches to your native resolution but its obvious when you change levels.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are very well crafted. None of the puzzles seem rushed and they all feel very different to each other.\nThe level design feels like it always features one new "thing" that you get to play with or over come.\nBe it making a bridge out of lying cubes or flying through valleys in a 'Helicopter'-esque mini-game. 'The Prism' always feels fresh.\n\nStory\nThere is very little story to The Prism, you are just spawned into the game and left to figure it out.\nThere are some hints at some story but nothing is given to you at the start to give you a hint to the story.\nYou just play as cube '02' and '03' and help them progress.\n\nEven if there is little to no story, I cant help but feel for the little guys.\nI WANT them to get through the levels and progress forward. I cant even explain why because they are just little cubes.\nAgain, this is similar to 'Thomas was Alone'.\n\nAudio\nThe soundtrack to the prism is absolutely stunning. If anyone knows me well, they will know that I ♥♥♥♥ing love music and a games soundtrack is something I almost certainly hunt down.\nThe Prism's soundtrack was done by 'MISTER STRANGE' and it is very atmospheric. It leaves me simply enchanted because of just how calm it is.\nThe music fits in almost perfectly with the game, it matches the visuals perfectly as the locations you take place in, you could imagine them actually sounding like the soundtrack.\nThis is a damn good sign of a damn good soundtrack.\n\nThe soundtrack can be found on Soundcloud  here! [soundcloud.com], You should totally check it out.\n\nWhere I do think the soundtrack is perfect. What is there is very limited. There is only 6 songs and they repeat maybe too often.\nIf there was a couple more songs that would change every now and again, to remove the repetition, then it would be a 10/10 perfect.\n\nVisuals\nOkay this game looks STUNNING. The game feels like the developer crafted each and every frame with extreme precision as every little detail looks gorgeous.\nEach and every environment in this game bursts with vibrant colors, if it was a steak, it would be extremely juicy.\nThe colors in the game just look absolutely stunning, Every time you transition into a new environment, I always take a step back to just look at how lovely the game looks.\nBecause Jesus, this game provides many 'Wallpaper' Moments where i just want to stop playing and take photo's.\n\nThe only thing on the Visuals that I could criticize would be that some of the backdrops look a tad bit blurry, they look really odd compared to the rest of the game.\n\nFinal Overview\nSo in overall, The Prism is a puzzle platformer that I feel is incredibly underrated on steam. Its another case of a game being misrepresented by its reviews.\nWhere I cant say that the other reviews are wrong, because that is their own opinion, but my opinion on the game is that it is pretty god damn good.\nThe visuals and the audio fit together perfectly, like a match made in heaven. The gameplay and the level design always feel fresh and new.\nEvery chapter brings something new into the mix and the game never feels like its stale at all. Minus a couple of bugs and graphical errors.\nThe games gets the following scores from me.\n\nGameplay - 7.5\nStory - 5\nAudio - 9.5\nVisual - 9.5\n\nOVERALL SCORE - 8.5","January 8","true","1.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Yes. $10? Don't make me laugh.\n\nThe game is pretty good; I do recommend this game at a highly discounted price! The ambiance of the game is definitely the best part, the maps were well done and the music added to the tranquil pixel puzzler experience.\n\nYou play as 2 blocks that must assist each other in accomplishing levels. The gameplay is simple but challenging. There is a storyline but it was too sparse for me to care or comprehend. You must use duel pads/keys to play this game, which I really enjoy; shows some serious potential with the steam controller!\n\nThe biggest issue for me honestly is the price; for just $5 more you could grab Brothers; which is basically the same concept but on steroids, and way better! I would have rated this higher if not for humorous price tag.\n\nWorth $2-4; pretty sure I got it in a bundle for less.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

I was blown away. The beautiful art style, atmosphere and music are incredible. The puzzles get increasingly difficult, although it starts off a bit slow. This game doesn't get enough attention and is WAAAAAAAAAAY underrated.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Salarn/recommended/399420/","Salarn","Salarn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Salarn/","2132 products in account","This puzzle platformer puts the player in control of a pair of runaway pixels.  Technically they look like at least 256 pixels cubes.  Each controlled with a different position on the keyboard to allow both to move independently.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tiLZqJN1C-w\n\nThe visual style of this game is simple but the high contrast makes it enjoyable.  The lack of visual cues for dangers will cause some frustration.\n\nHowever, the greatest frustration factor is the controls and surface detection.  This finicky combination can result in missed input resulting in pixel death.\n\nOccasionally the game will ask the player to hold keys down to manipulate the pixels to progress through levels.  This is an attempt of physicality to add weight to the actions of the pixels, that they can't be ignored.  Regrettably, the end result is more tedium than empathy.","February 29","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has a strong atmosphere and characters. The puzzles were challenging and some of the cool powers I got were really cool. The overall story is quite simple, yet really deep and emotional.

I would definitely recommend this game.","September 4, 2015","true","0.1"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"
