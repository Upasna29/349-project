That did not turn out to be true.  Now normally I enjoy games that go out of their way to be different and try something new.  While it is safe to say Retention is something different that does not make it good in any way.  A big problem with Retention is that it promises a story that never happens.  The game description says you're given the 'opportunity to tell a man by his memories', but I found that this just amounts to you picking one picture out of a group of three and then being given a small one sentence summary of the picture (as if you already couldn't tell just by looking at most of them).  The ending you recieve  after picking one picture out of all 85 groups of 3 doesn't help clarify the story in any way.  I've played through it multiple times now and I still can't decipher how or why I unlocked certain endings (and you can unlock multiple ones at once) and not others.\n\nConfusion is honestly another reason why Retention is not a good game.  Again this is a game which in the description promises a 'user-friendly interface'.  I did not find that to be the case.  Right from the start the only helpful information given to you is how to move between slides and that you have to pick one picture out of a group of three.  The problem is that the game starts you at the very moment when the man presumably got into his biking accident.  You must then go back through all 85 of his memories (the pictures you'll get tired of looking at because they never change).  There are many problems with this.  First is the fact that it's very hard to tell what picture group you're on. It took me way too long to figure out that the only thing indicating what group you're on is a thin strip of white that appears below the square of film you're on.  Second is that if you somehow miss a picture group you're kind of screwed.  The only thing that separates picture groups you've selected a picture from, from ones you haven't is a tiny (very easy to miss) + sign.  Those two things coupled with being forced to flip through all the pictures you've already selected and seen to see if you've done enough to achieve an ending and in the end being denied one because you missed one group (out of 85) is downright frustrating.\n\nIn the end the only good thing I can say about Retention is that it has some pretty pictures and okay music.  There is also the fact it has cards, but even those can't make up for the fact that Retention is bad game.","January 13, 2015","false","1.7"," 204 of 212 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","204","212","8","0"

Speaking from experience, no imagery passed  across my mind at the time of my serious cycling accident  apart from  images of being run over while I lay in the road and  wishing the pulsating pain in my back would go away.  That said, I  quite enjoyed   working through all of the images.  It took me     a couple of goes to   see them all, and I spent quite  some time looking at some of the images as I do love photography.  The only point if interest I see in this game (apart from the actual value of looking at the images) is  seeing which outcome you arrive at  once you've worked through the  images for the first time.  I lost my memory on my first go, lol.\n\nEven though I enjoyed this  experience, I wouldn't  call it a game nor  can I recommend it to  my friends  or any one else.  It was not a waste of money for me (unlike that  aweful Lord of the Rings bundle, which was removed  from Steam within a day of it going on sale), but I reckon if you must buy this, it is only £0.67p at the time of writing (with 15% off).

I could only find one definition of the word "Game" which even comes close to defining it: "A complete episode or period of play, ending in a final result".\n\nSteam's store page lists it as a casual indie adventure. Casual and indie maybe, but adventure implies some kind of story at least, and... well, you'll see.\n\nThe game starts windowed at about 1280 by 800, and has no fullscreen option. In fact the only options it has are the language and whether you want it to force the ending after ten and a half minutes. Whether this is strictly necessary I'll let you decide yourselves after reading about a little of what could only very graciously be called "gameplay".\n\nWhen you start a new game, you're given this: A picture of a leg and a bike. There's some backstory about how you've fallen off and need to go back through your memories to put things together again, but it's utterly irrelevant. You move through the memories either with the keyboard or clicking on the timeline at the top, and at each stage you're given one of three pictures to select. There's nothing else to do at this point. In fact, there's nothing else to do, period. Scroll through the pictures and pick one.\n\nVery quickly, I got bored and started thinking up responses to the captions, each of which look like they're just a tag you'd put on facebook to remind yourself about it. And they're very pretentious comments at that.\n\nOnce you've selected your choice on all the pictures (or hit the ten and a half minute time limit if you managed to sit through it for that long), you get to the ending. Four more pictures which are selected based on your choices. Each of them is a binary black or white result, and just feels like you've just done one of those annoying Playbuzz quizzes to find out which Disney princess you are or some such rubbish, but doesn't even go into as much detail as them! "Your pictures were mostly black and white." Really? I hadn't noticed that, and you know why that is? It's because I actually don't care!\n\nOr maybe this game has a deep understanding of my psyche and inner demons. I don't know.\n\nThe whole experience, because I refuse to further call this abomination a game, is a painful mess. Every time you click on a picture, you get the same tired old sound effect, which becomes irritating after only a couple of pictures. Although the music isn't bad, it has nothing to do with the rest of the content, instead just picked because... well, to be honest I have no idea why it was selected. It was probably the first music the developer came across and just bunged in to give the experience some sort of backing other than repetetive clicking noises.\n\nEither way, on to the numbers.\n\nTotal time played: one hour.\nTime for one playthrough: 630 beats of the heart. Yes, it actually says that. In real terms though, about 5 minutes.\nBugs found: 0. There's not really enough of anything to contain any bugs.\nSanity lost whilst reviewing: about 25%.\n\nTo sum up, Retention is a photocopy of an instagram of a snack that some random guy you've never met ordered in a cafe next to you. It's bland, boring, one-dimensional, and after seeing it once you have no desire to look at it again, if you ever did in the first place. In fact the only reason to have more than about ten minutes playtime logged on Retention is to get the Steam Trading cards and sell them for a few pennies. You never know, you might get a foil card and make back the wasted money you spent on getting the game in the first place.","January 14, 2015","false","1.3"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","24","27","4","0"

Then one day, he falls out of his bicycle and various moments fly through his head.

It is known for it's unique gaming genre, "Game-Photo Album" where the game attempts to create an experience with the use of only photos and it does a great job on that.\n\nThere's 8 endings to this game (4 good and 4 bad) according to the store page, but so far, I've only found 4 of them (3 good and 1 bad, but I may need to play through it more to find the other endings). This game contains one original unique soundtrack and can also be emotionally powerful for some people that go through this game at least once. Oh and let's not forget about the trading cards to go along with it.\n\nIn conclusion, this game's simple, strange, but yet, unique at the same time.\n\nShould you buy this game?If you don't mind paying a dollar for a good experience and/or trading cards, then I'd say you should.\n6/10","December 26, 2015","true","1.5"," 50 of 72 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","50","72","7","3"

Except at best the adventure is skewed and obfuscated. In reality though, there is no coherent plot. No hooks to go off of and simply nothing to really tell you anything about it. This is a point and click adventure game without the adventure and the point and click is very limited. It's 99 cents but yet I wouldn't recommend that for it. There is little interaction, no plot, no gameplay, little feedback and it delivers a message at the end that is suppose to invoke emotion to encourage you to go look through your past and remember some nostalgia about the good ol days. The message though falls flat and is easily missed if you don't click the "credits" button. The entire experience is over in 12 minutes if you take your time and read everything. Probably around 2 minutes if you just rush it.","January 14, 2015","false","0.8"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

With that experience, the only thing I can say with absolute certainty about this title is that I did not enjoy it.\n\nThe presentation is good and the game itself works fine, but it all seems a bit vague, to put it lightly. It's essentially a slideshow in which you decide on an injured man's memories. You are presented with a set of three photographs, from which you have to select one. This occurs numerous times, and makes up the entirety of the gameplay.\n\nThere are apparently a number of endings to unlock, but I honestly cannot find any motivation whatsoever to bring myself to work towards them. I understand that the story is to be partially constructed by the player. but I feel that more explicit explanations would have really helped to flesh out the narrative. Doing so may go against the game's vision, but not everyone (myself included) is able and/or willing to piece together a coherent narrative through a series of still images and some sparse accompanying text.\n\nThere is no denying that Retention is an original piece of work. As far as my experiences go, there is nothing else like it. However, that alone does not warrant a recommendation.

First off, it literally is a slide show where you pick one of three photos, rinse and repeat until you've gone through the "story", which best I can tell is a cyclist who lost his memory in a crash? Pretty sure the cyclist in question is the developer (maybe I'm wrong though). Basically, this is a random photo album, which, if you take it as that alone, is not bad. I dont mind flipping through the odd photo album here and there. As a game with an alleged story however, it is absolutely a failure, since it really isnt a game, and really doesnt have a story, even though it tries to trick you into thinking there might be one. There isnt even any continuity in the photos. maybe it is a set of three pics of a pretty girl or a kitty cat or an old lady or some camera lenses (lol at that set of pics btw)...but there is no real timeline, no real way they tie together in any seeming fashion, and nothing to suggest they are really even connected except for the product description that claims they are.\n\nNow, this does sell for less than a buck (although my own key came from a bundle I bought at some point), and for a buck or less, there are some nice photos to look at and some decent music to listen to, and so it probably carries value from that alone, but pretending this is a game and selling it as such is pretty, i dont know, pretentious at best, and flat out deceptive at worst.\n\nAlso, there isnt a full screen mode and the developer apparently insists that you fix the game from your end rather than bothering to optimize it himself.\n\nThere are trading cards, so I suppose when all is said and done, you will end up having invested around 50 cents for a decent photo album with some tunes, lol.\n\nIf you are expecting a game of any sort however, I would steer clear of this.","January 17, 2015","false","0.5"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

I believe everything deserves a look see, it's how you find amazing things afterall.\n\nMoving right along, story wise you play as a man who has an accident and has his memory stolen from him, he runs in search of finding out who he is, about his past, the people he knows and his present. Now, at this point it gets a little confusing for me, as it's never explained anywhere if he is stuck under his bike looking through a photo album to regain his memory or if they are just pictures the player chooses to flash before his eyes.\n\nWhilst it does somewhat try to give an opportunity to tell a man by his memories in the form of a photo album that the players personality can cause change to, it really fails to get any kind of story or meaning into it due to lack of depth or explainations, bar one liners on each picture.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I do appreciate the idea of giving the player a kind of power to affect what the man will remember by them choosing a picture out of three in a set of 80 that may simply attract them, or one that they connect to. If they're a photographer, maybe one will stand out due to how the photo is put together or something along those lines.

Welcome to Retention...\n\nHere are the garbage collectors... http://www.sometimesyou.com/about_en.html I did not actually know this but it appears that anyone can now invent a game. Yes... even people who have just graduated to the extent of being able to use Instagram can now create games. Oh joy, Facebook the game is just around the corner. Can't wait for the sequel to this game called Flickr.\n\nAnyway lets begin to sort through this Instagram Trash and see if there is anything good about this game!?\n\nThe story is you have to help a complete mo.ron who has some how got himself buried under his bicycle?!?! He requests that you help him regain his memory!????!!!????! He's smart enough to recall three similar images and you have to pick out which one is the right image ???!???!?????!???!??????!??? Is this guy for real??????? and you have to keep doing that for 10 minutes and 30 seconds or his brain will explode painting the inside of his skull with multicolors or he will stand up and remember everything.!!!????!!!!!\n\nI'm not sure what message the developer is trying to get across? I assume it's the noble message that your memories are one of the most important thing to you and you should spend time creating good ones and cherish them. If that was his intention then he is a complete and utter coughdrop in how he has tried to get that message across. Apparently when our life is on the line we will spend most of time imagining pointless dribble like a old guy who we dont know sitting on a bench or a grave or a butterfly which he claims in game as a insect that cannot see its own wings. This statement is false butterflies have 360 vision which only further proves that we are helping an idiot. There is only 1 slide of his mum and dad a couple slides of a girl he once knew and about 350 of a pus.sycat, in fact he spends most of his time thinking about pus.sycats than anything else and I hope for his sake he actually owns a ♥♥♥♥♥cat. If not then not only is he an idiot but he is also creepy and i hope someone pours concrete over him and uses him as a future speed bump.\n\nThe game must be awarded for not making any sense at all, using dull uninspiring photos and picking music that is not fitting in any shape or form. Seriously the music is so odd like it was completely performed by those doing work experience.\n\nThere are 8 endings to the game. Your presented with 1 set of four depending how you finish the game. Why? Who knows, doubt the developer himself knows. There are 4 good endings which are the ones where he just stands up and remembers (that's debateable) and 4 bad endings where he suffers brain damage for the rest of his life (see what I mean these seem like so much better endings). The endings consist of a singular photo with a subtitle and nothing more.\n\nFor complete novelty reasons here's a few more endings you could have added mr developer but forgot....\n\nHe remember he is actually a character in a really bad game and not a real person and that everyone hates him.\n\nSomeone rings the ambulance, but because its dark the ambulance accidentally runs over him four times.\n\nThe pus.sycat he remembers, eventually finds his body and has a feast.\n\nTaking his medication for his multiple personalities the 3 slide delusions eventually fade away.\n\nThis game is POINTLESS, MEANINGLESS, DRIVEL. DO this world a favor DO NOT BUY. DO NOT GIFT. LEAVE!

You have very limited time...I don't want to be stalled by the text animating one letter at a time.\n- Perhaps better hints at the actual goal of the game would be a plus, but then again, I enjoyed being confused and then having the 'Aha!'

My first instinct to this game is that this is some psychological test where you choose pictures based on your personality to generate some results.  A few other reviews have said similar things.  Now, I did not study psychology so I can't confirm if this is true. I don't know about the background of the creators.  The credits say in memories of Steve Jobs so maybe there is some relation between this game and Steve Job's life? Maybe I'm over thinking it but I never read his biography so once again I can't confirm.  I read another review saying there are multiple endings to the game and I agree that after playing it through 3 times and clicking different pictures, I did have slightly different outcomes.  I would assume the ultimate goal is to achieve all 4 positive outcomes but that might take a lot of tries.\n\nThis isn't your typical game.  It doesn't fit in any genre. I have never seen a game like this and in all honesty, this is barely considered a game. It can be simply "picking your favourite picture".  People gave bad reviews to this game because they spent money on this.  You can think of it as dropping a dollar or something if it really bothers you.\n\nIf the game is packaged in a bundle and the game is about 0.25 then its fine because the trading cards are likely worth that price.\n\nThe music of the game is also fine although it is not my genre of music.\n\nIn the end, this game is like going on tinder: you're just clicking your favourite pick instead of swiping.","January 30, 2015","true","1.3"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","17","31","7","1"

You might expect this game would be as badass as Vladimir Putin, I see a credit card in your hand in wait to dump all of your monthly income already, but wait a minute. I am your secret ally and I should warn you. This game is not a simple game, there is a story behind it. In soviet russia they would actually pay you if you'd decide to play this game. But hey, my dear capitalist comrade, you probably remember that you screwed USSR in 1991. Did you actually think there will be no punishment for the commited crime? This game was in development for the last 20 years in the depths of KGB - the best russian psychologists were involved into development of this secret weapon. It's main goal is to drive all the capitalist scumbags insane by showing them meaningless frames of russian environment. The lack of sense will cause an irreversible mental damage. Victims will endlessly try to find any logic in the photos shown in this game and will ever fail on this task. The inevitable crescent of mental disorders will screw capitalist world from the inside. It's only a matter of time when our plant will turn bloody red. Your last hope is to boycotte this game and open your relative's eyes. It's been 20 years they were living in peace, but the illusion of safety should be gone. We need you, comrade! Don't let them turn you into communist!

Okay, not something of. A complete and total hipster gamer. I love indie games and I love games that push the borders of what can be considered a game and I love weird narrative spins and just... everything about the sort of games that make your average gamer go "UGGGHHH NOT A GAME 0/10 BOOOOO" is the sorta thing I cherish. I mean, my top games of the past year or two include Mountain, Gone Home, and Hate Plus.\n\nBut even I can't stand Retention, the latest game to bring down the wrath of NOT A GAME gamers. First off, it's totally a game. The inputs are weird and disconnected because really you're looking through pictures and choosing them and its supposed to string together a story. It's no less of a game than any choice game; the system of inputs is just unique.\n\nThe problem is that the player is given absolutely no sense of coherent connections between the images. It's implied that they're a timeline of events, but there's no thread that holds them together except the occasional repeated model or vague theme. In terms of "narrative," nothing matches up.\n\nSo, if there's no narrative, maybe the game is better read as modern poetry. Maybe the game needs to be read as discordant elements brought together in a way where the meaning needs to be pieced together. Okay, cool idea. I still think it could be better executed because, again, there are few repeated motifs throughout the piece and poems work almost entirely based off invoking a series of signs and signifiers that links the reader back to previous works and images in a canon of both literature and language. The game struggles to do this. And that's okay, in certain ways, but it makes it incredibly hard to analyze and piece things together.\n\nRetention is an interesting experiment, that's for certain. I think it deserves to exist and should exist and needs to exist. It's possibly an important step in disturbing and deconstructing our ideas of what makes games art by pushing a concept of game poetry forwards in a new way. Sadly, I just don't think this poem is any good.","January 16, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In my opinion, the game doesn't warrant such bad reviews at all. It was an overall pleasant experience for me, somewhat like a more artistically experimental form of the visual novel. Call it a "Visual Photoalbum". All you know, is that your character has been injured with the last moments of their life rushing through their head--in the form of still photography. You get to choose specifically which photos to look more closely at, which in turn reveal a little more about the protagonist's past and state of mind.\n\nLet me just say, the over 200+ photos that are included in the game are gorgeous to look at, and very thought-provoking. Commentary on the photographs themselves are very cryptic and limited, allowing you the freedom to ruminate on the meaning for yourself. It makes the game feel very personal. Will you choose to remember love? Friendships? Color? Beauty? Or will it all be forgotten in a haze. The music adds an interesting touch to the game as well.\n\nThere is replay value, if you want to be able to view all the individual pictures (it's worth it in my opinion). There are also multiple "endings" (the game automatically "ends" after 10 minutes), but this game isn't so much about getting to end but rather everything that leads up to that. Death and the afterlife have been explored in video games before, but I have never played a game which focuses solely on the remaining few minutes of life itself. It really makes you wonder, what will you recall in your own last moments? Do your memories really make you who you are?","February 24, 2015","true","0.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Like, from what I can tell, you pick one of several images based on how far along in his life he is after a timer starts, and you have to keep picking before a timer runs out. Forgive me if there isn't a timer, I don't exactly recall, been a while since I downloaded... this program.\n\nAnyway, once you've gone through the whole life, it stops, and you can look back on what you put together.\n\nThat's it. All you do is pick pictures, and look back afterwards. I have no idea if what pictures you pick affect what's available next, but I don't think it does. It doesn't help that the pictures are generic as hell, and seem to just be stock images.\n\nI don't know if this is supposed to pass as a game, or art, or... something, but it doesn't seem to be a game. You just pick pictures, and look them over afterwards. Nothing really interesting about them either, they're... just pictures. Sure, you could piece together the idea of a life where the main character does a lot of things, but... I mean, all you're really doing is just clicking pictures, and then it stops.\n\nThere's no replay value. At all. Heck, there isn't even anything to make one want to play it to begin with if they have any idea what they're getting into beyond the description. The description is much better than the game.\n\nI don't recommend this. There's no fun to be had at all. I mean, maybe some people might get something out of this, but I don't see it.","November 10, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Retention is simply not a good art game, because it balances art and visuals quite well, but forgot to add the gameplay.\n\nAll you do in this game is look at photos, and read captions written in poor English.\nI wish I were joking.\nThe "game" does give sort of a backstory as to why you're looking at these photographs, but backstory or not, it's simply not interesting.\n\nI'm sorry, Retention, I tried...\nbut you need to do MORE than give my a gallery of pretty photos.","May 21","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Recommended if you like that sort of thing.\n\nDo you know these psych quizzes you can find online or in magazines? You answer a bunch of questions with a), b) or c), and in the end the answer key tells you what kind of person you are, or what popular series character, etc. Retention is much like that, except you get no questions, instead your life is flashing before eyes, and the answers are images: 80 choices of 3 images each, and in the end your "life" is judged to be retained or forgotten, full of friendship or solitude, colorful or monochrome, and your memory of it is clear or corrupted.\n\nThe problems with Retention are numerous:\nThe set of 3x80 images is the same for every playthrough.\nThe game is Russian-made, and it shows in the selection of images.\nThe English translation seems badly done: the "corrupted memory" ending is called "feculent"? and the image descriptions that pop up on your choices seem badly translated, too\nYou may have problems running this at low resolutions, or if your Windows dpi setting is not 100%: the image positions and sizes don't work properly in that case.\nThere are no game mechanics beyond picking images and reading your evaluation afterwards, hence all the hateful reviews\nThe game runs on a timer. In the settings on the intro screen, you can turn that off (and also change the language). I believe the timer is intended to make you pick images intuitively, from your gut feelings, and not think about your choices too much.\n\nYou can also change the language to the original Russian, or switch to Italian or Turkish translations.\n\nTip: Among the game files, there are instructions for making an OST CD.","January 17, 2015","true","0.2"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","12","26","2","0"
