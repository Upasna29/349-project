"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/recommended/37310/","BridgetFisher","BridgetFisher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/","4086 products in account","This hidden object game looks like clipart literally threw up, different styles of drawings mixed in as if thrown together in a mix mash.  Some items are photos for example and others are like drawn cartoons with no rhyme or reason.   Worst part of the game is the game itself.   Often items will be stuck behind items maybe showing like one pixel of the actual hidden object.\n\nPlayfirst makes alot of great puzzle games from NIghtshift to Valerie Porter which would be better suggestions to get your puzzle finding fix.\n\nRating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00","December 18, 2013","false","1.3"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

And here we not only meet Flo herself and all her friends, but we actually play as Bernie, one of the most memorable DinerTown characters, who tries to be a detective. And that means - not only just plain hidden-objects-searching, but quite a lot of other diverse puzzles as well!\n\nThe only drawback of this game is that unfortunately PlayFirst has abandoned PC market for several years already and they are no longer with us to support their great games. Which means - no trading cards, no achievements, no Steam sales, no updates - and many negative reviews from people who couldn't launch the game for some reason.\nAnd I have to add that I had no trouble launching and running it with all the videos on my rather new PC.","March 27","true","3.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It's a hidden object game with a few more puzzles thrown in, all framed around the short-term goals of solving silly mysteries. It's very well made and very pleasant.","December 19, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

Innsmouth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/efverification/","497 products in account","Felt like writing a positive review for this game. I had quite some fun with the colorful scenes and the references the game has to the Diner Dash series. After a couple of levels, obviously you've kind of seen everything gameplay-wise, but I don't hold that against casual games like this. It had enough variety in it to keep me interested to the end, and I'd recommend it to fans of hidden object games and/or Diner Dash.\n\nP.S.: I had no technical issues whatsoever, and tried it on my desktop PC, my own laptop and someone else's laptop.","March 13","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
