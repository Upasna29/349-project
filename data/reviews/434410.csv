The writing is not verbose, yet it still manages to convey themes that many games with much higher budgets and longer playtimes struggle to do.  This is a game that I think would capture the imagination of both young and old, and I fully intend to have my young children play through this game as the writing is simple enough that they can understand it while also picking up some of the positive thematic messages on friendship, tenacity, and achieving one's dreams through the help of others.  My hats off to MonkeyMaw Games for creating this, I highly recommend Moonlight to all!","February 10","true","3.2"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","16","16","2","0"

However, a friend had me play this and for that I am thankful. This was an incredible experience. While it was a short game, within that time, I felt like I begun to care for these silly little characters. The music was absolutely incredible and truly made the game work. The developer made a good choice in the composer. Also, I felt warm inside from reading the credits. Seeing what inspired this game made even more special. In the end, I felt like I had a good journey and got to know an interesting world. Overall, I would say that this game is worth the purchase. The developer seems like a nice guy/girl and I feel good supporting people like that. I would definately be interested in the next game that he/she makes, especially if they have a similar atmosphere and fitting music as Moonlight did. I would recommend wholeheartedly\n*Spoilers**SPOILERS*SPOILERS*\nSPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPOILERS BELOW\nI felt bad for them in the end accepting their fate to the Master. Being shut down. Knowing that their life is temporary and not even real, yet trying to live regardless. That made me sad, but not in a bad way... in a more impactful way. I also felt bad that the character you get to control was leaving them. And as a final note, when Kinubo reaches his "destination" and talks to the character there but cant understand him, I'm not sure if I need to decipher what he is saying for the game to end. I cant figure out what to do. I think that is supposed to be the end and we can all easily guess what the green guy is saying. Overall, I am very happy with this game. Incredible job Developer. I look forward to your future work.","April 11","true","2.5"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","2"

Albeit short, very much worth your while.\n\nIn this little metroidvania like platformer you, as the main character Kinubo, try to get to the moon. There are no battles, no brain-scratchingly hard puzzles to stop you. The platforming is on the easier side even for someone who does not really excel at such things. That's alright though, for as silly as the story seems to be, it does grip you quite unexpectedly.\n\nThe design choices are excellent. The art is well thought out and executed for a cute, simple look. The music however, is the thing that makes this game come together. It's relaxing and sets a great mood for the game. Moonlight might just be one of the only games which soundtrack I loved through and through.\n\nAn excellent game. Highly recommended, especially for winding down after a busy day. Would also work well as an interactive goodnight story for children (though there were some word choices you might feel the need to edit).\n\nRarely have I been this impressed in this short of time.","April 16","true","1.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

You're a cool little no-armed monkey guy on an island with a dream of getting to the Moon & you'll need to enlist the help of all the other armless monkey things to get there. However, they won't speak to you until they trust you & to accomplish this you'll need to get the previous npc's hat. Yes, this means doing quests for them but they are, for the most part, entertaining & simple errands that show the developers knack for flow & dialogue.\nMoonlight has charm to spare & as with any other game just make sure to leave your expectations at the door (and your hat b/c this game has plenty!) & you'll have a great time.\n\nNote to Developer: Much thanks goes to MonkeyMaw not only for a fantastic game but also for releasing a few free codes.

The tone, artwork and music are all lovely. While short (I beat it in 2 hours), it was a lovely experience.\n\n---- PROS ----\n- Great Artwork\n- Lovely UI, Menus (yes, I notice stuff like that)\n- Good dialogue with the characters\n- Characters that have a lot of charm and personality. I particularly liked the clear emotions of the characters at different parts of the story.\n- Beautiful calm, atmospheric music\n- Simple to understand gameplay (all you do is jump and talk to people...though it gets a *bit* more complicated than that) ~_^\n\n---- CONS ----\n- Short. While lovely, the game can be beaten in about two hours. Know that going in. :)\n- There were a few grammatical errors in the dialogue (I believe the dev said they're working on that, so that's good)\n- I didn't like how the game defaulted to using the directional pad for movement instead of the left analog stick.(I think both should work right away.) Regardless, in the settings I was able to change movement to left analog stick. I still had to use the 'X' button to talk to people instead of the 'A' button (which I prefer), but it wasn't a big deal. I got used to it pretty quickly.\n- This is sort of a nitpick with the trailer, not with the game itself. At over 4 minutes long, I think it shows too much. I mean, 'Moonlight' is not a long game, so as much of it should be preserved for the player to experience. I would think a minute long trailer - maybe a minute and a half showing a variety of gameplay (and nothing past the hot air balloon) - would be cool. Just a thought. ^_^\n\n---- TL; DR ----\n\n'Moonlight' is a calm, atmospheric platformer with a great look, soothing music and interesting characters. While short, it does what it does very well and I look forward to further work from the developer.\n\n---- FINAL GRADE ----\n8 out of 10","February 8","true","2.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Recommended. )\n\nNo Spoiler Review:\n\nGraphics & Ambience: I loved the style of the game, the graphics and the music were beautiful and it tied in perfectly with the story. Everything is cute and light-hearted. This is a very well-made indie game, it flows well -- even my old office desktop computer can handle it.\n\nGameplay: There were mechanics that surprised me at some points, namely the way to jump high. Pressing X & C took some getting used to. There were no points where I got stuck or the game crashed. A+ for that.\n\nStory & Humor: Good, I like the way you interact with the other characters, it reminded me a little bit of Super Mario Sunshine, one of my favorite childhood games. In the end I think this game goes pretty deep into society but that's just my interpretation, I'd like to think that it does.\n\nLet's Playability: Super, there were no spaces for me where I couldn't put commentary, it was great to make the characters have different types of voices and personalities, hopefully in a way that you (dev) intended. Thank you for making this game, I had a fun time recording it for my channel.\n\nRecommended? Yes. One of the better indie games that has come out. If you have a Youtube channel and you're looking for something to play for it, this game is a perfect choice especially if you do story-driven or cute games. Otherwise, if you're a (casual) gamer, you'll still enjoy the story and the gameplay a lot. Definitely worth a try (& buy).\n\nCons: The game bugs out when you exit the program, making you force-close it. That's all.","February 5","true","2.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Moonlight is a very short, yet rewarding game, or so it was to me. It's a story driven platformer with a few light puzzles implemented into it. Once I loaded the game in you are greeted by the calm atmospheric tones of this absolutely beautiful soundtrack that just fits the entire game perfectly. Which brings me to the art style of the game, the art style of the game for me on a personal level is just amazing. I'm a huge fan of 2D/Bit games like these, add a little platforming and I'm sold. But the art style in general is very calming, thought the entire game (except one area) you have the Moon looming over head, always in sight casting it's glow on the "land" you walk, the blue over tone fits it all to perfectly and just makes it a calming theme. During your adventure you meet several characters in the village, some you might like at first, others might have to grown on you, but none the less the very short few minutes to spend helping these characters leave a lasting effect in your heart. You really start to feel attached to them and really want to hang around them more, but you must move on in your adventure. I'd like to say as much as I can about the ending without spoiling anything, but to be honest I can't think of anything I could say that wouldn't spoiler it. You'll just have to play it yourself and find out. I paid $4.99 for this game, for what I played and the enjoyment I got from it, I'd pay $10 easy for this game. I strongly recommend picking up and trying Moonlight out for yourself, oh and explore as much as you can, there's little hidden things here and there.\nAll in all, if I was a professional game reviewer I would give Moonlight a 10/10, to be honest I'm sitting here trying to think of some flaws this game has, sure there might be a few things that need fixing, but nothing game changing or anything that will change your experience.\nThanks!","April 10","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I created an account just for this game basically. Although I'll get more I'm sure. Now, I could have played her game, but I wanted to really play it through and give my opinion.\n\nI'd like to start with the only con that I can come up with, content. I'm not saying that I didn't get my money worth either! This was definitely worth my money. No, I'm talking about wanting more content. I sincerely wish, that there was more of this world. I wish there were more locations, more characters, more hats, more of these puzzles, and please ... more of this art and atmosphere!\n\nWith the one con out of the way, I can sum up this game's art and atmosphere pretty well with, simply beautiful! I tend to like detailed pixel art, and that isn't the case here. It's rather clean if you will, but there is just something about it. The details are not in the art itself, but more of a combined entity? It's all so very smooth and I don't know, it just makes you really enjoy the enviroment. The trees, especially the big one, is just something else! You can barely tell in some screen shots, but the light on the edges of all the bark is just awesome! The character art is very cute and charming. I do believe a little variation would have been interesting, but it feels hard to complain about it too much.\n\nThe music is phenominal to say the least. There is a media player in the game's menu, or I guess it is called the jukebox. Apparently there are only six tracks, but none of it is repetitive as the tracks are fairly long. It has a unique kind of sound, it's kind of oriental sounding in a way. It might not be something you would listen too outside of this game, but with the game's feel, it works well.\n\nThe story is also not something to be ignored, especially since the game relies on it heavily. The story as a whole is not the game's strongest point though, and without some very key elements, it would be dismissable. The key elements, are the characters telling that story. Each individual character seems to have a very real personality. You cannot help but create voices in your head for these little guys. Obviously Buko for the win, but all the characters seem to matter in their own little ways. The only gripe is that Kinubo, the character you play, has what seems to be a changing personality. He's all over the place some times. However, once I saw the ending, I think I get it. He's the player, he is the culmination of many different types maybe?\n\nI want to wrap this up, but there is one thing I have to finish with, and that is this developer. I emailed him with a few questions about the game, and how many people worked on it etc. With the production level in this game, the art, the lack of any real bugs, I assumed it was a few people at least! It was interesting to find out that he is the only one. His "type" is something we need to see more of as well. He is extremely polite, helpful, and he even gave me a few keys for friends! I really enjoyed the game and the interaction with Monkeymaw, I hope for more, I wish him the very best!","February 8","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

First of all, I'd like to say the music and atmosphere that this game gives is outstanding.  The scenery is beautiful, and the character designs are just absolutely adorable.  It is a bit of a short game, as you can see I beat it in about 1.5 hours, but it's definitely worth the buy even still.  I mean, how much would you pay for a 1.5 hour movie at a movie theater?  $20 including popcorn and everything?  So paying $5 for 1.5 hours of enjoyment isn't bad at all, especially when it's this cute.\n\nMy only bit of critique, and this could just be personal tastes so it may not even be valid, is the conversations sometimes went on a little long and got to a point where they were sometimes a tiny bit awkward, but really that's the only thing that bugged me at all about this game, everything else was fantastic.\n\nIf you want to see a bit of a preview before buying, you can check out my "let's play" series of this game, which I had a blast making.\n\nAlso if you're an achievement go-er, this game has quite a few, pretty easy to get achievements, so there's that.\n\nAgain, great game!","February 20","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has relativly simple puzzles and a story that lacks serious depth but never-the-less made me feel a bit sad ( in a good way ) at the end. I had no problems running the game either. The gameplay was smooth and it is a very light weight game. So light weight that I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to maybe port it over to the App Store or Google play.
