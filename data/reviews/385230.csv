Worth it? In this review you will find out.Hint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR and a video section.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬●\nNinjahtic was developed and published by Blaze Epic in July 2015 and titles itself as an action-adventure platformer in a neoretro style. The player jumps into the role of an unnamed, black haired ninja, who explores an abandoned civilization located atop of a floating island. The reason behind that is unknown and so the ninja discovers corner by corner of the city. The place does not seem to be so abandoned as thought at first.\n\nThe graphics are hold in a simple but very smoothed out retro look, which reminds of games from the Gameboy Advance. Each layout of the level is cut into two pieces, a background always fitting to the parts where the action is happening. Nothing special but very well made and nice to look at while playing through the game.\n\n'Easy to learn, hard to master' is a good description for the gameplay. In the tried and tested way of a platformer, the player has to move the character through parts of a level, while solving puzzles and avoiding lethal traps and enemies, either through stealthing or through going in like a berserk. Four kind of different roboters and three different trap types will stand in the path of the ninja, killing him instantly when they attack. Admittedly not the biggest variety, however this will not cut down the difficulty. Not comparable to the difficulty from similar games like Super Meat Boy, Ninjahtic still proves to be tricky in each new part of a level. The layouts of puzzles, traps and enemies are always different and the player will not feel like he was in that level already before. Apropos, while this game is actually linear in its gameplay, some paths provide two or three more ways to discover. Only one or rarely two are open to obtain e.g. cards in the later levels to proceed, which means that the player has to go through a lot of backtracking. (It is preventable by saving at the forks.)\nAn endboss, 5 in number including the last boss, will await the Ninja at each end of the levels and have slightly different patters to get defeated.\n\nControlwise the game is also hold simple, yet it does not feel clunky at all. After the ninja jumps aground, he will stay there for a few milliseconds. The player might be not used to it at first, probably even find it annoying , but over time it helps to "feel" the characters movement. Walljumping is very accurate, everything else works smooth and let the character literally glide through the levels.\n\nThe whole action is highlighted with a pleasent hypnotic looping soundtrack, which will interestingly not get monotonous.\n\nUnfortunately, no story is told and so the player will get thrown into the game without any prologue and endsequence. Also the length leaves a little to be desired. After 3 hours of gameplay everything in Ninjahtic is discovered and after the last boss the game ends abrupt. Here could have been a bit more to satisfy the player, but the overall look and gameplay compensate this small problems.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nNot as difficulty as Super Meat Boy, this game scores with adorable pixelated graphics, a nice soundtrack and overall smooth gameplay. After each death - and there were a lot - I had the feeling to rather blame me than the game. Even without story I really enjoyed Ninjahtic for its graphics and gameplay. I just wish it would have been longer, since it really ended abruptly.\n\nEvery fan of this genre should get it immediately.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ UPDATES]▬▬▬▬●\nNil-Ninjahtic: Ronin - Vote on Greenlight!\n\nA follow-up waits recently at greenlight to get both attention and likes, to find its way into the stores of steam.

Cute graphics!  Pleasant and unobtrusive soundtrack that plays in hypnotic loops -- puts one in the mood for carefully timed ninja antics!\n\nControls can be a bit clunky sometimes -- this did not detract much from my delectation, but I wish they had been a bit more slick.  I did not care for a downward wall slide always terminating in an outward jump.  Also, game ends without so much as a "winrar is you!"  I wanted acknowledgement of some kind; a pixely comic book cinematic would have been incredible.  I want positive reinforcement!  Always!\n\nHaving different options to dispatch foes is nice.  I liked kicking them into each other a lot!  After playing this nifty little nugget, I am quite pleased to know that I own the entire Blaze Epic catalog.  Ninjahtic is a game all of my spiritual siblings should play!  (Review sandwich complete.)","August 30, 2015","true","3.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Left/right movement is with a/d but attack is on x, and with the spacebar needed for jumping, this leads to an incredibly awkward hand position. It's also a naturally challenging game. You can die in one hit, and enemies take multiple hits to destroy if you can't jump on them. Your character also has a little lag when you land from a jump, which takes some time to get used to and stops your momentum. I didn't get very far into the game, but I would recommend it to anyone who wants the challenge.","July 7, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

And this game is cheaper than a rental, which is essentially what it is - not exactly short, but not worth more than a couple days, and no replay value unless you want to speedrun the whole thing.\n\ngood albeit simple gameplay mechanics (jump/slash).  the big specialty here is the parkour-style grabbing ledges, wall-jumping/sliding, and running up walls a little.  despite the platforming strengths, the challenge is more timing-based - enemies and turrets that can quickly insta-kill you.  luckily you have infinite lives and only have to restart whatever screen you are on (there is no scrolling in this game at all).  but it seems like if the platforming was the best part, why not get more tricky with the ... platforms?  there are no moving platforms.\n\nalso the presentation is very lackluster.  this goes beyond NES retro.  It feels like a freeware DOS game - you return instantly to the start screen after finishing the game - not even credits!\n\npixel art is good, and there is decent variety for the length of the game, but some areas can become quickly confusing since their screens start to get real familiar looking.  the gating is done by key cards and switches - problem is there doesn't seem to be a way to know which ones you've gotten other than remembering, so you can do a lot of backtracking, and with the screen art having no distinctive visual cues, it can get a little frustrating.\n\npros:\n- parkour platforming\n- good challenge, and ramps up throughout\n- pixel art\n- good bang for the buck\n\ncons:\n- lackluster presentation\n- gets repetitive\n- confusing maps/repetitive level art\n- enemies sometimes feel random, too easy for enemies to kill you in a cheap manner\n- i can't see any replay value here\n\nverdict: definitely buy this if you like pixel art, retro (simple) gameplay, challenge, and don't care much about presentation, length, or replay value.  It's cheap and enjoyable, but not going to stick out as one of your favorite games.","May 3","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the controls feel solid a majority of the time, they can also be finnicky. The wallrun doesnt work half the time, and sometimes you will want to pull up onto a ledge and it will have you jump off instead. Combat isn't great as guys take many kills and you die in one hit. All of the levels look the same and the environments are boring, blocking, and look copy and pasted with just a few color/background changes. There is no story. There is like 3 enemies total. You do the same thing in each environment. You hunt down keys, go into a building, and unlock a door. It gets super repetitive. Then there's the biggest problem, the map design. Each level has a few branching paths, and then some of those have branching paths. But since there is no map whatsoever and all the ways look the same it is hard to remember which way you came or you need to go. There are no markers or directions at all. The other biggest problem with the design is you will go super far one path, having beaten a bunch of hard parts, then you find at the end you need a key. So you have to run all the way back. There's nothing you can do, since no markers or map you have to trial and error hoping you found the right way. Even if you do, you will find a key, but you have to go all the way back again to use it in another area. This is just artificially inflating game length and is lazy design that makes the game boring. I would then get back and since it is hard to tell where you've been I would go back one of the paths I had come, but theres no way of knowing till you get back to start, then you have to retrace your steps again. So much of my time in the game was wasted retracing steps, going wrong way, etc. This saps all the fun from the game and makes it a chore. Finally I took a day off and was at a part with 3 paths, went 1 way, didn't have a key, had no idea which way I had come from the day before, went back one way, and finally decided it wasn't worth it and gave up.\n\nThe sad thing is, even with the finnicky control and combat, the game could be fun. But the terrible map design, lack of direction, forced backtracking and trial and error on paths, and repetitiveness of each area, just make this game an amateur effort. I just think of what could have been......","September 27, 2015","false","2.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

When you land from a jump you're stuck in place for a moment. The wall running mechanic that is super important sometimes doesn't work, arbitrarily. Climbing onto ledges only sometimes works. Sprites don't always line up with hitboxes - poles especially, but sometimes the edge of a ledge seems too close and you fall off without jumping.\n\nBut the design is worse. There are five boss fights in the game, but surprise, actually only three. The third boss is both the first and second bosses at once, the fourth is two of the first boss. Okay, so it's a little repetitive there. And also everywhere else, too. The game tries to be "exploration-based" but aside from one branching path point in the first zone, it's entirely and wholly linear, so you can end up going down a path only to reach a dead end because you don't have the right key. And the third zone is atrocious with this, requiring you to go all the way to the end of the zone, back to near the start, then pretty deep in and work your way back to the start, with where all the key locations are. It's FILLER, plain and simple. The second zone has a bit of this design too, and it's just a huge time waster.\n\nThe enemies in the game can shoot bullets at random intervals and without any sort of warning, so getting past them in some spots really just comes down to luck. The combat isn't very satisfying and in the second zone onward most things take too long to kill. All the bosses are way too tanky, too, they all only have one attack so it's just a tedious slog.\n\nThe dungeons are all designed so that you end up having to go all the way to the end and back in most every dungeon that doesn't end in a boss, which is just, again, filler. Such a waste of time.\n\nI'm prepared to say, at this point, that the developer behind these games really needs to take up some game design lessons or just outright quit, even aside from the horrible controls there's not even any potential in this game, it's badly design, not very fun, and the only reason I played to the bitter end was mostly to say I did, I hate giving up but I considered it with this one.\n\nAvoid at all costs, avoid the developer's games at all cost. I still have two more of these to play but I don't know if I can take another game like this...","September 18, 2015","false","5.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Just start, continue, exit.\n\nEdit : I've since come back and spent more time with the game. I'm going to say that it's worth the 2 or so dollars it is right now, but i'm still not compelled to beat it.\n\nEffectively the game is Knytt, but with some really janky combat and much...stickier controls.\n\nThe way the auto-wallrun / grab and ascend ledge was done feels incredibly stiff. In fact, just about everything in the game feel stiff.\n\nLike knytt, the game has no camera movement. You move from screen to screen, find rather unobvious keys and put them into a door to open up more paths.  There's an incredible amount of backtracking throughout all the areas i've been in, and all the enemies seem to take random amounts of damage to kill. sometimes it's one kick, sometimes it's seven. I don't get how it works.\n\nThere's also this really annoying quirk, where if you're sliding down a wall and reach the bottom, he flings himself away from the wall and down. There are quite a few spikes around to kill you for this, and it just seems like a control quirk designed to be  annoying.\n\nOn the whole i've seen 3 tilesets that all look very similar, maybe 2 similar floating enemies, 3 similar walking enemies, and some timed instant death hazards.\n\nAnd one 'boss'. It never attacked me, and took about 20 hits to kill. It opened up the next area, full of  moving turrets that shoot when you're in their line of sight.\n\n\nThe audio is real weak. The sound effects are, from what i can tell, all sfxr fare you've heard 1000 times before, and has no personality. The music is modern synth, with pads and such doing a very\nwell, Knytt-like thing. None of it stands out to me, and on the whole it's pretty forgettable.\n\nThe visual design is cluttered. No one seems to have told the dev how important it is to clearly lable collidable surfaces versus the background. Numerous foreground elements are colored with the exact same textures as walls you can interact with. Grabbable ledges along the background are colored exactly like walkable platforms.

All this results in a game that you keep coming back to until the end.\n\nRecommended.\n","March 26","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Worth that much.  This is a great little game, but due to the lack of a map, or any kind of pointer in any direction, it's hard to keep playing when the map starts branching.\n\n++ Very tight controls\n+ Good graphics\n- Story is non-existent\n- Terribly confusing and repetitive level design\n\nRuns great on my Linux box via Wine.","March 21","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice controls, simple yet fun mechanics. Fighting enemies can be boring, as they take multiple hits but are stunned when hit, so you're just standing there and mashing the same button until they die.\n\nMy major issue with this game is how there's no map or idea as to where you should go next. Several times I've gone in one direction, dying again and again, only to be rewarded with a door that can't be unlocked until I get the keycard from a different direction, but with five other possible directions to go, it's just a bunch of guessing. On top of that, the screens are so similar that they blend together and it can be hard to remember if the way you're going is a way you've already been.\n\nOverall, It's worth the low price\n3.5/5","March 10","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
