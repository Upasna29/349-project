The music and graphics are top notch and there are a lot of interesting gameplay mechanics in the combination of powerups. However, for me the game becomes too hard too fast and at that point mostly chaotic. I also think the player could have had more freedom of choise in what weapon to use and when.\n\nIf you like, fast, intense action and have a nack for getting the highscore this is definitely for you!","June 17, 2015","true","0.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It's too freaking frustrating.  There's challenge and then there's UFOPILOT!  Playing this just makes me feel bad about myself :(","July 31, 2015","false","1.1"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","1"
