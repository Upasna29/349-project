One night she spots a shooting star and wishes to become a idol, but instead she is met with a Nyanmel a magical talking cat that came hurdling down from the sky. There Nyammel ask Michiru to become a mahou shoujo (magical girl) in order to save the world.\nA majority of the Grisaia character make a appearance in this spin-off title including main protagonist Kazami Yuuji as a small child in the hospital.\n\nThe audio and visual elements were great and It gives a charming sense of playfulness resulting in an enjoyable read from start to finish. It’s very much a parody of popular magical girl and idol genres.\n\nTo sum up i would recommend to get this if you love Fruit of Grisaia visual novel as it will shine a "new light" on the characters giving them a whole new look.","July 30, 2015","true","87.5"," 130 of 160 people (81%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","81","130","160","16","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeutscheArbeiterpartei/recommended/377710/","DeutscheArbeiterpartei","Alternative-Right Anime Hacker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeutscheArbeiterpartei/","166 products in account","In Idol Magical Girl Chiru Chiru Michiru, Michiru criticizes Japanese culture as unsophisticated and nihilistic, and shoots some disapproving arrows at key French, British, and Italian cultural figures who represent similar tendencies. In contrast to all these alleged representatives of cultural "decadence", Michiru applauds Caesar, Napoleon, Goethe, Thucydides and the Sophists as healthier and stronger types. The visual novel states the transvaluation of all values as Michiru's final and most important project, and gives a view of antiquity wherein the Romans for once take precedence over the ancient Greeks.\n\nShe establishes early on in the section "The Problem of Socrates" that the value of life cannot be estimated and any judgment concerning it only reveals the person's life-denying or life-affirming tendencies. She tries to show how philosophers from Socrates onwards were "decadents", employing dialectical rationality as a tool for self-preservation as the authority of tradition breaks down.\n\nMichiru denies many of Plato's ideas, specifically that of Being and Becoming, the world of the forms, and the fallibility of the senses. More precisely, she does not believe that one should refute the senses, as Plato did. This goes against Michiru's ideals of human excellence in that it is a symptom of personal decadence. By decadence, Michiru is referring to a fading of life, vitality and an embrace of weakness. In Michiru's view if one is to accept a non-sensory, unchanging world as superior and our sensory world as inferior, then one is adopting a hate of nature and thus a hate of the sensory world - the world of the living. Michiru postulates that only one who is weak, sickly or ignoble would subscribe to such a belief.\nMichiru goes on to relate this obsession with the non-physical realm to Christianity and the concept of Heaven. Michiru indicates that the belief in the Christian God is a similar decadence and hate of life. Given that Christians believe in Heaven, which is in concept similar to Plato's ideas of the world of forms (a changeless, eternal world) and that Christians divide the world into the "real" (heaven) and the apparent (living) world, they too hate nature.\n\nIn the section "How the "True World" Finally Became Fiction", Michiru demonstrates the process by which previous philosophers have fictionalized the apparent world, casting the product of the senses into doubt, and thereby removing the concept of the real world. The section is divided into six parts:\n\n1.   The wise and pious man dwells in the real world, which he attains through his wisdom (skills in perception warrant a more accurate view of the real world).\n2.   The wise and pious man doesn't dwell in the real world, but rather it is promised to him, a goal to live for. (ex: to the sinner who repents)\n3.   The real world is unattainable and cannot be promised, yet remains a consolation when confronted with the perceived injustices of the apparent world.\n4.   If the real world is not attained, then it is unknown. Therefore, there is no duty to the real world, and no consolation derived from it.\n5.   The idea of a real world has become useless- it provides no consolation or motive. It is therefore cast aside as a useless abstraction.\n6.   What world is left? The concept of the real world has been abolished, and with it, the idea of an apparent world follows.\n\nIn the chapter "The Four Great Errors", she suggests that people, especially Christians, confuse the effect for the cause, and that they project the human ego and subjectivity on to other things, thereby creating the illusionary concept of being, and therefore also of the thing-in-itself and God. In reality, motive or intention is "an accompaniment to an act" rather than the cause of that act. By removing causal agency based on free, conscious will, Michiru critiques the ethics of accountability, suggesting that everything is necessary in a whole that can neither be judged nor condemned, because there is nothing outside of it. What people typically deem "vice" is in fact merely "the inability not to react to a stimulus." In this light, the concept of morality becomes purely a means of control: "the doctrine of will has been invented essentially for the purpose of punishment, that is of finding guilty."\n\n"Men were thought of as free so that they could become guilty: consequently, every action had to be thought of as willed, the origin of every action as lying in the consciousness... ...Today, when we have started to move in the reverse direction, when we immoralists especially are trying with all our might to remove the concept of guilt and the concept of punishment from the world and to purge psychology, history, nature, the social institutions and sanctions of them, there is in our eyes no more radical opposition than that of the theologians, who continue to infect the innocence of becoming with 'punishment' and 'guilt' by means of the concept of the 'moral world-order'. Christianity is a hangman's metaphysics."  - Michiru Matsushima","August 8, 2015","true","86.3"," 87 of 117 people (74%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","74","87","117","48","0"

Don't buy it.\n\nFull Review (Part 1 of 2 - Part 2 here):\nIf you couldn't tell from my previous reviews, I'm a rather avid Grisaia fan. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard about this game, and even a little hopeful when I heard it was coming to Steam. Oh, how woe is me.\n\nTo clear up any immediate misunderstandings, I was in fact very happy with the game itself. Idol Magical Girl Chiruchiru ☆ Michiru was everything I'd expected and more. If it wasn't obvious enough, the game is a spinoff, so if you were hoping for a continuation of the mainline Grisaia series, you've come to the wrong place. That being said, the game delivers everything you could hope for from a spinoff.\n\nIt parodies the Grisaia cast in an amusing light, yet manages to remain more or less true to the originals. Since the game is a spinoff with a rather fantastical setting, it obviously doesn't deliver the same kind of hard-hitting, serious drama that you've seen in the original. Although Chiruchiru is primarily a comedy, it has a surprisingly intricate story of its own, despite the witty antics. The genres are too different to reasonably compare this game to The Fruit of Grisaia, but Chiruchiru definitely gets my quality seal of approval. Die-hard Grisaia fans will also enjoy the inclusion of characters that don't get too much attention until the later games, like Asako and Robbie, as well as the sneaky references to the main games, such as Yuuji's water bread and 9029.\n\nThe production quality was also spot on, as I've come to expect from Frontwing. The graphics and menus were as crisp and polished as they were in The Fruit of Grisaia, and the first half of the game alone contaned a good 20 or so unique CGs and about 30 different soundtracks. Through reading, I noticed myriad sprites and backgrounds, almost as if they were trying to show off the fact that no corners were cut. It really was a great reading experience, and anything that spells "Grisaia" has its own place in my books.\n\nNow, despite all this, I really recommend that you do not buy this game.\n\nAt least, not from Sekai Project. I don't want to point fingers at the entire company for the poor quality of a single no-name translator's work, but from my past experience with other Sekai Project translations (World End Economica, Clannad), they really aren't helping their case with this release.\n\nThe "translation" of Chiruchiru, if you can even call it that, often lies on the boundary between "a stretch" and "blatantly incorrect", sometimes even tipping in favour of the latter. No effort was made to localize the language at all, though after seeing the Dangopedia, maybe I was a fool to expect otherwise.\n\n(Arguable spoiler)\nTake a look at this screenshot, for example. This is the line that comes directly after. It says 望み (nozomi) - wish, desire. This happens to be the name of Michiru's friend, as well. Now, the dialogue makes sense in Japanese, but if you can't read Japanese and don't know how to look up kanji, how are you supposed to understand this? The line isn't voiced, so you're not even able to hear it. At the very least, if they weren't going to translate it, romanji would have at least been readable for most, but this is just nonsense.","December 14, 2015","false","7.9"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","41","48","0","9"

As a fan of the series though, i would suggest playing the game(s) (only the first has been translated as of now, but the sekai project is currently working on it.)\n\nThe game is a visual novel. There are no choices to make, you only need to read.\nThe story is a mostly lighthearted story about how the main character, Matsushima Michiru, is mediocre at being both an idol, and as a magical girl. (as she plays the comic relief role in the main series.) You will laugh at her various failures and her airheadedness. BE WARNED, this is a 2 part game, the first part ends with a cliffhanger.\n\nI would reccomend this to a visual novel fan, but would suggest they see the first season of the anime beforehand.","January 6","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if you're not a fan this is a great vn. The dialouge is just wonderful and the comedic aspect is terrific It actually has me laughing out loud and has a cute aspect to it that I just love. Granted, I'm only a few hours in but so far I am loving it.","April 29","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
