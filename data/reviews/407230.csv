Starting with Wizardry games on the PC when I was young and onto Final Fantasy, playing the newer ones as they came out. I was a PlayStation girl so I played the Personas, Xenogears, Grandias, Shadow Hearts - okay, listing them all would take too long and is off the topic. But I want you to know how well-versed I am in this genre. :)\n\nLegend of Mysteria is the first RPG I've played on Steam that was obviously made using one of the generic RPGmakers and isn't a "big hit" game. I thought I'd give something different a chance. And I'm extremely glad I did.\n\nNow, it's listed as a turn-based RPG but it's really all about an involving story where you do some serious detective work. In all the hours I played, I fought only a little over 10 battles - half of those, bosses. There is no leveling in this game whatsoever. You have to find different equipment to bolster your stats. And you play as a mage so the trick is figuring out what your enemy is weak against and then finding a staff or accessories that allow you to cast the elemental spell that will annihilate your target the quickest.\n\nThe meat of the game is interviewing everyone you can. Everyone thinks you're a murderer so you have to find the real culprit and clear your name. Of course, being that people view you as a killer, you must disguise yourself. You begin in a tower full of all different types of mages. You'll need to switch robes often to fit in with whatever group you're spying on. You also get different dialog choices here and there so think carefully before answering. Searching everywhere and everything is a must since you need those different colored robes, and reading notes and diaries on all the mages will help you find clues and point you towards those who might be willing to help you in your cause.\n\nI would say this game is difficult. The times I had to turn to a walkthrough, I would sit there reading it thinking "who in the world would know this is what you're supposed to do?" But the story was so interesting that I had to see it to its end. What you do during the entire game affects what will happen at the very end. It's just very neat.\n\nSo in conclusion, this is not your typical RPG. It's frustrating at times and... no leveling? I'm  a girl who loves to level for hours so I can swat the last boss like a bug. In this game, I actually had to strategize my fights and manage my healing potions with care. :p  However, I loved Legend of Mysteria. I was never bored, the characters were interesting and detailed, and I really approved of the music selections they chose from the RPGmaker. The fact that I'm even writing this review at all says a lot because I don't really want to be doing this. I want to be playing! I just wanted you to know how much fun I had with this unique adventure. :)","May 22","true","8.8"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menacia/recommended/407230/","Menacia","Menacia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menacia/","204 products in account","Disclaimer: I was given a key for this game for free.\n\nFull Review (for my original Quick First Look just scroll down):\n\nLegend of Mysteria is a spin-off from the Labyronia RPG series and story wise a prequel. While there are a lot of familiar characters and the main area of the game is the so called Mysteria Tower, the story can be enjoyed on it's own, without any prior knowledge. However if you have played Labyronia RPG 1 and 2, Legend of Mysteria will give some nice additional insights. The main storyline, the murder of a high rank mage called Dinyon and Windir (the player character) trying to clear his name, while being accused of being the man behind the dirty deed, is a very well put together detective story that will keep you guessing until pretty late who the true culprit is.\n\nAs I have already said in my First Look, gameplay wise is where the biggest different lies between Legend of Mysteria and the original Labyronia RPG games. While all 3 titles share their RPG Maker VX Ace foundation, the later are more traditional CRPG games with a quite a heavy focus on battles. Legend of Mysteria on the other hand plays more like a classic Point & Click adventure with hardly any battles at all and even then, there is no real RPG style character progression, XP system etc. This game is about exploring your locations, talking to NPC, gathering evidence, finding and using items to unlock new and previously locked rooms and areas. At this point it needs to be noted that even though I have played a lot of adventures in my gaming career (including most LucasArts Games and even more Sierra Games), I did get stuck quite a lot. This is not due to strange tasks to be done, but rather the fact the due to the absence of a quest log, the player should really start writing (I mean really writing with pen & paper!!) down notes. Thankfully to a kind player, there is a full walkthrough in the community guides section!\n\nIn conclusion I can highly recommend this game to both fans of the series for the insight it shares to the lore of Labyronia, as well as to everbody looking for a RPG Maker game that doesn't follow the usual steps a RPG Maker game does take!\n\n-------------------\n\nQuick First Look:\n\nLegend of Mysteria RPG is a spin-off from the Labyronia RPG series; actually according to the title screen it should be called "Labyronia Tales Legend of Mysteria". Hence anybody who is familiar with the main series, will feel right at home, as there many characters one would have already met and familiar locations, only at a different time and with new content. This should not scare of newcomers, since it is an independent story that doesn't require any prior knowledge.\n\nGameplay is where the Legend of Mysteria RPG seems to have changed the most, at least from what I have seen so far. It actually feels way more like a classic adventure game with RPG elements. In the beginning the player character, a mage called Windir, gets innocently accused of attacking and possibly murdering another Mage called Dinyon. Now it is time to find the real culprit and clear Windir's name. This all happens in traditional adventure game style, that is talking to NPCs, doing favors for them and finding ways to access new areas.\nWhat about the battles, you might be asking by now? There are battles, but unlike in Labyronia RPG 1 + 2, it actually will take some time until you will have your first encounters. Despite appearing to be easier now, simple attack spamming still won't get you anywhere - just don't forget that Windir is a mage!\n\nIn conclusion I can easily recommend this game to fans of Labyronia RPG, because it is more Labyronia, even though it kinda feels different now. There are many characters appearing from the main series as well as well-known locations featuring additional content (new areas). However this should not turn off newcomers, as no prior knowledge is required to make sense of what is going on.\n\nNOTE: I will update this quick first look with a full fledged review, once I have finished the game.","October 10, 2015","true","7.6"," 29 of 43 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","29","43","2","3"

K.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973230221/","3588 products in account","The 3rd part of the labyronia series. This time its like a prolog or Nr. 0 of the other games. It has a few changes. No leveling and only a few less battles that are tough like boss fights and you need to have prepared with "enough" items and right elements. Not a hard burden if you be prepared with many items. This game has like the other games a nice story with many traders and you need to find out the assassin of the attack of the intro and need to find many clues and to use some quests and puzzles. So you are this time like a detectiv and search for hints, hidden items, secret passages and unseen switches/ keys you need so search every corner and each item from all 4 sides, read carefully a lot of stuff (books and many more) to find the right ways. I love this game even much then the others. Sometimes you feel lost because its so hard to find the answer you need to test many items with many peopls and things to find all of it. The music is fine and the game lenght is good if you dont need to much hints from the walktrough and test many combinations yourself. This little personal master piece for me get so 9.3 of 10 points as on of the best 2 D games with a really lovely story, dont forget to play after this Labronia  1 & 2 if you didnt do it before. So take a look, preview or lets play and i hope you support the great developer with some money for his work/ time. He still try his best to make the game better if you give him something you dont like like i did 2 little points. So i hope many people enjoy the search after the TRUTH :)","October 14, 2015","true","8.0"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","0"

Yet, I saw the game was on sale for 51 cents, and I thought, "Why not?"\n\nI must say I am glad I spent the $.51 on this game. I haven't had much fun playing rpg games in a long time until I tried this and the Labyronia series. The soundtrack of the game is probably one of my favorites out of most games I've played. The battles with enemies could be a bit challenging, but nonetheless the gameplay did not fail to make up for it. It was definitely difficult playing the game since it required so much I had to use use walkthroughs like guides or videos to help me out for the rest of the game. I still couldn't complain though, I enjoyed the many puzzles and clues throughout the game.\n\nThere's a lot of questions I have IF this happened before Labyronia since Windir and Triste marry each other and have a child, and in Labyronia, you find out Arres is their son. Yet the release dates of the games throw me off so I'm not sure if that speculation would be valid enough to say that Legend of Mysteria happened before Labyronia. Either way, much props to the developers of this game.\n\nThe only thing I would suggest is to fix the brightness of the game. Besides that, great game, and I'd suggest this to anyone who are willing to play rpg games and enjoy long stories.","January 24","true","13.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

Got "Legend of Mysteria" in a bundle and payed about 10-15 cents for it. You can literally get more than that by selling the cards that drop when you play the game, lol. But, unlike some other cheap games that I've played this is one of the best. As you can see it took me a bit more than 8 hours to finish the game and get all the achievements. Although It can be done faster I followed a step-by-step walkthrough and even so it took that long. I mentioned this in another review but I will say it again: A guy had written in a review that for every 1 euro game he/she expects to get at least 1 hour worth of gameplay. So if we follow this logic I got the game almost free and I spent 8 hours playing it meaning the price it has is pretty good, right? Yea, I'd say so.\nOkay, so you have to do quests, fight monsters, collect items, explore, buy stuff, talk to people. Honestly the map is pretty big so there's a lot to do. I am glad there is a guide. I'd be lost without it. While some of the things that you need to do are pretty straightforward, others require some thinking. Really fun to play. Actually, I added 2 other RPG games to my wishlist. They are made by this dev and are called "Labyronia" and "Labyronia 2". I checked other players' stats and seems like they are even longer than this game for the same price. Wow! I feel like a guy that has found a gold mine! And I am not even exaggerating. I am saying this because I've seen some flash games on Steam that are worth 3-5 euros. Rip-off! If you manage to get "Legend of Mysteria" on sale you can at least idle for cards and still make profit. 10/10","May 6","true","8.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

In addition the game type has changed from typical JRPG style adventure to a more 'detective story' type of gameplay where Windir from earlier games is the protagonist who tries to solve a murder taking place in a mage school and clear his name as he is framed for the murder.\n\nAfter some 6h i must say the game is of same high quality as the previous games in the series. i.e. what it lacks in original art and assets it gains in good design. I guess you could say the dev did not spend his time at the art drawing board but instead did good work on the design board and it really shows. Lots of details and well tested gameplay as i have not seen any bugs yet.\n\nAs it looks now Labyronia games are some of the best what this old game engine can offer and therefore a warm recommendation to anyone who wants good games for cheap with high production values.","October 16, 2015","true","5.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

The game isn't all that fast paced, but it has small animal fights like pokemon, (seen in the trailer on steam store) of which I do feel is a bit cheap of them to do, but that is their game...\n\nConsI was unable to get the feel of the game, even after playing like 16 hours of it. I found it hard to follow the story due to the lack of information on the steam store page, and really just all over the internet. I seemed to run really fast when going sideways as well, I noticed the fact that you can go faster going left or right on your keyboard than going forward or backwards (evening this out would make a heavy difference. Overall I did find a lot of the start to be a bit silly, and not really immersive, but I would still play the game.\n\nOverall ReviewGiving the fact that the game lacks in the immersive story telling, and the fact that it is just like a lot of other cheap basic RPG games, I would still find a way for me to play it, and have fun, whether this being hacking (Item mods) or possibly even messing with game files, I would be able to spend my time playing this sky view RPG game. I would not reccomend this game to those who hate story lacking games, but if you wish to try it, then feel free.

In this Clue like game, discover the vile plot and who the  true killer is, by escaping your prison and scouring the Mysteria tower for clues and suspects. A great change of pace from the RPG maker games , this is one for the mystery Scooby Doo fans. Very much did I actually want to see how everything plays out . Collecting and pretty much on ''high alert'' about everything, do you go through the game trying to figure out what happend. Picking up and finding items and when/ where to use them is key to the game.  ''Does that plant pot over there have a key hidden in it?''  kinda thing.You pick up some comrades and friends ( even a lil dragon) and try to clear Windir's name. A smart gameplay too with disguises to get by and trick guards and fellow mages. Try if you like the Labyronia games and want to try a rather well done JRPG.","October 10, 2015","true","6.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","0"

Regardless of whether I paid for it or not, I remain unbiased in all of my reviews. My reviews reflect my opinion, and my opinion only.\n\nSomething something powerful crystal, something something dark lord, something something RPG Maker.\n\nI want to become engrossed in these games, I really do, but it's really hard to do when you see recycled materials used over and over again. I imagine it's really fun when you get into it, but I just done care what's happening anymore. I can't become immersed when I'm staring at the same scene with walls of text explaining the back story. If I wanted to play a game based on a light novel I would just read the novel. I couldn't even get into the combat, I was lost at the beginning. The music is pretty good though, from what I heard, but it was awkwardly misplaced...\n\nIt's like, two dollars though.

It is very much different from the other Labyronia games (Labyronia I & II) as it relies more on exploration and discovery.  One of my favorite parts of this game are the many secret tunnels and rooms that are available to be discovered as well as the "open-world" feeling the game delivers.  The only con I found for this game is the lack of fighting that occurs, as previous Labyronia games had alot of fighting and battles.  So far, I have found this game very enjoyable and worth the price.\n\n","October 9, 2015","true","21.7"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","6","17","3","0"

While some of the obstacles can be irritating and it's not always easy to find the right piece of information and where to use it, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and would definitely recommend it, especially considering how cheap it is.","June 4","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
