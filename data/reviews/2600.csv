There is also no point in me telling you that white wolf unarguably makes the greatest vampires and one of the darkest atmospheres in any kind of game, just as there is no point in telling you that this is the kind of game that has to be experienced because we will probably never get another game like this again. And since nobody can see this, there's definitely no chance anyone will ever know that I personally recommend pirating this 100% so you don't accidentally fund a terrible publisher that ruined an amazing development team. But since this is just a review, you can make your own decisions.","June 20, 2014","true","10.4"," 978 of 1,012 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","978","1","0","29"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047166457/recommended/2600/","76561198047166457","Nu Lycan","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047166457/","75 products in account","Vampire: The Masquerade-Bloodlines is an immensely intriguing vampire-role playing game by Troika Games, and an exellent example of a "flawed masterpiece" and had a lot of things going for it.\n\nFor starters, you are thrown into the game with the option of choosing between 7 different clans (vampire bloodlines) that each play a good bit differently. There's the Brujah: fast hard hitting rebels, the Gangrel: animalistic loners, the Malkavians: bat-**** crazy psychopaths, the Nosferatu: sneaky grotesque monsters, the Tremere: a vampire sect of blood mages, the Toreador: artsy fast vampires that are closer to humanity, and Ventrue: the most power hungry members of vampire society. Every single one of these classes feels distinct, as every clan has advantages and disadvantages. For example, the nosferatu get more blood from feeding on rats than the other Kindred (Vampire: The Masquerade's term for vampire), but cannot seduce anyone because of their monstrous appearence. The Ventrue are the only kindred that can use dominate (basically mind control) in dialogue, but they cannot feed on animals and may vomit when feeding on "lowlife" like street bums.\n\nNow, the gameplay is extremely engaging. Combat is fast, fun, and allows you several options. Every kindred clan has their own disciplines, or vampiric abilities, that allow you to choose your own approach to conflict. Do you use obfuscate to invisibly sneak past the goons? Or do you use "fortitude" to soak up their bullets and "animalism" to summon spectral wolves to tear them apart. It's your choice. Of course there are the standard ways of fighting: guns, unarmed, and melee weapons. There are a good variety of each weapon types (except unarmed) with upgraded weapons available to you along the way. Another potential tool for combat is feeding. As you need blood to maintain your sanity and use your disciplines, you will need to drink blood. You can drink blood from any humanoid you choose, hostile or not, but it can be more difficult to drink blood from hostiles. This is tempered by the fact that you have to stop yourself from completely draining innocent humans, but don't think twice about draining a thug. There is one problem with feeding, but I'll cover that later.\n\nI need to mention the dialogue too, as it's absolutely awesome. The facial expressions on the characters in this game are better than some of the facial expressions I see in the games coming out today, and the dialogue choices are absolutely brilliant. The Malkavians and Nosferatu get hilarious dialogue options, including an infamous one where a malkavian player character can actually get into an argument with a stop sign. A stop sign! And if I remember correctly, there's a conversation with a TV as well.\n\nThe quest system is absolutely one of the best parts about this game. The side quests range from defeating demons to hunting down serial killers to fighting of zombies in a graveyard. You'll always have some sort of want to complete them because completing quests gives you experience, not killing enemies. I think this is an exellent system because this keeps you from being penalized for using stealth and guile over brute strength and bloodshed. There are quite a few missions where things turn out better in the end if you choose a stealthier, more thoughtful approach instead of going full Rambo. The main quest is no slouch either, with multiple engaging quests.\n\nI enjoy the game's atmosphere quite a bit. The endless night conveys a mysterious feeling (to be fair, it's not like you're character can feel the sun anymore) and the music lends itself to this. While sometimes the music can feel a little repetitive (combat music is determined by area, so if you get into lots of fights in one area, you're gonna hear that music a lot) I never found myself annoyed by it because it was good. There are lots of songs from real bands, such as Lacuna Coil and Tiamat.\n\nNow, time for the "flawed" part of "flawed masterpiece". The game was rushed out on the same day as Half-Life 2 because the idiocy of the game's publisher, Activition. As a result, the game has several glitches by default, so don't even think about playing the game without an unofficial patch of some sort. The late game feels less fun because it's all combat, and becomes quite tedious because before, combat was more spaced out. I don't mind mandatory combat sections, but the last portion of the game gets excessive with these. Because of the mandatory combat and power of late game weapons, if you don't have your gun skill fairly high by the end, you're screwed. Melee skills only work well when you're not being shot at by 10 enemies, and that's a rarity near the end. Also, the series of levels, the Nosferatu warrens/sewers can be very boring, unintuitive, and downright frustrating at times, as there are few sources of blood, annoying enemies, it's long as hell, and mandatory. Lastly, there is the problem with feeding. When used against normal human enemies, I don't mind it. But when it's used against a human boss, it's pretty overpowered. There is no way for an enemy to escape from your grasp besides you getting hit, so if you get your teeth on a boss while they're alone, they're done. But all in all, these things don't break the game by any means, but they should be mentioned.\n\nOne last thing that makes the game great, and it should be no surprise what this is: mods. There are two mods particularly, Vampire: The Masquerade: The Final Nights, And Bloodlines Antitribu (although this one is somewhat buggy at the moment). Both (and other mods I'm forgetting ATM) add in cut content, new character models, brand new content and quests, and even new systems like the companion mods and blood loss that take the games immersion to new heights.\n\nIf you had your interest piqued by this review, you should definitely pick up the game. Even now, more than a decade after the games release, I still give this game a playthrough every now and then, because it's just that good.","June 29, 2015","true","127.2"," 441 of 451 people (98%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","98","441","451","17","10"

Game is surprisingly good at conveying the V:tM atmosphere of the better pen & paper sessions I've had (the worse ones got bogged down in dice rolling -- for a system called "story teller", the mechanics can be annoyingly gamist). Lets you play as any of the classic clans and either sex (but looks are determined by the combination of those two factors and can't be customized further, except with clothes). I thoroughly enjoyed this game, was sad when it was over, and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone liking the pen & paper V:tM (or even just the Kindred: the Embraced show), and anyone enjoying a decent blend of fight/RP/drama elements, as long as you can get over the yesteryear graphics.\nIf this is your kinda thing, wait till it drops to 9.99. If you're not sure, wait till it drops below 5 again. Then go for it. You'll thank me later.\nAnd then you'll be sorry because there is no multi-player, nor a steam workshop for additional campaign, so that all good things must come to an end.","November 24, 2013","true","109.9"," 409 of 435 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","409","435","0","9"

This is not Anne Rice. This is not Buffy. This is World of Darkness.\n\nVampire: TMB's world is mysterious and complex, rich with lore from White Wolf Publishing's WoD tabletop games. The quests are memorable, characters desperate, locations varied, and character customization extensive. It is easily one of the best written RPGs ever published, right up there with the Fallout series.\n\nI would blindly recommend this to anyone remotely into verbose games. NPCs have very unique insights into the world they live in, and constantly share their philosophies with the player (the voice acting is excellent). Naturally, anyone who finds themselves bored after a few paragraphs of hearing NPCs talk should skip this game.\n\nEdit:\n\nI should have probably also mentioned that although VTMB's writing is stellar, there is also quite a bit of combat. The game strikes a nice balance between letting you feel like a ridiculously overpowered rampaging creature of the night, and a mere shadow of other, elder vampires: some fights will be hilariously easy (especially against human foes), others will be tremendously difficult (high-level supernatural enemies, yikes!). Character creation and levelling up is very comprehensive, and should be a joy for anyone who likes putting thought into how they will play the game.\n\nPlease note that the game was extremely buggy when released, and is moderately difficult to run on modern PCs.

I seriously play it at least once every year or so. VTMB is not your basic Vampire RPG. The game allows you to switch between first and third person, features both melee and ranged combat, and allows you mutliple paths to any of your goals. This is set in White Wolf's World of Darkness universe. If you are familiar with table-top RPGs and the World of Darkness, good, if not that is okay (I was not).\n\nThe World of Darkness is your basic modern urban fantasy universe. You the player take the part of a newly created vampire thrust into a world of intrigue and darkness where ancient vampires pull the strings of humanity and each other in ever-shifting alliances and plans. The game allows you a high degree of customization, when creating your character you can choose from one of 6 clans, which feature different superpowers that your character can build as you level. There are no classes, you build your stats how you want them. Your quests almost all feature multiple paths to completion. Need to kill a vampire hunter? Well you can talk your way into her place of work (if you got the speech skills), sneak around the pack and pick some locked doors (if you have the stealth and lockpicking skills), maybe hack some computers to put the place into lockdown and get civilians to leave the area (if you have the hacking skills), or maybe you just want to kick in the front door and go to work with your katana/shotgun/teeth&claws. In this game there are mutilple paths to your goal. A few different endings (choose one of the factions or yourself), and enless playthrough ability. Visit the community forums for this game and download the fanmade patches, they will give you extra quests, clans and plug some bugs.\n\nSeriously. I can't reccomend this game highly enough.","October 19, 2014","true","39.5"," 177 of 181 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","177","181","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaoticproductions/recommended/2600/","kaoticproductions","Drunk on Chaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaoticproductions/","114 products in account","Firstly, you will need the unofficial patch to play this (so here it is: http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647.) The original devs were pushed to release this early by activision, thus it was very buggy. BUT that said, this is easily one of the best RPGs ever concieved. (Also ignore the low play time, for some reason when I installed the patch on my last system the patch only worked if I launched it off of steam, my play time probably numbers in the hundreds of hours.)\n\nSo, Pros\n\n-The Role Playing aspect of this game is very deep, I haven't played a game in a long time that rivals it. You can play as one of 7 vampire 'clans' (which are basically sub species of a sort.) Each clan has it's own unique skill sets, meaning each clan have strengths and weaknesses. Whether it's the toreador with their seductive ability to manipulate practically anyone, the nosferatu, who can stealth their way into just about anywhere, or the brujah who are your more naturally brawling vampire type. Each of the seven clans has distinct strengths and distinct weaknesses.\n\n-Skill specialisation means that you can't be a jack of all trades, if you commit to being a silver tongued devil that talks their way into and out of everything, then you won't be as good at fighting. The opposite is also true, and considering that being good at persuasion/seduction doesn't result in bloodshed this means your vampire will naturally be able to accomplish things that a violent vampire would not, again the opposite is true.\n\n-Because of this, the game has vast replayability, as even a slightly different playstyle results in quite a different story.\n\n-Speaking of replayability, Malkavians are amazing, but they are insane, I would not recommend playing them on your first playthrough. Nosferatu can also be really fun, but are hard to play because you cannot be seen by mortals.\n\n-Leads me on to another important point. The Maquerade itself. The Masquerade is a conspiracy of vampire culture that maintains the illusion to mortals that they don't exist. Meaning that you can't behave in a supernatural way in certain areas, lest you violate the masquerade and incur the discipline of vampire culture. Certain abilities can still be used, depending on whether they are discreet or not, this is another layer of depth to the roleplaying system, as some vampire clans are naturally more capable in masquerade areas. For me personally, I am an avid player of the Toreador (It appeals to the part of me that adore the Anne Rice books.) This clan plays exceptionally well in masquerade areas because they are the most 'human' of all the vampire types, whereas the Nosferatu for example cannot be seen in these areas due to their appearance.\n\n-The Characters in this are not necessarily believable (some are very convincing, some are less so,) but either way the characters are... well... characters... You will love them, and you will love them a lot, the voice acting is amazing, and so is the facial animation, (which is ridiculously expressive, notice I say expressive, not necessarily realistic.) Dialogue options are also insanely awesome in a bethesda before bethesda kind of way.\n\nCons\n\n-Combat (it pains me to mention it, but I have to.) The combat in this game doesn't bother me, but it can be a bit twitchy. Don't worry, we're not talking morrowind levels of twitchy, but it's a little twitchy nonetheless. But it's very easy to overlook because everything else in this game is so on point.\n\n-I should probably mention this as a con, but I just see it as an inevitable mechanic: There are points in the game where you simply cannot avoid intense combat. This can really annihilate a social vampire, so it's good to invest the odd point into ranged weapons once every now and then (because ranged weapons are generally the best thing to deal with the late game combat.) This seems to put some people off the game but it really doesn't bother me that much, and again i'm willing to overlook it because everything else in the game is done so damn well.\n\nIn summary this game is one of the gems of the rpg genre, and you can't call yourself a fan of roleplaying games if you haven't checked this out. it is THE example of a flawed masterpiece; something which had so much ambition and very nearly lived up to it all but fell just a little short. But in spite of this the game is still way above average, and very close to perfection. And it represents something that more games developers should aspire to, because this game went for the moon, and damn nearly got there. Games aren't this ambitious anymore, they don't try to be this unusual any more, and if something did in this generation of gaming, it would truly be a masterpiece.","December 16, 2015","true","35.1"," 175 of 179 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","175","179","6","1"

The quintessential vampire game. There are many reviews that highlight its pros and cons, so I will just say this: it's very good; play it. Be aware, however, that installing the unofficial patch isn't just recommended, but necessary, since the game is very buggy (which is by no means the developer's fault, but rather the publisher's). So check out the community hub for guides on how and where to get patches and various mods.\nFirst timers should also be careful in choosing the clan for their inaugural playthrough. For instance, Malkavian are a... peculiar breed, and some of the dialogue may be a bit confusing; you might also hear voices and talk to objects. Nosferatu, on the other hand, have an altered physical appearance (more "monstruous"), so moving around and interacting with various NPCs can be a challenge; thankfully you can use sewers, and an innate cloaking ability. Even Ventrue can be difficult, because they are selective with their food; so you won't be able to feed off rats or homeless people. But all in all, the clans are pretty balanced, so it's down to personal preference\n\n29th Oct edit: It seems Paradox bought White Wolf, which means chances for a sequel have just gone up. By a lot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asterette/recommended/2600/","asterette","Asterette","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asterette/","136 products in account","Bought this game while on sale thinking it was gonna be pretty so-so. I'd heard things about Vampire: The Masquerade before, but never actually tried it. Boy am I glad I did. This game is like a hidden gem. The graphics are outdated, but what else can you expect from a game that's over 10 years old? If you enjoyed being able to make your own story in Dragon Age or Mass Effect, you may enjoy Vampire: The Masquerade, as it allows you to choose conversation options and shape your character's path.\n\nAlthough you can't customise the appearance of your character (other than clothing), you can choose between 7 different races of vampires of each gender, each with different abilities. Other clothing options can later be bought from the different locations throughout the game, each giving more armour and a different look from the last.\n\nThe story begins with your character and the opposite gender version of your character's race getting 'friendly', and your character will be Embraced (turned). Unfortunately, your sire has commited a violation of the Masquerade by Embracing someone without permission, and is executed for their crimes. Left sireless, after an intervention by the vampire Nines you are allowed a chance to live, but you must 'serve' LaCroix, the prince. During the story, you'll learn what Sabbat, Camarilla, Kuel'jin and many other things are. But I won't spoil the story for you, go play it yourself.\n\nThe downside of this game is that, in order to play it, you must do a few things. There are a few bugs that will not allow the game to play on Steam. To combat this, you must run Steam in administrator mode and change the compatibility properties of Vampire: The Masquerade. I changed the properties to run the program in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 3), and disabled visual themes and desktop compositions. Doing these steps should allow you to run the game. But that's not all. Even though this game is old, there are still unofficial patches being made for it. I recommend installing Wesp's unofficial patch 8.9 at least, as this will fix the resolution error with the game and make the interface clear instead of blurry. Each patch contains everything from the patches before, so you can install the latest one without missing anything. The patches fix a lot of bugs and add things to the game. However, with each patch you must make it a fresh install, delete everything from the patches before (this includes your save files) and replace them with the new patch. The game may crash if you do not do this. You should replace the folder named Vampire inside your Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines folder with the patch folder, which will also be named Vampire. You must also disable the auto updates for the game in the Steam properties, or it may install the old official patch over your unofficial one.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game. Some of the boss fights were quite challenging, there is a lot of side quests and missions to keep you occupied, and you can choose your character's destiny in the world of darkness. You can choose to be a saucy seductress, a badmouthed badass, anything really. And if you choose a Malkavian, you'll have different conversation options than the other races, as Malkavian's have a sort of split personality and insanity. I wish there was a sequel or something. Sucks that the World of Darkness MMO based on this universe was recently cancelled as I was looking forward to it, but what can you do.\n\n~ 9/10 ~","April 28, 2014","true","43.1"," 126 of 131 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","126","131","0","1"

I wish to open the curtain and propose you to join me in this ‘sombre dance’.\n\nTo start off you get to choose between 7 quite varied classes, called clans. Want to play as a Nosferatu and deal massive damage but have the sewers as your main travel path, or would you rather be of the noble kind, a master of eloquence and persuasion but lack physical prowess? Or maybe you fancy the clinically insane that suffers from schizophrenia? I chose the clinically insane because... well as if you wouldn't...and it turned out I chose well because the Malkavian is indubitably one of the most creative character you can play in video games.\n\nFrom the start, you'll notice major technical issues and design decisions that indicate the game was released on its last legs. Their dream nearly did indeed turn to dust as the company went bust soon after its release. In spite of this, the team managed to make a game that unfortunately today is a merely an ash, but a game that still to this day goes against the grain. Eventually an (unofficial) patch was released that made the game much more playable.\n\nIt takes a very conventional approach to customization. On offense you can choose to specialise in guns, unarmed, melee and powers known as disciplines. The defensive counterparts also exist. Each clan has its own set of disciplines that you can specialise in. In addition you can level up skills including hacking, lock picking, intimidation, seduction, research etc and some of these skills add extra dialogue options which can lead to otherwise unavailable rewards. Loot isn’t as abundant as in Bethesda games for example but it exists in moderate amounts. The game features your standard health bar and a blood bar for good measure. You fuel your blood bar by using civilians as sustenance. The refuel rate varies on the civilian type and caution is required since if you get caught you lose masquerade points and once that reaches zero you lose the game for reasons you can find out for yourself. Additionally killing civilians (for example) will lower your humanity and once that reaches a certain point your character does bad things. The graphics are dated but definitely passable.\n\nThese aforementioned issues, these run of the mill customization options are ultimately trivial because the game manages to supersede its faults completely as it ironically isn't devoid of spirit and soul. The game induces perturbation, states of uneasiness, disorientation and even sheer unadulterated terror in both expected and unexpected locations that’ll make you just wish you could give it a maniacal final vale and go make a sandwich while playing Skyrim or something. It isn't all doom and gloom though. This atmosphere, this ‘sombre dance’ can quickly shift to an upbeat vampiric club rave (literally). Of course this tonal shift is entirely at your digression but it's this type of juxtaposition that makes the sinister and foreboding moments all the more significant. The game has quite a few unique takes on conventional missions and a cast of absolutely impeccable characters. These characters can be usually manipulated depending on the clan you choose. For example If you choose the insane schizophrenic, you can use mind control on people to make weird gigglies and other disturbing lines come out their facehole which consequently will make gigglies come out of your facehole. To please the masses there’s also tons of philosophical yet hilarious one liners too.\n\nAs an encore the game washes you with its masterful soundtrack. It’s an eclectic bunch of tunes that amplify the various moods you’ll feel in the game. Whether it’s ominous or calm, frantic or upbeat it does its job. At times there’s an absence of music where ambience is created by the sound of the world around you which in my mind is a soundtrack in itself. This natural ambience can be felt in many places but for the majority of people it will be most memorable in the Ocean House Hotel, considered by those who’ve experienced it as one of the most frightening areas in video games, alongside Shalebridge Cradle from Thief Deadly Shadows. No other game has matched the level of trepidation I felt in The Ocean House Hotel.\n\nUpon release, a significant portion of those who played it hated it because it was marred by its technical issues of which it became infamous for but the biggest cause of its demise was its release alongside Half Life 2. Luckily the game is still on sale today so bless your blood vessels by biting into this magical game like the pale lotus eater that you know you are because once you are done, you'll realise that this product, in this large market where the generic usually flourish most, is an ensemble of special silence and Troika's genuine, bittersweet farewell kiss.\n\nMod Recommendations: Unofficial patch: http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647\n","December 30, 2014","true","53.3"," 123 of 133 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","123","133","3","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/recommended/2600/","positron_","ρоѕιтяои_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/","291 products in account","Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines is a RPG from publisher Activision and developed by Troika Games. For years I'd been hearing from various people about  how great this title is and now that I've played it I must totally agree. Roleplaying games are my bread and butter so this title definitely delivers with its core RPG elements. You create your character and as you progress through the game you acquire experience points which you can then distribute to many different skills and abilities thus allowing you to customize your vampire to your liking and particular style of play be that close or long ranged combat or stealth. The game is action oriented and played in either a first or third person perspective similiar to say Fallout 3 or New Vegas. Graphically the game is dated especially compared to many of the titles from recent years but with the addition of the unofficial patches by Wesp5 and various others you can update the title with high resolution textures and an abundance of bug fixes and enhancements that make it look fairly great for a game that was released so long ago. I myself am a fan of games with retro and outdated graphics and this title just has a nice style to it that fits the dark and forboding theme perfectly. Even better, the dialogue that I've been having throughout the game is one of my favorite aspects of the title as the voice acting is top notch and done so very well. Released in 2004 this game also seems to have been doing things slightly ahead of its time...things that we take for granted as they are very common place in the games of today. Pound for poind I'm loving this title and plan to spend many hours playing it so it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!\n\nP.S.-Thanks to Section Nine http://steamcommunity.com/id/Section9/ for providing the links to the patches for the game.","November 23, 2013","true","3.3"," 144 of 169 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","144","169","0","6"

When you first lay eyes on it, it might be an eye sore, but trust me. Start to sink your fangs into the first few victims and get lost into the twisted personal horror game that lets you cling to your humanity while witnessing unGodly, unspeakable things... or let loose and become the monster you always wanted to be all the while walking the thin red line of not breaking too many Kindred laws.\n\nThe RPG element comes from the table top version of the game, point in intel, point in strength, point in charisma or melee, the concept is easy to use for beginners and easy to follow if you hover your mouse over any stat. It will tell you exactly what other stats benifit from your choices. Lacking in Hacking? Lacking in lock picking? (Dues Ex - like skills) Just add points to whatever helps you make you better at what you like doing.\n\nGame play: When you start you pick a clan, each clan has their own strengths, their own weaknesses. Adding to the replay value of the game. Brawl your way, punk your enemies into submission, lie or whisper sweet nothings into the humans' ears to manipulate them into giving you what you want. Stealth your way through the city via sewers and back alleys, stick to the shadows - or walk among the humans and other vampires as their superior. It's all up to you.\n\nLots of side quests and though the world is not too vast (hence the game was made in 2004) you will have plenty to do with the portions of the city you have access to. Some you will need to gain specific skills, others you will get to as the game progresses.\n\nThe music is awesome. 90's and early 2000's gothic/rock, dark metal music. Will be looking for the OST of this game.\n\nVoice acting, Jeanette! And many others. Even a popular actor from the TV show Futurama voice acted in this. Jeanette's voice actress did a role for Harley Quinn as well. Love her work! One of the strongest parts of this game is conversing with the NPCs. Some are funny, others will make you annoyeed, but none will be boring. Certain powers and certain social skills will effect how NPCs interact and react to you. Some you will need to threaten, if your threat is high enough, some you will have to persuade, others you have to flirt with, and some (if you pick clan Malkavian) you can just talk crazy talk with them. All adding to the depth of each NPC and some making you wish you could talk with them all night long.\n\nThe game is a Horror game, and some jump scares, but the feeling I get from playing the game... CREEP FEST. The atmosphere of the game when you get into a haunted house, or exploring a mad house, or going into a den of those trying to hurry the end of the world... and the sewers! It will make you think twice about opening a manhole, in real life and in game.\n\nOver all this game is a CULT CLASSIC. If anything, get it and play it so when you nerd it out with your friends online or in person, you can give them lots of bloody tales of your own experiances in Vampire - Bloodlines.\n\n9.5 / 10 Play it! Worth every penny at full price and at 75% off.

If you are not sure if you want it, wait for a sale. If you have no problem with older games in your library and love RPG’s, get it instantly and stop reading.\n\nNow to the main part of the Review....\n\nSo I was thinking that I need a new RPG to play. It should have a nice story, good gameplay and some open choices for the player. After a long time searching I found Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. I waited for a long time, before grabbing it on sale and what can I say....I love it.\n\nFirst things first as you may read in other reviews, this game has many bugs. Luckily there is a nice Community that fixes them and brings patches for the game. Before you play it make sure you download the latest patch found here: http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647.\n\nNow let’s start with The Review itself, why do I love this game so much? First, it is inspired by the Vampire: The Masquerade Pen and Paper, and the universe of it, a universe that is deep and complex, and instantly took a place in my heart, where Vampires live along mortal people with rules they have to keep, called the Masquerade. In that world, there are 7 playable and some more (Npc only) Clans that all play in a different way and even have a small impact on your story.\nThe Clans are called: Brujah, Gangrel, Malkavian, Nosferatu, Toreador, Tremere and Ventrue. At the beginning you pick 1 of these, decide if you are female or male (sadly no more customization) and then you allocate your "standard skill points" in your character sheet, whilst every clan has his own abilities and different bonuses on some of the attributes.\n\nThen the Story starts. After a pretty, long but well-made intro sequence you can control your character. The controls feel a bit strange at first and you may have to enable mouse look in the options to get a free camera, everything else should feel similar to rpg players/source users.\nThe graphic is also well designed and fits the dark theme of this game perfectly well, as does the synchronization.\n\nWhat I liked was the fighting style. You have different melee and ranged weapons that reach from a Tire Iron and a magnum to a katana and a flamethrower. While you fight in 3rd person with your melee weapons, you switch to 1st person while using your ranged firearms. Also nice : most of your attributes increase more than 1 ability, example: 1 point of dexterity will get you +1 lockpicking and +1 sneaking skill, strength will get you +1 unarmed and +1 melee and so on, so there are many different ways to design and actually play your character, which leads to the next point.\n\nThe Story has to my knowledge 5 endings, that trigger with your final choice and your positioning to the factions (called sects), which are the Camarilla (the "standard" vampire community) the Anarchs (fighters against the Camarilla) and the Kuei-Jin (eastern vampires that are slightly different). And while you don't actively decide your standing, your actions that you make in the story "speak" for you.\n\nAnd finally The Difficulty...... I love it. The Disciplines between the clans are well balanced and with the right combination of Disciplines and weapons, even the hardest bosses turn to ash in seconds (recommandation: Flamethrower)\n\nSo what can I say.... I guess the fact I recommended the game and my playtime + this review are showing it is worth playing, but again get the unofficial patch and if you are unsure get it on sale. Now excuse me while I enjoy my 2nd playthrough.","July 29, 2015","true","40.3"," 84 of 91 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","84","91","4","5"

By far it's a classic rpg that set the standard for a new generation of rpgs, if your ok with a lot of bugs and not the best graphics due to being outdated this is like a game equal to Skyrim in how much fun and how much time you can put into it. There are a total of 8 playable vampire races that are all very different and provide a different experience that never really gets old, just don't play as a Nosferatu ♥♥♥♥ becomes impossible to play as. There are a bunch of different play styles that include, guns, melee weapons, magic. As long as your ok with a good amount of bugs drinking the blood of everyone, and a huge spike in diffculty by the end of the game and the graphics, this game is probably a 9/10 truely a masterpiece in the field of role playing games and if you are a fan of rpg games I personally recommend this game to any and everyone.","October 30, 2014","true","40.9"," 269 of 355 people (76%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","76","269","355","33","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomebro/recommended/2600/","welcomebro","Toucan Bane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomebro/","283 products in account","Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is my favourite RPG and my favourite game. If I try to be as objective as I possibly can, I can admit that other, better RPGs have come and gone; this is more of a personal preference. The last four or so missions are a bit too lengthy and also happen to be rubbish. I think there are more bad endings than there are good, but I really can't deny what a great time I was having up until those points. Let me preface this review by saying that I don't like Vampires. I never cared for them and I thought I would stay that way until the day I die. My opinion immediately changed within the first 20 minutes or so of playing this game; the vampires are so badass. Troika's approach to Vampires is definitely interesting. Set in 21st century Los Angeles, the Vampires coexists with man and are required to "uphold the masquerade" by keeping their existence a secret.\n\nThe game begins with you selecting one of seven vampire clans, your gender, and some basic skills. After all that, you find yourself getting nasty with a vampire from the clan you selected. They decide to make you into a vampire, forbidden by the masquerade unless special permission is given. A bit after the siring process is complete, vampires bust through the door, stab you both with wooden stakes, and bring you before Prince LaCroix to decide your fate. Your sire is executed for his/her actions, but you are spared and are then tasked with carrying out LaCroix's dirty work; a few odd jobs and a hunt for an ancient vampire artifact, which is said to bring about doomsday. Now, take a plot about several vampire factions fighting over an old sarcophagus, then add intrigue, adult themes, a gothic, urban setting, and humour, and you've got one of the greatest RPG storylines ever.\n\nBloodlines definitely has some of the most memorable characters (my personal favourites being Jack, the Voerman sisters, VV, and Chunk) in any game. Their dialogue is superbly-written (now that I think about it, all of the game's dialogue is superb: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=596424142 ), they've got great voice acting, as well as lively, fully-animated faces. However, one thing I didn't really like was how some of these characters you grow really interested in are only relevant for a certain period of time and then you just move on and never see them again. However, I can see reasons for why this was the case, as the writers may not have wanted to just shoehorn a random character in just for the sake of doing it.\n\nThe clever writing, stellar world design, great soundtrack, and likable characters all make for an atmosphere that I feel is unparalleled.\n\nThankfully, the writing of Bloodlines does not hold up the entire game. The gameplay is very good but not without issues. You can customize your character in a number of ways. Focusing on combat, stealth, or whatever floats your goat. You can spend XP to upgrade your basic attributes (strength, appearance, dexterity, etc.) and your skills (guns, melee, lock pick, hacking, stealth, etc.), both of which contribute to your feats. For example, you have your melee feat, which is the sum of your strength attribute and your weapon skill. Unfortunately, the game was a bit rushed, which led to a lot of the later areas being combat-oriented... a bit too combat-oriented. Now, you can upgrade your skills and attributes that don't contribute to your combat feats, but it is a good idea to make yourself into a decent fighter because if you aren't, then you'll be in for some really nasty surprises later on.\n\nSpeaking of combat, it isn't particularly great. It's definitely enjoyable in short bursts. However, too much of it is just frustrating and annoying. First off: aiming of any kind, be it a gun or even melee weapon, needs work. The crosshair is tiny, so you will miss... a lot. Some of the enemies take way too long to kill; basic thugs can take ten years to kill with a baseball bat. The biggest problem with it is that there's simply too much of it.\n\nHowever, you can make it a bit easier by using your awesome vampire powers! Each clan has their own unique abilities that can range from stat boosts to straight up magic. In order to use these powers, you'll need to make sure you've got enough blood in you. Being a vampire, you run on blood, it's your new heroin. You need to keep your blood level stable by either feeding off someone or by consuming blood packs. If you don't keep your blood pool in check, you'll eventually start to lose control of yourself and drain the blood of anyone in sight until you kill them. Doing so causes you to lose humanity. The more humanity you lose, the more of a mindless beast you become. You must also be careful with keeping your vampiric presence a secret. Failing to do so will result in a Masquerade violation; five of these and you get a game over. Losing too much humanity or racking up violations will get hunters after you.\n\nThere are ton of quests for you to complete throughout the game's four districts, most of which are awesome. Remember how I said this game was a bit rushed? Well, that certainly becomes evident after a bit. You begin the game in Santa Monica, which is easily the best part of the game. There are many great quests, all of which accommodate for any playstyle. As you progress to different areas, you'll eventually notice that the quests start accommodating less playstyles until the only way to continue is to kill everything in sight... or possibly sneak (good luck with that).\n\nBloodlines doesn’t have the best graphics, but it’s still easy on the eyes. The environments are generally nice and have a decent amount of detail in them (some rather humorous details!). The characters are easily the best looking things in the game. Now, the stock enemies and random people on the streets don't look very good, but anyone you can engage in a conversation with is guaranteed to be. The same cannot be said for their animations, however. Some are good, some are laughably bad. Most of the good ones seem to be the ones of NPC characters when you’re talking to them. Most of the bad ones are combat animations. Some of them make your character look like they have the worst posture ever; I’ve seen awkward kids from a high school anime club that can stand up straighter than my vampire! The sound, however, is definitely great. The voice acting is terrific (mostly), the sound effects are of good quality (better than Oblivion, that’s for damn sure), the background noises (cars, people chatting, etc.) don’t feel out of place, and I absolutely love the soundtrack. The background tracks for city streets, crypts, or anywhere else are all very fitting, sound great, and add to the atmosphere. And you didn’t think I’d forget to mention the club music, did you? It’s mostly Goth music, which I normally hate, but I actually really liked the tracks they chose here. I admit to standing around and stalling in the Asylum and Confessions just to listen to the music.\n\nBloodlines is a pretty buggy game. Playing it vanilla is like… well I can’t think of a good comparison so I’ll just say that it’s something you don’t want to do. That is, if you can even get it get it to start up. The game has issues running on modern hardware. However, this can be remedied with one of the several unofficial patches for the game. I strongly recommend installing one, as it will fix so much of the game. Even with one installed, you’ll still run into the odd bug every now and then, but I never encountered anything game-breaking with the latest patches.\n\nBloodlines is a game that gets worse as you go along, but it’s still one hell of a ride; I guarantee it’s unlike anything you’ve ever played. If you’re more accustomed to modern RPGs, you may find it hard to enjoy this. But if you like older CRPGs, this is for you!\n\nStory: 20/20\n\nGameplay: 36/40\n\nGraphics: 18/20\n\nSound: 10/10\n\nPerformance: 8/10\n\nOverall: 92/100","January 28","true","32.8"," 69 of 76 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","69","76","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/recommended/2600/","goldenagegmr","GAGMR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/","425 products in account","This game is a cult classic.\n\nYou should be warned that this game is broken and will not function on most modern machines.  There is an Unofficial Patch made by Wesp5 that fixes nearly all issues with the game and also adds new content.\n\nBased on the board game, and sequel to Redemption, you play as a fledgling Vampire in California.  The story starts as you create your character.  Here you choose your background, bloodline, and gender.  Backgrounds change your stats slightly and your powers as a vampire will differ depending on your bloodline.  Some bloodlines have some side effects, however.\n\nThe best examples are Malkavians and Nosferatu.  Malkavians are insane and schizophrenic.  You'll talk like a crazy person, hear voices in your head and see things other people don't see.  Nosferatu are cursed in a different way as they can't be seen by humans without violating the masquerade.  This does not make it impossible to beat the game as a Nosferatu, because the main quest NPC's will still be approachable.\n\nThe masquerade is a system in the game where if you get 5 bad marks it's game over and you'll be executed by your peers.  You earn bad marks by displaying certain powers in public or are seen feeding.  You can redeem yourself if you have bad marks by protecting the masquerade.  This usually involves killing someone who is speaking  too much or who isn't playing it safe like all other good little vampires should.\n\nGraphics are decent and passable.  The game is an older game, so don't expect mind blowing visuals.  City hubs are fairly small but there's a lot to find if you set your mind to it.  There are some nice facial animations that you won't even see in games nowadays which adds to the immersion.  There's also several mods for the game to add atmosphere and even more depth to the classes.\n\nGameplay is basic.  You shoot things, you smash things.  You talk to people, you kill people.  There are extra dialog options if you level your seduction, intimidation, or persuassion skills.  These skills can be vital to completing some quests perfectly.  You can also recieve bonuses from certain NPC's for having them at the required level at certain points in conversation.\n\nYou gain experience from doing quests and you level up to gain strength, wisdom, guile, skill, and become more attractive.  If you're sexy enough you get free hookers! Just like IRL! =P\n\nThe beginning of the game will mostly be fetch quests, with a few baddies to either slaughter or let live.  It's a game where you can put the fate of nearly everyone around you in your hands.  Being good is rewarded with extra perks like your very own slave ghoul girl, or an extra item/money/experience.  There's also a decent but easy stealth system that's based on how many points you have in stealth.  If you max out stealth, are in the shadows and crouch you're pretty much invisible.  There are also assassinations you can do with each weapon while stealthed and behind your victim.  My favorite is the baseball bat.  :)\n\nAudio is very good as well.  Just make sure you turn Environmental Effects off or there will be a constant echo.  Voice actors are all top notch and AAA grade ones that you'll know if you've heard them before.\n\nThere are some very good mods for this game available as well.  My favorite being the original Unofficial Patch Plus, but there are other that increase the difficulty of the game and add new quests and bloodlines to choose from.  When installing these big mods you need to remember that they aren't compatible with eachother.  E.G. Final Nights mod will not work with Camarilla Edition nor with either work with the Unofficial Patch.  Both mods have an Older version of the Unofficial patch that come with it, which still fixes a lot of bugs.  There's also several mods  that are still being produced constantly by fans.  Every now and then you should check up and see what new mods are out to keep you coming back for more.\n\nAll in all, if you are in need of a good RPG that's open world with a lot of freedom and are tired of Fallout 3/NV, Skyrim, etc.  Then you should definately check this game out.  Especially if it's on sale.  Well worth every penny spent.","October 23, 2014","true","334.1"," 60 of 63 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","60","63","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killahneo/recommended/2600/","killahneo","Killah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killahneo/","181 products in account","The stronger points of the game are that it has a fantastically dark atmosphere, believable and often intense characters (something which alot of games lack), and a solid storyline that does the game justice. Also, you choose at the beginning which bloodline (faction) you are part of, which will directly affect your relationships with the characters in-game, offering variation and replayablility, if you don't mind already knowing the storyline the second time through. Finally, the level design is very well done, giving varied and interesting locations that will keep your interest, no rampant cookie-cutter design here.\n\nOn the down side, it is a dated game, having been released in 2004, so you will probably only get the most out of it if you don't mind the avatars looking a bit blocky compared to what you might be used to. I'm sure it was 'fairly' close to cutting edge graphics in 2004, but if you can look past it, the game will suck you in and you won't notice.\n\nIt was mentioned that the game doesn't feel finished by one reviewer, and while I disagree, I can see why that might come up. The game is completely set at night, so far as I can remember, so you won't get the bustling city feel that daytime would bring, and also it doesn't have a huge amount of side quests that seem to pack into games these days (to cover up lack of original content), but there is plenty to keep you occupied.. you won't get bored.\n\nAlso, apparently the game was quite buggy at release. I'd used the official patch when I played it, and didn't come across any problems. I certainly didn't come close to checking on forums, as one or two others had, but everyone plays a game differently, and it's becoming standard practice to check forums rather than think a problem through, or work around it. Regardless, apparently the unofficial patch made by fans is the best, from what I gather.\n\nOverall I greatly enjoyed the game and thought it to be underrated, definately a pleasant surprise. At no point did I get bored, even though there are many areas, nor did I question whether I'd see it through to the end, unlike quite a few games which get churned out. The storyline was interesting, and I found myself carefully watching the behaviour of all the characters, not quite sure who to trust, as it should be in a vampire underworld. The hotel level was especially spooky, I might add ;) good job on that. I only wish that there was a sequel.","November 19, 2014","true","1.8"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","37","41","0","0"

There are even guides that will aid you in getting the graphic-enhancing mods to work that come with one of the patches (I chose Wesp's Unoffical Patch since it seemed to contain more goodies).\n\nYeah, yeah, I know the game's developer's are out of business.  I know it 'only takes five minutes to install the patch'.  Doesn't really matter.\n\nSomeone is asking people to fork over $20 for a decade-old game (as of the time of this writing, you can get it for $5 though!), and someone is getting that money.  That 'someone' could at least update it with a patch of their own that is included in the purchase.  Whoever is getting paid for this game is relying on the cult status this game has achieved to put money in their pockets and giving their fans the middle finger as they do it.\n\nWhich is a shame because, what I've played so far, it's a great game.  Not top-notch, but pretty good for its niche.\n\nGraphics:  They're a decade old and even with enhancements, it shows its age.  Animations are kind of stiff and clunky, and everything is sort of reminiscent of the way the original Blood Rayne looked.\n\nVoice-Acting:  Some of it is Grade A, some of it is Grade F.  Pretty hit or miss, as usual with most games, your protagonist stays silent.  Nothing wowing here, except for how terrible some of it is.\n\nGameplay:  Pretty basic.  Forces you into third-person view whenever you do melee fights, which I find irritating.  I'd like it a lot more if I didn't have to see my own character's awkward flailing strikes.  There are some nice elements, such as your ability to be a silver-tongued rascal, or computer-hacking nerd, or lockpicking sneak really coming into play.  I also like how faithful they are to the source material, with Nosferatu having to stay hidden from humans, the rivalry war between Sabbat and Camarilla, etc.\n\nStory:  It's nothing to sneeze at, but it's not quite as great as some people claim.  Your dialogue choices are often clunky and ridiculous, but the whole thing weaves together fairly well.\n\nTL;DR:  Get it while it's on sale.  KNOW YOU WILL HAVE TO MANUALLY PATCH IT TO GET IT TO WORK.  DO NOT IGNORE ALL THE REVIEWS TELLING YOU THIS, THINKING IT WILL WORK ON YOUR RIG.\n\nIf whoever is making money off of selling this game would patch it themselves, I would give it a positive recommendation.","January 2","false","6.0"," 124 of 204 people (61%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","61","124","204","10","14"

Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines is it.\n\nI had this game standing alone in the backlog two years ago. I kept having strange sudden urges saying I need to play this game over and over again. I decided why the heck not. The game kept crashing and crashing. I found out it required community patches. Already had 300 of them... Wow, the community must be sooo dedicated. I wonder why? Hmm...\n\nNow it finally ran smooth at the start. Boom, my life changed when I put my foot in the city of Santa Monica and met a memorable character named Smiling Jack. The atmosphere and the characters in the game were something I have never seen or experienced before in any games that blown me away. They were soooo freaking immersing that kept me hooked playing this game nonstop for two weeks. The story became remarkably darker, mind blowing, and emotional all at the same time. It was sooo well written and properly executed that I couldn't believe how good the whole thing is. The characters. The atmosphere and places to explore. The gameplay and RPG elements chosen for this game. The plot. EVERYTHING. So good. I do not want to spoil ANYTHING because you need to play this first.\n\nThe experience inspired me to complete few playthroughs with different clan and mods. The community and cult following are so dedicated that it's amazing. This game is a textbook example of a cult classic.\n\nExcellent cult classic. I am proud to claim this game as my third favorite game of all time.\n\n9.7 out of 10","March 22","true","112.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","1"

It's dark and gritty without taking itself too seriously, filled with atmopshere and world-detail without playing like a fantasy encyclopedia. and you can roll around town dressed up as a pimp or a stripper. What more could you want from a game?\n\nThe best testimony of how fantastic this game is is undoubtedly the fans; Even though this game came out in 2004, there are still unofficial patches being developed and released as you read this. Never has a game been more loved, cherished, or enriched by its community. We're just lucky to be able to play it now, when all the bugs have been fixed by dedicated fans, compared to its initial release.\n\nThe game play is fairly simple and easy to access, though the variety of levels mean it never gets dull. You can shoot, tear, or bite your way through your enemies, and look like something straight out of a bondage fever dream/nightmare whilst doing it. The plot is genuinely gripping, with twists and turns I never saw coming, and the ending? The ending is just... f*** me. Well played, Bloodlines. Well played.\n\nStoryline? Basically, you wake up a fledgling after a passionate night with your fanged lover, only to end up becoming a glorified slave of a grumpy french nobleman with a Napoleon complex and a damn nice suit. Be his ♥♥♥♥♥ for what feels like eternity. Blow ♥♥♥♥ up. The ranges of choices you're given are actually pretty impressive, and DO make a difference, unlike some franchises I can think of (*cough*Mass Effect*cough). Be sassy. Be crazy. Be sexy as hell. It's one of those games where you can truly be whoever you want.\n\nAside from appropriately dressed.

It has small, more compact world because of the source engine I presume, but lots of content. I am mentioning Elder Scrolls for the solo purpose of saying that just like TES, VTM:B must be loved with all its flaws, bugs, errors and imperfections.\nI honestly believe that Troika Games just had horrible luck as if universe screwed them up while they were creating the game.\n\nStarting with engine itself, Troika used an unfinished Source Engine and had to work with it, adding their own code. Troika worked on the same engine that Half-Life 2 were even before the engine was shown publicly. In fact they had an agreement that they can't sell the game before the Half-Life 2 release.\n\nAfter the engine came Activision. Even though Troika employers kept on working overtime on the game, Activision still rushed the release and cut off sponsorship of the game. So in the end we got ourselves a rushed, unpolished product that in fact was fixed and updated by fans for more than 11 years now.\nAnd you might think thats it? Troika Games sold too little copies of the game to keep up afloat and ended up being closed. How did that happen if the game is so good as I keep on saying?\n\nBad luck.\n\nRelease date of the game is November 2004. What else happened in 2004 prior the November?\nUnreal Tournament 2004, Far Cry, Sacred, Painkiller, Hitman: Contracts, Manhunt, Thief: Deadly Shadows,  Doom 3, Silent Hill 4: The Room, Sims 2, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War, Star Wars: Battlefront, Myst IV: Revelation, Rome: Total War and many other awesome games. Year 2004 was an amazing year in the industry.\n\nAnd you may think that with all that competition on the market VTM:B were safe since they released in November, while other games were earlier? Well, still bad luck Troika Games.\n\nWhat happened in November in the PC game industry? (I am not mentioning games such as MGS3 and other console games since I am talking about PC)\nCS:Source, Half Life 2, NFS: Underground 2, World Of Warcraft, Prince Of Persia: Warrior Within and so on. With all respect to Troika Games, they had no chance of wining a competition.\n\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is probably one of my favorite games of all time. With all it's imperfections and glitches it delivers an amazing lore, story, humor and experience. Gameplay itself (fighting) is done horribly and sloppy though so don't expect to be blown away with it, dialoges is what makes it so special. Depending on the vampire clan you chose it can take you 3 or more walkthroughs to experience all the game aspects such as different approaches (stealth, fighting with magic or brute force, persuation/intimidation/seduction) and even a special, Malkavian clan walkthorugh. You see, Malkavians are insane vampires. And by insane I mean totally sick. When you play as a Malkavian character literally every dialogue line for you is changed in a mad/insane way. In fact you can have a dialog with a news reporter on your TV if you are playing as a Malkavian.\n\nAll and all, when playing this game keep in mind that it was released in 2004 and it has lots of flaws that modern games don't, but thats simply because people are always becoming better at what they do and creating videogames is not an exception.","November 19, 2015","true","18.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","2"

And in some ways, is vastly superior to some modern games. The graphics are a bit dated, but not horribly so. Again, I've played some modern games with worse. Voice acting is top-notch. The story and lore that surrounds the game is amazing and deep. You could spend hours just talking to NPCs because the lore is that involved and you may want to absorb it all. I hesitate to say characters are believable (I'm looking at you, Knox), but they're charming. Some are likeable, whereas others are easy to hate. Either way, they're all written well for the world they are in and really help to develop it. I found the Anarchs to be a much more relatable, realistic group than some of the others. That said, the members of the Anarchs are my favorite chraracters, so I could be biased.\n\nCombat (especially melee) can be a bit clunky, but not impossible to handle. And, due to the various clans, it makes it very easy to find a playstyle that works best with what you like. This game transitions from a stealth/puzzle game, to a 3rd person hack and slash, to a 1st person shooter seamlessly, and allows the player to change up their playstyle on the fly.\n\nEach clan has a very unique, rich story that surrounds them, which makes it fun to play multiple times in order to get a feel for all seven of them.\n\nSome the levels are unsettling, or downright scary to go through. They're very atmospheric, with great audio and visuals. I would be lying if I said that there weren't some missions where I had to take my headphones off, or had to play during daylight hours while other people were around. There's one in particular where you don't even face any enemies, but the hair on the back of my neck still stands up every time I go through it.\n\nMy one main complaint is that VTMB is a game that hinges on the fact that your character might be a sexual creature, making it possible to sort of romance some of the characters. However, there is only one male NPC throughout the game who can be 'romanced', yet several females. I get that at the time, game companies thought  that female gamers were a rarety, so I don't really fault it too much.","April 26","true","1.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

I've seen nothing but positive things about it, but to be honest, the cover art and the concept kind of warded me off of it. After all, vampires suck now.\n\nNow, after 30 hours and having beaten the game, I can safely say it's one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nIt has a unique atmosphere, gothic without feeling forced, gritty and stylish. It takes what the modern take on the modern vampire is and makes it well... good. Great. Apparently, this is the norm for VTM (which I haven't played at Tabletop before). I would say its the best depiction of a modern vampire out there.\n\nIt's not all rosy, of course. This game doesn't pull any punches if you're not being careful and keeping aware. I couldn't even get the game to run on Steam. However, VTM-B has a very active, very devoted fanbase that creates custom content and mods so I was able to get a 'true to game' patch that simply made the game run in no time at all.\n\nI only beat the game a few hours ago, but I am already thinking of second play throughs, with new mods and new choices. This game gives the player a ton of opportunities to alter the story, too. I felt like, at most every juncture, that my decisions mattered. That I wasn't just plodding through the developer's story but that I was writing a story of my own.\n\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines manages to hold together a beautifully crafted environment, with some satisfying combat and evocative NPC interaction and story telling. It borders on perfection and a standard that other RPGs should be held to.\n\nPros:\n+Amazing Atmosphere\n+Cool and gothic without feeling forced\n+Likeable/multidimensional NPCs\n+Lots of choices and approaches to both build and story progression\n+Satisfying, high-impact combat (at least in melee)\n+Active fanbase producing extra content\n+Very addictive once things get going\n\nCons:\n-The first half hour or so of the game are slow and fail to grab attention\n-The unmodded/unpatched game was not playable for me (but this is not such a big issue)\n-Character building and numbers can be unintuitive\n\nOverall, I would say it's completely worth the purchase, even at non-sale price.","February 28","true","30.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

There is just so many options to choose from, both in development of your character’s personality and fighting style. You can basically play the game exactly the way you want the game to be played. I’ll recommend this game to everyone who likes a good dark and twisted RPG full of morbid and black humor.\n\nAs a newly embraced kindred you are given a lot of choices that could alter your overall storyline. If you believe in good or evil then your world might get turned around, as it all depends on point of view - your point of view. Will you seek allies to strengthen your fate or will you simply end up betraying them due to trust or individual differences?\n\nAn important condition for your new and eternal existence is your beast within and the craving for blood that follows. Going without blood when you’re thirsty will make your beast unsatisfied and release from the chains of you, till it once again will be filled and in slumber. This could break your most important rule - keep your identity hidden, keep your race a secret, respect the masquerade. Mortal curiosity could be your final death, if not by them then by your own, revealing the secrecy of your species is tolerated as betrayal as you will condemn the masquerade.\n\nThere is a lot of clans to choose from, even the choice of clan can alter the perspective people talk and greet you within the world. Every clan has unique armor and skill sets. All of the clans can choose the same stats depending on which role the player wish to play the game. Your stats affect your social and combat abilities.\n\nDo you want to slice and dice or do you want to take your enemies out from a distance? You can choose your fighting style in combination with your clan’s skill set to create your own unique play style. However blood is limited so remember to feed when you can.\n\nYour social abilities can help you to dominate, convince or seduce others to have your way. That can help you grant access to locations, free goodies or even a free blood snack!\n\nDon’t forget to catch a squishy rattie when passing through the sewer. Why… one might ask…? Well… they’re deliciously tasty and uhm, ratties provide a fine amount of blood! Tasty, tasty ratties.\n\nThe game has only been improved by time, thanks to a great and active modding community and the unofficial patches, which I highly recommend to everyone who would like to play the game, as it fixes some of the game’s glitches and bug issues.\n\nThe game offers quality gameplay and storyline plus a huge amount of playtime and replay value.","March 14, 2013","true","65.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","5"

Being the idiot that judged a book by its cover, I often threw it aside and left it hanging there in my library. Sure enough, I sift through many old gems in the RPGs section, only to find it again, and again, and again. There must be a reason for an RPG to be great despite the technical difficulties and the outdated graphics, no? Sure enough I go for it (On my fifth attempt of liking it) and I was immediately pulled into its world and characters. This is the best example I would give to anyone asking for a high quality story experience, never mind the fact that it is a great RPG experience. I never played it at its time, but I sure have good memories of Vampire: The masquerade. I am normally not a pushover when it comes to games, but I would easily be one for anyone who is a big fan of RPGs and hasn't experienced such a masterpiece. I don't think I need to go into detail about it aside from the fact that it might turn away a lot of players due to its outdated presentation and technical limitations. Other than that, you can easily guarantee yourself a great game.

This is something that kind of blew my mind. Just played an hour or so into it i noticed that it is very detailed in the types of vampires they have, the abilities, and the lifestyle. They do a very good job keeping everything shadey and making you play the game to discover more of it. You get to create how you want your character and it gives you a few options. Only thing is i noticed is it didn't have a character customization. What happens is theres a character thats pre-determined for each type of vampire. Suprisingly the graphics aren't that bad either. I figured they would be horrible or very dated due to it's time but for the game it still outshines most indie games these days.\n\nI will update this further when i play more of the game, but for now i recommend this game.\nAlso if you purchase this game you might run into some issues running.

The RPG elements were good, if a little confusing at first, the character sheet can be overwhelming at first glance, but it's easy to get the hang of eventually. VTMB provided you with plenty choices as well, involving not just the plot, but your style of gameplay, some of your dialogue, even extra areas depended on the clan you chose. The length of the game was also very nice, with loads of side quests in each area to do. The only downsides to this game were it's bugs, a lot of which were fixed in the unofficial patches, and the difficulty of some enemies seemed too hard at times, but with careful spending of experience points, lots of quicksaves, and patience, can be defeated easily enough.

Deus Ex, Thief, Morrowind, System Shock and Pathologic were all excellent in their own respects --- but this game beats them all in terms of consistency and believability. Characters actually have personality, conversations actually flow, and every single NPC that can be interacted with has a ton of depth and maybe even a few ulterior motives. This game is easily tied with Deus Ex as the closest we've ever gotten to Warren Spector's "one city block" vision. It simply has to be experienced to be believed.\nUnfortunately, the game is even more broken than Deus Ex. While Deus Ex was marred by half-baked and unsatisfying systems that would make for a terrible games on their own, this game is marred by a ton of systems that are either there for no reason whatsoever or just outright don't work. The Seduction skill makes Deus Ex's Swimming look useful, and there is absolutely no reason to use firearms at any point in the game. Not even the tutorial for firearms requires that you use them --- they are that useless. For the first two areas, the game is a brilliant collage of choices and possibilities, surpassing even, yes, Deus Ex, but that vision becomes more and more distant as the game goes on, to the point where the latter half of the game is a concoction of horribly rushed and bland dungeon crawls and some of the worst boss fights even seen in games and the final area is almost entirely devoid of any complex architecture, sidequests or secrets. The story comes to a similarly rushed, mean-spirited and silly conclusion. If there was ever a game that deserved this kind of fate, this one wasn't it.\nOverall, this game is Deus Ex taken to the extreme in every aspect --- while the world of Deus Ex occasionally felt real and personal, Bloodlines' world bursts at the seems with life, and for a precious moment, one could be forgiven for seeing the World of Darkness as truly alive and endless. While Deus Ex was somewhat weak in its mechanics and failed to retain its momentum into the latter stages of the game, Bloodlines barely functions at all beyond its first few stages and completely falls apart in the latter half. This game is utterly brilliant for its first half, but the second half will make any player mourn for what it could have been. Considering the fact that Troika closed its doors after Bloodlines' release and nobody has so much as attempted something approaching the first half of the game ever since, it's unlikely that we'll see a happy ending for this kind of game, so we have no choice but to enjoy this precious specimen.","October 23, 2014","true","25.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It was the third and final title they ever made before kicking the bucket.\n\nYou play as a newly formed vampire in a "World of Darkness". You choose between several clans, from the rebellious Brujah to the insane Malkavians. Each clan has their own stat differences and NPCs react to you very differently. Especially if the player plays as a Nosferatu, you are treated like a hideous monster and cannot stay around human NPCs without them running away from you. The gameplay is solid and acts as both a first person shooter and a hack and slash.\n\nMost notable is the atmosphere of VtmB. It features very well made map design that is riddled with side quests in it's city hubs. Believe me when I say this game takes a while to complete, and is very rewarding once you do it. It is also replayable due to how much of the game changes depending on what clan you play as.\n\nIt runs on a beta version of the Source engine. The version it runs on is actually more primitive than Half Life 2. As a result the game is fairly buggy due to it's rushed development. However like all of Troika's games there is a large fan community that has released an unofficial patch that fixes most of the issues.","April 5, 2014","true","33.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

First don't let the 1.1 hours mislead you, I've put around ten hours so far into this game. The Unofficial patch functions outside of steam so the counters not gonna work. I reccomend the patch by the way it has a list of improvements that make the game more enjoyable.\n\nThe Pro's:\n-Lore. There's a lot of it and it is fairly easy to understand most of it.\n-Graphics. Top notch for it's time, early 2000's, it has aged pretty well to my eyes.\n-Audio/Voice Acting. The background music is pretty atmospheric and in tense situtions got my heart quickening a bit. The VO is well acted and cast, Each important and even supporting characters feel very distinct.\n-Gameplay. It's an rpg so you'll have to manage stats and what not but I found keeping track of your "Humanity" interesting as well as "The Masquerade". Falling to zero in either of those is game over. Also don't die, that's a game over too...\n-You Are a Vampire Baby! Bloody act like it!!!!!\n\nThe Cons:\n-Some small bugs are still present even with the patch but that's to be expected. Nothing is perfect.\n-Character creation is really limited. You have about a dozen sub species of vampire to choose from but you CAN'T go in and edit facial appearances or anything. Options are limited to race, gender, backstory and predetermined body build. Each has it's own strengths and weakness. My character is a Brujah, strong willed idealist types but low self control when "The Thirst" rears its ugly head. (I use The phrase "The Thirst" because the Blade movies had the better term.)\n-Quest details often give you very little clues as to where to find goals. You'll end up wandering about before figuring out that you need to be in a area that hasn't been unlocked to you yet.\n-Managing your skills seems a bit daunting at the very begining but it gets smoother as you go on.\n-Quick travel between areas but not to specific locations i.e. clubs, motels and such. So be prepared to walk, a lot...\n\nThis game is savage (in a good way) and is well worth playing atleast twice I feel. I give it 9 out of 10 bites to the neck. Would bite again and again.

This game allows you to immerse yourself into a vampire role-playing game which is vast and has numerous twists, you start off as a nobody who is sired (turned) by someone you're sleeping with - male or female. Thus begins your story into the chaotic world of the supernatural, with numerous mods which change the story and add extra clans you'll be capable of sinking many hours into this game and gaining great pleasure from doing so. I don't usually make reviews unless the game is truly deserving of one, so let that bounce around your empty skull for a moment. You NEED to buy this game, you MUST have this game. Sorry, I just tried to dominate you - which is one of the many disciplines you are capable of having in this game. The game itself is known for having bugs, however the community keep making patches for it which fixes them and brings along new content.\n\n10/10 - Carl Poppa Rating\nYou'll definitely need to buy this game if you are a fan of vampires, supernatural or are merely looking for an immersive role-playing game.","November 2, 2015","true","45.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

At time of writing I have logged over 60 hours into this game. I love the setting, the gameplay, and the experiance that it presents to you.\nThe creatures and clans remain faithful to their source material which makes for a great mix of horror and RPG. Some of the creepier places really get under your skin. When this game came out, it had top of the line graphics, but has aged a bit. That doesn’t distract from the incredible art direction and level design.\nWith each clan bringing a unique playstyle, and 5 endings, this game has a lot of replayability. I especially enjoyed the madness inducing Malkavians. The game will often give you a goal and have several ways to accomplishing it. 10 years after the fact, I still love and play this game. Make sure you get the unofficial patch though. It fixes a lot of bugs and adds a lot of extra content (mainly stuff the designers hadn’t finished yet).\n\nOverall, if your looking for a great game with horror/RPG elements, give this game a try. It will suck you into its world!\n\nHighly Recommended\n\n5/5","January 1, 2014","true","82.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I like this as much as Rappers like tax evasion(seriously guys do you taxes). I would even go as far as saying greatness and this game go together like Nicole Richie and calorie counters. The game allows you to make a character from 5 different clans. These clans all have thier own special abilities and feel really different. Oh yeah, I should mention that the game is very stat heavy. Now I am going to put down what I liked about the game in cliffnotes because current society's attention span is as short as Gary Coleman doing the crabwalk. Let us get into this,\n\nWhat I liked?\n-Very stat heavy which makes for some interesting skillchecks\n-Multiple ways to create a character\n-Multiple ways to complete a mission\n-Brilliant Dialogue(If you want movie type of dialogue this is the game if you want book type of dialogue look for Planetscape : Torment)\n-Voice acting is spot on, probably one of the best voice acting ever recorded in an rpg.\n-Combat abilities are just marvelous\n-Clan specific abilities give your character a different feel.\n-Lots of Side Missions\n-Interesting story component\n-Multiple Endings\n-Mixture of Minor and Major Decisions to be made(Not all rpgs should be based on making decisions of finding a cure for cancer or ending world hunger)\n\nWhat I didn't like?\n-BUGS. With the amount of bugs that this game has, you would think it was made by an obsidian programmer working through a hangover. The amount of bugs in this game are probably being cast for ANTZ 2(3?). When I think about the bugs i run away in peril because I think they are all over me. (They are amazing patches to fix this though)\n-The last quarter of the game was more copy paste than that friend of yours that leaves assignments till sunday. Seriously troika fix your ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOther than that it is probably my most favorite game out there. I would go ahead and give it what it is due. VTMB with patches and everything is a complete 9.7/10. I absolutely wasted and had so much fun in this game. I would recommend it for anyone that wants to have fun.

The history is very interesting and the dialogues are well written and very funny several times. Even the advertisement that plays on the radio (which you can ignore if you want) is funny and well elaborated. The haunted house mission is a memorable moment of the game and is a good example of how this game is well made.

Just know that I played this game ALOT.\n\nThis is my second favorite role-playing game of all time! And it's still extremely close to my first favorite, Mass Effect 2. The voice acting is really, really good. You get a pen and paper-like character customizer where you get to pick your gender, and vampire clan along with a backstory about before you became a vampire. The intro is really interesting and builds the world very well. You really do feel like a vampire that's hiding their true identity in Los Angeles. Each quest is interesting, and are all worth playing. Instead of an open world, you get four hub cities Santa Monica, Hollywood, Downtown, and Chinatown. Depending on your gender, clan, and certain skills, you can select alot of interesting dialogue options, and unlock more too! The lore is very interesting, and I recommend studying it on the White Wolf Wiki if you're gonna buy this game. This game also has great characters who are all very detailed in the world. In fact, my favorite gaming character of all time came from this game, Therese Voerman. If you look past the dated graphics, even some bugs with the unofficial patch still installed, and look at all the great things this game has to offer like detailed role-playing, interesting characters, a well set up world, rich lore, and great quests, you can easily have alot of fun with this game.","December 28, 2015","true","10.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It takes the basic gameplay of the intelligent shooters of old and mixes it with a heavy does of RPG mechanics and open ended storytelling.\n\nBloodlines start you off in a very classic vampire way, you find yourself in a seedy motel room being hot and heavy with someone of the opposite sex when all of the sudden they bite you. Before you get a chance to get your bearings some goons storm the place and take you and your new lover away to a court where your lover is executed for making a new vampire without permission but you are uncharacteristically spared. You are then set loose on the streets where a friendly old geezer explains what it means to be a vampire and after a quick tutorial introducing you the various concepts of the game you are free to explore the city.\n\nBloodlines is a first person shooter in it's most basic form although many of the weapons and abilities are melee in nature. It takes a great deal of inspiration from Deus Ex and System Shock by creating a myriad of different ways to go about each area. Lots of vents and back alleys, locks to pick and people to persuade. There is always another way to go about things depending on your skills and inclination. The RPG system is fairly straight forward, you get skill points as you level up which can then be put into a myriad of different skills and abilities including some special vampire magic that tends to be specific to the vampire clan you select during character creation.\n\nThe vampire clans are on the big highlights of the game with the most notable mentions being Nosferatu who are hideous and unable to pass for a human unlike the other clans and the the Malkavians who are, quite literally, completely and utterly insane. Both of these change the way you play and experience the game significantly and in particular the Malkavian guarantees you will need a second playthrough.\n\nThe main storyline isn't anything tremendously exciting however the smaller side-quests and the world itself is exceptionally well written and acted and you will feel heavily immersed throughout the game.\n\nSource is the engine upon which this is all created which makes for a decent looking game even though it was released a good while after Half-Life 2 due to licensing issues which unfortunately also had the side-effect of absolutely killing the sales of this game and also Troika, the developers.\n\nWhen originally released Bloodlines was extremely bug ridden despite the delay in release and it was nearly unplayable at that point, now however most of the bugs have been patched out and for those few things left unfinished there is a very high quality fan made patch that I recommend everyone gets before playing the game.\n\nAll in all Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines is one of the best games of the modern era and one of the few modern games that manages to pull off a first person view without losing sight of what the game is trying to accomplish. You could classify it as an action RPG or as a first person shooter with some RPG elements but either way, it's a great game.","January 1, 2013","true","153.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","5"

The instructions to do this can be found here.\n\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=229\n\nTalking to people, I cannot pinpoint the reason that some new computers will run it without the fix and some will not.\n\nThis game is old and the people that made it are out of business.  Steam has posted it up here basically "As-Is", without warning us.  While I have the assurance of many Steam users that this game is excellent, I have yet to play it as I haven't felt like jumping through the hoops.\n\nGranted that patching or modding older games to work has been a staple of PC gaming for years, shouldn't we be past that in the age of digital distribution? I am appealing to Steam here, you are the future(some would argue the present) of PC gaming distribution, putting a game for sale that has issues with so many modern computers is step backwards.\n\nThis is the edited version of the review based on input from other users.(you can find my original dissapointment filled review below)\n\n----\n\nThis game crashes as soon as you run it.  If you want, you can follow guides like some kind of treasure map to get it to run but that kind of misses the point of steam.\n\nKnowing the bad press that would come from this, Steam requires a 5 minute play-time minimum before posting a review, so I ran the game and let it crash over and over until i got to 5 minutes.  Hopefully I can reach a few people to spread the message that, instead of buying a fun vampire game, you are being the target of an insidious cash grab.\n\nShame on the game's makers for it not being fixed and shame on Steam for selling it.\n----","April 7, 2014","false","11.1"," 215 of 411 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","215","411","2","21"

You start off by choosing your vampire clan. Each clan has its own set of abilities. Two clans in particular really change the game up: The Malkavians and the nosferatu really play differently from the other clans offering some nice replay value.\n\n+ Lots of stats to further build your character. Play as a melee, stealth, guns, hacking etc.  Build a character that fits your play style\n\n+ The plot and characters are interesting, they really flesh out the story and dialogue.\n\n+ Great main and side missions\n\n+ Multiple ways of completing your missions depending on your character build. Go in guns blazing, or sneak in through the back, etc.\n\n+ A lengthy game that never feels boring or drawn out simply because the developers did a good job of keeping things interesting all the way through.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Technical and texture glitches. The game was officially patched however there were still plenty of bugs left over. You must play with some of the unofficial patches. I was playing with a widescreen mod which may have contributed to all the texture anomalies.\n\n-The combat feels less polished then the rest of the game. Melee combat goes into third person view which could be off putting to some. Using guns can be very frustrating and probably won't be worth it until you invest some heavy experience points into the firearm skill. Guns probably won't be effective until half way through the game.\n\n- Some really annoying parts of the game.  Luckily it was far and few between to really hurt the overall experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nA great game, and if you love RPG's this is a great game that you can't go wrong with. Possibly one of the best vampire games out there.\n","July 14, 2014","true","19.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It just might be the scariest mission in the whole game, and you don't fight a single monster or enemy the whole time.\n5) If you play the game as a Malkavian, your flaw is that you're crazy.

For those who don't want to take the time to figure out how to do this, you'll probably want to avoid purchasing this game.\n\nThat said, if you're comfortable with spending a few minutes finding and installing the unofficial patches, you might find this game interesting. You should probably wait for a deep-cut sale though; $20 for a 10 year old game that barely made it out of production is a little silly.\n\nThe good:\n- Excellent writing (easily the best aspect of the game)\n- Compelling storyline\n- Interesting lore and characters\n- Voice acting is very well done\n- Play as one of seven vampire clans with differing abilities\n- Allows for several different play styles\n- Explore side quests in a non-linear fashion\n- Multiple endings\n\nThe bad:\n- Combat feels very clumsy. The defensive stance in melee combat is essentially worthless. It is difficult to maneuver and avoid being hit by enemy attacks.\n- The game favors melee combat until much later in the game where guns are very powerful. However, since this is an RPG, the player must level up their skills one way or the other. Certain boss encounters are very difficult for players who choose a melee play style.\n- There are stats that are basically worthless to invest in, such as haggling. Lockpicking and hacking can be useful for those in a hurry, but are in most cases not needed since keys and password notes can be found nearby. Other stats such as those used to influence others in dialogue are useful early on in the game, but aren't used at all later on.\n- It is not possible to remain in first-person view at all times. The game forces you into the third-person view when engaging in melee combat. Ranged combat functions like a first person shooter.\n- The player can make many different choices, but there are no diverging story paths. All choices the player makes eventually lead to the same outcome.\n- The graphics aren't terrible, but look quite dated.\n- At times there are graphical glitches or weird physics.","January 19, 2015","true","70.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is easy to be swallowed in to the game by it's rich storyline and a fantasticly written dialogue - but it's not just that. I felt immersed in this game that was able to describe and not only give me an idea of - but also allow me to feel like I was suddenly pulled into a vampire society. Which, judging by the popularity of the vampire genre in video gaming, seems to be something that many games involving vampires have great difficulty with.\nI look forward to the future and hope that the vampire genre can be inspired by this game.\n\nI'll list the pros and cons of this briefly, from my experience.\n\nPros:\n~ Deep and non-linear storyline.\n~ At the start, you can choose your stats or 'roll' them randomly (let the game decide!), and have a choice of clans with their own personality, background, advantages and disadvantages.\n~ Creative and well written dialogue, of which can change depending on chosen clan.\n~ Voice acting that fits well with the characters and enriches their personalities.\n~ Many hours of play filled with many missions and many choices for you to make.\n~ Experience various entertaining kinds of insanity.\n\nCons:\n~ There are bugs. The patch does help with this and is easy to find with a web search. However, it does not eliminate them completely, and this is also to be expected when playing an old game. Personally I wasn't bothered by them, as I was too busy enjoying the storyline.\n~ Combat is funky. This links with the bugs, but don't get me wrong - there are tough fights.\n~ Graphics can be improved with the patch I believe, but are still old. It's not disasterous or unplayable however, by any means - on the contrary, very good for an old game in my opinion.\n~ For some people this will be a con. SAVE OFTEN. Your experience of the game will differ in places depending on the choices you make, and you may want to go back to have a different experience later. And then of course, there's always the possibility of getting shredded up and dying.","April 22, 2015","true","61.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Utilizing the HL2 Source engine, Bloodlines is easily modifiable, and as such many fan made community patches are in circulation around the internet. I highly recommend downloading these patches for a more refined and polished gaming experience (although it is optional as the game is still playable all the way through without said patches). Bloodlines delivers exceptional voice acting, a grim and atmospheric setting, a fantastically agreeable soundtrack, a fair amount of character customization, and at times, a fair amount of role-playing choices, all for a low sum of 20 bucks, and believe me folks - with said amount of issues, it's still very much worth it.","October 8, 2013","true","42.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is another really underrated game that definitely should get more sequels (comeon Activision, I know you have it in your black heart somewhere!)

When you paid for your game up front, with no forking out for DLC or micropayments?  Remember that wonderful thing called an imagination?  You know that thing with which, when you hear a story, your mind constructs an image?\nIf not, you had best get back to Destiny in case you miss out on a fun grinding festival (THIS WEEK ONLY).\n\nOn the other hand, if you miss the old days when you were immersed in the plot of a game without there ever being a monetary catch, take heed.\nThis game invites you into the World of Darkness (WoD) and sets you on a bloody path through vampire society's political intrigue and betrayal.  Imagine a world not unlike our own filled with all manner of supernatural beasts; from vampires to werewolves and demons, WoD has it all.\nChoose Nosferatu and work your way through missions carefully, transiting via the sewers and using vampiric powers to hide your hideous form from the human population.  Feed your inner beast as Gangrel, slaughtering all opposition with deadly claws and inhuman strength.  Or you could charm your way through machination after machination as Toreador or Ventrue.  And so on.\nOn top of this, the semi-linear storyline is enhanced with the faction system.  Choose which side you wish to support - the Brujah and their Anarchists or the Ventrue and their Camarilla.  The possibilities in gameplay will keep you entertained for hours.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game 85%...owing to its age and minor bugs.\n\nThe WoD managed to make vampires cool without turning them into spoilt brats and people seemingly damned to an eternity as angsty teens (a la True Blood/ Twishite) so you should check it out if you're into that sort of thing!\n\n\n","April 22","true","8.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","2"

I actually stood around a radio in this game just to listen to each radio program loop in each game chapter because it was so damn entertaining.  This game is loaded with so much awesome stuff, and the humor in it is great.  It's a shame these guys when out of business, they had the potential to make games as good as anything Bethesda has put out.\n\nA note about all the people complaining about this game needing a patch to run: Of course it does, morons, stop your whining.  This game was made to run on an operating system that's been obsolete for over a decade (and people could argue that Windows ME/2000/XP/etc were garbage when they came out), and the company that made the game was crushed and is long gone, of course you will need to DL a patch to run it.  The good news is that these patches also fix bugs that were originally issues in the game.  So look up and follow the easy to install patches, it's totally worth it (and they are free, so ... yeah).\n\nThis game is also worth multiple play-throughs, which can be hard to find with linear story/plot games.  As each clan (and gender) has some different perks, playing through more than once can be rewarding.  And if you haven't played as a Malkavian (the crazy ones), that is always good for a last play-through for the whole game.\n\nGreat for any fan of Vampire the Masquerade, great for any vampire genre fan, great for any FP/RPG game lover.\nI played this a LONG time ago, and playing again now is just as fun, and it is still an impressive game.

It's based off a tabletop RPG called Vampire: The Masquerade by White Wolf Publishing.\nIt's set in Los Angeles by night where the player controls their own vampire. There are seven clans to choose from and each has their own "thing". There's a clan which focuses on art, one that speaks in riddles, one that lurks in the shadows etc (Also adds replayability!). The PC is sadly not customisable, but it's possible to play as female or male. Gender doesn't have a very big impact on the game, but it affects NPC interaction a couple of times.\nThere's also some crazy ♥♥♥♥ going down in game. I won't be going into too much details but it can be kinda scary sometimes. Also there will be gore, sex and even a snuff movie. And maybe about two jump scares.\nBUT WAIT. Luckily there's a console in case you really don't want to/can't do something. Hooray!\n\nThere's no such game as levels in the game. Like a real RPG, there's a character sheet and you can upgrade your abilities by spending experience, which you get from completing quests.\nQuesting is fairly fun in this game. There's no such thing as mindless farming! The first challenge is getting the quest, through picking the right dialogue. In some cases, if you pick the wrong dialogue you're missing out on quests and thus, experience.\nQuests can be completed in different manners. You can either kill everything, stealth and in some cases just with dialogue, which is nice for the lazy people among us. Sometimes it affects the experience gain though. (For example, getting 3 XP instead of 2 if you aren't seen).\nCombat is decent-ish, but at least you can switch between first- and third-person perspective.\n\nThe game isn't sandbox, but there are a few hubs you can go to as you progress through the game. You can travel as much as you want, as you have your personal vampire cabdriver! Awesome!\nNPCs are all voiced and depending on the clan, even the whispers in your PCs head too! Isn't that fun, you'll never be lonely again! Anyway, it kinda adds to the already dark atmosphere of the game.\nAnd unlike a lot of games, choices DO matter, throughout the whole game. If you aren't nice to someone, you might miss out on a quest/experience/ending.\n\nThe downside is that combat becomes more important as you get closer to the ending. This is probably because the developers were in a rush to finish the game. The vanilla game has some game-breaking bugs even, but if you use a patch by Wesp the game is definitely play-able.\nThere are also a lot of loading screens. Fortunately, loading times aren't long.\n\nTrue, it's not a game for everyone. But what game is? BUT. IN THIS GAME...\nYou'll meet fellow vampires, werewolves, ghosts, zombies and humans!\nYou can be nice, sarcastic, or really mean!\nYour vampire can dance just as good as you can!\nAlso you can make people explode so their blood is everywhere. Did I mention that? 'Cause that's cool you know.\n\nFor a rushed game from 2004, it has a lot of mods and some even revamp whole game mechanics. So I guess it's kinda hard to get bored of it.\nTen years and going strong!","November 7, 2014","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Despite a loyal, yet small fanbase creating unnoficial patches to fix the bugs found in the game, it still has a lot to be fixed. The game works on the early Source engine, so it uses to base code for Half Life 2, but the development cycle took different paths from the very beggining. The most notable feature of this RPG in particular is the fact that Experience isn't gained for kiling enemies, but for completing quests or finding alternate or special routes to them. That makes it a lot more that a run & gun game. This is - a true Role Playing Game.\n\n\nEven though this game came out in 2001 it i still by far my favorite RPG and no matter how many times I play it I always want to go back for more. I definitely reccomend this game.","September 3, 2013","true","58.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It had earned a rather nasty reputation over the years but it was on sale and I decided to try it out. It was a decision I would not regret.\n\nGraphics 5/10 - The graphics in this game have not aged well to say the least but don't let that discourage you. If you can look past the dated appearance of the game you will find plenty to enjoy.\n\nSound 9/10 - The sound design in this game is fantastic. Although the sound effects can lack impact at times, the soundtrack really sets the mood for the world of darkness. More then once I found my heart racing in anticipation over what would be around the next corner. Play the haunted house level in this game and you will know what I mean (very atmospheric!).\n\nLevel Design 7/10 - With the exception of the games main huds, the levels in this game are all pretty linear. It would have been nice if the game gave more alternate routes to your destinations, Deus Ex style. It does indeed do that at times if you keep an eye open for them (or your investigate skill is high enough) but such events are few and far between. Despite this though, I never felt bored on my first playthrough.\n\nStory 9/10 - The story in the game is masterfully woven. I found myself constantly thinking about who I should trust and distrust. In one case you can discover a potential allies true motivations before the end of the game and tell them to go to hell but with the others you have to take a leap of faith and hope your instincts are on the ball. This adds a level of uncertainty to your actions as you feel more and more like a diposable pawn with no will of your own, surrounded by master manipulators who wish to use your skills for their own gain and then toss you aside like yesterdays news.\n\nQuests 10/10 - The quests in this game really shine. Investigate and evil cult, track down a supernatural serial killer or take down a group of famous vampire hunters. This game really keeps your interest by giving you well written quests that are not only entertaining, but also give you the feeling that you are making this dark world a better place with each step you take.\n\nBugs Presence 2/10 - When this game was released it had a ton of bugs since Activision rushed it to market. However, there is an unofficial patch for this game - which is still being updated - that removes nearly all of these issues and then some. It also adds plenty of new content into the game so I would HIGHLY recommend it. In fact, I've heard it's pretty much essential since this game can't run really well on modern operating systems without it, which makes perfect sense given the games age. There are still some minor bugs present, sometimes I would have difficulty climbing a certain set of stairs or would partially clipp through a wall but these instances are minor and quite rare so they were never an impediment for me.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth a purchase. I've played through it several times with different clans and enjoyed it every single time. At only 20 bucks you certainly can't go wrong. Hopefully, someday we will get a sequel to this game, with all the potential on display I can only hope for a sequel. The MMO was a bust but I will remain hopeful for the future of this franchise.","July 5, 2014","true","170.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its a dark and gritty world where their are no good guys, just different degrees of evil ones.

Unfortunately, this was also the release date of Valve Softwares magnum opus, Half-Life 2. Vampire, like Half-Life 2, made excellent use of the Source Engine developed by Valve. However, since this game was using the brand new Source Engine, it was not allowed to release before Half-Life 2. This alone made Activison decide to "crack the whip" at Troika and push the release date to that of Half-Life 2. Ultimately, this lead to the game being riddled with bugs at release.  Troika, unable to find funding, laid off all of it's employees in several waves over time. Despite this, several employees developed a patch for the game without pay. Three weeks after the games release patch 1.2 released and official support of the game was shuttered. Despite this, even nearly ten years later, this game is still supported by fan patches developed by Wesp5. This review is written based on experiences with fan patch 9.0\n\nVampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines is a video game translation of White Wolf Publishings table top rpg, Vampire: The Masquerade. By translation, I mean this in an almost litteral sense. The game mimics the table top rpgs systems exceedingly well, right down to the way the character sheet works. You are actively encouraged through out the game to actually play your role in the twisted tale that is woven for you.\n\nHumanity, or the lack thereof, is one of the key features in the game. Can you (your character) pretend to still be human, integrating yourself into society, while being a Vampire. Killing an innocent on the streets will make you lose a humanity point, further driving home the fact that you are a supernatural beast. Lose too many humanity points and you may frenzy if you run out of the games main resource, blood. Going into a frenzy unleashes the savage beast within you, temporarily causing you to lose all control of your character. One of the other key elements of the game, The Masquerade, challanges you to act human. If anyone sees you doing anything that a Vampire normally would do (using magick, feeding on an npc, etc,) you lose a Masquerade point. Losing these is an astoundingly bad thing. Did that Npc see you feeding on a bum? Yep, and they ran to the cops, you my friend are now being hunted. Sure, losing one point only gets the police on your tail, they are nothing compared to you, you're a damn vampire. But, begin losing more (up to six) and you will have Hunters (one of the games antagonists) or even other vampires after you. The systems from the table top RPG are translated so well into the game it is astounding.\n\nSo, I just explained some of the systems in the game, while that is all well and good, an rpg would be nothing without a good story and good mechanics to tell it to you. You begin the game with a questionaire of all things. This decides which Vampire clan you will play as. Will you be a melee powerhouse Bruhaj, or will you be a magick centric Tremere? Maybe a stealthy Nosferatu, or the absolutely (literally) insane Malkavian. After a thorough quizzing and assigning points to your character sheet the game begins. Your character is in the throws of passion with a vampire from which ever clan you picked (or were assigned) from the questionaire. You are turned, and are essentially born anew as a vampire.\n\nI will be absolutely honest here, this game, it has some of the finest writing, and voice acting, I have ever encountered. I really have to commend Troika for the stellar cast they gathered. A few examples of the voice actors in the game are, Steve Blum (Cowboy Bebop), John DiMaggio (Futurama, Adventure Time), Phil LaMarr (Pulp Fiction, Samurai Jack) and Kathryn Cressida (Tarzan, Dexters Laboratory). All of the voice actors do a phenomenal job of playing the characters they were assigned, you actually believe these characters are apart of a living, breathing, world. The entire game feels as if it is alive. Bums wander the streets of LA, hookers propisition you, cops make your life hell and get in the way. Even politics play a roll in this game.\n\nSo, the story, is not just a story about your character, it's about the world of Vampire: The Masquerade. From the charismatic leader of the Camarilla, to the "all too happy to be a vampire" Smiling Jack, Troika crafted a story that not only grabs you, but makes you care about what is going on. I don't want to spoil anything of the story, even giving cliff notes of it would be doing a disservice to the reader. This story is one you must truly experience for yourself.\n\nThe gameplay of Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines may seem familiar at times, after all, this is a story driven RPG. You can play in first or third person, but I recommend a healthy mix of two. While first person mode takes away a good bit of perephrial vision, it makes the experience all the more personal. Speaking to npcs, you are given fully voiced and written dialog, with (for current times) pretty standard RPG choices. Depending on how your character is developed, you can get special dialog in the form of persuasion, intimidation, and even mind control. While it doesn't seem like anything really special now-a-days, back in 2004, this was pretty damn spectacular. The combat, to be honest, is the weakest part of this game. I am by no means, putting the combat down, it is a fully functional, working combat system, that, at sometimes, is a little bit wonky. Transitioning from first person gameplay to third person, at first, is a little jarring, especially if you're fighting with a melee weapon and casting certain spells. Doing this, the game keeps jumping back and forth between third and first person view, and can make combat a little more difficult than it should be. The only black mark that I can find that makes the game even slightly frustrating is the slight bit of downtime you have when casting spells during combat while using a gun. If you're trying to fight enemies while using a firearm and casting spells, the game delays you being able to shoot, reload, or even cast a different spell. This kinda breaks the immersion of the game at times, because it makes fighting certain enemies incredibly frustrating, more than once I had to take a break from playing because fighting the same foe for twenty minutes was grating on my nerves. (Though, this is a slight disclaimer, I was playing a Tremere, the heavy magick using class.)\n\nThere is still so much I can say about this game, but, I don't want the review to be exceedingly long. Yes I wanted to be thorough, but, all I really want to say is that Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines, with the fan patch 9.0, is an absolutely astounding game. The patch, in addition to making it work on Windows 7 and 8, actually adds back in some content that was missing from the base game. I really have to give it to Wesp5, he really has brought this game back out of the shadows and gotten it the attention it deserves. I cannot recommend this game enough, it is truly, one of the finest games I have played in ages.\n\nI give Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines a 9.5 out of 10. The wonderful story, voice acting, and general gameplay make this an absolute treat.","April 27, 2014","true","46.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Some terms and ideas still exist, but the very feel of the world and the themes of the game are wholly different. They've switched from the advertised "gothic-punk" atmosphere (a term the company itself uses to describe the old setting) to a more supernatural mystery/thriller feel.\n\nEven if you don't intend to play the tabletop game, this is still one of my favorite RPGs, period.

I played it back when it first came out in 2004. It is now several years old but has held up very well.\n\nIn the game you start out with a somewhat lengthy cutscene which gives you an idea of the society you now belong to as a new vampire or childe. You are then released into a somewhat open world to begin your undead life as pretty much everyone's errand person. Your style of play will obviously depend on what clan you chose at the beginning. Whether you are a fighting brujah, beastly gangrel, squishy tremere, smooth toreador, snooty ventrue, crazy malkavian, or *shudders* disgusting nosferatu; you will find plenty to fight in the perpetual darkness.\n\nThis game has decent graphics (especially considering its age), great dialogue, believeable characters (and some pretty wild ones too), monsters (other than vampires), plenty of seduction, AWESOME music (seriously though... this game introduced me to several artists that I had never heard of that I still listen to til ths day), and an overall decent and interesting story. One word of advice... explore the cities and talk to everyone... multiple times. There are many interesting side quests that you can easily miss!\n\nIt has a few glitches that can sometimes occur in unpatched versions. Only thing I dislike about this game is how many autoaves it produces. It creates a new autosave every time instead of simply rewriting the autosave file. This feature cannot be turned off as far as I am aware. Periodically you will need to go through and clean up the older autosaves.","March 31","true","37.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Be warned right now though you will want a unoffical patch as Troika Games is no longer around and it does have some bugs. Also when it says mature 17+ it means it.\n\nYou play the role of a fledgling vampire from the world of whitewolf. Its a dark and gritty world where their are no good guys, just different degrees of evil ones. You will choose from one of seven differnt clans (clans are differnt bloodlines of vampires each with their own quirks and perks) that lead to a very differnt type of game on multiple play threws.\n\nCombat is not the smoothest and the graphics are a bit dated. However the voice acting is superb the atmosphere is a increadible 11/10 as well. Depending on how you spend your EXP points on various skill and what type of vampire clan you are the base game can play very differntly from one play threw to another. Also features a 5 ending setup (although some endings arnt as varied as what you would think) leaving the game open to some replayability even at the ending.\n\nOverall i would give this game a 10/10 even with its problems and age.","November 27, 2013","true","55.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think during the entire play through I had less than half a dozen crashes. I found this to be pretty impressive considering I couldn't even launch the game after installation.\n\nOk, so if you've bought the game and installed the 9.2 patch, the next step is to mod your female character to look like Jeanette or Velvet Velour ;)\n\nOn to the game!\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines sounds like a sequel and there was a game before it, but it starts fresh and doesn't seem to carry any baggage from the previous game. You play with roleplaying-style skill points which increase as you buy into the higher levels. Your skills range from melee, to stealth, to guns, to computer hacking, and everything in between!\n\nWhen creating your character you choose between male and female, and then one of many different families. These families give you your vampire powers, like terrifying presence, or moving in super speed.\n\nYour job as a newly converted vampire is to do the will of your Prince and leader. During your missions you'll meet so many creative and unique characters. The world you're put into is just so unique and enjoyable from everything else out there right now, it's really hard to describe how this game's story was.\n\nBottom Line: Get this game. If you like great stories and/or role-playing games, then this is a gem I had missed for years and I wouldn't want any of you to miss it any longer.","March 9, 2015","true","27.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But let me tell you, this game has no glittering pretty boys. It's a true painting of what the modern vampire should be- they walk among us in society because they look like us, often using their intelligence and sex appeal to feed and maintain their powers. The game largely focuses on the politics within vampire society known as The Masquerade- it's this web of politics that sends you off on several quests where, depending on how you've chosen to level your character and converse in dialogue with NPCs can play out very differently.\nThe side quests are also very compelling. And I'm usually incredibly disinterested in these- the lore and the characters are all just so well written it made me want to explore the game more.\n\nIf you're looking for an obscure gem, excellent writing, unique atmosphere, or just tired of seeing Vampires suck ♥♥♥ like they have been in recent years this game is up your alley.","December 17, 2014","true","44.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game offers you a selection of clans to play that each offer their own powers and weaknesses to take into account. An FPS with a touch of RPG elements, you'll gain experience over time to invest into a variety of skills and powers to upgrade and master.  There really is no wrong way to play this game, talking and sneaking through most if not entire levels is just as valid as rampaging through with guns and blades provided you have the skills and ability to back it up.  Your dialouge options can vary from clan to clan along with what abilities you can use to manipulate others, which further provides an incentive to replay this game multiple times with different skills and powers to see what other actions play out.\n\nMelee combat switches you to third person giving you a better range of vision as you block, evade, and strike enemies; while ranged fighting allows you to switch to third but also first person for making those more carefully aimed shots.  The stealth mechanic is pretty simple, just crouch and stay around dark areas.  Your stealth skill makes you harder to be spotted and if you get behind someone without notice you can instant kill.\n\nBlood is your source to power abilities and help keep you from frenzying (losing control of yourself), so getting blood is crucial.  You could get it from someone will like a person you charmed at a bar or hire an escort, you could buy bags of blood from some who are willing to sell, or you could even take it from combatents you fight by grappling to overpower them. The options you take are up to you.\n\nBloodlines also has its share of a few bugs and hiccups for which I recomend you look into the unofficial patch fix which remedies that.  Without spoiling anything, the story is nicely done and definitely worth the playthrough.","November 27, 2015","true","52.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I played it back when it first came out in 2004. It is now several years old but has held up very well.\n\nIn the game you start out with a somewhat lengthy cutscene which gives you an idea of the society you now belong to as a new vampire or childe. You are then released into a somewhat open world to begin your undead life as pretty much everyone's errand person. Your style of play will obviously depend on what clan you chose at the beginning. Whether you are a fighting brujah, beastly gangrel, squishy tremere, smooth toreador, snooty ventrue, crazy malkavian, or *shudders* disgusting nosferatu; you will find plenty to fight in the perpetual darkness.\n\nThis game has decent graphics (especially considering its age), great dialogue, believeable characters (and some pretty wild ones too), monsters (other than vampires), plenty of seduction, AWESOME music (seriously though... this game introduced me to several artists that I had never heard of that I still listen to til ths day), and an overall decent and interesting story. One word of advice... explore the cities and talk to everyone... multiple times. There are many interesting side quests that you can easily miss!\n\nIt has a few glitches that can sometimes occur in unpatched versions. Only thing I dislike about this game is how many autoaves it produces. It creates a new autosave every time instead of simply rewriting the autosave file. This feature cannot be turned off as far as I am aware. Periodically you will need to go through and clean up the older autosaves.","March 31","true","37.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/czeekykunt/recommended/2600/","czeekykunt","Holier Than Thou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/czeekykunt/","126 products in account","EDIT: Price gripe in the concluding thoughts.\nI don't believe that vampires have been represented in a more interesting way than in this video game. Well, technically a video game based off of a popular table-top RPG known as the World of Darkness containing multiple settings, and one well known one called Vampire the Masquerade. It is essentially vampires trying to conceal their power and blend in with society. Bloodlines is set in early 21st century Southern California with a Gothic and punk combination. Combine all of that with a cast of eccentric and intriguing characters, and a moody, ominous soundtrack you get probably one of the best worlds of any aRPG to date.\n\nStory\nA very interesting one for sure. First off, this whole game supposedly takes place soon before Gehenna, a.k.a. The Final Nights. Anyway, with that on your mind you might think, "What's the ♥♥♥♥ing point?" when you see the rest of the story. WARNING: Minor spoilers may be ahead. So you start as a freshly embraced (fledgling) Kindred (vampire). This was against the rules of Prince LaCrotch and so he gives your little friend the final death (you're undead, get it?). Anyway, he decides for you to do chores for him and so you travel all over SoCal doing very odd jobs for vamps and humies alike. The quests are all unique and well crafted, integrating your favorites supernatural beings into your objectives. They aren't all so kind to you of course, so you must use your skills in punching, slashing, shooting, and whatever disciplines your clan has their disposal. The quests may involve helping a girl get revenge on a shark man, defending Hollywood from zombie movie stars, preventing werewolf blood from falling into the hands of the medical clinic, or massacreing the local Russian mob for a bartender of a church turned nightclub. Be sure to talk to everyone, because you never know who might have something fun for you to do.\n\nCharacters\nA definite strong point of this game. The PC creation is very in depth in terms of stats, not looks. You choose male or female, and then you choose from one of seven clans of the Camarilla (the "good guy" vampire sect), the Ventrue, the Tremere, the Toreador, the Malkavians, the Gangrel, the Nosferatu, and the Brujah. They are known for the following (respectively): leading, blood magic, being beautiful, being insane (the silly kind and the edgy kind), transforming into wild beasts (or controlling them), sneaking and being ugly as hell, and fighting the man. The stat menu is very similar to WoD, as you have five dots to fill in with xp that affect your various feats of fighting, mentality, being covert, and soaking damage. I'll get to disciplines later; now that's the good stuff. The NPCs are some of the coolest in any RPG. The ones with no dialogue who saunter along the street are all copy and paste for the most part, but that's due to time constraints. The unique ones are all fun in their own special ways. Except for the Sheriff, the prince's assistant. He has no dialogue and is a huge buzzkill. The prince himself claimed domain for the Camarilla over SoCal, even though the Anarchs who hate them previously owned the place for vamp society. He is a huge ♥♥♥♥ and doesn't really deserve a good unlife. Sorry prince, but it's true. The rest of the Cammy members are cool though. There's a sensual stripper who loves when you assist her. NOT IN THAT WAY, VAMPS DON'T DO PEE PEE FRICTION. Uh... yeah, anyway, there's a crude Nosferatu who likes to insult everyone! There's also a Tzimisce (fleshcrafter) who is very amusing to listen to for his accent and description of how much he gets use out of flesh. Best of all, you get to listen to the radio show known as the Deb of Night, well that's more the lady who runs it, but she and her disturbed late night listeners are wonderful to open your ears to when you decide it's time for your Kindred to wind down for the morning. Also, the poster girl for the game, Jeanette Voerman, is voiced by the famous Grey DeLisle. A lot of characters can be used for blood or money or blood money and some can be influenced or have their minds broken into in many ways. It always pays off to break a man down with your undead influence... or just take some of his blood and then shoot him.\n\nGameplay\nSo many ways to play... what to do... OH YEAH! Play it four+ times like I did. Even in vanilla you could play it through seven times and still be happy because each clan with their bonuses, restrictions, and disciplines provides many hours of satisfying gameplay. You could be an axe murderer, a gun nut magician who plays with other's red essence, or just sneak everywhere if you don't prefer conflict. You can even use your good looks to woo NPCs into giving you info. or money (and then run away if they aren't impressed). By the way, there's a discipline for running. It's called Celerity. Other disciplines include: Thaumaturgy, the blood magic, Animalism, control over armies of spectral animals, Fortitude, a glowing shield, Dementation, become insane temporarily, Dominate, which allows full control over one's mind, and Presence, which is, "Listen to me I'm beautiful so do what I say". Some even change your appearance like becoming invisible with Obfuscate or turning into super wolf-bat man with Protean. There's also Auspex which improves some Mental feats temporarily, and one that everybody has through Strength called Blood Buff. You must feed on everyone's favorite Hawaiian Punch to keep yourself looking beautiful (unless you are a Nossie) and to be able to use these powers. You can feed on basically any human you want, just be careful because if anyone else sees, you'll violate the rules of the Masquerade and if you drain 'em dry you'll lose Humanity, making you go ravenous and beastly. Violate the Masq and you'll get your little head chopped off. When working within combat zones or supernatural infested areas, just do whatever the hell you want. You can find a lot of neat artifacts from vampires that will buff your stats as long as you don't say, "Eww, creepy" and sell them. A lot of creepy eldritch talismans combined with the Information Age in Southern California totally works. It does. Trust me. I'd say the only thing that plagues the game is the somewhat mediocre, but still servicable gunplay (it ties into your stats heavily though which is good for that old RPG style) and also the bugs. More bugs than a busy beehive. It is understandable since the game was rushed towards the end due to the acquisition of the WoD game rights by another company. It still requires an unofficial patch to get working on modern systems, but it isn't a big download so look it up if you want to play. Just play this game. You need to.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\nThis game is worth the money when it goes on sale as the game has been acquired by a better studio and is again one of the greatest aRPGs in recent memory, for me at least. The general atmosphere and interesting gameplay, plus the characters and their amazing facial animations (seriously, what the hell the rest of the body animations are wonky as hell and the clothing acts wild on the body models during some cutscenes, but the facial animations and models are near perfect). It is easily the best Source engine debut game from 2004 and that is all the more reason to check it out. I would honestly recommend only waiting until it's on sale for about five bucks unless you are die hard fan because while it is wonderful, it is quite buggy and dated and that would be a better use of your money. This is not to say it doesn't deserve every penny it got, just that there are much more modern games with equal amounts of content for the same price or lower. Do ya get me? Oh yeah, and you can dance. Enough said.","March 19","true","103.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Swinton/recommended/2600/","Swinton","~Swinton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Swinton/","398 products in account","As true a diamond in the rough as any game you can find here. Well, well worth the time of anyone who's interested in RPGs, arcane / urban / supernatural horror atmosphere, good writing in games or good plotting in gaming. If this is on sale you're cheating yourself if you don't give it a go.\n\nThe premise in a nutshell: Your character goes on a bender and ends up dead, then undead. Saved from certain (final) death, you end up an investigator / fixer for a secret shadow society of urbane monsters, chasing down all sorts of weird happenings in and around nighttime Los Angeles. Talk, fight, and use your monstrous powers to manipulate or destroy hapless mortals and other, less redeemable things.\n\nLet's start with the good: The plotting, writing, atmosphere are all simply amazing. From the marketing materials and screenshots you might assume the game is grim and gritty and oh-so-goth, but the game is, for the most part, incredibly funny. Think Deadpool or Garth Ennis' comics - there's a lot of black humor. Most everybody is dead and loving it. And it's not possible to say enough about how incredible the voice talent cast is, with a small handful of exceptions. Yes, that's Bender showing you the vampiric ropes in the tutorial. If the premise seems ridiculous at first, the game will sell  you on it. The central mystery is really good and the sense of dread builds perfectly.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is great - much like Deus Ex, it makes the most of being set entirely at night. There is a definite sense of traversing the city of angels' seedy underbelly - while the rest of the world's sleeping, all the weirdos and club kids and dirty cops and streetwalkers come out to play. If you look hard enough you'll find not just other vampires but stranger, more sinister, and inexplicable things preying on humans. the original soundtrack is very good and mostly trip-hop influencedm and the licensed soundtrack (mostly playing in clubs) is, well... It's subpar goth metal, for the most part, but all the files are in .mp3 format so you can switch them out for whatever you want.*\n\nThe narrative is composed of several story strands and subplots but is structured in "hubs and spokes" - think Hell's Kitchen in Deus Ex or Omega Station in Mass Effect 2. Each city center (there are four) is a large street-level area, thick with opportunities to take on new quests, pick fights, steal money or blood.\n\nAs with any classic RPG, you have stats, skills and powers that you level up (note that experience is given on quest completion, not upon killing ♥♥♥♥ - it's just as viable, and probably more fun, to play a stealthy character). There are no classes but you do choose a "clan", sort of a vampiric race. One thing you'll constantly hear people rave about with this game is how different the game can get based on this choice - most are interchangeable (save for the powers given clans are allowed) but the Malkavians are marked by insanity, and so every single line of dialogue you can give in the game is rewritten as a bizarre riddle (it's fun to talk to NPCs as they try to make sense of you). Nosferatu, on the other hand, are clearly monstrous, and so most every human you interact with will freak out, if they assume you're not a burn victim or wearing a costume.\n\nFighting gameplay is fairly good, though hardly exceptional. This came out before the advent of cover-based shooting so it may take some getting used to. Guns kind of suck unless you really know what you're doing. Melee can be fun but can also drag. Using your powers is always fun, you just have to watch your blood level (basically mana) - invest in the "brawling skill" so that you drain enemy blood in the middle of combat. Sneaking is pretty satisfying and intuitive.\n\nThe visuals are pretty fugly, and the animations in gameplay are bit janky, with the very notable exception of the dialogue animations - Troika took full advantage of the rigging potential of the then-young Source Engine (V:tmB rather infamously released on the same day as Half-Life 2, to its detriment) and as a result the conversations hold up to this day- it's crazy to go from this to, say, Mass Effect and marvel how much more expressive NPCs are here.\n\nBloodlines has its warts - Chinatown is full of caricatures, the lack of polish over the whole product is stupendously evident and a community patch is more or less essential to play the game to its fullest - but believe me when I tell you that there is no other game like this. When it gets its hooks in you, you'll play it to the end, and when it's over you'll wish you could spend more time exploring its strange, sinister world.\n\n* If you're going to do this, wipe all the ID2 tags from the file through Windows or Audacity before you insert them in, otherwise the game will freak out and crash.","April 16","true","63.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is a buggy mess, but thankfully fans have patched out a lot of the bugs so make sure to get the Wesp fan patch before you play. To sum it up Bloodlines has some of the best atmosphere, writing, and actual roleplaying in an RPG and it still really holds up to this day. There's multiple solutions through missions and each vampire clan have their own unique skills to solve them, i.e. Nosferatu can turn themselves invisible, Tremere have powerful blood magic, and Malkavians can drive people insane. Sadly, the game falls apart in the end with some horrid forced combat sections (So make sure you have a good combat build going, though just cheating through it is totally fine) but it ultimately is a game worth playing because there are still way too few RPGs that are like it.","April 23, 2014","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm not sure if they are as active now but none-the-less they have made some.\n\nIf you can get passed some of the games clunky mechanics and dated graphics; I'd highly suggest buying at such a low price.\n\nEspecially if you are a Vampire and overall supernatural game fan. These are your Ann Rice vampires...Not teeny boppers. Many of them being lustful, sadistic and all the other things you'd expect from people who have lived for 100's if not thousands of years.\n\nThe great thing is that you start as a human in the intro sequence. Bitten by either a guy or girl you just slept with (it depends on your choice of male or female).\n\nYou're then thrown into the political world of Vampire: The Masquerade. The factions all held together by what would seem to be one man who is a corporate CEO and also a Vampire.\n\nYou quickly learn of the society that they protect from the outside world. A society they protect by means of absolute and brutal violence if their common laws are broken.\n\nThe most interesting aspect is your choice of character. They range from a high-class, posh and political faction (affecting your characters stats) to a more brutish, borderline anarchist faction. Also; quite possibly my favorite overall are a type of psychic vampires that can often predict the future in pieces. Your dialog reflects it even...The great part about them being that they can barely piece together a sentence that isn't nearly a riddle or pscho-babble.\n\nIt adds high replay value. Just with the character choices and your possible responses.\n\nI'd give the game a solid 8/10 at it's state now. On release it was more buggy and almost unplayable at times. But now with the mods and bug fixes thrown in; it's a lot of fun.\n\nDon't pass up a gem like this (albeit a rough one at times). It's good for at least one solid and satifying playthrough.","November 2, 2013","true","343.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And I'm both happy and sad about it.\n\nHappy\nThis game is fun, engrossing, interesting and at times a little creepy.  The setting, SoCal, becomes as much a character as any of the off the wall kindred or kine you meet.  To me, I can't get enough open world games set in present day cities, and this has to be one of the more quirky and shady settings that I've played in recent years.\n\nThe gameplay isn't as polished as a game like Deus Ex, but not many games are.  If you get past the dated graphics / character design and the not-so-great combat mechanics, you'll be able to enjoy a big world that has a lot to offer, filled with funny and odd characters throughout.\n\nIt's one of those games that after you beat it, you look forward to the next play through a year down the road.  There are a handful of different clans to play as (which can really change the way you play), but as most people suggest, save the Malkavian clan for your 2nd play through for when you already understand the story.\n\nSad\nAfter you get into the game, learning the basics of the Lore that VtmB has developed over the years, you're bound to want more.  And I want so much more.  This game couldn't be big enough.  I want more chapters, more missions, more locations to explore.  More dangerous encounters.  Hell, take this engine to New York or Chicago or London.  Tell more stories using the already rich World of Darkness universe.\n\nThe huge problem with all this is that there hasn't been another video game in the Vampire: The Masquerade (or even World of Darkness) universe since this game; 2004.  With so much dense material to create a story with, it's surprising that it hasn't happened.  I'm not sure I would've been interested in the MMO that got canceled earlier this year, but it would've been better than nothing.\n\nTL;DR - If you want a game that you can take your time exploring, a game that gives you the freedom to go about completing parts of the story the way you want, and don't mind Vampires as a means of telling a story, then please, get this game.\n\nWarning:  Patch this game with the unoffical patch.  It may take awhile, but it's necessary.","December 22, 2014","true","67.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

My main concern was that I couldn't be impartial.  I love the World of Darkness games, and was seriously worried that despite the many recommendations this game has recieved, I couldn't help but be disappointed.\n\nI was not disappointed.\n\nTruely, I felt as if I were in the World of Darkness.  The game is a little crowded with WoD lore, but it was fun to see a little bit of everything from hunters to hengeyokai.  The leveling system is almost straight out of the WoD role playing system, which made it easy for me to know what was going on right away.\nThe game's controls never got in the way of gameplay, but sometimes the camera would get a bit confused when crawling through sewage tunnels.  It was all worth it though.  The first time I let loose with Celerity 5 in a room full of ninjas, all was forgiven.\n\nI've seen a lot of mention of issues getting the game to run well on Windows 7, but I had no real trouble.  I did get the "not enough RAM" error, but going in and changing the compatibility to XPsp2 fixed that right away.\n\nAll in all, this is a fun action RPG.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatassistoostrong/recommended/2600/","thatassistoostrong","Testicle Bag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatassistoostrong/","51 products in account","Alright, for real though, this is a game that has aged very well. It was a golden RPG for 2004, and today is still Golden. With Troika dead, and before Paradox bought out the rights to White Wolf and WOD, CCP didn't do crap with this series including updates, letting other people remaster it, etc. Luckily this game still has a somewhat active, but small, community, and came out with amazing patches even after a decade of death and silence. There was a project to remake/remaster the game called Project Vaulderie, but unfortunately it got shut down by CCP even though CCP had been doing nothing besides working on Eve Online.\nThe best:\n-The music is A1. Introduced me to some good gothic metal bands, and the soundtracks for a lot of the hubs are very pleasing.\n-The dialogue is hilarious most of the time, and it changes depending on what clan you are.\n-While there was some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting, there was also a lot of good voice acting from well known voice actors.\n-Clans: There are several you get to choose from, each one has its own special abilities, appearance, and ways you run through the game.\n-There is no leveling up, you gain experience points and then assign those earned experience points to certain skills you want to increase, which is a simple and nice.\n-Kind of has it's own karma system to put it basically, you kill innocents, you lose humanity, you lose all your humanity, you go into a frenzy which isn't always the prettiest. So most of the time you have to be conscious of your actions.\n-The atmosphere was greatly crafted; to be a dark gothic setting. Everything is eerie, not especially scary, but eerie and dark really no matter where you are.\n-You get to dance like a maniac.\n-You get paid good for a lot of quests.\n-A ♥♥♥♥♥ON of lore.\nThe Bad: A lot of this can be excused because of the time it was released, but still mentioning,\n-The map is absolutely tiny. There are only 4 hubs you can go to, which all are pretty damn small and will take you like 10 minutes to run through all the buildings.\n-The bugs. Of course, this has to do with the state it was released in, problems with the devs and Valve, etc. But if you don't install the patch that was wonderfully made by fans, then you're going to have a hard time playing because this game is bug heaven.\n-A lot of the NPCs are the same, there's probably like 5-7 differen't types of NPCS in one city, with 3-4 repeats.\n-The AI is awful. You can have a decent sneak level and be crouching in front of a group of cops that are on a hunt for you and they wouldn't see you.\n-The game is fairly short. I think the first time I played this I completed the main and side quests within at least 14 hours.\n-You don't really get a choice in who you side with. Throughout the game, you are working for LaCroix no matter if you don't like him, but at the end you do indeed get a decision.\n-You can't really replay this game much differently than a last playthrough mainly because in terms of storyline, there isn't too much you can choose differently, besides minor decisions.\n-It really doesn't show too much or hint at the enormous amount of lore the WOD and VtM series has. The first time I played this I had no idea that there was a crap ton of books belonging to this series. But luckily, once I found out, I bought all of them.\n-Because the environment is small and all the work went into the quests, you really can't do much in terms of just exploring. There's not much to interact with.\n-LOOT. There is rarely any loot throughout the entire game. Which any loot you find is sold for dirt cheap and you get barely any $$$.\n\nOverall, a lot of the flaws of this game I can look past because of the age. Lets all hope Paradox does a good job dealing with this series, because it can either go absolutely horribly or incredibly wonderful. And lets hope they don't make a MMO.","March 11","true","63.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It belongs to a good RPG, horor (creepy kind of horor, no jumpscares) and belive me or not, even the comedy genre. It haves a huge replay value since you have multiple kind of Vampires (clans) you can play as, and they are all different. The biggest spotlight get the caln Malcavian and Nosferatu.\nMalcavians because their dialoge options are completly different,  they are all completly insane not to mention speaking to the STOP sign and news reporter over TV, xD.\nNosferatu because of their ugliness you will get a lot of hilarious reactions from NPCs but the penalty for it is you wont be able to do some quests. Technicly, Nosferatu are like the HARD mode for this game.\nIt haves a many endings so watch the story and try to make good desicions!\nAnd just to mention this is NOT the Twilight teen Vampire ♥♥♥♥, this is some serious Vampire ♥♥♥♥. Now that's done here's the Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n-Replay value\n-Very fun combat mecanics\n-Mucis makes the creepy dark atmosphere even more better.\n-Very interesting and special side quests\n-Main story is greeat\n-RPG part is very well made\n-Vampiric powers are awesome and very helpfull and different for every Clan\n-Characters are interesting\n-I never saw better dialoge options in any video game i ever played in my life and i played them a lot. The cool thing is that every character makes deep facial exsprecions for every sentance they say.\n-Cool easter eggs\n-and other....\n\nCons:\n-Otdated graphics (2003)\n-Random NPC are same in every place ( i once saw 5 women looking exacly the same o-o)\n-Combat music is very repetitive (but you can get used to it)\n-Bugs, since game was rushed.\n-You'll find your self going on internet so see some solutions for quests, since some quests get you more exsperience if you beat them on different way, hidden treasures ect.\n-Needs the unoficial patch, but it's a quick job not problem at all.\n\nOverall it's a must play game, shame it never got a sequel :) And watch youre ♥♥♥ when you get to the Seeside Hotel in Santa Monica...\n","October 20, 2015","true","17.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pineappleprincess/recommended/2600/","pineappleprincess","Danseuse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pineappleprincess/","144 products in account","This game is a buried gem. Activision, as per their hitleristic standards, rushed this game into release about halfway through the development. The result is somewhat painful as far as bugs and glitches go. For me, the game wouldn't even start on its own, and when I initially tried to play it, I uninstalled and felt regret for buying it on my boyfriend's recommendation.\n\nA few months afterwards, I installed it again while I had a craving for RPGs. Here's the single key to enjoying this game: go and download the unofficial patch, and make sure to select the patch plus during the installation process. A large amount of the game's content is in unactivated code. The patch is regularly updated - the most recent update was this year, last I checked - which fixes all of the game breaking bugs and readds content that wasn't quite finished or activated.\n\nThe game? Great. The lore is excellent, which most of anyone who has experience with the Old World of Darkness universe would know. Even if you're not, the game is a great introduction. I wasn't a huge expert before I started playing, but a few hours in, I pulled up the wiki and simply started reading. The writing is quality. The characters are memorable, and it's hard not to feel about them; usually, if they're not Beckett or Jack, that feeling is indescribable loathing. The quests are so interesting, you feel a need to go out and find all of the ones avaliable. The environment offers many areas to explore and makes you want to explore them.\n\nThe only two things I would say aren't perfect about the game are the graphics and the combat. The graphics, naturally, are as dated as the game, and they haven't aged well. I honestly enjoy them because sometimes they're literally laughable. The combat is charmingly schizophrenic, in that you're never quite sure what you're doing, nor what you should be doing, but gosh dang if the results aren't fun. The combat difficulty jerks up and down with little in game conceivable reason, and initially I was confused, but then I realized that the difficulty wasn't based on game mechanics. It's based on lore. If the game makes you fight vampire hunters, no matter at what point you're at in the game, the fight's going to be very hard because vampire hunters in the Old World of Darkness are damned near impossible to kill.\n\nIt's a great game, and I think that if lore, missions, writing, and plots are your thing, you should play it. However, don't buy it. Pirate it. A larger company - I think it was Bioware - bought the company that made it and fired everyone who worked on it. Your money would be spent paying the people who ruined the chance of a second game.","December 4, 2013","true","40.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

However, for a new player like myself to jump in without any prior context, Bloodlines does a great job of establishing the fiction of the world of Vampire.\n\nWhat is most impressive is the game's way of forcing a "vampire mentality" on you. The Masquerade is a system requiring vampires to keep their existence secret from humanity, and this sometimes means having to kill innocents in unfortunate circumstances. By not doing so, you risk the lives and foundation of all vampire society.\n\nBloodlines is an open-world modern RPG/adventure, allowing you to take quests while following a main story narrative. For a game released in 2004, the graphics aren't half-bad, and the character expressions/facial animations are actually rather impressive.

It's a RPG true to the roots, where you spend most of your time exploring, talking and interacting with a world pretty much alive. It not only explores all that it can from the V:tM setting, but borrows everyhting that fits from the World Of Darkness full setting, meaning one can expect to see nothing short of changelings, werewolfs, Kindred Of The East, Mages and who knows what else. The game is full of memorable characters, with decent voice acting and nice models. The quests are very interesting, and tie well with the setting. Surely, this is one of the most ambituous RPG projects ever done, and it's not a surprise that Troika couldn't quite finish it.\n\nA rushed production meant that most of the game wasn't ready by the time it was unleashed upon the world. This resulted in poor reception by the specialized media and worse by players, who where annoyed by semi done quests, lots of bugs and a number of other problems. And since Troika closed doors a few months later, people thought there was no hope.\n\nNonetheless, a few people could see the jewel inside the oyster and started working on "unnoficial" patches that not only fixed the glitches but also unlocked lots of unfinished content and enabled players to enjoy the whole detailed scenario. To accompany that, ENB has a cool DX patch that improves the graphics and make the game even more obscure and dark that it already is.\n\nIf you ever played Vampire: The Masquerade with friend, you owe it to yourself to play the game. If you enjoy true RPGs, you won't forgive yourself for not trying this game. The good is so good that you'll be able to forgive the bad.","January 15, 2013","true","30.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well made and full of character and intrigue it also features the most frightening sequence I have ever experienced in movie or game format to a point where many people opt to skip the section via the console due to its nature (one could argue if you have played through it once you find it more annoying than scary). It has a lot of great writing and acting in it and the downsides to the game are that it was released before Half-Life 2 and as such valve didn't let them use the fully optimized version of the source engine which led to a lot of bugs. Bloodlines was hurried near the end of production as Troika was going out of business and the combat slog toward the end of the game reflects that. Several people continued to work on the game without pay just to get it as finished as it could be. A fan patch might be necessary for you to fully enjoy this free of some odd bugs but you do yourself a disservice missing out.","July 28, 2011","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, for a new player like myself to jump in without any prior context, Bloodlines does a great job of establishing the fiction of the world of Vampire.\n\nWhat is most impressive is the game's way of forcing a "vampire mentality" on you. The Masquerade is a system requiring vampires to keep their existence secret from humanity, and this sometimes means having to kill innocents in unfortunate circumstances. By not doing so, you risk the lives and foundation of all vampire society.\n\nBloodlines is an open-world modern RPG/adventure, allowing you to take quests while following a main story narrative. For a game released in 2004, the graphics aren't half-bad, and the character expressions/facial animations are actually rather impressive. Be aware that some odd unofficial patching needs to be done to make this game work on modern systems.\n\n4 out of 5 foxes.","December 28, 2011","true","45.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StealthMeister/recommended/2600/","StealthMeister","Darawesh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StealthMeister/","435 products in account","A game mired by its rushed release, VtM:B is an alternating 1st and 3rd person RPG about, you guessed it, vampires.\nIf the developers, Troika, had not been rushed by their publisher, Activision, this game would have been more completed and plagued less by bugs and glitches, on top of that it would've sold better too, considering that its rushed release forced it to compete with the likes of Half Life 2's release all those years ago.\n\nBut enough about that, let's talk about the actual game shall we?\n\nAtmosphere and music\nThe atmosphere in this game is more important in this game than in others in how it effects the overall feel and tone of the game. There a wolves howling in the night, bats flying around, the sounds of screams and glass breaking in scummy parts of town and let's not forget the eeriness that the wind brings. Different music is played for each hub and each combat encounter. The music has a dark, gothic, jazzy, sultry feel to it. It makes the player truly believe he/she is a creature of the night. The bars and clubs have appropriate music in them as well.\nHowever, where the atmosphere falls short in this game is with the people. This game take place in Los Angeles California, a densly populated city. But it just feels empty, there aren't enough people and there are never any cars aside from the taxi cab that occupy the roads. It's not that big of a deal, but it definitely disrupts the atmosphere of the game.\n\nGameplay\nThis game does get a lot of praise, and most of it is deserved, but you just can't ignore some of the downright broken and unrefined mechanics of gameplay. Namely combat and stealth, two of the most prominent mechanics in this game. Stealth is just outright broken, enemies are either completely oblivious to your approach or they see you from a mile away. You can shove your sword through an enemy's sternum, spewing blood every which way and his buddy in front of him will just say "Huh? Who's there" and give up searching for you after 10 seconds. Or you can be standing in a room with a closed door, not moving at all, and be spotted by a wandering security guard, through a closed door. The stealth in the game is just bad even with the plus patch.\nLet's talk about combat, it works but just barely. During melee combat which forces you into 3rd person the camera is your biggest enemy, it just feels wonky and like I'm being spun around a merry-go-round while I'm swinging an axe. Guns aren't all that better either, it feels stiff and klunky and until the later missions in the game it's unfulfilling as you hardly do any damage with them.\nOn a more positive note, the voice acting. This game has some of the best voice acting I have experienced in an RPG. The asians in Chinatown sound like actual asians that would live here in America, instead of the terrible stereotypical accent that some games are known for (I'm looking at you Deus Ex). You can hear the emotion and passion in the character's voices. Also, the game only lets you talk to important people. This could be considered a good or a bad thing. In my opinion, it's good. The game only lets you talk to people who have something worthwhile to say which keeps you from wasting time talking to people who repeat the same line over and over again.\nFinally, quests. I can honestly tell all of you that through all the quests I did (and I did almost every single one) I never once encountered a quest I could not complete due to a bug or a glitch, this is with the unofficial plus patch. So I highly recommend everyone who is thinking about playing this game gets that patch.\n\nGraphics and design\nNow, in my opinion graphics are the last thing you should worry about when choosing whether or not to play a game. But I feel it's worth talking about it in this game. It looks decent at 1920 x 1080 resolution. But there are some hiccups when it comes to playing this game. Certain areas (the warrens, Santa Monica) will drop in framerate due to rain or water, which is bad. There's also a glitch where if you're not looking in a certain direction the top or bottom of the screen will blur textures together. Easy to fix but still annoying.\n\nStory\nLast but certainly not least, the story. In the beginning you are forced into the world of vampires and supernatural beings. You get little to no guidance and it is clear from the very beginning that you are stuck in the middle of a political struggle and you have to decide who to back. On top of that the ever looming subject of an apocalypse is carried through the winds of the night, putting everyone on edge. Doing all of the side quests on your first playthrough should take you anywhere between 25 to 30 hours to complete.\nThis game is NOT for children. There are a lot of adult themes and subjects, such as snuff films, strip clubs, lots of blood, and graphic deaths. Not for the faint of heart. Overall the story is strong from start to finish. You will laugh, you might cry, you will be grossed out, but you'll have a hell of a time doing it.\n\nThe verdict\nOverall I give this game a 8/10. This is by no means a masterpiece or the best game ever, but when it comes to the vampire genre this is probably the best thing you'll ever experience, other than Castlevania of course. It would be a crime for any self-respecting RPG fan not to play this. It's worth the 20 bucks.","January 5, 2015","true","33.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every person has their own appeal, games they like and dislike, and reasons for those likes and dislikes. Not every game a reviewer will play will conform to those likes or dislikes, and a review must still compose himself and present a fair and balanced review in spite of his personal thoughts. I bring this up because it is very difficult to talk about Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines (hereafter referred to simply as ‘Vampire') without delving into the subjective elements it presents without sucking all the emotion and personality from the review and transforming it into a technical overview of the game itself. As such, I have divided this game up into two sections, an objective and a subjective one. But first an overview of the game itself;\n\nIn Vampire you play as a young person living in L.A. who has recently been transformed into one of the undead. Upon your indoctrination you quickly come to discover that the vampire society needs to be very secretive about how they act so as to keep the public unaware of their actions. Before long, though a sarcophagus which may or may not house the remains of a very ancient and very powerful vampire is uncovered and the various vampire clans in the city all begin a secret war of cloak and dagger tactics, each trying to recover the sarcophagus and its contents or deny them to others for themselves, all while trying to keep their very existence secretive from humans.\n\nFirstly, for the objective. The game is VERY well designed and it shows in its game mechanics. Serving as a action RPG with elements of The Elder Scrolls (except less open, confining the player to four primary districts that are fairly small and multiple dungeons) it is solid right from the get-go. From the beginning you are forced to select one of a series of vampire clans, each offering its own unique set of bonuses, abilities, and disadvantages that will end up shaping how you play. I, personally, ended up going with Clan Ventrue which focuses a lot on persuasion, but can't feed off of animals and can only feed reliably on upper-class humans. Someone else may end up with Nosferatu which can't raise their appearance at all and has to avoid being seen at all by humans for example.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fairly solid with most of the controls being very tight and having almost no real problems beyond a few glitches (which I will cover later) which I can't blame on the controls. One of the interesting things is that, instead of leveling up stats like strength and such, the player instead levels up various skills and abilities which, in turn, affect stats. This can cause for some very interesting outcomes where a character may choose to level up a skill they don't intend to use at all to bolster another skill which they do, in fact, use and results both in a large amount of flexibility and interesting builds as well as a drive to experiment around and see what else can be done.\n\nAnother interesting thing is that players do not gain experience from killing enemies in the slightest, but rather from quest completion. This puts an added drive to complete even simple sidequests as the added experience is the only way to make your character stronger.\n\nLastly, there are two special meters that will need proper attention. The Humanity meter and the Masquerade meter. A large focus of the game is the focus on struggling against the vampire urges and keeping ones self ‘human' despite needing to drink human blood in order to survive. Certain actions can cause players to lose some of their humanity and, as the gauge lowers to 0, it can result in them becoming utterly feral. Meanwhile, keeping the humanity high can result in a weaker vampire who struggles with their new nature. Additionally, keeping ones actions as a vampire secretive is very key and, every time a player is caught being a vampire in public, it costs them on the Masquerade meter. They start with a set amount of chances and, if those chances ever all disappear, game over (going feral wastes a chance). This puts an added focus on keeping ones nature as a vampire truly secret and staying human as going feral at the wrong time on a player who didn't try to keep hidden can cause an outright loss.\n\nVisually the game is fairly solid as well. While, sadly, you won't be able to delve too deep into the many complexities of polygon count, it very successfully manages to convey the feeling of the World of Darkness (the world as a vampire sees it). Vampire does its best to drive this home too, but manages to back it up with some solid displays. While they may look a bit dated today, there is a HUGE difference between ‘dated' and ‘bad' and this is most certainly not the latter.\n\nThere are some problems with the game though. First off it seems to revel in giving vague directions and not giving you anything resembling a quest-marker. While this wouldn't normally be too bad of a thing it is very easy to end up lost and unsure of where to go or who to talk too, especially if you stop playing the game for a week or more and don't remember the location of an important NPC with the lack of a map (aside from some bus-stop signs) driving the annoyance home. But, more overbearingly, is the glitches. There are a LOT in this game, and they are NOT of the minor kind. These are the kind that can destroy a game and leave it unplayable. Hunting down a patch and/or activating the command console may very well be a requirement for this game.\n\nAnd now for the subjective. This is a dark game. A VERY dark game to say the least. The game makes sure to reinforce this with such locations like abandoned hospitals, scummy apartment buildings, sleazy motels, brothels and night clubs galore, and death around every corner. The streets are almost never clean and are littered with trash, bums and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s seem to be the most common ‘professions', and so forth. People looking for a game about sparkling vampires, or even just ‘normal' vampires may find themselves off-put easily. This is a very dark and pessimistic game, and it ended up causing me to rethink about how to score this.\n\nTo say that this is a bad game simply because it's world is so scummy and grim is shortselling what the game does right. In any other setting where you can count the number of people who are ‘good' on more than one hand this probably would have been an amazing title. However, this game does not hide for even a moment that this is a grim and depressing world. People not looking for this sort of thing specifically can very easily end up becoming disguised and/or offended by it. Even the ending of the game seems to love rubbing in just how dark this world is.\n\nAs a result, I feel it is VERY important to look into the game before buying it and deciding if you wish to play a game like this. While it can be enthralling for people who revel in its darkness, for those people looking for even the tiniest ray of light and hope, they would be better off searching elsewhere.\n\nIn summery: while a solid game that is mired by some technical problems, its subjective aspects and story may simply be so off-putting to a player who does not enjoy its dark and grim world as to not make this game recommendable on a whim. If you buy this game, you should know what you're getting into, because this game is in no way shy about tossing you into the shadows.\n\nMy pricing: For someone looking for a dark game: 15-20 bucks. It's very solid, if a bit dated and dealing with bugs.\n\nFor someone not: Avoid at all costs. Remember, this is a game where it is possible to lose because you couldn't pretend to be a human being instead of a blood-sucking monster well enough.","April 23, 2014","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/THPPFT/recommended/2600/","THPPFT","JakkelR4psc4llion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/THPPFT/","82 products in account","Vampire: The Masquerade is a tabletop RPG game that was brought into the video gaming world with its first endeavor, "Redemption". After that, the creative and much more free roaming sequel, "Bloodlines" came out and basically shut down Troika games because of its bugs and glitches. However, the game itself, with its plot, choices, characters and overall lay out were good enough that fans have been releasing unofficial patches for the game in the decade since it was released. What does THAT tell you about the game? ;)\nIn Bloodlines, unlike Redemption, you get to choose your character by picking which gender you are and which vampire class. The vampire classes are an interesting assortment and essentially choose what your main skills and penalties turn out to be. If you're a Nosferatu, you're hideous and can roam about in public, but you're very intelligent and technical, if you're a Toreador, you're gorgeous and persuade/seduce almost anyone in the game, but you aren't very strong or intelligent and so on. Once you pick your class, you are thrust into a world of vampiric politics, gothic nightclubs and other fun stuff.\nThe fight mechanics are decent enough and the overall choices that you get make the game extremely enjoyable. The game has multiple endings and you essentially choose what kind of vampire you want to be (nice to people, recklessly homicidal to people, break all the rules, etc.) and what kind of vampire politics you want L.A. to turn into (ruled by the manipulative Vampire prince, ruled by the manipulative asian sorceress, ruled by you, or kill everyone and embrace vampiric anarchy). While the glitches are noticeable, even with any of the numerous fanmade uber-patches, the game is worth playing.","August 19, 2014","true","43.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm a monster. Blurgh!" stereotype as surprise surprise, you've just recently become a vampire yourself.\n\nPicking a clan you get sired into also affects how people react and talk to you or how the game plays itself. Picking Malkavian makes everyone want to smash their faces in trying to understand your cryptic methaphors, Tremere makes people wary about you because you can use your own blood as a magic weapon and Nospheratu means getting in the shadows because you're so god damn ugly and no one wants to see your face. Just a few examples.

Unfortunately when this game was originally released it was full of bugs & I guess Steam doesn't provide any fixes but don't worry there is a solution. Go to the forum or the website patches-scrolls and install Wesp5's patch version 8.9. This person has done amazing work to not only get this game running but provided many fixes for any in-game bugs. And it's worth the extra bit of time it takes but first off the bad stuff. The first thing you will notice are the outdated graphics but they really are not that bad and you get used to it pretty quick. The worst thing is combat. It's a bit clunky.....actually, it just plain sucks but not so bad that it's unplayable. The thing is VTMB is billed as an RPG & it not only delivers but it may be the best game ever in this aspect if you like getting immersed in an excellent story. There are rules you have to (un)live by & consequences if you don't. Decisions you make early on reflect what happens later. Basically, in a nutshell, it's an RPG that truly allows you to roleplay who you create & that's what makes this game shine.","February 5, 2014","true","562.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now I don't wish to spoil too much of them game but I will say it lets you choose between seven different playble clans each with their own inherent powers and personalities and even more clans that you see in the world. The mthical creatures in this game aren't cookie cutter definitons and each has its own uniqueness that adds character to the game.\n\nThe game plays a mixture of rpg elements, such as getting points to add to skills of your choice, getting and saving humanity so that you don't turn more beast than man, and following the masquerade, a set of rules to follow so you dont bring unwanted attention to the vampires. The game also employs first and third person aspects; in first person you get to control the gunplay and you will be spending most of your time looking this way, but in third person you can control your melee aspects which are done extraordinarily well. As in most rpg games you have an inventory in which to keep you weapons, cash, artifacts and other miscellaneous objects in,\n\nTo say this game is good is an understatement and I still beat myself up for not playing it sooner, and the game only gets better with mods.

I read that a few years ago, mind you, and I have since found other RPGs to add to my "best RPGs of all time" list. But Bloodlines, despite its age, its sort of mediocre gameplay that can confuse you for being based on a set of rules that are not always apparent, despite its dated visual and lack of character customization... Despite all that, the world, characters and tone still keep me coming back.\nPretty much every quest is interesting, the dialogs are well writen, the urban fantasy setting is something I wish I could see more often in gaming (especially in RPGs) and it has what simply must be my favourite haunted house level in gaming. Ever.\nSo yes, after almost ten years I still recommend Vampire, if nothing else because it will show you a world like which you won't find in any other videogame.\n\nMan, now I feel like starting another playthrough.","January 8, 2013","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/THPPFT/recommended/2600/","THPPFT","JakkelR4psc4llion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/THPPFT/","82 products in account","Vampire: The Masquerade is a tabletop RPG game that was brought into the video gaming world with its first endeavor, "Redemption". After that, the creative and much more free roaming sequel, "Bloodlines" came out and basically shut down Troika games because of its bugs and glitches. However, the game itself, with its plot, choices, characters and overall lay out were good enough that fans have been releasing unofficial patches for the game in the decade since it was released. What does THAT tell you about the game? ;)\nIn Bloodlines, unlike Redemption, you get to choose your character by picking which gender you are and which vampire class. The vampire classes are an interesting assortment and essentially choose what your main skills and penalties turn out to be. If you're a Nosferatu, you're hideous and can roam about in public, but you're very intelligent and technical, if you're a Toreador, you're gorgeous and persuade/seduce almost anyone in the game, but you aren't very strong or intelligent and so on. Once you pick your class, you are thrust into a world of vampiric politics, gothic nightclubs and other fun stuff.\nThe fight mechanics are decent enough and the overall choices that you get make the game extremely enjoyable. The game has multiple endings and you essentially choose what kind of vampire you want to be (nice to people, recklessly homicidal to people, break all the rules, etc.) and what kind of vampire politics you want L.A. to turn into (ruled by the manipulative Vampire prince, ruled by the manipulative asian sorceress, ruled by you, or kill everyone and embrace vampiric anarchy). While the glitches are noticeable, even with any of the numerous fanmade uber-patches, the game is worth playing.","August 19, 2014","true","43.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If that isn't enough, the game was the downfall of Troika, a games studio formed by key people from Black Isle, responsible for the first two Fallout games.\n\nThe game is deeply hardcore, and completely written for fans of the Vampire: The Masquerade pen & paper RPG. It's a RPG true to the roots, where you spend most of your time exploring, talking and interacting with a world pretty much alive. It not only explores all that it can from the V:tM setting, but borrows everyhting that fits from the World Of Darkness full setting, meaning one can expect to see nothing short of changelings, werewolfs, Kindred Of The East, Mages and who knows what else. The game is full of memorable characters, with decent voice acting and nice models. The quests are very interesting, and tie well with the setting. Surely, this is one of the most ambituous RPG projects ever done, and it's not a surprise that Troika couldn't quite finish it.\n\nA rushed production meant that most of the game wasn't ready by the time it was unleashed upon the world. This resulted in poor reception by the specialized media and worse by players, who where annoyed by semi done quests, lots of bugs and a number of other problems. And since Troika closed doors a few months later, people thought there was no hope.\n\nNonetheless, a few people could see the jewel inside the oyster and started working on "unnoficial" patches that not only fixed the glitches but also unlocked lots of unfinished content and enabled players to enjoy the whole detailed scenario. To accompany that, ENB has a cool DX patch that improves the graphics and make the game even more obscure and dark that it already is.\n\nIf you ever played Vampire: The Masquerade with friend, you owe it to yourself to play the game. If you enjoy true RPGs, you won't forgive yourself for not trying this game. The good is so good that you'll be able to forgive the bad.","January 15, 2013","true","30.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well made and full of character and intrigue it also features the most frightening sequence I have ever experienced in movie or game format to a point where many people opt to skip the section via the console due to its nature (one could argue if you have played through it once you find it more annoying than scary). It has a lot of great writing and acting in it and the downsides to the game are that it was released before Half-Life 2 and as such valve didn't let them use the fully optimized version of the source engine which led to a lot of bugs. Bloodlines was hurried near the end of production as Troika was going out of business and the combat slog toward the end of the game reflects that. Several people continued to work on the game without pay just to get it as finished as it could be.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/explodingbosoms/recommended/2600/","explodingbosoms","The Pasta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/explodingbosoms/","349 products in account","While I've not played any game taking place within the Vampire: The Masquerade universe, I was pleasantly surprised by the attention to detail this game in particular had. It was a unique experience, giving me a more contemporary feel of vampires in modern settings, even ones as ugly as the Nosferatu. Hell, even  finding vampires of Asian descent  was an interesting thing to find out. Not to mention how long the game is and how extensive some maps could be, Bloodlines proved to be an adventure worth finishing. That being said, there were some parts of the game that just felt either...off or just broken. While it didn't detract from the overall experience, they were buggersome to have to deal with. Let's break this down into two lists: Pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nIntriguing story. The ability to mold your path by the choices you make and the factions you choose to aid make the game replayable quite a few times.\nMultiple paths. As stated above, you can go a completely different route the next time you play just to see how things would've ended.\nPlaystyles. While some types excel in some fields, you're completely capable of being any build you desire, which is a nice bonus to have when figuring out what you wish to be good at. Unfortunately some builds just don't work as the game progresses, which I'll cover below.\nTheme and enviroments. The world is pretty well done. I didn't expect source to be capable of this kind of detail, major props to the devs. When you walk into the different maps, the different atmosphere feels refreshing too.\nCharacters. I was impressed by the characters and the people voicing them. They were really aggressive and sold their roles enough to make me wish they had more to say. Honestly, I feel this is the biggest selling point of this game.\nCons:\nCombat. Gotta say, the combat in this did not age well. It just didn't feel very engaging to shoot jerkfaces from a distance, nor was it fun to engage in melee combat against things that could very well kill you. The weapons were fun, sure, but it felt somewhat boring.\nBuilds. You can pidgeon-hole yourself if you do not build your character correctly. If you go mostly charisma, you will melt later on. Buffs don't seem to make much of a difference if you don't focus your points into boosting them, which can either interfere and flatout make your build a mess. Imagine having to fisticuff a boss but doing almost no damage. Argh.\nStory and ending. While interesting, the story felt like it tossed elements at you without really explaining much. Like  the werewolf attack . And while multiple endings exists, only one is worth bothering for, and even that can strain the nerves.\nBugs. There are some game-busting bugs that were never fixed in the official release and either need a third-party tool to fix or flatout cheat to get past some triggers that just do not function anymore, which was a big detractor for me.\n\nThat said, the game is pretty solid and still fun to play, even today. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking to play a game involving vampires and guns.","September 19, 2014","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The unofficial patch takes care of nearly all the bugs and restores additional content that was left out of the retail release. RPG elements are implemented a bit differently than most RPGs, in that xp is only awarded for completing quests, so there's no grinding involved, or even leveling (as xp is used to increase stats). The variety of vampire 'clans' that can be played provide a high replay value, as the dialogue options and events vary depending on which you choose. If you enjoy the subject matter, this is definitely a recommended purchase.","September 3, 2011","true","41.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plus both stealth lovers and gun fanatics can have fun, with both being great choices for getting most jobs done. Either way, action and stealth lovers alike are sure to have fun with this game.\n\nMy only problems with it are that it can be really glitchy, so it would be best if you went and downloaded the unofficial patch, which fixes problems for newer systems while also adding new quests and weapons.","June 28, 2014","true","26.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game straight up toppled Fallout from my list of RPGs i love, and took the spot of number 1.\n\nThe game itself is low detail, with many bugs (at one point random furniture spawned throughtout certain areas, and if i looked into the sky i would see what looked like the shadows of furniture and people in the sky xD) but the bugs would rarely effect gameplay and since the game saves after ohmost every time you leave a Building you can take a few steps back, if you ever come across a bad bug that really stops you in your tracks. I only ever had one bug that was like this but i didnt even need to load to a previous point cause it was done for me when i was killed by a couch xD(invisible wall kinda deal).\n\nNow if you have been reading up on this game you know that it was never really polished off cause of the developers departure from gaming, luckily a rouge developer by the name of wesp5 took it upon himself to create an unofficial patch that rounds off quite a bit and adds in a few things previously unavailable.\n\nNow a lot of people can play the game without the patch but i see no reason not to get it since it adds more to the game(just a little bit). Some people are afraid of going outside of steam to fix their games but its not that hard to find a reputable site.\n\nI got my patch from http://patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647 and remember to download 9.0 and install it into steam (itll try to install it into a file that dosent exist i.e if you actually had this game on a CD)","April 24, 2014","true","41.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Numerous other locations are also worthy of praise, with the Ocean House Hotel deserving special mention for being one of the scariest experiences I've ever had in a video game.\n\nThe different vampire clans you can play as provide plenty of replayability, and I've played through this game more times than I can count. In particular, Malkavians and Nosferatu make for the most unique experience.\n\nThe base game is a bit buggy, so track down the latest version of the unofficial patch before you get started.

You will also need to download a fan-made patch to make it work properly, but once that's sorted the game works just fine.\n\nYou get to choose one out of seven clans, your gender, and if you want - a backstory. All of these will have an impact on your playthrough, and gives you a lot of diversity to play with. Each clan has different abilities and traits. Sadly, you don't get to customise your appearance though, it's set by your sex and clan.\n\nThe dialogue options allows you to voice your opinion, often in a rude way. The game gives you the options you need to go around and be an a-hole to everyone, and you can of course lick butt if that's more of your style. There will also be unique dialogue options based off your clan, stats and abilities.\n\nAs you play through the game you will eventually be part of a story of politics, intrigue, and the fight for power and gain in the city. You will get to choose through your actions the outcome of this struggle, which I found very satisfying as you can make the ending of the game directly reflect your opinion on the conflicting factions of LA. There is no black and white answer here, as all these factions could be considered bad in different ways.\n\nAll in all it's a good experience, and I highly recommend it.\n\nOh, and one last bit of advice: Do not open the sarcophagus.","January 22, 2014","true","38.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a seriously interesting world, that will imerse you regardless of whether you're a fan of gothic culture or not. It spins a vampire tale that is both interesting and enjoyable at the same time. The plot remains solid and tense up until the 75% mark and then it feels unfortunatly rushed. I ended this story, feeling satisified of the journey but the overal end just left me feeling like alot of choices I made didn't matter. This is of course, due to the game developer being rushed to finish the game on time and highlights of game gems such as this one, are unfortunatly not given the extra attention they deserved.\n\nGameplay is very similar to that of games like Deus Ex. You are allowed to tackle objectives in any way you wish, in fact the game presents you with a series of classes which almost define your playstyle from then on. And this isn't just a minor state boost ethier. Playing as a particular class for example, renders you unable to travel on the streets due to your inability to blend in. The consequence of this is that you spend most of the game in sewers eating rats, but have a massive advantage when it comes to any stealth encounter. This is one of the fantastic game design choices the games makes! Certain vampire classes have advanatges in certain areas. Some are good at meddling with humans, others are better at combat and violence. One class is considered insane, and has an entire dialouge choice to back it up in conversations.\n\nCombat can be a little worse for ware, but it isn't unplayable. The broken AI, doesn't tend to put up much of a fight - especially in stealth sections. When you pick your class, you will find it difficult to progress down any other path. Stealth classes, tend to be killed quite easily if you try full frontal combat. Stealth isn't just a one off thing ethier, it is supported by stealth kills, shadow blending etc.\n\nOverall, when you play this game - it is very difficult not to appreciate it, for what it could be and for what it is. I find it difficult to discredit the game up to the 75% mark. After that, things are obviously rushed, everything becomes more combat focused and you will find yourself struggling if you didn't pick a combat class. Before that though, is a game that definatly rewards player choice in both story and gameplay. It provide an interesting, immersive gothic world that will delight both those who enjoy vampire culture and those who don't, alike.","November 30, 2013","true","47.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

And it just has so much replay value due to the different clans you can play as (not to mention the gender option - female vampires have a kinda sexy way of taking their night snacks). The music is great too, varying between atmospheric to industrial.\n\nI think the devs should perhaps clean up a bitmap or two on this new release, because the various maps - especially useful as Nosferatu as you'll be hitting the sewers a lot due to their unsightly appearance - are not clear. If you can find the maps online do print a copy if you're playing as Nosferatu.

They have a secret society and live among us with a certain set of rules to maintain order and ensure that their existence won't become widespread knowledge. This is the Masquerade. You become the new pawn for the local leader in his political wars. Not all is well in vampire community, and some factions are eager to change things.\n\nIt's a comfortable entry – just as you're in the dark, so is your character, letting the two of you learn together who's who and what's what in vampire life. It's a pretty crazy one, too. Violence and sex are plentiful and the game doesn't shy from either. You'll find it hard, and not too rewarding, to play your regular Good Hero sort. It's also a very humorous game with plenty of moments that made me chuckle. The voice acting is terrific and there are many great characters. I found myself often just standing still and listening to the in-game news report on the TV, or the late-night radio show for the laughs.\n\nThe story develops in unexpected ways and the ending managed to surprise me. Maybe I haven't found them out yet, but I didn't feel as if my choices bore significant consequences. It didn't really bother me, though, because the ride was a good one. The game is divided into city hubs that open one at a time after plot checkpoints, and you can jump from one to the other freely once they're available. You won't find the trademark "collect 10 donkey tails" side-quests that pollute fantasy RPGs, but instead many fun investigative missions outside the main plot. Backtracking can be annoying, though.\n\nWhile the story isn't too divergent, the gameplay is. It shares similarities with Deus Ex – many missions (though not all) don't offer just one way to the solution. Usually you can take a stealthy approach as well as the loud and bloody one. If your hacking skill is low, often your lockpicking will let you do the job instead – or vice versa. And while, like many other RPGs, it has its skills which aren't as useful as the others, I was happy to find out that many non-combat ones are still well utilized in the game. I won't write down a guide to power-building, though. One, because you can easily google it. Two, because it's hard to suck at the game.\n\nYou can focus either on guns or melee. I did one playthrough of each, and while I felt that later on my gun-focused character was stronger, the melee was more satisfying, despite how simple it was. I really liked playing an immortal psychopath who charges into a room while people shoot at her and she just jumps around slashing everything. However, just like the graphics, keep in mind the year of the game and don't expect anything advanced in terms of combat mechanics.\n\nThe game also has serious replay value. I'm already during my 3rd playthrough, and I'm not crossing out the possibility of a 4th sometime in the future. It's not due to different choices, because – as I said – they're not too significant here. It's partly due to reviewing the story with the insight of the twist at the end and partly due to different approach in mechanics – like many RPGs. You don't choose a specific class, but instead a clan. They're set apart by their own few unique abilities (some even have different dialogue options, which is pretty amazing if you ask me), while the bulk of the simple ones are shared between them all.\n\nBefore you start, two things. First, the game is buggy as hell and you shouldn't play it without the unofficial patch. Google it, it'll come up. Second, don't play the Malkavian clan in your first run – they're lunatics who hear voices, and their dialogue is completely overhauled and special, partly due to their weird insights into matters. So without understanding the plot after a complete playthrough, and knowing what happens in each interaction, playing a Malkavian can be really confusing. But after your first playthrough? Highly recommended. They're very entertaining.","February 2, 2015","true","80.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines is first person and third person action RPG based of the pen and paper RPG of the same title(Vampire the Masquerade). You play as a fledgling vampire who was spared after your sire was executed, now you have to fight the beast inside you by keeping your humanity and obey the laws of the masquerade.\n\nStory 10/10\nThis game has amazing writing. From the get go you got yourself into some vampire politics and have a whole new world around you that you have to discover. There's not only kine and kindred (humans and human like vampires) there are also things like the sabbat, werewolves, vampire hunters, etc. The main vampire government are the Camarilla, but their are also vampire rebels known as the Anarchs. As the story progresses you'll have to pick a side. Beyond the main story there are countless side missions that often have mini stories or side stories to them.\n\nGameplay 9/10\nIt's got a lot of buggy issues to the game but there are several 'unofficial' patches to the game that can help. I can't compare the vanilla game with the patched version because I installed the patch before playing it. But mainly there are various mechanics to the game, from simple combat like shooting and melee attacks, disciplines which are basically spells, you have a blood bar you regenerate from drinking blood, you have a humanity bar you need to keep balanced, and finally the masquerade bar. Knowing the names of the mechanics is one thing, figuring and mastering them is another.\n\nThe game is very immersive, depending on what clan you are and what you do and say to people effects how you are treated by various characters throughout the game. The game allows you to have your own play style, from sneaking around vents to going guns a blazing, and seducing or threatening people you talk to to get information. There are also the little things that make this game so amusing as well, for example I mercilessly murdered a fat guy at a diner and I heard the sounds of sirens and the police were waiting outside, I also broke into an art gallery and a mission later watched a news reporter talk about that very thing. Great stuff!\n\nMusic 10/10\nThe music is top notch! Composed by Rik Schaffer & various others, the game has many tracks to fit the mood. From ambient tracks for the streets of LA and haunted hotels to Club tracks by actual bands and slow tracks to strip clubs. I absolutely love it!\n\nOver all: 9/10\nVtMB is an amazing game to have. I personally found it hard to stop playing, and within two and a half days already had 25 hours of play time. Even though I make this sound like a masterpiece it does have it's negatives like the need for a patch to properly work, it gets a bit hard/confusing at times to find stuff or complete objectives, or the fact there's not enough Jeanette(play the game and you'll know what I mean ;P)! ::I almost forgot to mention this game has lots of sexual content, it almost surprised me. So if you're not into that kind of thing or just don't like it in general I would highly consider that a factor before thinking about buying this game::  But this is still something to have, especially if you're into vampires or just Action RPG's in general. So I urge you to check it out!","January 5, 2015","true","54.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sadly, you don't get to customise your appearance though, it's set by your sex and clan.\n\nThe dialogue options allows you to voice your opinion, often in a rude way. The game gives you the options you need to go around and be an a-hole to everyone, and you can of course lick butt if that's more of your style. There will also be unique dialogue options based off your clan, stats and abilities.\n\nAs you play through the game you will eventually be part of a story of politics, intrigue, and the fight for power and gain in the city. You will get to choose through your actions the outcome of this struggle, which I found very satisfying as you can make the ending of the game directly reflect your opinion on the conflicting factions of LA.

It was such a fun, emmersive game, that when the sequel hit, I almost wet myself. It's such a great blend of 1st person with RPG, and takes you so many places in the deep, seedy underbelly of L.A., as you massacre your way through levels filled with ghosts, mutants, werewolves, and cultists. It's too bad the game hasn't been updated for a long, long time. It's worth a lot more than one or two playthroughs, and is full of several paths, interesting characters, and amazing level design.","July 11, 2014","true","89.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/explodingbosoms/recommended/2600/","explodingbosoms","The Pasta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/explodingbosoms/","349 products in account","While I've not played any game taking place within the Vampire: The Masquerade universe, I was pleasantly surprised by the attention to detail this game in particular had. It was a unique experience, giving me a more contemporary feel of vampires in modern settings, even ones as ugly as the Nosferatu. Hell, even  finding vampires of Asian descent  was an interesting thing to find out. Not to mention how long the game is and how extensive some maps could be, Bloodlines proved to be an adventure worth finishing. That being said, there were some parts of the game that just felt either...off or just broken. While it didn't detract from the overall experience, they were buggersome to have to deal with. Let's break this down into two lists: Pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nIntriguing story. The ability to mold your path by the choices you make and the factions you choose to aid make the game replayable quite a few times.\nMultiple paths. As stated above, you can go a completely different route the next time you play just to see how things would've ended.\nPlaystyles. While some types excel in some fields, you're completely capable of being any build you desire, which is a nice bonus to have when figuring out what you wish to be good at. Unfortunately some builds just don't work as the game progresses, which I'll cover below.\nTheme and enviroments. The world is pretty well done. I didn't expect source to be capable of this kind of detail, major props to the devs. When you walk into the different maps, the different atmosphere feels refreshing too.\nCharacters. I was impressed by the characters and the people voicing them. They were really aggressive and sold their roles enough to make me wish they had more to say. Honestly, I feel this is the biggest selling point of this game.\nCons:\nCombat. Gotta say, the combat in this did not age well. It just didn't feel very engaging to shoot jerkfaces from a distance, nor was it fun to engage in melee combat against things that could very well kill you. The weapons were fun, sure, but it felt somewhat boring.\nBuilds. You can pidgeon-hole yourself if you do not build your character correctly. If you go mostly charisma, you will melt later on. Buffs don't seem to make much of a difference if you don't focus your points into boosting them, which can either interfere and flatout make your build a mess. Imagine having to fisticuff a boss but doing almost no damage. Argh.\nStory and ending. While interesting, the story felt like it tossed elements at you without really explaining much. Like  the werewolf attack . And while multiple endings exists, only one is worth bothering for, and even that can strain the nerves.\nBugs. There are some game-busting bugs that were never fixed in the official release and either need a third-party tool to fix or flatout cheat to get past some triggers that just do not function anymore, which was a big detractor for me.\n\nThat said, the game is pretty solid and still fun to play, even today. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking to play a game involving vampires and guns.","September 19, 2014","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NXGangrel/recommended/2600/","NXGangrel","[Daisy]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NXGangrel/","32 products in account","Every time someone mentions it, someone will reinstall it.\n\nThis is one of the most enjoyable games you'll ever play. Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines is first person and third person action RPG based of the pen and paper RPG of the same title(Vampire the Masquerade). You play as a fledgling vampire who was spared after your sire was executed, now you have to fight the beast inside you by keeping your humanity and obey the laws of the masquerade.\n\nStory 10/10\nThis game has amazing writing. From the get go you got yourself into some vampire politics and have a whole new world around you that you have to discover. There's not only kine and kindred (humans and human like vampires) there are also things like the sabbat, werewolves, vampire hunters, etc. The main vampire government are the Camarilla, but their are also vampire rebels known as the Anarchs. As the story progresses you'll have to pick a side. Beyond the main story there are countless side missions that often have mini stories or side stories to them.\n\nGameplay 9/10\nIt's got a lot of buggy issues to the game but there are several 'unofficial' patches to the game that can help. I can't compare the vanilla game with the patched version because I installed the patch before playing it. But mainly there are various mechanics to the game, from simple combat like shooting and melee attacks, disciplines which are basically spells, you have a blood bar you regenerate from drinking blood, you have a humanity bar you need to keep balanced, and finally the masquerade bar. Knowing the names of the mechanics is one thing, figuring and mastering them is another.\n\nThe game is very immersive, depending on what clan you are and what you do and say to people effects how you are treated by various characters throughout the game. The game allows you to have your own play style, from sneaking around vents to going guns a blazing, and seducing or threatening people you talk to to get information. There are also the little things that make this game so amusing as well, for example I mercilessly murdered a fat guy at a diner and I heard the sounds of sirens and the police were waiting outside, I also broke into an art gallery and a mission later watched a news reporter talk about that very thing. Great stuff!\n\nMusic 10/10\nThe music is top notch! Composed by Rik Schaffer & various others, the game has many tracks to fit the mood. From ambient tracks for the streets of LA and haunted hotels to Club tracks by actual bands and slow tracks to strip clubs. I absolutely love it!\n\nOver all: 9/10\nVtMB is an amazing game to have. I personally found it hard to stop playing, and within two and a half days already had 25 hours of play time. Even though I make this sound like a masterpiece it does have it's negatives like the need for a patch to properly work, it gets a bit hard/confusing at times to find stuff or complete objectives, or the fact there's not enough Jeanette(play the game and you'll know what I mean ;P)! ::I almost forgot to mention this game has lots of sexual content, it almost surprised me. So if you're not into that kind of thing or just don't like it in general I would highly consider that a factor before thinking about buying this game::  But this is still something to have, especially if you're into vampires or just Action RPG's in general. So I urge you to check it out!","January 5, 2015","true","54.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was never into vampire silliness prior to my discovery, but if you're looking for a 3rd person, multi-faceted, gritty / noir-styled action RPG with visceral, albeit clunky, gameplay, then this is it.\n\nMind you, it's a tad dated at this point and certainly has its fair share of flaws, but literally, there's a console-activated cheat that can make the ♥♥♥♥ (breasts) of a certain clan of female vampire expand to be as big as your screen- /no make/. Who cares if they're all glitched and polygonal? What are you, some kinda queer?\n\nIn short, VtM:B is dated, occasionally glitchy and has a somewhat ponderous fighting mechanic. It also boasts incredible variety, either in how one approaches obstacles (seducing, coercing, persuading, mind-♥♥♥♥ing, murdering, sneaking, exploding, exsanguinating); or what style of character you choose to get it all done with (seven clans of vampire in this iteration of the series and both genders per); or the arsenal of weaponry you can utilize (I'm talkin' katanas, shotguns, flamethrowers, sledgehammers and bush hooks, submachine guns, SEVERED ARMS, et-♥♥♥♥in'-cetera)...\n\nPHEW. Anyway, do yourselves a favor and BUY THIS GAME.\n\n(NOTE: even the Steam version of this game seems to hate certain versions of Windows? 7 in particular, as I've not been able to play it on my current computer, as noted by my utter absence of play time)","July 7, 2012","true","0.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dated graphics are the price of entry but if you can get past that you have a terriffic semi-open world with a fantastic story, superb voice acting, varied environments and cool gothic theme (which I wasn't even into but this game sucked me in).\n\nThis is basically the only game that comes close to replicating the overall feel of the original Deus Ex, but also stands entirely on its own.  And like Deus Ex, despite the semi-open world mechanics, you never have that feeling that you're just playing a collection of minigames.  All the main and side quests feel tightly coupled to the story.\n\nVampire was released the same month as Half Life 2 and was therefore totally missed by the gaming public but if I had the choice of replaying both games it would be Vampire, no question.\n\n","November 28, 2014","true","58.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Besides that, it's got memorable characters, a good soundtrack and can be funny at times, both on purpose and accidentally (keep in mind this was released in '04). Combat gets repetitive pretty quickly, so I suggest trying to kill enemies without being detected to make things a bit more intense. I also suggest to not bother with guns and stick to melee (always collect any dropped weapons though, so you can sell them later). Plenty of sidequests to keep the main narrative from getting boring, great character sheet. I recommend the hell out of this game.","November 19, 2015","true","101.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well made and full of character and intrigue it also features the most frightening sequence I have ever experienced in movie or game format to a point where many people opt to skip the section via the console due to its nature (one could argue if you have played through it once you find it more annoying than scary). It has a lot of great writing and acting in it and the downsides to the game are that it was released before Half-Life 2 and as such valve didn't let them use the fully optimized version of the source engine which led to a lot of bugs. Bloodlines was hurried near the end of production as Troika was going out of business and the combat slog toward the end of the game reflects that. Several people continued to work on the game without pay just to get it as finished as it could be. A fan patch might be necessary for you to fully enjoy this free of some odd bugs but you do yourself a disservice missing out.","July 28, 2011","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While you do gain experience, and unlock new abilities, the skill tree will be unfamiliar to those not already versed in White Wolf's pen and paper games. Also, there is very little gear, whether dropped or bought and it almost feels scripted. You get to a new place, and get a new weapon or armor, at the same time on every character you make. The only other bad point i'll touch on is the combat system. While it's fun hacking away in melee, and the vampire powers you get to back your fighting skills are top-notch visually and mechanically, if you specialize in guns, expect to have a REALLY hard time until about halfway through the game, even if your ranged skill is high. On top of that, even when your wielding a trusty baseball bat knocking some punk to the floor, you literally have to wait for them to get up to strike again as the hit-boxes don't register when they are prone. But those a few minor annoyances, and really aren't the spirit of the game. You can get through many missions without physical confrontation if you are socially inclined, or can make people magically go insane. The characters you meet all have a story and each one's personality might clash with another or even yourself. It's a great opportunity to really role-play a vampire and a must have for anyone looking for more than a run-through guns blazing type of game.","June 1, 2015","true","36.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/armeda/recommended/2600/","armeda","Mr Wednesday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/armeda/","480 products in account","Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.\n\nLong name, incredible game. Quite possibly the best game I have ever played. I have reached the final boss several times, but only finally got around to giving him his Final Death today. Taking around thirty hours, this is a game complete with an amazing story, interesting characters, cool powers, and the most legit vampire's I know of. The basic story begins with your 'embrace' - where you become a vampire - and continues as your rise in power and prestige, until you are causing the events, rather than reacting to them.\n\nEach of the nine clans you can choose from have different abilities. They could be considered classes, similar to other games, but they aren't usually wildly different. Most of the change is in the player models, and the powers - each clan getting two powers from a pool, and a third unique to their clan. But there are enough differences to make replaying a possibility. For example, the Nosferatu are hideous, and as such cannot seduce people for blood, and instead have to suck on rats in the sewers below the streets, while the Ventrue clan is the opposite - they cannot drink from rats due to their nobility. Another is clan Malkavian; each and every one of them is insane. Incredibly, they have 100% unique dialogue, opposed to other clans having a few lines or opportunities each, and can engage in some interesting tangents - such as having a conversation with the news reporter on TV.\n\nWhile the vanilla version is very buggy - due to the developers being rushed in their final stages - most of these issues can be resolves with the fan made Unofficial Patch, which is a must-get if you plan on playing. It's not the prettiest game either, with some pretty terrible animations at times, but all this is forgiveable in the face of such a wonderful experience. The game uses Valve's source engine (an earlier version of the engine Titanfall is built on), and was released on the same day as Half-Life 2; and though the models in the game are by no means of equal quality, they are attractive in their own way, and help nail the bleak, horror/noir atmosphere.\n\nIf Firefly was a game, it would be this one. While the themes are not at all similar, it is the kind of game that when someone brings it up in conversation, or you read about it on the net, you pretty much have no choice but to reinstall and have another crack at it.\n\n10/10. I honestly cannot think of any way to improve it, other than give the devs more time to improve a couple of the cutscenes.\n\n\ntl;dr - V:TM-B is one of the best games ever. It is often on sale on Steam. buy it. Install the most recent Unofficial Patch. Enjoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.\n\nP.S. ♥♥♥♥ the haunted hotel.

Combat is relatively simple. It's important to remember you can't be a jack of all trades. There's very limited EXP in the game (which is why I suggest playing all of the side-quests) so it's best to spec into things.\n\nThe characters are cool. There's several factions you can join. Playing as different clans can prove to be a new experience (especially Malkavians, Nosferatus and Tremere, but my favourite is Gangrel as bland as it is.) I find characters like Jack and Gary to be hilarious. There's a great voice acting crew, too. Most of the voice actors sound like they put some real heart into it. Though the generic NPCs that roam around sometimes sound like they used a less-than-moderate quality microphone and didn't care.\n\nAll in all, I think this game is 10/10. Just make sure you patch it before you play it or you're going to have a bad time.","December 3, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some fantastic fan mods that even out the rough edges, but even unmodded this is one of the most immersive games out there, one that throws you into its world and lets you explore its darkest reaches. Rather than excessive exposition, it lets you discover the ins and outs of the underground vampire society yourself, much as an outsider like the player character would have to do. It has a fantastic amount of player choice, and a genuinely good storyline to follow, however you choose to play.\n\nMany of the core mechanics are pretty sloppy, and the various skills are terribly balanced. Not to mention an excess of bugs can impede your progress. But if you can ignore, or mod out these issues, you'll find it's the perfect vampire game. Just as the Arkham games make you feel like you really are Batman, this makes you really feel like a vampire. And makes vampires cool again in the process.\n\n(As usual, ignore my low recorded playtime, as I've already played my non-steam version multiple times.)","July 30, 2011","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tungconor/recommended/2600/","tungconor","Conor MacLennan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tungconor/","165 products in account","Well, where do I begin, telling you about this gem? I suppose I'll start with what it is.\n\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is an action-RPG based on the tabletop game of the same name. Gamplay-wise, it plays similarly to the original Deus Ex, leaving multiple options to accomplish your objectives. You could go for the good-old fashioned direct assault, use stealth, or alternatively talk your way out of situations. It's really up to you.\n\nThere are numerous vampire clans to choose from, all with their own unique focus. Brujahs and Gangrels focus more on combat, whereas the Tremere make use of powerful blood magic, and the Toreador and Ventrue manipulate their way towards their objectives. There are, however, two more, special clans. The Nosferatu are mutated horribly by their vampiric curse, and must skulk around the sewers and alleys lest they be seen. Needless to say, they're good at stealth. And last, but certainly not least, are the Malkavians. These guys are completely insane, which is reflected in game by your bizarre dialogue choices, hallucinations and voices in your head. They do have some nice powers, though, such as invisibilty and Dementation, which is useful for both dialogue and enemies. You'll also be treated quite differently based on your clan, leaving a lot of replay value.\n\nReally, though, it's the story and atmosphere which make this game truly special. Walking through the streets of a depiction of LA apparently going through it's Goth phase. The hubworlds are small in size but full of detail, and you always feel like you're doing something different. From tracking down and killing a cabal of blood disease-spreading vampires, to exploring a haunted house, to getting your own ghoul (basically someone who has recieved vampire blood and gets some basic vampire abilities from it, but not the whole set), it always feels like you're doing something unique. It feels good to drink blood, and the political intrigue of the secret vampire society you're involved in is extremely engrossing, and all the characters have different personalities, and a good few are quite memorable. The story moves at a good pace, although the story path to a seemingly simple objective often becomes quite convoluted.\n\nSadly. this game is not without its flaws. First off the bat, there's the bugs and poor optimisation. This game was Christmas rushed (which, as we all know, always ends well), and the game was in an extremely buggy state upon launch, and Troika were unable to fix it on account of going bust shortly after. The game will ouright refuse to work on some modern systems without an unofficial patch, and may be almost unplayable. Even with the patch installed, you will see bugs often. Most won't affect gameplay, but will pull you out of that fantastic atmosphere Troika worked so hard to make. After a certain point close to the end of the game, due to it being rushed out the door, the game forces you into a repetetive series of combat arenas, with no alternative paths. So, if you've not been putting points into combat skills, you're screwed. The final boss (oh, and the boss fights aren't very good throughout the game) is impossible to kill without a gun, when guns are next to useless for a good part of the game. Oh, and even if you have gone the combat route, the game still has a massive unfair difficulty spike near the end. The combat itself is bearable, but very repetetive, and essentially consists of wailing on attack and spamming your most powerful clan Disciplines.\n\nStill, overall, VtM-B is easily one of the best RPGs ever made, and you owe to yourself to get it. Accept the Embrace and find your place in the world of the Kindred...","July 4, 2015","true","81.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it was made in 2004. Also the best RPG mechanic I've ever played. Makes the systems used in various MMO's and other rpg seem massively inferior and sometimes pitiful.\n\nHighlights are: Every character (except yours) is voice acted, and done by professionals. Your dialogue choices are numerous and varied, and based off how you increase your social skills. Every character is really interesting, and all side quests are excellent. All dialogue is very well written.\n\nThe main story is really good. And the choice of endings is more "branched" then even current rivals, although thats not saying much (Except for Witcher II which holds the crown for choices that  change the entire game and political landscape, and truly stands out in the RPG marketplace).\n\nThere is plenty of music made by professionals. There are details like news reports and radio shows that progress as you progress thru the game and make mention of things you do. An if you play Malkav you are in for a bonus surprise with regard to that. The whole atmosphere is so darn immersive and well constructed.\n\nMultiple clans to play, so the game has at least a couple of repeat play thru's. By my count, minimum of three, since the Nosferatu (stealthy) are quite different, and certainly the Malkavs (totally crazy), and then there is everyone else (they follow more conventional social interaction).\n\nMake sure you check out/read up on the community mods for the latest patch (Activision does not bother to fix their own property), and also resolution fixes.","October 30, 2013","true","42.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some fantastic fan mods that even out the rough edges, but even unmodded this is one of the most immersive games out there, one that throws you into its world and lets you explore its darkest reaches. Rather than excessive exposition, it lets you discover the ins and outs of the underground vampire society yourself, much as an outsider like the player character would have to do. It has a fantastic amount of player choice, and a genuinely good storyline to follow, however you choose to play.\n\nMany of the core mechanics are pretty sloppy, and the various skills are terribly balanced. Not to mention an excess of bugs can impede your progress. But if you can ignore, or mod out these issues, you'll find it's the perfect vampire game. Just as the Arkham games make you feel like you really are Batman, this makes you really feel like a vampire. And makes vampires cool again in the process.\n\n(As usual, ignore my low recorded playtime, as I've already played my non-steam version multiple times.)","July 30, 2011","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tungconor/recommended/2600/","tungconor","Conor MacLennan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tungconor/","165 products in account","Well, where do I begin, telling you about this gem? I suppose I'll start with what it is.\n\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is an action-RPG based on the tabletop game of the same name. Gamplay-wise, it plays similarly to the original Deus Ex, leaving multiple options to accomplish your objectives. You could go for the good-old fashioned direct assault, use stealth, or alternatively talk your way out of situations. It's really up to you.\n\nThere are numerous vampire clans to choose from, all with their own unique focus. Brujahs and Gangrels focus more on combat, whereas the Tremere make use of powerful blood magic, and the Toreador and Ventrue manipulate their way towards their objectives. There are, however, two more, special clans. The Nosferatu are mutated horribly by their vampiric curse, and must skulk around the sewers and alleys lest they be seen. Needless to say, they're good at stealth. And last, but certainly not least, are the Malkavians. These guys are completely insane, which is reflected in game by your bizarre dialogue choices, hallucinations and voices in your head. They do have some nice powers, though, such as invisibilty and Dementation, which is useful for both dialogue and enemies. You'll also be treated quite differently based on your clan, leaving a lot of replay value.\n\nReally, though, it's the story and atmosphere which make this game truly special. Walking through the streets of a depiction of LA apparently going through it's Goth phase. The hubworlds are small in size but full of detail, and you always feel like you're doing something different. From tracking down and killing a cabal of blood disease-spreading vampires, to exploring a haunted house, to getting your own ghoul (basically someone who has recieved vampire blood and gets some basic vampire abilities from it, but not the whole set), it always feels like you're doing something unique. It feels good to drink blood, and the political intrigue of the secret vampire society you're involved in is extremely engrossing, and all the characters have different personalities, and a good few are quite memorable. The story moves at a good pace, although the story path to a seemingly simple objective often becomes quite convoluted.\n\nSadly. this game is not without its flaws. First off the bat, there's the bugs and poor optimisation. This game was Christmas rushed (which, as we all know, always ends well), and the game was in an extremely buggy state upon launch, and Troika were unable to fix it on account of going bust shortly after. The game will ouright refuse to work on some modern systems without an unofficial patch, and may be almost unplayable. Even with the patch installed, you will see bugs often. Most won't affect gameplay, but will pull you out of that fantastic atmosphere Troika worked so hard to make. After a certain point close to the end of the game, due to it being rushed out the door, the game forces you into a repetetive series of combat arenas, with no alternative paths. So, if you've not been putting points into combat skills, you're screwed. The final boss (oh, and the boss fights aren't very good throughout the game) is impossible to kill without a gun, when guns are next to useless for a good part of the game. Oh, and even if you have gone the combat route, the game still has a massive unfair difficulty spike near the end. The combat itself is bearable, but very repetetive, and essentially consists of wailing on attack and spamming your most powerful clan Disciplines.\n\nStill, overall, VtM-B is easily one of the best RPGs ever made, and you owe to yourself to get it. Accept the Embrace and find your place in the world of the Kindred...","July 4, 2015","true","81.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Using a combination of stealth, cunning and brute force, only you can ultimately shape the result of the conflict.\n\nFamously released in an unfinished state (though several patches and mods have been released that largely fix this), Bloodlines is a flawed yet absolutely captivating gem of a game that takes the stealth-action RPG hybrid gameplay of series such as Deus Ex and Thief, drapes it in a veneer of equal parts Anne Rice sensual horror and goth club sleaze, and ties it all together with an excellent script dripping with lore, mystery, sexuality, and violence. There's plenty of replay value to be had as well thanks to the diverse array of vampire clans one can play as; from the seductive Toreador or traditionalist Ventrue, to the monstrous Nosferatu or gibbering and insane Malkavian.

The closest thing I could relate it to, both in terms of gameplay and overall feeling is the first Deus Ex, as in both games you are some kind of superhuman who gets to master disciplines and powers in an RPG fashion in a game that gives you complete freedom in how to tackle the problems it throws at you (The third Deus Ex could qualify as well, but it tends to make the various intended paths obvious to you right off the bat, rather than letting you think of creative approaches yourself), and each clan (read : Character class) helps complement those playstyles.\n\nI'm not really going to say much more, because at this point, you should know whether the game interests you or not, but know this :\n- Steam only provides the retail version of the game, which is notoriously buggy (not just minor stuff, I'm talking about the game being outright unbeatable or just crashing all the time) because Activision insisted that the game be released the same day as Half Life 2. This version only includes the most critical fixes, like getting the game to start on computers with more than 1GB of video RAM. You definitely should download the unofficial patch (which actually includes "official" fixes) at this adress : http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647\n- As enjoyable as I found the experience, the game really begins to lose itself in the last few missions, where levels become longer, much more linear, and where non-combat builds start becoming a lot less viable. The last bosses (which one you get depends on your choices) are especially bad about this, as you probably won't leave a scratch on them unless your combat skills are at least level 8 or 9, but they go down in seconds once they are. Just keep that in mind if you're planning to go down a more non-combat route.\n- If you go for stealth, prepare for some set pieces to look weird., like enemies busting in through a window or blowing up a wall and then stand there doing nothing.\n\nThis said, if you're a fan of RPGs, and especially if you liked the first Deus Ex, you owe yourself to play that game.","December 22, 2014","true","76.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now I don't wish to spoil too much of them game but I will say it lets you choose between seven different playble clans each with their own inherent powers and personalities and even more clans that you see in the world. The mthical creatures in this game aren't cookie cutter definitons and each has its own uniqueness that adds character to the game.\n\nThe game plays a mixture of rpg elements, such as getting points to add to skills of your choice, getting and saving humanity so that you don't turn more beast than man, and following the masquerade, a set of rules to follow so you dont bring unwanted attention to the vampires. The game also employs first and third person aspects; in first person you get to control the gunplay and you will be spending most of your time looking this way, but in third person you can control your melee aspects which are done extraordinarily well. As in most rpg games you have an inventory in which to keep you weapons, cash, artifacts and other miscellaneous objects in,\n\nTo say this game is good is an understatement and I still beat myself up for not playing it sooner, and the game only gets better with mods.

Combat is relatively simple. It's important to remember you can't be a jack of all trades. There's very limited EXP in the game (which is why I suggest playing all of the side-quests) so it's best to spec into things.\n\nThe characters are cool. There's several factions you can join. Playing as different clans can prove to be a new experience (especially Malkavians, Nosferatus and Tremere, but my favourite is Gangrel as bland as it is.) I find characters like Jack and Gary to be hilarious. There's a great voice acting crew, too. Most of the voice actors sound like they put some real heart into it. Though the generic NPCs that roam around sometimes sound like they used a less-than-moderate quality microphone and didn't care.\n\nAll in all, I think this game is 10/10. Just make sure you patch it before you play it or you're going to have a bad time.","December 3, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/causprod/recommended/2600/","causprod","Causticicus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/causprod/","147 products in account","Despite its quirks (graphical hiccups, repeated NPCs, wonky combat) and the absolute NEED to mod V:tM-B in order to run it on modern systems, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is, hands-down, one of the best RPGs - and possibly the best vampire game - ever made. Simply put, LA does not give two hoots about you, and events are only driven forward when you begin to interfere. Nevermind that vampires have generally fallen out of favor amongst gamers - this is one that should be played through at least once. Lust, hunger, betrayal, and hard decisions - its all here.\n\nExpect to die at least a couple of times; the game doesn't pull its punches, and will backhand anyone thinking they're running on rails. The game's world may seem small, but given that the game is over 10 years old now it has quite a bit of space to roam. Maybe not Witcher levels of freedom, but very few of the game's quests are (or really feel like) fetch quests. The things you do change how the game plays, and each Family has their own oddities to them - both good and bad.\n\nIf there ever was a game that needed a graphical (and gameplay) overhaul, though, it would be this one. The visuals, while striking, are severly dated, and you'll see the same bums/hookers/random people begin to repeat over and over after a while (although it does give the feeling that the city is beginning to mess with your head). As well, the combat system feels severely tacked-on, and while functional, it is almost ALWAYS preferable to go in with a gun rather than a bat or blade, as melee combat suffers the worst. While it only becomes troublesome in a few areas, those can be the places that make one throw the keyboard in disgust.\n\nFinally, as mentioned, the game will NOT run unpatched, so picking up an unofficial patch is necessary to run it on a system with a Windows 7 or newer OS (not sure about Vista; it might work, but it definitely doesn't on W7). Attempting to run the game unpatched causes many issues, so don't even think about it.\n\nOverall, though, it is worth picking up (especially when it goes on-sale), as it was Troika's last game before they went bankrupt, and while buggy their games have managed to pick up cult classic status over the years. Beyond that, its a damn good convoluted tale featuring the children of the night, and certainly deserves praise for making the player FEEL like they're a bloodsucking monster.","December 28, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My applause to wesp.\n\nI'm about to be honest and give this great game a hard review. No doubt that this game is quite unique in what it offers, a traditional RPG experience in a dark themed vampire world. The best part of it hands down is the story and the immersive atmosphere of the game. The story and the text is so deep and extensive that you lose yourself just talking to so many characters and getting insight into their stories and background information of the latest happenings.\n\nI have a few issues with it so here comes the tough love;\n\n1. It is unplayable without the patch\n\n2. Even with the patch it has its share of buggy moments\n\n3. Combat :(\n\nOh dear. This is what stopped this game from being the my top 5 RPG games of all time; RPG being my favourite genre of games. It really kills the immersion and knocks down a potentially near perfect game (for its time). The combat is just so wonky and I wouldn't take issue with this if the game was a lot more focused on interaction in the world, solving mysteries and story driven. However a decent chunk of the mission design is combat based and its painfully bad to the point where I just took every shortcut and option possible to avoid it, including console commands later in the game because I hated the combat so much. I could go into more detail, but I'll leave it at that.\n\n4. Furthermore the game is a little clunky in places as you go through it and I've had a few times where the game just freezes.\n\n5. I also had to do additional tweaking of the game just to prevent motion sickness by adjusting FOV, resolution and playing 3rd person often when I felt a little sick (despite FOV fix)\n\n6. There are sound issues that have to be also seperately addressed in settings to prevent echoing\n\nStory 10/10\n\nGraphics (doesn't mater)\n\nGameplay (8.5/10)\n\nControls (♥♥♥♥ed)\n\nIf you have the time and energy to give modify this game with the official patch and tweak it to get it running properly you will 100% enjoy this game if you're an RPG fan, however those who are new to PC gaming or steam I'd avoid it because of the modifications neccessary for optimal experience.\n\nI'd only recommend this game with the patch and tweaks!\n\nFinal Verdict: 8/10 Overall. Solid experience with an excellent story, brought down unfortunately by the controls and combat. Takes a spot in my top 10 RPG games.\n\n\n\n","June 28, 2015","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't normally play horror games and while the game was fine for the most part, when the more freaky bits of horror intruded I didn't enjoy the game quite so much. My Steam playing time won't be accurrate as I copied the game files out of the Steam directory so I could install the unofficial patch. I don't know how the game played without the patch, but it certainly played fine with it. In fact, I couldn't play the game unpatched as it instantly crashes on startup (hence it sitting unused in my library for so long). The only way I could write this review was by starting the game, watching it crash, then leave the "vampire.exe has stopped working" message open for 5 mins to trick Stream into thinking I'd played :)\n\nLots of quests, interesting characters, and a fairly interesting story with a unexpected ending. Graphics are a mixed bag, but I did find that some of the expression animations to do a pretty accurate job. Levels are fairly linear but they do.\n\nOf course, during the questions as the start of the game I answered in the sneaky vein where I could and so ended up as a Nosferatu which possibly isn't the best choice of character for a first playthrough - pretty much everyone runs screaming from you, and you have to sneak pretty much all the time, unless you use the sewers, which I did find tedious and just stuck with flittering around the surface.\n\nBut if I play through this game again, I think I'll try a melee heavy class that looks human. At least I'll won't have to hide all the time and assumbly will get different dialog trees and be able to speak to characters I couldn't before.","May 11","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As apposed to most role–playing games, Bloodlines offers a more diverse approach to the platform, creating near unique scenarios for each different Clan, outfitted with bespoke abilities and skills. One of the more enjoyable qualities of Bloodlines is that – and unlike most other games of the same genre – content transcends the battle front, development and progression is key to successs. Having said that, combat is equally as awesome as storyline content, and one of the funnest aspect of the game for me so far has been trying out different Clans, and seeing how they work differently with dialogue and the eventual endgame, there's to say it's a very redoable game as long as you broaden your horizons for each new character and select a different Clan for your playthrough.\n\n100% recommendable for RPG fans.","June 4","true","47.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A well made story, and fun gameplay that makes me have to think. This game delivered on both fronts fantastically. I would even go so far as to say that this is my second favorite game of all time (the first being DA:O) The game not only has branching dialog options, but multiple factions and endings. It also has a level up system similar to shadowrun, with you being able to improve both combat and non combat skills. This makes balancing your character hard, because while you may be able to talk your way out of some fights, not all of them will be easy or even possible. The game made for a fun experience where I felt like a bloodsucker stalking the streets of hollywood, caught up in a battle with multiple choices and vital decisions that could change the world. Overall, the great story wrapped me up in a web and I thought about the moral and fatal conse qunces of every action, from decisions that could shake the world, to where to spend my experience so that i could spend another night breathing, VTMB had me thinking about every action, and their consequences. 10/10\n\nP.S.

It’s true the game won’t run on a modern OS without the unofficial patch, which is shameful on Activision’s part, especially since the creator of the patch offered it to them for free.\n\nBut despite the annoyance of getting the game running, it has a 94% approval rating here on Steam. Indeed it seems nearly everyone that actually managed to play the game liked it. That speak volumes of the game.\n\nApart from getting the game running is it flawless? Not entirely, the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. While the combat isn’t as clunky as the first Deus Ex, enemies with fully automatic weapons will kill you in about two seconds, though these enemies mostly appear towards the end of the game and thankfully stealth is preposterously easy.\n\nSo why play this game? Simple: Atmosphere and Characters. This game has such wonderful way of making you feel like a creature of the night. The graphics are obviously dated, but there are nice touches such as animated facial expressions. The original soundtrack is great, although the cheap licensed rock music playing in the various nightclubs is terrible.\n\nWhat really keeps me coming back to this game is the characters. Though most of them are clinically dead they are more alive the character in any other game I’ve played. The dialogue is brilliantly written and voice acted. It’s just a delight to talk to people in this game. The Vampire Politics at the heart of the game are also really fascinating and how you treat the different factions affects which endings are available to you.\n\nDespite the problems with getting it running and the rather poor gameplay this is a must play if you like good writing in games. If, however, you only care about gameplay this game is not for you.","June 1","true","281.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The melee combat is a little wonky and a little difficult to control to the degree one desires. There are a couple of "filler" points in the game where a level extends further than necessary for atmosphere and story-telling purposes.

I seriously cannot do enough to recommend it to anybody who has even the most microscopic interest in RPGs. If you like vampires and White Wolf franchises in the World of Darkness, it's an absolute must-buy.\nIf you do buy it, however, you should be prepared to download the official 1.2 patch, or the famous Unofficial Patch by Wesp5. The game does have a few bugs, but either of those patches will solve them. Combat is also a little repetitive, but challenging for all the Clans; it's a mix of point-and-shoot and slice-and-dice melee. However, the game truly shines in its application of the setting and characters, all of which are representative of the World of Darkness, the larger world setting in which vampires, ghosts, werewolves, and all the nightmares of humankind are made real.","October 28, 2011","true","136.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

I am a huge vampire fan and for my entire life I've waited for a game like this, not knowing it was right under my nose the entire time. It is totally worth the full price, and it gets %75 on every sale so there's literally no reason not to buy this.\n\nPros:\nA great story, accompanied by characters you'll love or love to hate\nPretty dark  world that feels gothic, even though it's just Santa Monica at night\nAged well, graphics would not bother you at all if you're not obsessd with next gen stuff etc\nGameplay is pretty nice and gives you lots of different options about how to play. You can even finish lots of quests with speechcraft. Adds replayability to the game\nIt is pretty realistic, you can't go around butchering people like there's no tomorrow since you'll lose humanity and succumb into the beast, if you try to play like not drinking any blood you'll die. You can even role play and drink the blood of animals/blood packs.\n\nCons:\nWith some builds you can't go too far in the game. Like if you only skilled bloodmagic as your combat choice you can't get passed the sewer episode since creatures there won't give you any blood.\nEven though the story was great, the ending kinda felt rushed.\nGame needs to be patched manually before it can be played(not exactly a con, just wanted to point it out)\n\n\nSo long story short, BUY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME YOU WON'T REGRET IT","December 27, 2015","true","93.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I bought it originally in 2004 when it came out, but bought it now on Steam just to have another copy. It's that good. I seriously cannot do enough to recommend it to anybody who has even the most microscopic interest in RPGs. If you like vampires and White Wolf franchises in the World of Darkness, it's an absolute must-buy.\nIf you do buy it, however, you should be prepared to download the official 1.2 patch, or the famous Unofficial Patch by Wesp5. The game does have a few bugs, but either of those patches will solve them. Combat is also a little repetitive, but challenging for all the Clans; it's a mix of point-and-shoot and slice-and-dice melee. However, the game truly shines in its application of the setting and characters, all of which are representative of the World of Darkness, the larger world setting in which vampires, ghosts, werewolves, and all the nightmares of humankind are made real.","October 28, 2011","true","136.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

The best ARPG I've played. Seven distinctive classes (read: bloodlines, get it?) and a complex network of attributes, talents and disciplines send players through unique story archs, creating genuinely exciting replay potential. Impactful decision-making, above average dialogue and tough, ultraviolent combat combine to create a level of immersion rarely attained in all video gaming. The GTA-style open world is packed with fun, story-driven quests that span a broad spectrum of level designs, some of which are among my favorite to date (many are truly terrifying), all of them teeming with World of Darkness's inspired takes on classic horror creatures. The "feeding" logic is immensely satifying. Add the inventive weapons and gear and the result is an unprecedented completeness of world building. Easily one of my favorite games, period.\n\nThe game is sexist and racist, which sucks because it really is among of the greatest of all time. The sole black NPC wears a basketball jersey, sports an afro, refers to women as "baby girl" and, in conversation, when he invites the player to eat with him, there is a dialogue option that reads: "Couldn't I just watch the monkeys feed down at the zoo?"...Not funny! This and the gleefully violent sexual rhetoric in many of the in-game emails (and general objectification of women characters) suggest a troubling level of depravity on the part of the staff at Troika and Activision.","April 10, 2015","true","114.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is absolute genuis. The story is VERY well writen, the graphics hold up incredibly well considering when this game was made (however mods are recomended), the characters feel real, and the combat is very satisfying. That being said make sure you download the unofficial patch because this game is broken without it. You only gain experience by completing quests and there are ALOT of them. The side quests can distract you from the story for awhile but they aren't needed to complete the game but its recomended that you do them in order to level-up your stats. At the begining of the game you really only need melee skill, but once you get farther in you really need some ranged skill or your gonna have a hard time. You can pick from 7 diferent vampire clans each one VERY different from the others, even more so if you pick a background for your character, but thats not required. There are some pretty dark moments, but its a game about modern day vampires so there kinda has to be. I HIGHLY recommend this game to any RPG fan, you will not regret buying this game. This game is very underrated and deserves much more attention and recognition.","March 23, 2014","true","54.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

From my perspective, you have a game that is very much like the original Deus Ex in terms of choice by in-game actions or conversations mixed with a compelling atmosphere perfect for the location and time period of the story.  Being able to make various choices or alternate routes of completing goals is awesome.  The 90s pop / gothic vampire cults imbued in Southern California culture is convincing and enjoyable.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some design decisions that prevent it from being the same great addicting experience that is Deus Ex.  The combat is lousy.  While Deus Ex has aged in terms of gunplay, there are at least mechanics to perform instanteous lethal kills or knockouts.  While stealth holds up with human foes, it is somewhat hindered in my point of view by the third person perspective that is forced when equipped with a melee weapon.  When firing at an aware NPC, the combat feels similar to a bullet sponge FPS with no ADS.  Think Halo.  This would not be a problem if you did not get forced into critical situations requiring combat, however, there are boss fights that must be completed throughout the main quest.\n\nCombat aside, the game has trouble with pacing.  Some times you can become stuck trying to find an item or clue that will set you off on the next thread of the main quest.  While tinkering around the world is enjoyable, being lost in 90s computer records is not great.\n\nAnyways, I think this game should definitely be played.  Buy it when on sale and dedicate 6 hours of game time before calling quits.  Also, spending time with a character creation guide to make the most of your skills and vampire powers is advised.\n\n[GET AT SALE]","December 26, 2013","true","24.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The graphics may be dated but this game is seriously awesome, if you got textures problems then deactivate/activate '' bump mapping '' in the options In game, it works great for me.\nIf your game won't launch/crash then launch the game in administrator mode and Windows XP (Service Pack 2) it works for me, you can also download the custom patches but I'm not using them and the game is working pretty fine.\n\nNow, you'll probably say '' vampires are gay and it's gay to watch/play them ''. Well I've never seen a vampire that was gay and I actually love girls and only girls.\nVampires are awesome, supernatural stuff always been awesome and the vampires are In my opinion, the greatest, now of course Twilight is another story, Twilight is giving a bad name to the vampires but do not trust Twilight, it's stupid.\n\nVampire: The Masquerade, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Castlevania, Legacy of Kain, BloodRayne, Blood Omen, Darkstalkers, Soul Reaver, Nosferatu, Dracula: Undead Awakening and The Elder Scrolls just to name some, there are some others that are really great, that's about it for the video games.\n\nThe Vampire Diaries, True Blood, The Originals, Buffy the Vampire Slayer are some great vampire TV series. The Vampire Diaries and The Originals are my favorites, you'll love them if you love history and supernatural even if they're not really horror, drama and suspense, True Blood is really great too.\n\nLet Me In, Near Dark, Blade are some great vampire movies.\n\nHellsing, Vampire Knight, Blood + are some great vampire animes.\n\nThere are also books like The Vampire Diaries (the original serie and the new one) and probably many more but I am not much of a reader.\n\n\nIf you've watched, played, read all of them and didn't like any of them then you're just not to Vampire/Supernatural stuff.\n\nLook at the vampire lord in The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, It is amazing, not like Twilight.\nVampires can be pretty badass actually, just stop looking at Twilight.\nI seriously wish that there would be another Vampire The Masquerade but It probably won't happen.\n\nAnyway great game, I recommend 9.5/10 and don't forget, Twilight is simply stupid, vampires aren't about beauty, In the Vampire Diaries they manage to make it awesome but normally vampires are supposed to be scary so do not believe Twilight.\nNo hate, just facts, If you like Twilight then it's good for you, I don't really care but it's not a true vampire movie, it's just some random movie for 8 years old and mainstream girls.\n\n9.5/10","January 29, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

By now, a very active community of enthusiasts has fixed 99% of these problems with their unofficial patches. And the game is an absolute gem. Brilliant writing, memorable characters, dialogues and settings. I Recommend it wholeheartedly. Where else can you play a batshit crazy vampire who ventures to have a conversation with a stop sign?\n\nWhile the story is quite linear, it provides reason to replay it because the different clans of vampires provide very unique game experiences: Some, like Toreador and Ventrue, will be able to talk themselves out of most situations. The Nosferatu look like the monsters they are and will cause a panic the moment a mortal sees them, which leads to a focus on sneaking and exploring the sewers of the city. The Brujah are combat experts, inviting a hack'n'slash melee-fest. Others, like the Tremere, focus on magic.\nAnd then there's the Malkavians, a strand of vampires who's very blood causes insanity, leading to some of the craziest dialogues in video game history. They can (temporarily?) cause insanity in others - who wouldn't want to make their annoying ex think you're their long lost pet turtle? It also allows them a near prophetic insight into their conversation partners' thoughts and motives - That is, if you listen to the right voices n your head and ignore the others...","February 22, 2015","true","41.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As such the graphics are not up to par with current standards. Moreover, the base game is riddled with quirky to game breaking bugs. However, there is a dedicated patch by fans that solves all these issues and brings new (restored from the orginal concept) powers and game balances to the game. My review will be about the game with this unofficial patch for that is the way to experience this game.\n\nVTM is a RPG about vampire in the setting of the likewise named pen & paper version. The main abilities of your vampire depend on the clan you choose. Although all of them share the greater part of skills, you have unique abilities linked to your clan that are at times shared by another but never in the same combination. Furthermore your background alters your starting proficiencies, and your sex does matter in the game at some small points.\n\nThe game seems to be made out of two parts. The beginning is a true RPG, with heavy quests and side-quests, intrigue, and the ability to stealth, talk or fight through these quests (not all of these opportunities for each quest, but most of the time at least 2). After a certain point though, the game starts more to become a Hack & Slash RPG - probably to allow you to use all those cool vampire powers you have been putting points into, but it does break the experience a bit here. Regardless of that the RPG does have some adult stuff, even if it black screens at moment supremes, it at least does not shy from it. The feel of the world is dark indeed and it feels trully unlike other RPGs.\n\nReplaybility is supposedly low as with other story driven RPGs, but I would advice using some clans for a second or third run (I did them all) for some of them are quite the game changer - like the Nosferatu or Malkavian vs. the other clans - moreso than just another class in e.g. Baldur's Gate. Now I did all the clans for runs and you can see from my profile I do not have a huge amount of hours in game, thus it is not very long - but the price is also not high.\n\nIn my opinion this game is definately worth the pricetag for a relative short RPG in a very unique environment.","April 17, 2015","true","264.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The best ARPG I've played. Seven distinctive classes (read: bloodlines, get it?) and a complex network of attributes, talents and disciplines send players through unique story archs, creating genuinely exciting replay potential. Impactful decision-making, above average dialogue and tough, ultraviolent combat combine to create a level of immersion rarely attained in all video gaming. The GTA-style open world is packed with fun, story-driven quests that span a broad spectrum of level designs, some of which are among my favorite to date (many are truly terrifying), all of them teeming with World of Darkness's inspired takes on classic horror creatures. The "feeding" logic is immensely satifying. Add the inventive weapons and gear and the result is an unprecedented completeness of world building. Easily one of my favorite games, period.\n\nThe game is sexist and racist, which sucks because it really is among of the greatest of all time. The sole black NPC wears a basketball jersey, sports an afro, refers to women as "baby girl" and, in conversation, when he invites the player to eat with him, there is a dialogue option that reads: "Couldn't I just watch the monkeys feed down at the zoo?"...Not funny! This and the gleefully violent sexual rhetoric in many of the in-game emails (and general objectification of women characters) suggest a troubling level of depravity on the part of the staff at Troika and Activision.","April 10, 2015","true","114.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics may be dated but this game is seriously awesome, if you got textures problems then deactivate/activate '' bump mapping '' in the options In game, it works great for me.\nIf your game won't launch/crash then launch the game in administrator mode and Windows XP (Service Pack 2) it works for me, you can also download the custom patches but I'm not using them and the game is working pretty fine.\n\nNow, you'll probably say '' vampires are gay and it's gay to watch/play them ''. Well I've never seen a vampire that was gay and I actually love girls and only girls.\nVampires are awesome, supernatural stuff always been awesome and the vampires are In my opinion, the greatest, now of course Twilight is another story, Twilight is giving a bad name to the vampires but do not trust Twilight, it's stupid.\n\nVampire: The Masquerade, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Castlevania, Legacy of Kain, BloodRayne, Blood Omen, Darkstalkers, Soul Reaver, Nosferatu, Dracula: Undead Awakening and The Elder Scrolls just to name some, there are some others that are really great, that's about it for the video games.\n\nThe Vampire Diaries, True Blood, The Originals, Buffy the Vampire Slayer are some great vampire TV series. The Vampire Diaries and The Originals are my favorites, you'll love them if you love history and supernatural even if they're not really horror, drama and suspense, True Blood is really great too.\n\nLet Me In, Near Dark, Blade are some great vampire movies.\n\nHellsing, Vampire Knight, Blood + are some great vampire animes.\n\nThere are also books like The Vampire Diaries (the original serie and the new one) and probably many more but I am not much of a reader.\n\n\nIf you've watched, played, read all of them and didn't like any of them then you're just not to Vampire/Supernatural stuff.\n\nLook at the vampire lord in The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, It is amazing, not like Twilight.\nVampires can be pretty badass actually, just stop looking at Twilight.\nI seriously wish that there would be another Vampire The Masquerade but It probably won't happen.\n\nAnyway great game, I recommend 9.5/10 and don't forget, Twilight is simply stupid, vampires aren't about beauty, In the Vampire Diaries they manage to make it awesome but normally vampires are supposed to be scary so do not believe Twilight.\nNo hate, just facts, If you like Twilight then it's good for you, I don't really care but it's not a true vampire movie, it's just some random movie for 8 years old and mainstream girls.\n\n9.5/10","January 29, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game has something for everybody and may try way too hard in some places but makes up for it with variety, fun, and creative level designs that become familiar rather quickly. After installing the unofficial patch to fix this game, it becomes one of the best games you'll play from the 2000's. Take it as an RPG/Dialogue sim or make it a FPS, there's no wrong way to play this game and it'll give you enough option to try as many routes as you want without much repetition outside of the main storyline. Buy it, play it, then play it again in a completely different way and as a completely different class - this game will let very few players down.\n\nPros:\n+High replayability including multiple endings and a GOOD variety of classes/clans.\n+Excellent Voice Acting\n+Decent Combat System\n+Great Environments\n+Memorable Characters\n+Great Writing and an interesting plot\n+Informative menus and inventories with a quest log\n\nCons:\n-Bugged as hell (fixed with the unofficial patches)\n-Music is pretentious and laughable and sounds like somebody compressed three entire Hot Topics into a soundtrack\n-Backtracking becomes tedious\n\n","February 8, 2015","true","160.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Doesn't age at all.\nAwesome soundtrack, great plot, including side-quests, non-linear gameplay, a variety of classes and skills.\n\n\nEach clan has its own style, they are typically divided into classic groups: warrior, mage, marksman, thief, the-one-who-talks etc. I recommend to play with Malkavian or Nosferatu on your SECOND try, as the difficulty with these clans is higher due to their appearance and manner of speech. Totally different game.\n\n\nBugs and dated graphics are the only things that can bother: sometimes scripts don't work, sometimes the game crashes, you can encounter some glitches, but let's face the truth: Fallout 3 & 4 have the same problems, but you still play 'em.\nThat's why it is important to save all the time and two have at least 2-3 active saves.","November 25, 2013","true","20.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercury7elite/recommended/2600/","mercury7elite","Game Cooker US Rocks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercury7elite/","170 products in account","Great game overall but it was rushed out the door because of money issues but the game is still a masterpiece even as is. There are unofficial mods that will make the game play better and also change it as well. Play it through once with the official patches and then MOD it. Be sure to investigate the world and do the side quests to open up more side quests. Have fun. It is made with the Source 2 engine I believe.\n\nForget about all the negatives people have said about this game. It is well worth 5, 10 or 20 dollars even with it's age. The only reason this game was released before it was polished up is BIG F'ing GAME COMPANIES who want dev teams to rush out their content. When this game was bought out that company could have spend a few thousand dollars finishing it up and made multi-millions off it but short sighted money hungry attitudes killed that idea. The game as is is a Vampire Masterpiece and I am not a fanatic of vampire stuff.\n\nEven if you don't like RPGs this game is still appealing. Yes the graphics are not as they should be, nor is the controls on PC but the overall atmosphere, storyline, quests, items you can use, characters, dialog, areas to travel, humor, horror, music, etc. are very original and immersive and enjoyable.\n\nAbout patches: There is no real company to work on this game anymore so there are no fixes from those who created the game. But there are many mods out there that do fix a lot of broken things in the game and even some mods that overhaul the game extensively. There are model and skin patches as well. Nude and otherwise. The mods are NOT hard to install. If you can read it is very simple. The only thing that I had an issue with is the game not running on install from Steam and in 64bit mode. There is a patch to fix this. Sorry I do not have the links at the moment. Google them or look on the community page.\n\nI have the boxed version and the Steam version and have played it lots of times in many ways. All have been pleasurable experiences. I recommend playing through without modding it first if you can or at least not using the overhaul mods that change too much of the game. Then play again with the conversion MODS.\n\nThe game gets a 10/10 for me even with the quirks and work I have to do to get it to work efficiently.","November 4, 2015","true","55.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As I see it, the plethora of bugfixes and restored content make the game much more enjoyable than the latest official release. The patch, downloadable from the Patches Scrolls (google that :P ) is a must-have in my opinion.\n\nAs we're dealing with a game from... 2004, if memory serves... the graphics aren't top notch anymore and they never were, but they're realistic enough not to be a pain for the eyes. The Source Engine definitely helps with the realistic facial expressions and there's a lot of those. The music is a quite moody ambient-sounding set of tracks, however this changes when you enter the nightclubs - all the tracks used in those seem similar to one another, so similar they quickly bore. The sound effects - they are just there. Neither especially good or bad, just... there.\n\nWhat the game shines in is the story. While fairly linear, it can be experienced in several different ways due to the number of different vampire clans available. The NPCs will react differently to a Ventrue than they do to a Malkavian, for obvious reasons - both clans have different personality traits. Ventrue are cunning in political nuances whereas Malkavian are insane, each of them. There are five different endings available too, so there's a lot of replay value.\n\nAside from the story, the game is a hybrid of RPG and FPS. The RPG aspects are focused on increasing your skills and traits in order to fare better in problem solutions of your choice, however you won't be able to avoid killing others in order to have your way and that's what the FPS aspect is for: guns, blades, combat disciplines - all this has but one goal. To kill. And depending on which side you pick, you'll get to kill some of the other side. The World of Darkness is a brutal place.\n\nI could mention a whole lot of flaws - but the continuous support for the game - even if unofficial - and the amount of hours I spent on playing it even before I got it on Steam, all this speaks for itself. A 10/10 from me and a badass seal of approval.","August 15, 2014","true","52.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

As a result, the game is rather buggy, featuring shoddy AI, missing content, broken stealth mechanics, and other annoyances.\n\nIn spite of that, this is perhaps one of my favorite games I've ever played. This is an absolutely charming and underrated game.\nIt's a closed sandbox RPG: think Deus Ex (a masterpiece) but set in the modern world... and with vampires and other creatures of the night.\n\nThere are seven different vampire clans you can choose to be part of. Can't decide which one? Then take the quiz the game offers, I got the Tremere: the spellcasting mages that use blood as their mana. Allowing you to steal an opponent's blood from a distance or internally "boil" their blood until they explode into a visceral masterpiece. It's rather adorable, honestly.\nThe gameplay is similar to Deus Ex, an RPG first person action game with multiple choices affecting the story, thus each playthrough is different from the other.\n\nThere are multiple weapons to use: firearms, melee weapons, and your own clan skills are all fun to use. There is also a skill tree allowing you to customize and enchance your proficiency in certain categories, although many of the skills are rather useless save for a few circumstances.\n\nThe graphics aren't too shabby to be honest. This is the first game to use the Source engine (even before Half Life 2) and while dated by today's standards, is still a fairly nice game to look at. The facial animations in particular look great.\nThe atmosphere though is simply wonderful: the characters all feel real, the voice acting is well done, and this game's world just feels alive in its own undead way. The writing is top notch too, this is one of the funniest games I've ever played, and I still haven't started my second playthrough as a Malkavian!\n\nThe bugs I mentioned before? There are fanmade fixes for them (I recommend the unofficial patch), in fact there are a lot of mods available for this game. Proof of its quality.\n\nOverall, despite its flaws, this is an awesome game that I recommend for anyone who enjoyed Deus Ex, or you really like vampires.","June 20, 2014","true","25.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Which I heard is a more difficult vampire tribe to play but it's really fun. Often you'll hear voices saying really creepy things because well Malkavian are crazy. And other NPC will respond to that.

Not a lot of people know about it, partially because it has some flaws which are off putting to some.\n\nIt runs on an early version of the Source engine, which is just so sucky and glitchy.\n\nAnother flaw is combat. It can be a bit boring and way to difficult, especially melee because it is clunky and awkward. There is supposed to be a system of pushing directional keys to vary your swings, but it doesn't work well. I high recommend playing a gun-wielding character.\n\nHowever, in the long run, combat is mostly avoidable (more on that later), so it doesn't matter too much.\n\nOther than that, this game is perfect. You get to play as a vampire for one thing, which is awsome. I know of no RPG like this except Oblivion, but those aren't real vampires in that game. The world's lore about secret vampire societies and laws is really well thought out and interesting. The sheer amount of it shows you how much work the developers put into the game.\n\nAnother great feature is the story. I just felt that it was really cool and interesting. It's very subtle and mature without being too long-winded. The dialouge is really awesome as well. In fact, both the voice acting AND the writting of the characters made me feel like I was watching a movie or reading a novel.\n\nThe gameplay and rules system is also extremely well done. You're assigned experience for completeing goals. Thats it. No XP from killing things. A lot of RPG's award too much XP for killing, and as a result you're actually punished for finding alternate soloutions because you'll be under leveled. In VTMB, there are always multiple ways to finish a quest. You could be a cowboy and fight your way through it, or you could look around for a way to sneak in. Or maybe you can hack a computer? Don't forget charming, persuading, or intimidating people to get your way. You're allowed to play any way you want and have tons of freedom. More RPG's need to be this way.\n\nAll things considered, VTMB is an awesome game that compensates for it's flaws with a legendary story and backdrop. It's a must have for RPG fans who like vampires.","November 5, 2014","true","49.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
