Lo, with the modern education game you get little but distractions, but with you the little ones have entire worlds to explore and creatures to discover. This,was their first game I ever played, and returning to it today after over a decade since I last touched it, I can see that they spared no expense. Every passage in the index is fully voiced, and each individual creature I came across had multiple goofy interactions that sometimes intersected with others. Somehow even old Buggy isn't as annoying as he probably should be, but that could be the nostalgia talking.\n\nSo many secrets, so many gags, and still rather pretty; even 20 years later, still better than the competition. I have a feeling my nieces will love this as much as I do, and if you have kids of your own that want to learn in a more silly and fun way, look no further. I look forward to seeing how the rest of the collection has aged.\n\nEdit: And of course, a thanks is needed to Night Dive studios for gaining the ability to release these again. As always, you guys are the best.","December 10, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It can be difficult to navigate through and get lost, which may make some Find It challenges rather frustrating if you don't know where to look.\n\nDoubt information here is outdated much, but regardless gives young leaners a general look of three known jungles (and they're not close to each other as the game shows).","May 5","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Seems like I love this game as a 25 year old too. Was surprised it was on steam since it's mostly for kids, but Ant Eater Feeder is still AMAZING. Also the neat colouring book!\nGet this for your young kids, or for you if you want some (mostly) stress free ant eating and jungle exploring.","April 4","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
