YEP.\nPlenty of shooting of natural and supernatural enemies in well-paced fight encounters? YEP.\nLots and lots of booby traps to avoid, disarm, or survive? YEP.\nPuzzles that usually involve timing, platforming and typical Lara acrobatics? YEP.\nSmartass one-liners and quips from Lara almost everytime she opens her mouth? Yep.\nWell-placed and often hidden collectibles? Yep.\nMANY, MANY GUNS? YEP.\nTomb raiding? You bet!\n\nThe controls are snappy and responsive, the puzzles and platforming are very satisfying, and ultimately pretty much everything about the gameplay is rewarding in some way. Every level has a handful of optional objectives you can try to complete for even more rewards -- such as artifacts or relics that boost your stats or combat ability in various ways. The game's visuals and audio both are actually a hell of a lot better than I expected, and I often found myself gleefully looking around to admire the level design or dancing around a boss in time with the boss stage's music.\n\nBonus: You can play this with a friend, and the game even redesigns much of the levels' puzzles to accomodate 2 players. The second player character, Totec, CANNOT be played on his own, i.e. if you're playing on your own, Lara is your only option. But, well, she's the far cooler option anyway. :P\n\nA tip: Use a controller. The game only fully recognizes Xbox 360 type controllers but you can very easily fool it into accepting others by using a controller emulator (x360ce). Mouse and keyboard controls have much more precise aiming for shooting, but I found they just were too clunky for me for -everything- else.","September 25, 2014","true","22.0"," 89 of 103 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","89","103","3","0"

Fortunately, this game is quite an enjoyable experience.\n\nLara finds herself in Central America looking for an artifact called the Mirror of Smoke. After a long journey, she is successful, but a group of mercenaries led by a local warlord ambushes Lara and misuses the mirror, unleashing Xolotl, the aztec god of death and darkness. Totec, the Guardian of Light, is then awaken - he informs Lara that Xolotl must be stopped until dawn, otherwise, the world will face certain doom.\n\nThe story is really predictable and shallow. You release an evil god and you spend the whole game chasing him. The thing is, you are always on his heels, so he feels like a total coward, constantly running away. Its design is also bad in comparison with all the other bosses; he looks too cartoony and the stakes are never high. You don't care about any of the characters and the only reason you "care" about Lara is because of how well-established she already is as a videogame character/icon. If she was a new character, we would know nothing about her. You can play as Lara (Singleplayer/Multiplayer) or Totec (Multiplayer only) and the levels design changes accordingly.\n\nThe game can be played with a single player and a second player can connect at any time - Locally or Online.\nSingle player is good but I would suggest playing Local Co-op for a full, rich experience.\nLocal Co-op is amazing - solving puzzles with a buddy is awesome. You can also kill your teammate so there are a ton of possibilities for revenge and a few laughs, usually followed by an impalled/crushed ally.\nOn the other hand, Online Co-op is full of bugs and there are a lot of synch problems. Bullets doing nothing to enemies and Totec's spears not spawning (they are necessary to cross certain obstacles) are only some of the bugs I encountered with friends.\n\nThe gameplay is this game's main strength; it focuses on platforming, combat and puzzle solving.\n\nPlatforming is relatively simple. Lara and Totec can use their gadgets to get to higher places or to cross pits and chasms. Totec has a shield that allows Lara to jump on him and perform a bigger jump, allowing her to reach higher platforms; Lara can then pull him up using her grapple. Totec also has spears; once thrown against a wall, Lara can use these to cross certain obstacles.\n\nCombat is good. You have a lot of weapons to choose from but you'll find yourself using the same combination over and over again. Once you kill enough enemies, you'll enter some sort of berserk mode and you'll get an upgrade - mana/health regenaration, scatter shots or even better mines - that will last until you are hit by your enemies. This kind of makes the game's combat super easy. If you pick a powerful weapon and you keep regenarating mana, you'll be able to kill everything with ease. Your enemies are a bunch of clumsy demons and summons who are kind of shallow in design, but they offer a decent enough challenge later on, when their numbers are massive. Some of these creatures get a different color pallet on certain levels, which provides them with different abilites (ressurection, explosion when killed, etc.). My real gripe with the enemies is that you only come across a really limited number of different creatures. More variety would have been better.\n\nThe puzzles are quite easy to figure out and only slightly harder to solve. You'll have to time jumps and dodges, activate pressure pads and deactivate hazards/barriers that block your way. Their design is really good and the scale grows bigger and more impressive in later levels. Unfortunately, even harder puzzles are sort of basic and provide no real challenge..\n\nTo mix things up and add replay value, each level provides some optional challenges to complete. They can be really easy to complete - destroy all trucks in a level or jump 12 times over a trap - or "infuriating" (complete the whole level in under X minutes or  navigate a trap-filled hall on your first attempt). Once completed, these challenges provide helpful new weapons, health/mana upgrades or even relics. Relics are equippable items - they change your stats and help you in combat (better bombs, better speed, etc.).\n\nSound is kinda generic - guns don't really sound all that great but it's serviceable (explosions sound good, though). The dialogue is really cheesy and considering the story is also bad, you won't care about what the characters are saying - not that it matters. The game features a good soundtrack - I might be wrong but I think some of it was used in Tomb Raider Anniversary and maybe even in TR Legend and Underworld.\n\nThe game looks fairly decent. You'll have some graphical glitches from time to time but the game knows what it is and it tends to amaze you with huge environments  instead of with graphical detail. Character models are ok, but their lips do not move during cutscenes; the camera angle keeps changing so players won't notice.\n\nOverrall, this game is a great purchase if you enjoy inventive puzzle solving, mixed with a fair amount of combat and platforming. It might have big flaws, including what was supposed to be its main selling point (online co-op) but the gameplay is so satisfying and local co-op is so good that this is an experience I gladly recommend. The game currently costs 10€ - I'd suggest getting it on a sale. I think it is worth 5€ if you are desperate for a puzzle game but it goes on sale fairly often so I'd wait for a 75/80% discount.\n\nFinal Score: 7.5 out of 10.","September 29, 2015","true","22.7"," 66 of 70 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","66","70","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/35130/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is exemplary coop ingenuity.\n\nTransplanting the Tomb Raider franchise onto an isometric shooter, its genius lies not within its clever puzzles or satisfying combat, but the lengths at which it has been designed from the ground up as a brilliant coop experience. It forces you to think with two players in mind instead of opting for the far simpler solution of just dropping another player in beside you, and this devotion makes for refreshingly unique puzzle designs and the means with which you navigate the world.\n\nThe focus on teamwork is in large part based on the different character abilities between archaeologist, Lara Croft, and the ancient Mayan warrior, Totec. Each has various gear and moves (from a grappling hook, to a shield that can be raised and jumped on) and it's in using them in tandem that you can manage to make your way through environments that one person couldn't. It inspires cooperation in ways that simply providing double the fire power doesn't, putting you in situations where each player has a specific role and no one feels the lesser for theirs.\n\nIt's a fairly radical departure for the series traditional gameplay hooks, but Guardian of Light still feels distinctly Tomb Raider. Though the perspective has changed and there's less of an emphasis on platforming, there are still plenty of supernatural monsters to kill and tombs to raid, with puzzles that are probably the best the series has ever seen. They revisit many of the same designs but in a way that's constantly layering on new challenges, requiring you continue expanding your perception of them even when on the surface they're born of the same basic template.\n\nI don't doubt that it's entirely possible to play Guardian of Light as a solo adventure and have a good amount of fun with it, but to me that would be missing a huge portion of what makes it so enjoyable. There's just nothing quite like the sort of beautiful coop design presented with a game like this, with playing with friends already being generally more entertaining and something so tailor made to that playstyle elevating it to new heights. There's something really special to me about games that can serve as essentially bonding moments between friends and family, and ones as smart and polished as this are all too rare.","December 20, 2014","true","5.7"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","31","38","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mitch13pavel/recommended/35130/","mitch13pavel","Mitch13pavel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mitch13pavel/","566 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5bsyZ96Xes&feature=youtu.be\n\nIt’s a shame they didn’t take notes from Guardian of Light when developing the most recent reboot of Tomb Raider. While Lara croft in the most recent core entry in the Tomb Raider series is trying her best to shed all the enjoyable puzzles and adventuring that made the series famous to instead become the new quick time event action movie star and dethrone Drake from Uncharted, Lara Croft in the Guardians of Light offers everything that made Tomb Raider great.\n\nThe game is centered on fast paced action combat, exploration, and completing various interesting and sometimes challenging puzzles.  Unlike the core entries in the franchise, Guardians of Light takes the approach of having players control the game from an isometric view point, this type of view point allows for a very enjoyable seamless co-op mode experience.\n\nAs far as visuals go there’s nothing in this game that will overwhelm you, but for an isometric view game from 2010 it holds up very well. The level design on the other hand is absolutely brilliant, offering a wide variety of puzzles ranging from one room dungeons to entire expansive multi-tomb map sized puzzles. The puzzles are normally completed through various interactions between Lara and her co-op companion Totec, the Guardian of Light. Each character plays slightly different from one another, each with their own pros and cons, Totec is bulkier and has a shield so he fits more into the role of a tank, he also uses throwing spears as his primary weapon that can also be used to make platforms for the much lighter and more nimble and agile Lara Croft. Totec can also raise his shield above his head to use as a platform and then Lara can use her grappling hook to pull up Totec or make rope bridges for him to climb up. There are many instances in the game where you are put into a situation where you have to act very quickly and rely heavily on your partner to either lift you into the right position or to carry you to safety before you are either crushed, mauled, or mutilated, and in these intense, fast paced, high pressure situations is where the game shines.\n\nThe combat handles just the way you’d expect it to for an isometric view arcade shooter. There aren’t really any complaints as long as you aren’t the guy who gets stuck as player 2 using a gamepad controller, because you’ll be SoL and instead of a crosshair you will get stuck with the tiniest little light that shines on the wall in the direction you are facing as your point of reference for the general area in which you’ll be firing. This honestly wouldn’t be that bad, when you see the light it works really well, but the problem is that it’s constantly being hidden behind objects in the foreground and you have to blindly fire at enemies while you franticly search for your little light. The game does offer a fairly extensive variety of weapons to choose from, from pistols to assault rifles to flame throwers, they’re all present and accounted for.  Each character has their own primary weapon; Lara’s being her pistols and Teco’s being his throwing spears, both of which have unlimited ammunition, all of the other weapons are useable by both characters and their ammunition is monitored by a depleting ammo bar below your health bar that is replenished by the abundant ammo drops located on the map and from enemy drops.\n\nThe game tries to shake things up and keep the gameplay from feeling stale by adding various challenges for each level such as reach the end of the level by “X” amount of time, or blow up a certain number of random objects placed throughout the map. Completion of these challenges result in acquiring a unique perk or item that can be applied to your character to greatly aid you in your adventures.  An example of the most beneficial perk I came across during my adventures was a perk that became activated if I managed to chain together a large enough kill streak without being injured by any enemies, my gun would then switch over to rapid triple shot mode and allow me to plow through hordes of enemies like a true bonafide bad ♥♥♥. The best part is that all the perks and items you acquire are useable on both characters, so you don’t have to worry about your partner hording the juicy loot.\n\nOverall Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light provides an excellent experience that becomes even that much more enjoyable when played with a friend in co-op. The fast paced action combat is thrilling and there is an abundance of quality puzzles that keeps you engaged and entertained. With the only complaint being minor control issues for player 2, the Guardian of Light is truly a game worth buying and enjoying alongside a friend.\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/","February 2, 2015","true","6.9"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

GoL is a mixture of puzzles, combat, arcade elements, and platforming all done from an isometric perspective. Most of the puzzles are clever and juggle between challenging players’ finesse and problem solving skills. There are deadly traps to avoid, and a fun physics system helps transform something as mundane as a boulder into basketball, transportation, or even makeshift artillery. A lot of these shenanigans will lead to player death, but that is also part of the fun.\n\nThe combat is a mix of shooting and planting bombs that are detonated remotely. The controls feel tight, and dodge rolling keeps combat fair and exciting. Combat is also the area where the arcade elements are strongest: each level has a set of various challenges that are completed to boost score and unlock new items directly. The unlocks ranges from new weapons to stat boosts and offers players a healthy amount of options when comes to fighting foes. The arcade style of challenges also pushes players to die less, complete levels faster, and complete some neat tasks. None of the challenges ever get in the way of enjoying the game, and are generally a mix of things that can be done easily on the way to completing the campaign, and more difficult tasks that require practice.\n\nThe absolute most important aspect of the game is the cooperative experience. Having someone to race with leaping across platforms, blow up with bombs, drop into a pit of spikes, leave behind, lock into cages, lead into traps, and just betray in general is a large part of what makes this game fun. Lara and her partner Totec are designed to rely on each other: he has a spear that he’s too fat to climb on but can help Lara reach new areas or a shield to lift and shield Lara, and she a grappling that can support the elephant that is Totec. Co-op also allows players to revive each other, which comes in handy when killing each other. Throughout the game it is simply a lot of fun to work together to find secrets, complete challenges, win, and mess around in general. With every person I play this game with, we end up making our own little challenges and games: balancing on a boulder as we mow down enemies, tag, horse with explosives and boulders, testing how far we can fall into spikes before being saved, etc. and it is an excellent diversion.\n\nLara Croft and The Guardian of Light hits all the marks of a great spinoff and a great co-op experience. I had more fun with this than any other Tomb Raider game, so much so that I bought it multiple times on different platforms. The levels are well designed, the mechanics all feel balanced, and the game is well paced. Sure there is a story that can easily be ignored, but that pushes the game towards an arcade experience focused on having fun with your friends. Out of all the local co-op games I have played, including the old console days, GoL easily ranks high up on the list. That being said, solo is pretty fun on its own, but never quite reaches the same level of satisfaction.","January 16","true","11.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","10","10","5","0"

Overall, great combat allows you to show off your fighting skills and puzzles to get your brain going. Single player achievements are easy enough except the one where it asks you to "collect all relics, artifacts, and weapons", but that's the same in all of those types of achievements.\n\nMultiplayer is dead amongst the community but there are still the very few people who are looking for another coop partner. The coop mode takes on the single player maps and adds a second player to it. Thus, you and your partner must work together strategically and  percisely to complete a mission. There are some tasks that will change, for instance, instead of using balls to open/stop things, your partner will act as the ball. In other words, puzzle structures are similar but solving them are a little different. Coop achievements are super easy to get.\n\nOverall, super enjoyable and fun to play. I've had some friends wat hed me while I played and have all gave back good reviews. So whether you are watching or playing it, everyone seems to enjoy it a lot!

You get a great Third Person Action-Adventure Shooter game mixed with Puzzles you need to solve and a wealth of collectibles to find! This will definitely take you some time to play through the whole adventure and collect everything as there is just so much to collect and so many challenges to solve. I completed Story Mode in Single Player which is a great way to sharpen your skills if you have never played a Tomb Raider game before, but the Multiplayer is also nice. I prefer Single Player as I can get challenges done on my own time and can explore the land freely, but the Multiplayer has some nice advantages and the good part is you can actually play the game with one of your friends!! Aside from the Challenges and Multiplayer, you have a great arsenal of weapons. Anywhere from Spears and Flamethrowers to Pistols and Rocket Launchers, this game will keep you busy trying to choose what weapons you want (as you can only have four equipped, however you can always change them out in one of the Menus.) I still have not quite 100% completed this game. This game will keep you playing for a while after you buy it! If you are willing to spend a little extra dough, the Challenge Packs are always a great add-on. While not incredibly long, they are challenging and it's nice to see if you can beat the time trial they have set (let me tell you they take some strategy and thinking if you are going to go for a Time Trial.) I don't like the Character Packs though. I don't even use them. They are just sitting there in my DLC Menu. To some people it may be a nice addition but I don't use them so I can't say much about them. I am a huge Tomb Raider fan as you can probably tell by the Profile Picture and I own all of the Tomb Raider and Lara Croft games to date. This is definitely a great edition to the Tomb Raider and Lara Croft series and I recommend it to people who like Tomb Raider and to people who like Third Person Action-Adventure Shooter and Puzzle games!","May 18","true","20.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And this doesn't get much better during the game - pretty much all of the plot development takes place either before or after the game.\n\nThe game is easy to learn, and a bit too easy to master. The combat is exciting and dynamic, and the multitude of weapons means more and more ways to destroy your enemies. The puzzles are at the perfect level of challenge - they aren't incredibly easy, but they aren't so hard you spend an hour just trying to find out how to get a boulder from point A to B.\n\nThe achievement system makes this game definitely worth another run, and there's plenty of DLC out there for when you finish the main story. The action sequences and boss battles are entertaining and challenging (though some of the bosses are a bit on the easy side).\n\nI was not expecting this game to be this good, voice acting not super, music average, but over all I can't stop loving it.","April 8, 2015","true","27.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/recommended/35130/","LonMcGregor","LonM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/","303 products in account","LC: GoL is a much more arcade-like game than many of the others in the Tomb Raider franchise, but it is no less fun to play.\n\nThe story follows Lara and Totec as they attempt to prevent Xolotl from destroying the world. The story is told through various means within the game, from narration at the start to comic and "live" cutscenes. This could have possibly been made more consistent throughout, but in no way affects the quality of the story. It does at times seem like many of the classic villain tropes come through in Xolotl however: Manic laughter, taunting the player etc., but this isn't too over the top.\n\nThe gameplay has 2 main styles: linear and open levels. The linear levels (usually in tombs) generally require fighting your way through monsters, solving puzzles with balls and hazards like spike pits and fire, and jumping puzzles. The open levels are similar in what they require from the player, but instead of funneling you through a tomb you are generally given a "hub", with multiple paths to tombs to "complete". You need to do all of them anyway, so it's sort of the illusion of an open level more than anything.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are generally quite easy, although there are one or two of the jumping puzzles which, like in all games, can be a bit frustrating. Overall, though, for an arcade-level game they are well made. The fighting scenes, which can occur randomly at any time (monsters spawn from out of the ground), seem to result in a sort of pseudo-bullet-hell type gameplay, which isn't a bad thing. The game difficulty can be changed depending on how you like your fight scenes (easy being you just tear through enemies, and hard gives you enemies that soak up bullets).\n\nTo aid the fight mechanic you can collect different weapons (machine guns to explosive grenades), powerups (health boosts etc.) and various relics. The relics require a charge which when filled can enhance your fighting power. At the endgame, when the top tier ones are unlocked it becomes very easy to fight through vast numbers of enemies, which the game will happily provide.\n\nThe sound design is very good in this game, with dramatic music when required and more ambient music for within non-combat puzzle areas. Similarly, the voice acting is very good, even if it is only heard in cutscenes. Given the isometric-style view of the game, you never really see things in a close detail, but even at a distance the graphics in this game are very nice, from the rocky textures of walls and brickwork to the design of the monsters and characters you fight.\n\nThe game plays either using a controller or a keyboard. Personally, I would just stick to using a controller, if you have one, as the arcade-like nature of the game suits this playstyle best.\n\nIn terms of bugs: If you intend to use a controller, note that the game might not automatically assign it to player 1, so you may need to go into the options to manually assign it. I only had the game crash catastrophically once. No idea why it happened, but restarting it solved the issue.\n\nTo summarise: If you want a more laid-back adventure game, then this is definitely worth buying. It isn't terribly difficult, but it does offer a nice story and nice gameplay.","April 18, 2015","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Do keep the puzzles & non-shooty action segments. Then, for good measure add in a co-op mode where puzzles are re-worked to actually require 2 people to solve. Oh, and make sure the levels are designed for fun.\n\nDespite the genre-shift, and despite being a non-canon spin-off, this game does keep the Tomb Raider spirit, and is pretty solid. Main game isn't too long (I'm close to the end in 6 hrs, and taking my sweet time), but various challenges and such help extend that. (Speed-run and score-mode challenges on the levels in particular).\nYou get equipment upgrades from the challenges as well (any required weapons you will find in the wild though) - the later ones are pretty powerful, and especially the relics can border on being broken - only kept in check by the fact that they'll stop working for a while if you take any damage.\n\nAnd like with the older Tomb Raider games, blindly rushing in will get you killed more often than not. Better keep an eye out for the various tells & signs, and make sure you time your jumps correctly.\n\nThe game does have one annoying bug: It'll just crash if you die frequently enough on the same map.","October 26, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The mirror was originally formed by the keeper of darkness, Xolotl, to unleash monsters into the world. His nemesis Totec, the gaurdian of light, used the mirror against Xolotl and sealed him within the object. Many years later, Lara finds the mirror hidden within a temple. Unfortunately, she is ambushed by mercenaries who carelessly take the mirror and releases Xolotl and Totec from their slumber. With Xolotl free to unleash his monsters on the worldagain, Lara must work with Totec to stop Xolotl.\n\n\nGameplay\nThe game is a mixture of puzzle solving, platforming and combat. Each level sets you in a stage where you have to solve puzzles and platform around in order to progress. Along the way there are a wide range of enemies such as spiders, monsters, giants and skeletons, some of which have unique strengths and weaknesses. You also find plenty of traps such as explosives, spike traps, flame traps and pitafalls which will hinder your progress.  There are also unique challenges in each stage which when completed will offer either upgrades, artefacts or weapons. You have a health and ammo bar. Should your health depelte, you will restart at the latest checkpoint and lose score. There are plenty of weapons to find such as pistols, assault rifles, smg, minigun, sniper and spears each with different stats. There are also artifacts which give you a bonus of different stats.\n\n\nControls\nThe controls work well with a mouse and keyboard, however ther were instances where it was difficult to compplete challeneges and platforming due to key arrangement. I would highly recommend you use a controller.\n\n\nGraphics\nThe visuals in the game are decent. The environment looks good with plenty of objects and flauna around which a well detaled. The character models, unfortunately don't look good with lack of texture detail.\n\n\nSound\nAudio is a mix between good and not so good. The sound effects for weapons, traps and such are great. background music is good as well. While Lara's voice acting is good, Totec and Xotl aren't that great.\n\n\nExtras\nAs you play the game, you get score based on how well you performed in each level. When you reach a certain scroe threshhold, you unlock new costumes for Lara to use. There is also a free Kane and Lynch character DLC included witht he base game. Similar to the Kane and Azarael DLC, this basically changes the character models and some dialogue during campaign.\n\n\nOverall if you are looking for a good tomb raider game to play with a friend or by yourself, this is the game for you.","October 1, 2015","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have not played any single player mode at all, but the co-op element is quite good. Co-op partner shares the same screen, so both players cannot wander too far away from each other.\n\nThe puzzles are a little too easy for me, but this makes this game a good casual top-down platformer that can be played without stress.\n\nMovement controls aren't very good, a gamepad with analog stick is highly recommended. Because some platforms are diagonal, using keyboard to navigate is very awkward sometimes.\n\nThis game do have some awesome moments. There is a stage where you evade obstacles while dodging bullets to get to the other side before a giant monster get to you. Also there are a few awesome boss fights.\n\nGraphics are not bad. Audio is good. Story plot is negligible. There are a few glitches especially when the connection is bad while playing online co-op, but nothing is too game-breaking. Glitches are easily fixed by reloading a checkpoint or replaying the level.\n\nReplayability is limited. You can only replay the stages a few times to earn all the collectibles or challenges. After all that, there is no point to replay anymore.\n\n100% Achievement is moderately easy.\n\nThe DLCs adds a little content into the game, but some challenges can be quite frustrating to complete if you aren't very good in the game.\n\nMy Score: 8/10","March 26, 2015","true","16.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There isn't any loot dropped from enemies, no stats, levels and you do not level your character. Instead you explore tombs and collect power ups for health and ammo while puzzle-platforming.\n\nThe game features the same gameplay basics as the triple A positions in the franchise, some things it does even better. The shift to isometric makes navigation and solving environmental puzzles a lot clearer while keeping the challenge on about the same level as the other titles.\n\nAdditionally we also have good combat which always felt like an afterthought in the previous Tomb Raider games. The game features a host of weapons and powerups that sufficiently mix it up during these segments.\n\nOf course the game isnt perfect, sometimes it features some strange bugs and level props sometimes obscure the action (there is no see-through effect when Lara is behind something). However i never felt like this diminished the experience and so far did not lead to any frustrations.\n\nIt would be truly fantastic if we could get this Tomb Raider concept developed more, made it more open, more Metroidvania.\nSadly instead we got an uninspired 3rd person shooter with a lot of gore and hair physics.","March 22, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The puzzles rely on a handful of simple mechanics, but still manage to be clever enough to make you think for a bit before you find the answer. Decent variety of weapons that  feel good... the combat primarily involves kiting enemies into groups and blowing them up, which is always awesome. Collectables allow you to customize a few basic bonuses that your character gets, but nothing really crazy.\n\nMaybe not so much a Lara Croft game outside of the setting, as there's hardly any dialogue and personality given to Lara, but it's definitely fun for what it is. There's some quirkiness in the game involving things like physics, which doesn't hurt the game at all, but rather makes it hilarious if playing with a friend. If playing multiplayer one person controls Lara and the other controls some other one-dimensional guy. Lara has a grapling hook device she can use to tether to the other player or objects (so she or the other guy can access other places), and the guy has spears, which Lara can climb on.

The games is a must-have for playing with your best pal, if you are into puzzles and combat.\n\nGot this game browsing through the steam store looking for a fun coop game to play with my fellow  puzzle ethusiast of a friend, thinking it would do fine... And fine it did!\n\nPros and Cons++ Pros:\n+ Fun and challaging game.\n+ Co-op benefits\n+ Responsive Controls\n+ Full controller support\n+ Local Co-op #CouchGamingApproved\n+ Good combat system\n+ Broad custimazation\n\n- - Cons:\n- Single player falls short on brain-puzzles\n- Movement is somewhat restricted on keyboard\n- lack of better story (this is however not an actual issue)\n\nDetailsFirst of all, this is MEANT to be played in co-op. It is definitely one of the best coop games out there, and I have enjoyed every minute of it with a very good friend of mine, as well as playing it alone. Many of the levels are designed for coop, but has a sort of hot-fix for singleplayer solving etc... Much coop, very fun, such laughter. wow.\n\nThe game features puzzles which will test both your brain and timing. In the singleplayer part of the game, many of the puzzle seems to fade into becomming mostly timingskills rather than actual puzzles. Quite easy to figure out, somewhat difficult to execute. In the coop part however, the puzzles require teamwork, timing, space for experimentation and time to think (although timing and executions are still present).\n\nThe game is fairly short in single-player, unless you try to accuire every collectible in one run. This is also the case in co-op. My advice; play the coop and take your time to explore and have fun. No need for rushing (unless a challange requires you to do so).\n\nFull controller support is always a plus. Having tested both mouse/keyboard and controller, i find that they are equally pleasing. A matter of preference really. Also the game allows for local-coop with either keyboard or gamepad(s) which is awesome!\n\nThe overall movement mechanics really has a flow to it, you feel in control when you dash around the map, aiming your gun og moving at the same time.  Movement on the keyboard however may at times be a bit annoying as you can only move in vertical, horizontal and diagonal with the WASD, this is however nothing that you will not get used to.\n\nthe combat system is very easy to get used to, and is actaully pretty straight forward. (point => shoot => kill) it does however feature a lot of custimization later on, which I am not going to spoil. All I can say is, mutiple options are great! it's easy to learn and utilize, especially with mouse/keyboard, which may give the user more aiming freedom (yet again, a matter of preference).\n\nVisuals are pleasing, and the astosphere is great. The theme of the game is present throughout the game, which is nice. The only thing the games actually lacks, is a better storyline. It's pretty straight-forward; Lara must help the good guy defeat the bad guy, solving puzzles and defeating minions. BUT! the story is not the main focus of the game, the gameplay, the levels, the coop is indeed the driving force!\n\nFinal verdictMy friend and I had a blast playing it, can't recommend it enough for some couch-gaming!\n8/10.","November 5, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/35130/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","TLDR – Isometric action puzzle (with co-op!) game that you should probably play with a game controller, and not keyboard + mouse. I used a keyboard because that’s what I’m used to, but I feel that the experience would be better with a controller.\n\nThe only other Tomb Raider game I’ve played is the 2013 reboot so I can’t speak to story series continuity, but truth be told Guardian of Light doesn’t have that much story going on anyways. There’s an opening animation that’s kind of like a motion comic and occasionally during gameplay there are short cutscenes where the villain pops up and laughs evilly at you before running away. You play either Lara Croft, or a Mayan warrior Totec (the Guardian of Light) trying to stop a resurrected bad dude named Xolotl from destroying the world with a magic artifact.  Despite his fancy title, Totec doesn’t have any special powers and you don’t play as him unless you’re in co-op and the other player already took Lara. He has a nice shield though, that can reflect enemy attacks.\n\nAs mentioned above the game is built for cooperative play, one player as Lara and the other as Totec, but single player is a fun experience. During the single player campaign, the levels are modified so that you don’t need the help of a second player, and you don’t have an AI controlled ally either. Gameplay is roughly half puzzle solving and half shooting so don’t let the brainy parts turn you off, most of the puzzles aren’t that difficult to solve (until near the end). The game is broken up into about a dozen levels where you try to score as high as possible to unlock upgrades and new weapons (for example score 100k points to unlock a heavy shotgun). If you don’t care about score (you get plenty of guns just via regular play) you can grind through any level, since dying just costs you score points, your lives are infinite.\n\nPros:\n+The gameplay has a lot of variety with the right mix of action and puzzle solving.\n+The game is mostly reasonable in difficulty if you don’t care about your score. That means the game is as hard as you want it to be. If you want a challenge, go for a super high score.\n+Co-op gameplay! You can play with a friend online or with another controller plugged into your computer. This means all of the co-op steam achievements can be unlocked by yourself with keyboard and a game controller.\n\nCons:\n-The story is lackluster, but who cares as long as the gameplay is fun, right?\n-I mentioned that most of the puzzles are easy, but near the end there are one or two that seem insanely difficult unless you look up how they work online.\n\nOverall the game is not especially awesome (I don’t know why it’s got so many 9/10 scores from professional critics) compared to AAA titles, but it’s definitely above average. If you have it on your backlog, go ahead and give it a try, it’s less than 3 gb to download and takes maybe 6 hours to beat (single player).\n","August 17, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sidea01/recommended/35130/","sidea01","Sidea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sidea01/","21 products in account","Games are not always "fun" for me - they're often work that I like to do. This game is fun. It's work too, but it's also actually really fun. This game is like a perfect mix of Diablo and Mario Brothers.  If you like isometric platform games, you'll love this game. If you get annoyed by fast-paced action puzzles, you will hate this game.\n\nLet's get my cons out of the way first:\n\n-Controlling this game with a keyboard and mouse is REALLY confusing and difficult! You have to reorient yourself to move Lara in the direction you actually want, and this is the cause of lots and lots of deaths (points lost.)\n\n-There are some bugs, some of which are to your advantage, but most of which ruin your efforts. None of the bugs are so bad that it's unplayable at any point.\n\n- Some of the levels are repetitive, meaning you have to do the same type of puzzle, just in a new setting.\n\n- Some of the timed puzzles are made very annoying because controlling Lara is not easy. She can jump too far (when she jumps just right every other time,) go in the wrong direction, react too slowly, or get hidden behind an object.\n\n\nNow on my to pros:\n\n- Turning the combat down to "easy" does not reduce the difficulty of the puzzles. This means that if you prefer playing the game for the puzzles and the fun experience without the annoyance of difficult monsters, you can play it that way. It's still a lot of fun if you're not interested in difficult combat.\n\n- The levels, though repetitive at times, are designed well. They are fun, interesting, and pose just enough challenges. Some of the challenges will make you frusturated, some will take a long time to figure out, while others are a little too easy. If a puzzle is too hard for you, there are tons of Youtube videos available to show you what to do. There was only one instance where I had to get help because I tried about a 100 different things and kept failing. Once I watched the video I felt like an idiot, because the solution was so easy - just not obvious.\n\n- You can repeat levels over and over. If you're a completionist, this game gives you as many chances as you want without having to repeat too much.\n\n- If you're not a completionist and just play for the experience, not all the accomplishments, that's okay too. You can still fully enjoy the game without worrying about every detail.\n\n\nThe so-so parts:\n\n-The story. It's nothing special. There's nothing meaty here.\n\n-The music is rarely fitting. It's either too repetitive, or too dramatic for the scene. It isn't bad music, just too much at times. The longer it takes you to make it through a level, the longer you have to listen to the simple repetitiveness of it.\n\n\nConclusion:\nI can't see anyone disliking this game if they're a fan of the genre. It's not the best isometric platform game out there, but it's still great and really enjoyable. If you don't like the genre, this title will not convert you. If you're a fan of Tomb Raider in general, you'll enjoy this, even if you're not typically a fan of isometric games.\n\nI personally don't care about getting every achievement in this game. I even completed one level with zero points in the end because I died so many times. I know it makes me look bad, but with this game I don't care that much. I don't need to score well with each level in order to keep progressing, and I'm enjoying just passing every level without worrying about the details. I'm thankful for a game that lets me do that!","May 30, 2015","true","21.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And was not disappointed...\n\nThis game is an isometric action-adventure-puzzle game with very bad story, not so great voice acting, many minor bugs, but pretty fun gameplay, especially for co-op (I didn't play Single Player campaign, so I have no idea, how it turned out, but some coop ideas are really great)...\n\nIn co-op you play as Lara Croft and Totec, trying to catch on demon being (evil God) Xolotl. You need to fight various monsters using many weapons and artifacts, run through dangerous labyrinths and outsmart different puzzles... Every level has certain objectives, that give additional rewards when met, and beg you to replay them... It is really plain co-op fun on many levels, it has puzzles (non of which are hard, so don't worry), action and encourages helping because, for example, some parts are only passable when Totec throws it's spear on which Lara can climb (he cannot, because he's heavy :)), or when Lara throws her rope that Totec can walk on...\n\nBut, while this game shines on gameplay part, pretty much everything else is bad or nothing special... Story is bad, like really bad cliche story... Nothing more to add there... I also didn't like the voice acting, it just didn't help the mood... Especially when the story is so bad... And last, but definitely not least, game has many minor bugs that are there to irritate you in a moment, but nothing to completely break or make you leave the game...\n\nAfter all, recommended for co-op... As I mentioned, I didn't play Single Player, so I have no idea what to say about it...","September 1, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Couple of times I got stuck for a minute on a puzzle when I didn't know you could for example drop a bomb while climbing on your rope thingy. Mostly puzzles were a bit too easy and I quickly lost interest in trying to do the red rooms and just rushed through the game. First two hours were spent on exploring every place on the first three levels.\n\nStory was pretty weak and conversations between Totec and Lara felt unnatural.\n\nThe key mapping on PC keyboard feels like no one put any effort to it since some action were placed on weird spots. Like dropping a bomb is done with caps lock and opening the inventory with delete.

Resisting the urge to gush, I can honestly say that I had fun all the way throughout this game, and that is VERY rare for me these days.\n\nIt was a rather bold step of Crystal Dynamics to make a Tomb Raider game in this vein, rather than how all other Tomb Raiders have been, but I'm really glad they did. It's still very much a Tomb Raider game, in that there are platforming puzzles, lots of enemies to kill, and plenty of treasure to find.\n\nThis bird's-eye perspective, however, allows the action to be a lot faster paced. Enemies can (and will) swarm from all around you, while floor tiles ignite on fire, and arrow traps shoot out from the walls. It can get very hectic, but it never gets overwhelming.\n\nOne area in particular where this game succeeds, and many others get wrong, is in the area of specialized skills. Many games will have so many that it gets overwhelming, or just one major one, giving the puzzles an arbitrary feel.\n\nI never felt that way with this game, though. Playing single player, you get all of Lara's skills, plus all of Totec's (he's the Guardian of Light). Figuring out which ones to use in which situation felt very organic. In fact, it felt like the solution I used to solve several puzzles was not the one the developers intended, and I LOVE when you're allowed to do that. Too many games put too much importance on HOW you achieve the goal, rather than on the fact that you DID achieve it.\n\nThis is designed for co-op, no doubt about it, but it is an extremely solid single player experience. Never did I feel "oh man, I could really use a second player here," which is a testament to fantastic game design.\n\nThe graphics are quite good, the music and sound effects fit, and the voice acting is top notch.\n\nIt's a fairly quick game (I beat it in around 6 hours), but it's one I would have no problem going back to to collect more trophies. If a friend bought it and wanted to play co-op, I would absolutely say "yes."","February 19, 2013","true","13.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But later on I found out that the game is way more than just another rip off from the classic trilogy of PoP. So, let me get to the points straight away (but mind it, this is my firs title feature Lara Croft) -\n\n\nGraphics:\nThe games has an immensely good graphics - the visuals looks stunning specially if you play it on a big screen. The Level designing is very nice and complex(which suites the context). The artworks are awesome and the lighting and shadow effects will steal your mind. Surprisingly the game is somewhat "light" on my PC and I could switch context using ALT+TAB with no fuss.\n\nGrameplay:\nWhen you play an adventure game with 3rd person perspective and angled top view camera - the gameplay and the controls, specially, becomes a very critical indeed. I am playing the game with the XboX 360 PC controller and the inputs work just fine. In spite of trying 32 times for that "Better mouse Trap" achievement, I can tell you that controller is the better way to play this game than keyboard and mouse. since it is an Adventure RPG kind of game I think that developers should have invested more in the item and relic slots.Yes the game works just fine with 2 items and 1 relic slot but I feel it would have been better(read more in numbers). Overall the gameplay and controls are very much in sync with the levels and camera controls.\n\nAudio:\nThe in game sound is worthy enough to get a separate mention in my review. It feels awesome when you listen to the music or to the in game environmental sounds. The sounds change dramatically when the game scenario changes (including the death of your character). With my Steelseries Siverai V2 the sound feels awesome!\n\nStory:\nThis is one of the weakest links in the game - the Story!. I am not saying it is not there but it is somewhat generic in nature. I mean - it is nothing outstanding just a standard layout of story. Stupid people makes a mistake and unleashed terror on earth - now its up to you to stop it once and for all. yeah yeah we get it!!.... Well, that was the same layout I have found on Diablo (all versions) and in PoP games but the different twist and turns are what kept the players kept us mentioning about them every other review. This is what I feel what is lacking.\n\nMisc:\nThere are things that I need to mention here -\nThe cut scenes are not that good - it could have been much better than they are.\nThe Challenge Tombs are just rips offs from the PoPs life upgrade passages.\nThe overall complexity of the game is very very satisfying and so as the rewards. Combine them with steam achievements and you will feel much complete with your gaming experience.\nGrate re playability\nAll in all the game is a must have for me that comes with a solid bang for the buck. I have not yet played the Co-Op so I cannot comment on it- hopefully it will be as better as the single player one.\n\n- * happy raiding * -","April 1, 2015","true","14.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But later on I found out that the game is way more than just another rip off from the classic trilogy of PoP. So, let me get to the points straight away (but mind it, this is my firs title feature Lara Croft) -\n\n\nGraphics:\nThe games has an immensely good graphics - the visuals looks stunning specially if you play it on a big screen. The Level designing is very nice and complex(which suites the context). The artworks are awesome and the lighting and shadow effects will steal your mind. Surprisingly the game is somewhat "light" on my PC and I could switch context using ALT+TAB with no fuss.\n\nGrameplay:\nWhen you play an adventure game with 3rd person perspective and angled top view camera - the gameplay and the controls, specially, becomes a very critical indeed. I am playing the game with the XboX 360 PC controller and the inputs work just fine. In spite of trying 32 times for that "Better mouse Trap" achievement, I can tell you that controller is the better way to play this game than keyboard and mouse. since it is an Adventure RPG kind of game I think that developers should have invested more in the item and relic slots.Yes the game works just fine with 2 items and 1 relic slot but I feel it would have been better(read more in numbers). Overall the gameplay and controls are very much in sync with the levels and camera controls.\n\nAudio:\nThe in game sound is worthy enough to get a separate mention in my review. It feels awesome when you listen to the music or to the in game environmental sounds. The sounds change dramatically when the game scenario changes (including the death of your character). With my Steelseries Siverai V2 the sound feels awesome!\n\nStory:\nThis is one of the weakest links in the game - the Story!. I am not saying it is not there but it is somewhat generic in nature. I mean - it is nothing outstanding just a standard layout of story. Stupid people makes a mistake and unleashed terror on earth - now its up to you to stop it once and for all. yeah yeah we get it!!.... Well, that was the same layout I have found on Diablo (all versions) and in PoP games but the different twist and turns are what kept the players kept us mentioning about them every other review. This is what I feel what is lacking.\n\nMisc:\nThere are things that I need to mention here -\nThe cut scenes are not that good - it could have been much better than they are.\nThe Challenge Tombs are just rips offs from the PoPs life upgrade passages.\nThe overall complexity of the game is very very satisfying and so as the rewards. Combine them with steam achievements and you will feel much complete with your gaming experience.\nGrate re playability\nAll in all the game is a must have for me that comes with a solid bang for the buck. I have not yet played the Co-Op so I cannot comment on it- hopefully it will be as better as the single player one.\n\n- * happy raiding * -","April 1, 2015","true","14.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

LCatGoL comes along with 12 achievement and some additional DLCs with more quests, puzzles and playable characters from other games.

It's actually the opposite.\nLet's see what's good and what's bad.\n\nThe story is almost non-existent. Sure, there is some generic uninteresting intro, but that's it. To be honest, I don't mind it as I didn't expect much story from a game of this style (like Alien Swarm which also had very little story)\n\nThe graphics is okay. There's nothing that exceptional to mention here. Maybe just that even though the graphics is not that special, it doesn't run as well as I'd expect (on my main computer it's fine, on my laptop it is not).\n\nThe sound is average and there's also some music. The soundtrack isn't too memorable but I'm glad it's there. Games tend to get quite "sterile" without music.\n\nWhat really kills this game is the gameplay. That's a major flaw. Controls are awkward and your character sometimes does whatever he/she likes. It might be better on consoles, but I'm using a PC, so I'm rating that. There are many frustrating and unfair puzzles. Don't get me wrong - the idea behind most puzzles is good, but the execution is weak. Why? Controls. Movement is fine, but jumping is a disaster. You often end up falling to your death and as a consequence lose your valuable points. Which raises the question: Why the hell are you punished for developer's fault? That's ridiculous. There are several moves and tools you can use to get through the levels and puzzles. You've got two tools - a spear and a rope. Both are pretty useful to get to high or distant places. But good luck getting back down. You're forced to use a leap of faith as there is no way to drop while hanging on the edge of platforms. There might aswell be, but it's not in the tips and I haven't found it by myself. Such a thing should be mandatory in Lara Croft games.\n\nThere's also a coop mode which I haven't tried yet. If it plays better than singleplayer, this review might change to positive in the future. It's a fat chance though.\n\nTo sum it all up, the developers had ideas but clearly didn't know what they were doing. It's a shame because this doesn't look like a bad title. Well, let's hope they learn and don't ♥♥♥♥ up like this with their next game.","February 25, 2015","false","16.4"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

I did buy this game, it was in a Tomb Raider Bundle.\n\n\nThe DLCs with this vampires and guys from a shooter is just same , but the character does look different lol.\nYou cant decide to play the second character in single player and it sad, because by each i like the other one more. By the DLC charters you have no translation, they speak just in English by the cut scenes.\n\n\n\nThe gameplay is really boring, you have a spear and can collect more , but its actually you use the other by huge crowd of enemies or a grenade to take down a shield. So you have here 8 enemies.\nAll easy to take down, even in bigger formations not a challenge. So up middle of the game you just ran by, with no encounter because they are pretty easy to kill.\n\n\n\n\nThey game experince is bad, feels like 20% kill weak creatures with 1 hit, 40% like grass cutting from overlord, also really boring puzzles , like find 10 random stones and put them in holes or throw a spear to climb up.\n\n\n40% die for no reason, like you must jump down and die , so you restart and land on almost same position and survive, vs boss and troopers I loosed maybe 10 times, but for simple jump around it was around 200 times, to restart. So the jump around the environment is the most dangerous thing here. because its bad made, you don't land where you wanted to. The character does miss somehow the place you want.\n\n\nnext big thing is bad map design, in most levels you don't have the level map and sometimes you miss side quest items this way. Like you have 2 ways, left and right.\nYou go left but cant return, you can go right can return and there is the quest item. So if you just decided the wrong way , you cant return to collect the quest item, happened to me here dozens of times.\n\nLike by level 2 i need collect red skulls, for a new stuff, like health or ammunition upgrade. So i have way go north or go east, I go north and do see after 3 min there is the quest item i was looking for, but can't just rerach , because the game mechanic does block the way back. Because it did for no reason explode the cave entrance or blowed up a bridge, this way you experience it by almost every level.\n\n\nPeople I don't recommend this game. It feels really disappointing and boring.","July 29, 2015","false","9.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

One of the optional challenges for example require you to roll a ball on some plates to raise platforms, dodge some spears, jump over a platform..  easy right.. usual tomb raider fare..  After falling to my death 8 times in a row at this point i realize the platforms are bugged, you cant jump up left from that platform...  the game will just make you walk off to your death each time ARGHHHHH *stabs stuff*\n\nEven more annoyingly the next section if you skip that challenge has a platform you need to jump up left to cross.  However due to the up left walk off instead of jump bug, you fall to your death.\n\nAdmittedly there is another platform to the left you can jump at to work around the bug.. but that is beside the point, how could a game go this far and ship with such an obvious bug? It is highly unprofessional on the part of square enix who should bl**dy well know better.\n\nAlso game looks to have been designed for a gamepad too... but they added mouse support to aim... leaving a game that doesnt quite feel right with a keyboard and doesnt really play right with a mouse or gamepad.\n\nStop mixing your genres publishers.. and players will enjoy games more.","March 28, 2015","false","1.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","1"

I still feel it was a rip off.  This is no better than an average android game which typically 99.99% of android games suck.\n\nThe problems the main problem is this is an android level game on a desktop.\nThe competition for top down for a similar game rpg - diablo, marvel heroes,  torchlight 2.\nThe game setting is a dark dungeon crawler with puzzles like any android game.\nThe game may have been fun for a person on a tablet or phone because those who play on tablets are use to crappy games because this is would be a fit for them.\n\nHere is my major complaints\n\nKeybinding I can not find anyplace to change my keys.\nKeys are bound to the dumbest things  --  Alt key - Ctrl keys (For Desktop) Look at a windows keyboard the windows key is directly beside that.  I was often hitting CTRL or ALT then flipping to desktop because I hit the windows key. If you going to map such stopid keys next to windows key you should disable the windows keys that take you out of the game such as (Alt-tab, CTRL-ESC)  to avoid this problem.\nSure number of keys -  There are several keys that should all be the same key - grasping, opening doors, climbing, shooting out a grapling hook.  Yet each one is on a seperate keybind of which are all in terrible positions.\n\nInterface main menu.  I can not understand a main menu it has comic book tiles without clear understanding of what those tiles represent there is no text unless I highlight them stupid decision.\n\nResponse.  The enemies were boring and movement of my hereo was slow.\n\nThe typical Jump button (Space bar) in most games didn't allow me to jump across ledges or jump up from a spear.  The only thing I could figure out the jump button was for was hopping between spears, it didn't allow me to jump over a ledge or up unless there was a spear to jump on.

It's essentially an isometric Tomb Raider game with nice gunplay and puzzles.\n\nThe story is extremely simple, basically an evil being will throw the world into chaos if no one stops him (cue Lara Croft to save the day), but that fault is far outweighed by the well polished and designed gameplay.  The shooting and doging mechanics never left me wanting and a well placed bomb can prevent enemies from swarming Lara Croft.  The tools used to solve puzzles are usually the same, but the design of the puzzles are varied enough such that it never felt repetitive to complete them.  Those who felt Tomb Raider (2013) was lacking in puzzles will find them aplenty in this game. Weapons and relics/artifacts (items that boost Lara's stats) are usually unlocked by either completing side objectives, such as beating challenges in each level, and never feel tedious to do.  The only potential downside is that later weapons are clearly stronger than earlier ones, so those with an affinity with the earlier weapons might be disheartened to give them up. The levels are large enough that sometimes I wonder what it would be like if there was a first person mod available and see the expansiveness of the structures and fight enemies that tower over Lara.\n\nOverall, those looking to learn more about Lara Croft as a character won't find much, but this game is definitely recommended for those who wish to do some shooting as well as some puzzle solving.","December 13, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have not gotten very far through it yet.  When I started, however it resumed from where I had played through the demo to and I had forgotten much of the game, so did not remember some of the controls or game play mechanics from the demo.  One aspect that I detest is that it appears to use save point mechanics where you cannot choose to save when you need to but it will automatically save when you hit a sve point.  Not every one has time to reach a save point before quitting a game for the current session.\n\nPlease manufacturers of games do not use this lame mechanism in your games and so that players are able to save where they need to.  To further that thought, I do not like repeating the same scene over and over again a thousand times just to continue and this game forces you to do just that to pass certain areas.","October 18, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels play with height, often allowing you to look down at a barrier on a lower floor as you manipulate related mechanisms above it. Combat is frequent and fun; you're often granted new toys moments before hordes of vulnerable enemies are unleashed. Puzzles aren't generally very difficult, but break up the platforming and shooting nicely.\n\nAlso, the puzzles change when you play co-op.

Immersion secured.\n\nThe puzzles are tough but do-able and gives a sense of accomplishment when you complete it. The feeling like "hey awesome I just figured it out". And the game doesn't make you forget because often times these tricky puzzles contain rewards in the form of powerups or items to boost your stats.  And some puzzles are right just there in your face teasing you. "Look an ammo upgrade 20 feet away from me but I can't walk/run/jump to it. What should I do?" IMO is a good game design since it makes the game one giant puzzle/reward fest.\n\nBut it's not all about puzzles, there's action too. The enemies are pretty predictable but will definitely test your reflexes avoiding their attacks and projectiles. There's an incentive in doing good at combat too for if you do well you activate your 'power' which disappears IF YOU GET HIT so it makes combat pretty hectic but pretty fun.\n\nOverall good game. I can't wait for the upcoming sequel.\n\n8/10","August 27, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's essentially an isometric Tomb Raider game with nice gunplay and puzzles.\n\nThe story is extremely simple, basically an evil being will throw the world into chaos if no one stops him (cue Lara Croft to save the day), but that fault is far outweighed by the well polished and designed gameplay.  The shooting and doging mechanics never left me wanting and a well placed bomb can prevent enemies from swarming Lara Croft.  The tools used to solve puzzles are usually the same, but the design of the puzzles are varied enough such that it never felt repetitive to complete them.  Those who felt Tomb Raider (2013) was lacking in puzzles will find them aplenty in this game. Weapons and relics/artifacts (items that boost Lara's stats) are usually unlocked by either completing side objectives, such as beating challenges in each level, and never feel tedious to do.  The only potential downside is that later weapons are clearly stronger than earlier ones, so those with an affinity with the earlier weapons might be disheartened to give them up. The levels are large enough that sometimes I wonder what it would be like if there was a first person mod available and see the expansiveness of the structures and fight enemies that tower over Lara.\n\nOverall, those looking to learn more about Lara Croft as a character won't find much, but this game is definitely recommended for those who wish to do some shooting as well as some puzzle solving.","December 13, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is the first game in the series to support cooperative multiplayer, both local and online. The storyline is non-essential and thankfully stays out of the way. The graphics are nice, varied, successful in conveying the game's atmosphere and at times impressive. The soundtrack is also quite good. The game takes a different approach to raiding tombs than the mainline series but even so it was well received by both critics and diehard fans.

I even played the very first Lara game (Play Station 1 edition). Since then I have been trying to keep an eye on further Miss Croft adventures. The last full size Lara game (as I thought) is Underworld. My daughter, even a greater fan than me, and me are looking forward to playing a new game that is to be released in autumn 2012. At the same time I learnt there is a Steam version of a Lara Croft game (called Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light). At first I was rather doubtful about it. First of all the view was not the one I got used in the previous adventures. It is not a three dimensional game, you can see Lara from above and at first it confused me a lot. But after completing the first stage I realized I had forgotten about it.\nread more http://www.viewforum.net/gaming-dept-171/lara-croft-guardian-light-2408/","December 8, 2013","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/recommended/35130/","ryanyth","Encephalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/","441 products in account","Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is a fixed-camera isometric 3D platform game and unlike previous games in the series, puts a heavy emphasis on cooperative gameplay.\n\nYou play either as Lara Croft or a 2000 year old Mayan warrior named Totec who team up together to defeat an ancient evil god. Standard cliche save-the-world storyline that does its job well enough.\n\nEach character has their own specialities in navigating obstacles. For example: Lara is much more agile and can dispatch grappling hooks while Totec has a nice shield that can block things and a spear which can be used as a temporary platform for Lara to jump onto.\n\nPlay control is very smooth and fluid but the main highlight is the manner in which the cleverly designed puzzles are solved cooperatively and they sometimes have more then 1 solution. Although you can complete the campaign solo, (in which you are given all the tools needed to solve all puzzles) The game shines alot better when played co-op. Skills are split up between the 2 characters. You can tell that they put alot of thought into the designs of the puzzles.\n\nDownsides, the game is rather short at only about 6 hours for the main campaign although it is alot of fun. I have also encountered some random network disconnections while playing co-op online. Keyboard controls feel fiddly and a gamepad is highly recommended although some configuration is required if you're not using a native Xbox360 PC controller. Its also a pity that the game is not designed to be moddable (no mod tools were ever released for it AFAIK) as it feels very well suited for modding.\n\nThe 3 mission DLCs which consists of 4 short missions each, making it a total of 12 missions are just more puzzles and have absolutely no additional story to add on to the main campaign. It will probably take an additional hour or 2 depending on your playstyle to finish them all. You can play them solo, or co-op and are meant more for players who have completed the main game and just wants more puzzles to solve.\n\nThe additional character DLCs are also quite interesting in that they are not just re-skins, but are actually done with all new voicework. It basically re-tells the main story campaign but from a new perspective. So if you've already completed the game, and wanna replay it, these character DLCs can be worth to buy just to experience another run-thru again. Its quite funny to see Raziel and Kain again in a completely different environment.\n\nIn closing, this is a really fun but short co-op game with fluid controls and brilliant puzzles. Although very different from the usual style of the Tomb Raider series, I hope they make a sequel for it, as it is really very good.\n\nOverall Rating: 8.5 / 10\nDefinitely well worth the purchase. Don't miss it.","May 25, 2013","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have not gotten very far through it yet.  When I started, however it resumed from where I had played through the demo to and I had forgotten much of the game, so did not remember some of the controls or game play mechanics from the demo.  One aspect that I detest is that it appears to use save point mechanics where you cannot choose to save when you need to but it will automatically save when you hit a sve point.  Not every one has time to reach a save point before quitting a game for the current session.\n\nPlease manufacturers of games do not use this lame mechanism in your games and so that players are able to save where they need to.  To further that thought, I do not like repeating the same scene over and over again a thousand times just to continue and this game forces you to do just that to pass certain areas.","October 18, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It sounds wierd, but it works really well. Despite not being Tomb Raider, it's one of the best Tomb Raider games I've played. The levels play with height, often allowing you to look down at a barrier on a lower floor as you manipulate related mechanisms above it. Combat is frequent and fun; you're often granted new toys moments before hordes of vulnerable enemies are unleashed. Puzzles aren't generally very difficult, but break up the platforming and shooting nicely.\n\nAlso, the puzzles change when you play co-op.

Some of the hazards you'll encounter really are impressive to behold in terms of sheer scale, with puzzles that occasionally require you to think quite inventively, becoming more challenging towards the end of the game.\n\nThe shoot-em-up aspect is enjoyable for the most part, although the crosshair can occasionally be temperamental since it moves independently of Lara's person. You have to keep this in mind when you intend to shoot an enemy in the direction you're currently facing, in case your crosshair is elsewhere on screen. Only other criticism is that you can't skip cutscenes. It gets repetitive having to watch them over and over when replaying a level, for instance if you're trying to improve your score.\n\nRest assured, Lara looks downright sexy!","February 20, 2011","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the hazards you'll encounter really are impressive to behold in terms of sheer scale, with puzzles that occasionally require you to think quite inventively, becoming more challenging towards the end of the game.\n\nThe shoot-em-up aspect is enjoyable for the most part, although the crosshair can occasionally be temperamental since it moves independently of Lara's person. You have to keep this in mind when you intend to shoot an enemy in the direction you're currently facing, in case your crosshair is elsewhere on screen. Only other criticism is that you can't skip cutscenes. It gets repetitive having to watch them over and over when replaying a level, for instance if you're trying to improve your score.\n\nRest assured, Lara looks downright sexy!","February 20, 2011","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A Lara Croft game from a birds eye view and puzzles? It seemed like it would be weird and at first it was a little but. The story is a bit far fetched, but oh well it has to be in a Lara Croft game I suppose. The story isn't the games strong suit, but where it does excel is in the game-play. There are two main characters, Lara and her new partner Totec, an ancient Mayan warrior who was awoken when Lara accidentally awoke an evil spirit that was imprisoned in a mirror, yeah it's weird. Anyway on to the best part about the game, the mechanics. So starting off the two players are distinct in that Lara uses guns and Totec has a shield and can throw spears. Now the best part about the game is the interactivity that happens between the two characters. All the levels are designed with two players in mind. When Totec throws a spear it sticks into a wall for a brief period of time, and while it's on there Lara is able to use that spear as a platform... pretty cool right? Lara can also stand on Totec's shield when he raises it above his head and the two can preform a double jump. As the game progresses new challenges arise that asks the player to call upon certain co-op moves that they already know or just made available to them. It's an awesome game and it's definitely worth the time.","February 21, 2011","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the hazards you'll encounter really are impressive to behold in terms of sheer scale, with puzzles that occasionally require you to think quite inventively, becoming more challenging towards the end of the game.\n\nThe shoot-em-up aspect is enjoyable for the most part, although the crosshair can occasionally be temperamental since it moves independently of Lara's person. You have to keep this in mind when you intend to shoot an enemy in the direction you're currently facing, in case your crosshair is elsewhere on screen. Only other criticism is that you can't skip cutscenes. It gets repetitive having to watch them over and over when replaying a level, for instance if you're trying to improve your score.\n\nRest assured, Lara looks downright sexy!","February 20, 2011","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A Lara Croft game from a birds eye view and puzzles? It seemed like it would be weird and at first it was a little but. The story is a bit far fetched, but oh well it has to be in a Lara Croft game I suppose. The story isn't the games strong suit, but where it does excel is in the game-play. There are two main characters, Lara and her new partner Totec, an ancient Mayan warrior who was awoken when Lara accidentally awoke an evil spirit that was imprisoned in a mirror, yeah it's weird. Anyway on to the best part about the game, the mechanics. So starting off the two players are distinct in that Lara uses guns and Totec has a shield and can throw spears. Now the best part about the game is the interactivity that happens between the two characters. All the levels are designed with two players in mind. When Totec throws a spear it sticks into a wall for a brief period of time, and while it's on there Lara is able to use that spear as a platform... pretty cool right? Lara can also stand on Totec's shield when he raises it above his head and the two can preform a double jump. As the game progresses new challenges arise that asks the player to call upon certain co-op moves that they already know or just made available to them. It's an awesome game and it's definitely worth the time.","February 21, 2011","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gate opens. You step in. Ok, the easy part is done. Now... go and get the artifact and keep pushing forward to reach Xolotl and finally stop him!\n\nThere's no need for any introduction when it comes to Lara Croft and Tomb Raider games. The difference between this game and all the other Tomb Raider titles is the pace of action and camera view (fixed isometric), as well as a multiplayer option (two player co-opeative hot-seat or via internet). Lara is still equipped with her dual pistols, remote bombs and grappling hook but she can expand her arsenal during this adventure with dozens of weapons (although you will most probably stick to 3 or max 4 of them).\n\nThe story. Is it really important? Alright, here's the short version: Lara was hunting an ancient mirror that entrapped a creature of darkness for centuries inside a Mayan temple. A band of mercenaries got there before her and released the spirit. Now it's up to Lara and Totec, an ancient guardian, to hunt him down and stop his evil plans of world domination. Honestly, it's completely unimportant and unimaginative and the real value of this game is in its gameplay.\n\nThis is still the same, good old Tomb Raider game. It's just a little bit faster and the levels are shorter. Your goal is always the same: reach the level exit until you can finally face Xolotl and be done with this adventure. The puzzles are pretty simple and will only require you to control your character with some skill to be done. The real challenge are... challenges! Each level has a number of them, including speed runs (beat the clock) and some item collecting (each level has 10 red skulls that need to be found). Honestly, I really loved completing challenges and I kept repeating each level until all were done. I would usually try and beat the score challenge on my first run, as well as collecting the skulls and power-ups, then come back and try the speed run. Some challenges on some levels are real easy and you won't even notice you completed them (meaning that you will be surprised when the "challenge complete" text flashed out) while some require strong effort. For example, the very first level has a "Disable Xolotl's fire trap in under 00:30" and that took me more than 30 minutes to complete. Fortunately, dying in game is not really punishable (you lose 5000 points which is ok if you are not doing the score challenge) so you can commit suicide and just try again from the save point. Another great thing is that you can collect weapons, artifacts and other power-ups in any order - once you collect them, they are saved. You can even quit the game right after picking up an item and it's ok, you will never have to do it again. You can even pick up a grenade launcher on level 7 and go play level 1 with it in your inventory, possibly making some puzzles easier with it. Cool, eh?\n\nNow the real fun is the multiplayer mode. Unfortunately, I never tried it (nobody wants to play with me!) but I've seen videos and I loved it. In multiplayer, two players control Lara and Totec, while some puzzles (and solutions) are different than in a single player game. The game requires true co-operation and seems to be very fun to play.\n\nOverall, this game provides a lot of joy. It takes about 8 to 10 hours to complete the single player game and probably another 15 to complete all the challenges. There are 12 achievements in the game and 11 are really easy, while the last one asks you to complete all the challenges. It's far from hard, but it takes time to complete. I know I will do it, I really enjoyed completing time runs and I am not really a kind of gamer who likes speed runs in any games. This one is somehow different.\n\n","February 4, 2015","true","26.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels progress linearly but provide enough open space, variety, and alternate paths to keep the game engaging.  There is a good mix of player freedom and player direction.  The game can be played solo or coop.\n\nPros:\nLevel design.  Each level is fairly unique and provides a varied array of puzzles to solve.  There are lots of envirornment hazards and challenges to over come as well as plenty of enemies.  There is a good variety of enemies in each level.  Some levels are quite large and include a lot of puzzles.\nPuzzles.  The puzzles in this game are actually really good.  Some are quite involved and stretch over the course of the entire playing field.  Some puzzles require thought to solve, while others are tests of skill and reaction.\n\nCons:\nControls.  You can play this game with the keyboard and mouse, but I did run into some instances where the controls just wouldn't work right.  Bottom line, this game should be played with a controller.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is a good pick up and play for 30 minutes game and each level doesn't last longer than that.  The game isn't all that long, but for the price it is well worth it.  The puzzles are satisfying and the combat is great arcade style fun.  Beyond that, there isn't much.  The story gets the job done, but isn't fantastic.  There is little to none character progress and the hidden collectables throughout the levels do not add anything to the game.  Still, this is a good addition to the Lara Croft franchise.\n\nScore: 8.4 / 10","February 5, 2015","true","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can power up your character with health upgrades, ammo upgrades and even find and use more weapons.  It has online multiplayer CO-OP which is awesome.  Playing coop you WILL have to use team work.  You either play as Lara Croft or Totec.  Lara mainly uses guns and grappling hooks while Totec uses spears and shields.\n\nIn coop Lara will use her grappling hook and Totec must walk on it like a tight rope to advance in puzzles or platforming.  Totec uses his shield to help boost Lara upward and throw his spears on the walls for Lara to do some parkour action.  Both of these mechanics are a must and can not be avoided.\n\nOnline or local coop in this is absolutely fantastic and a must play for people looking for some coop fun.  Lots of stuff to do with a story and there are fun bosses to battle as well.  Can grab the complete pack for $20, but goes on sale a lot for $5.  Extremely recommended!

I think its like 9 or 6 bucks normaly.. but if the sale is still on for this at $2 buy it.. buy it now. Its a cool puzzle themed level game. The story starts abruptly and throws you in to the fray teaching you to play on the first level but I think it is done nicely. I'm not sure how much playing I'll be doing on it but I"m sure I'll make my way thtough it eventually.

Definitely recommended if you're a fan of Tomb Raider even though it deviates from the 3d norm. I'm not particularly a fan of tomb raider and I enjoyed it.\n\nThe story is that a curse/god is released and you play as Lara adventuring your way through many levels then do a boss battle to put the boss back into his prison.\n\nThe game consists of shooting, dodging and solving puzzles in roughly equal measure. If you rush the game without the extras you'll have it done in 3 - 5 hours. These are 3 - 5 very enjoyable hours and well worth the price.\n\nThe levels offer a challenge but aren't too hard and you can generally figure out what you have to do quickly. This is no hardcore puzzler, it's a casual puzzler. In the levels there are lots of optional puzzles which reward you with various things. There are also optional tombs containing puzzles that reward you with very nice extra things.\n\nThere are a few things to help you along, and this is where the strategy comes in.\nYou can hold 3 weapons plus unlimited low-damage bombs and your spear (which despite being the weakest damage weapon will be required quite often for puzzle solving).\nYou can hold 2 artifacts and 1 relic, which change the attributes of things like defense, speed and attack in varying ways.\nThe relic is only activated after you've killed enough enemies without being hurt, or after picking up enough diamonds and when you take another hit, the relic effects are gone.\nThe ammo is very simple. It's an ammo pool for all weapons (except spear which takes no ammo) and the more powerful weapons use more ammo per shot, simple as that.\nThis is all introduced gradually, and does sound confusing, but it's easy to master once you've been playing a little while and the artifacts and relics allow you a few options that can turn a battle where you haven't got a hope around.\n\nCheckpoints are frequent which is great. And you can quit the game and it'll resume from your last checkpoint next time.\n\nThe graphics get a bit repetative - lots of beige and brown rooms with stairs and pathways. But the action flows nicely and you're so busy either battling or figuring out where to go next that you don't really care.\n\nLastly the boss fight was thoroughly enjoyable. It wasn't particularly challenging on normal difficulty, but it lasted a few minutes and didn't get stale or boring.\n\nThere are four gripes I have.\n1. There are times when the aim-assist (you'll need it, really) can let you down, this is especially frustrating with the weapons that take lots of ammo per shot, but mostly it was very good.\n2. Jumping gaps can also be slightly irritating if you misjudge the direction of the controller.\n3. The mission briefing pauses the game to pop up on screen. This can break a nice flow you have and left me saying "I know, I read it before, just let me play damnit". However, these are necessary so you know what you're doing.\n4. It's too easy on normal difficulty.\n\nOne last thing. In one screenshot you see spiders. There are many spiders in this game. Nothing really pounces and there are no jumpscares.","December 30, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Over the years, it seems more has been written about Ms. Crofts ever expanding bust than on the actual games themselves.  This changed with the release of the last Tomb Raider (which I haven't played as yet, though it is in my library to download).\n\nI picked up this title as the description reminded me of the original in some way, but also cause I'm a sucker for a good action/adventure game.  And I'd just finished playing Shadowrun Returns, so the isometric view felt like a good fit.\n\nThis game holds the tenents of the series close.  As Lara, you must run, jump, shoot, bomb, swing, climb and puzzle your way though the temple with the Totec running point as you hunt down an ancient artifact and try to stop a catastrophe of epic proportions.  Lara quips with the best of them as well.  The puzzles require a bit of thought, some quick reflexes and when played in co-op mode, good communication to ensure you can make the most of Lara's and Totec's abilities.\n\nWhile it may not be a "true" Tomb Raider title, Crystal Dynamics have crafted a game that takes the Croft name and does it justice.  I've thoroughly enjoyed playing through this and look forward to playing the second installment when my budget allows.","January 23, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like a top down approach to a classic Tomb Raider game. Good action, a range of weapons, puzzles ranging from easy to hard, etc.\n\nThere are optional puzzle rooms which will give you more powerful weapons or artifacts that will increase your stats. These are usually more challenging but are worth the reward.\n\nThere is a high replayability factor as each level comes with a number of challenges, such as finishing the level within a certain time frame, finding hidden blocks or areas, finding all ten red skulls, et cetera. These also reward you with better weapons or artifacts, and sometimes new costumes.\n\nThe game has a good difficulty curve, starting off relatively easy and becoming more difficult, with the last two or three levels being quite challenging (I played on hard combat difficulty).\n\nIn essence, good combat, good puzzles, relatively mediocre story (although that fits in perfectly with the original Tomb Raider series before the reboot) and plenty of replayability. Definitely worth it for a Tomb Raider fan. I'm looking forward to the sequel.","January 27, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can power up your character with health upgrades, ammo upgrades and even find and use more weapons.  It has online multiplayer CO-OP which is awesome.  Playing coop you WILL have to use team work.  You either play as Lara Croft or Totec.  Lara mainly uses guns and grappling hooks while Totec uses spears and shields.\n\nIn coop Lara will use her grappling hook and Totec must walk on it like a tight rope to advance in puzzles or platforming.  Totec uses his shield to help boost Lara upward and throw his spears on the walls for Lara to do some parkour action.  Both of these mechanics are a must and can not be avoided.\n\nOnline or local coop in this is absolutely fantastic and a must play for people looking for some coop fun.  Lots of stuff to do with a story and there are fun bosses to battle as well.  Can grab the complete pack for $20, but goes on sale a lot for $5.  Extremely recommended!

The controls suck and this style of gameplay is just lame. I just spent twenty tedious minutes trying to get past one puzzle, and died time after time without making any progress at all. I am a HUGE fan of the franchise, but this is getting uninstalled now. I seriously regret wasting my money on this.\n\nUpdate 2015-02-06: This definitely a game for a controller or joystick. If you're a keyboard/mouse player, you are probably going to find this incredibly frustrating. However, if you're  a controller user, you probably will have zero problem at all. I plugged in a XBox-type Logitech controller I got for another game and had better luck. Personally, I need to re-read the guide to figure out how to play because it's not totally obvious to me, but I could be working off an old save and skipped the initial tutorials. I don't know that I'll put much more time into it... I'm more of a first-person shooter kinda gal. Perhaps if they at least had worked in Diablo, Starcraft, etc. type mouse controls I might get into it more easily.\n\nSo, summary: look at screenshots and vids. If this is the type of game you like, get it. If you're a fan of the Tomb Raider FPS but don't really play this kind of top-down isometric thing much, think twice.","February 5, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's the first Tomb Raider (or Tomb Raider based game, if some of you may call it) to feature a multiplayer mode, allowing for you and up to three other players to tag along in this wild adventure.\nStarting off with the gameplay, I must say that the movement controls and combat is smooth and robust. There aren't very many nuanced things in this game, as far as the story goes. You get an assortment of weapons throughout the games and the extra points, gems and rewards are present, waiting for you to jump in on the appealing and unexpected challenge right in front of you.\nRegarding the price point of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, I personally, would not pay more than $10.00 for the game, as it seems to be a mini game. Although Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light doesn't really have any new nuanced adventures, it is a good time killer.\n\n\n-     6 / 10","May 17, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is very easy - I just used some of the weapons i had and not using the rest paired with easy kills made it feel quite unrewarding.\n\nWithout a gamepad, jumping to certain places can be difficult because of only having 8 directions to move.. and certain challenges have jumps with much more than that.\n\nEven though the game is for the most part mediocre, there can be some fun moments when playing with a friend or family member and I would only recommend it for it's local co-op.\n\n7/10","November 3, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think its like 9 or 6 bucks normaly.. but if the sale is still on for this at $2 buy it.. buy it now. Its a cool puzzle themed level game. The story starts abruptly and throws you in to the fray teaching you to play on the first level but I think it is done nicely. I'm not sure how much playing I'll be doing on it but I"m sure I'll make my way thtough it eventually. And with the lvl setup being timed you can replay through the levels fighting for time if you want. This is a game my laptop with run seamlessly when I'm at Uni, waiting for a class, or doing something away from my glorious PC. The game really makes me wish I could somehow run steam games on my phone as I'm pretty confident the OPO could run this and for $2 your not goign to get a game with these mechanics, or even mechanics of this caliber(not saying they are amazing but for the price they are great), for $2 on the google store.

Online suffers from a bug where the second player cannot use subweapons which breaks some coop puzzles and also makes that player extremely iineffective in combat, as well as screwing up the ability of Totec to correctly aim his shield in the right direction.  Square-Enix support was unhelpful (why did I bother at all, customer support wont result in a patchfix).\n\nThat aside, if you can manage to play offline you can get a fun, quick paced cooperative game with interesting enough puzzles and combat.  Levels can be 10-30  minutes long so its good for a quick fix.  No enemies or puzzles were too easy or too frustrating.\n\nIf you've played Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance and liked it like me, this is that style of game with a focus more on action than on RPG customization.

Sure, it got high reviews but I've never agreed with IGN on a review for a game ever, and I was always comfortable with my familiar Tomb Raider game formula... but damn!\n\nLara Croft and the Guardian of Light is a very Diablo-esque game, wherein you control a character in a top-down perspective, fight hordes of demons, and loot tombs for special upgrades and treasures you can manage in your inventory. Except Guardian of Light is more interested in progressing through linear levels, which I personally prefer.\n\nThe game's story sucks. Random thought, but yeah. It's absolutely trash. It's rushed, the characters aren't interesting, and Xolotl is one of the most yawn-inducing villains I've seen ever.

This is an action game where accuracy of motion is an issue yet the controls are needlessly awkward.  The background is set at three quarter view and the wasd movement controls do not coincide.  so, in order to interact with the terrain, one has to constantly be pressing two keys at once.  Not a big thing for many players, I am sure.  I find it clumsy.  Many games with three quarter view allow mouse clicks to move the character.  Not this one.\n\nOh, and the main menu is complete nonsense.  Never have I seen anything so dumb.  Random cubes with images unrelated to the menu items.

It offers fast paced action, a decent variety of weapons and also has some hidden secrets.

Sure, it got high reviews but I've never agreed with IGN on a review for a game ever, and I was always comfortable with my familiar Tomb Raider game formula... but damn!\n\nLara Croft and the Guardian of Light is a very Diablo-esque game, wherein you control a character in a top-down perspective, fight hordes of demons, and loot tombs for special upgrades and treasures you can manage in your inventory. Except Guardian of Light is more interested in progressing through linear levels, which I personally prefer.\n\nThe game's story sucks. Random thought, but yeah. It's absolutely trash. It's rushed, the characters aren't interesting, and Xolotl is one of the most yawn-inducing villains I've seen ever. But, to be fari, Guardian of Light isn't interested in story... it's interested in gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent. You move fluidly, puzzles are excellently laid out, and combat with hundreds of enemies on screen feels as hectic as it does therapeutic. And the different artifacts and upgrades are actually useful, so breaking off from the main level to do a five-minute puzzle is both hazard-free and can end up benefiting you later in the level.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake is the graphics.

I can't imagine it would take very long to just beat this game but I made it a point to collect all the artifacts, totems, and weapons you can. That got me 12hrs out of it. The puzzles aren't difficult, the bosses aren't difficult and only a few secrets push the boundaries of 'well hidden'. But each level tends to have at least one of it's challenges push your limits and really test you. Controls are tight both with the keyboard and mouse and controller. Aiming is more precise with a mouse, but movement and platforming is more intuitive with the controller. There's no more story here that necessary to keep things moving and explain the setting. The graphics and art are nice enough for the gamestyle. I'd particularly like to point out the enemy models and animations, they were great. Sound effects are above average in my opinion.\n\nAll of this comes together crisply, cleanly and extremely fun. Full price is pushing it, but don't hesitate to purchase on sale.

I have also delved into the newer chapters, such as Underworld and Legend, but I must admit that the one which really stands out to me, is also the one that completely breaks the formula: Guardian of Light. Rather than the traditional jumping puzzles and third person combat, we get isometric, arcade-like, twin-stick shooting and some of the best puzzles I've seen in any action game, ever. On top of this add gorgeous graphics, satisfying weapons and incredible coop gameplay, and you have a real winner.

Yeah, you can shoot enemies and deal with enviromental puzzles, but the camera angle changes so it plays mostly like arcady action platformer and it is also pretty short, I got to end in 4 hours, but all things considered, it is not a bad game.","May 2","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not only fun, creative, and has great graphics, it also has a good music score, sound effects, and requires TombRaider style puzzle solving skills but in some really intense situations. The translation from the previous Tomb Raiders to this one is quite seamless. If you've played the others, you know the deal. And yet, they've managed to take an old arcade style format, translate it to the TR universe, and still make it into something really satisfying. 9/10","August 5, 2011","true","38.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Normally when I write reviews, I write a lot about the story, presentation, characters, and gameplay, but for this game, it's obvious that the whole point is just to blow stuff up and have fun! You can speedrun through the levels, or you can try to find all the secrets and optional challenge tombs! Either way, you won't be disappointed.\n\nController recommended, but not required.\n\nHere's a helpful list of things in the game you might like:\n\nLara Croft\nDINOSAURS\nGUNS AND BOMBS\nEXPLOSIONS\nI think there's a story too, but I wasn't really paying attention during cutscenes because I wanted to get back to murdering demons and things.\nOK? OK. Consider yourself enlightened. :)","June 5","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
