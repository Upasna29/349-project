I really enjoyed the other 3 or so bridge constructor games so that may have jaded my opinion a bit. The game is focused more on the driving and stunts than the actual bridge construction element. In this series I prefer the offerings completely focused on the construction element.\n\nOverall, this reminds me more so of a phone app than a $10 game. It's pretty fun and if you like a challenging stunt/construction games this one will be for you! I'd personally check out the first Bridge constructer if you are looking for a good one.\n\nWorth $3 like any other app-like game. It's good... but not amazing.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

The game at the moment is a little out of my price range for a game of this type, especially when you can get the same game on the app store for a quarter of the price.\n\nWatch my video for more details and you will get a better idea of the game, and decide for yourself what this game means to you :).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwUA9sQX_s","March 10","true","1.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

(Just a wild idea, but it would be awesome if another game like this was made but using hotwheel-like cars with hotwheel-like ramps and stunts at high-speed)\n\nOverall it's a great bit of fun, and is certainly enjoyable if you like physics based puzzle games.","February 25","true","0.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

And I for one quite enjoyed it! I've played through campaign 1 and 2 and it just gets better and more difficult with each level.\n\nI also made a video, feel free to watch it if you want to!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vErdUaMwQE\n\nIf you enjoy building bridges and try them out yourself then this is the game for you, the graphics aren't that new but the gameplay is smooth and very enjoyable!\n\nI recommend this game, 8/10.","February 25","true","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Kinda different from most bridge building games. It's like it's 50% bridge building game, 50% 'Hill Climb Racing' on Android. Also it's got some nice reggae in the main menu and some simple, but edgy rock music while playing and there's a lot of explosions. I like the style and how it's really energetic. It's like if Michael Bay made a bridge building game.\n\nPrice seems fair, comparable to most similar games, but unlike some of them it kept my attention for a good while. There were a few quirks, but nothing that really bothered. So yeah I'd say pick it up if it's your cup of tea :)\n\nFull first impression video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqLBuRowsqQ&ab_channel=OJJVZ","February 23","true","2.5"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","2"

Being a hot blooded American patriot I felt like I could really hear the National Anthem playing every time my truck took off to soar like our nations bird, the glorious bald eagle. Only thing I was missin' was a big ol' American flag attached to the back of the truck that fluttered in the wind as I recreated Neil Armstrongs space shuttle take off in about 1 ton of pure hard workin' steel. I recommend this game as much as I recommend freedom\n\nOh and I did a lets play if you need more proof of this games greatness (American grunts not included)\nhttps://youtu.be/pDGxywLuryQ","February 24","true","0.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","20","1","5","4","0"

The game is plagued with a very slow tutorial, mediocre bridge construction, basic stunt car controls and has a UI and input options that don’t feel natural on the Mouse & Keyboard.\n\nThe levels are broken up into two stages, a build phase and a stunt phase. You see the level, have a limited amount of resources, maybe restrictions in where you can build, and your goal is to get your vehicle to the other side. You can do some pretty wacky things and you have a lot of options when it comes to how you can form shapes, but it just isn’t up to the quality of something like Poly Bridge.\n\nOn the other end we have the stunt portion, the bit where you get in your car and drive. Simple controls, back, forward and rotate, nothing special. It’s nice having a little bit control of these segments but they aren’t that interesting, I felt having an automatic system would have been just as enjoyable as I got more frustrating moments out of this phase than pleasure. Also there are some weird game mechanics, to pass some levels you need to collect stars on a level, or reach a certain score (by doing tricks and collecting stuff), I feel these should be optional as they aren’t that engaging and force you into certain structure builds and movements within the stunt car.\n\nOverall it’s pretty unique and fun, but at the same time it’s nothing stellar. I have not finished the game yet, but from the looks of things there are 33 stages, not sure what you’re supposed to do after that. There’s a replay system but that’s about it when it comes to bonus features. Unless you really want to be able to build a bridge and ride it to I’d pass the game for now, but for $6 it’s pretty subjective.","February 23","false","1.4"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","10","26","0","0"

This time around, the focus is more on completing various objectives within the levels and creating the missing roads to do just that, and less on "How do I get a 30 ton truck over a wooden bridge" using my tiny budget.\nIt's challenging if you want to go for the achievements, but just playing a random level, raising that ramp just a tiny bit further and see how much we can hit is just what I like in a casual game.","June 2","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
