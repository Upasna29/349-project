What do you want me to say?\n\nIt's twenty levels of dodging buzzsaws and rockets fired by a fat corpse on a flying rug that looks like the zombie plague hit while he was queuing up to sign some sort of state molestation register... but it's 76p.\n\nThe only two movement keys (up and down) that the game gives you are about as responsive to stimuli as the AD 79 Vesuvius Hiking Club... but it's 76p.\n\nThe game can't even reliably keep track of how much food you've collected which, as its main victory condition for each stage, is just utterly diabolical... but it's 76p.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that there's a reason that some games retail for £39.99 and some games go for 76p and really, the best that ZombieRush can hope to aspire to is to provide a pretty thorough explanation to any new gamers on Steam as to exactly why that is.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vesuQ6XgCc","May 4","false","0.4"," 155 of 168 people (92%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","92","155","168","48","3"

Jos kontrollit ois paremmat, niin tätähän pelais kentät läpi, mutta nyt saa jäädä kymmenen kentän peliksi. Ei vaan jaksa näillä kontrolliasetuksilla.","May 17","false","1.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","4","8","3","0"
