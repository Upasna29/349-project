[ Should you fail you'll end up in your cardboard box pet coffin :( ]\n\nColourful graphics and a brilliant sense of humour - how can you not love a game that has a Nyan Hamster skin?\n\nChallenges get tougher and hold the game together really nicely collecting points to spin the wheel for costumes and single use upgrades as you jump through the levels. Neat game mechanics such as the buttons that rotate the world 90 degrees or the network of pipes that bounce you to the next section are nice touches too. Highly recommended especially as it's such a low price. Great fun!\n\n","May 1","true","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It was only $2.49 when I bought it, and I thought "I can refund if I don't like it lolololol."\nOkay, so- let's talk about the game. There are costumes you can get for your hamster by completing challenges. 19 are required to unlock all but one (you will get either Moonwalker or Space Suit at challenge 13, and as far as I know there is no way to get the one you didn't receive) costume. But after completing those 19 challenges, there are still more to complete (still haven't beaten challenge 20 ;_;). The game's currency is "nibbles." You can spend these nibbles (which are very easy to earn might I add, on a 30 minute session I got about 1600 challenge/power-up free) by spinning a wheel to get one of three power-ups. One spin costs 100 nibbles (it's not that much). The power-ups you can earn are double jump, nibble magnet, or extra life. The power-ups do NOT last forever. That's why you can get more than one. They only last for one turn, so if you have 6 double jumps and play a run, you will have 5 afterwards. You can disable power-ups by clicking their icons in the top right corner of the costume selection screen before your run. The icon will go gray if the power-up is disabled. I got confused on this for quite a while, lol.\nThere's also a leaderboard, so the longer you got on your run (say you got to 1337 cm) the higher you got on the leaderboard. There are daily, weekly, and all time ranks. You can even enter your own custom nickname for your spot! :P\nBut with every good game, there are bugs. When entering space, you can change the way your hamster is facing by entering the rocket facing a certain way. To fix this, just jump into the rocket instead of rolling so your hamster will not be upside down. Another bug I noticed is on the rotating blocks, I got stuck in the wall. This happened twice, only because I started rolling once I hit the block (only happened if I was rotating upside down, don't roll when on that block and you'll be fine). Lastly, the prize wheel. I was spinning it etc etc, then the hamster on the prize wheel turned sideways. This caused my hamster in the actual game to be sideways. Also some minor lag issues.\n9/10 would recommend, great game and very fun for such a low price! Absolutely love it. Buy it!","May 15","true","15.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
