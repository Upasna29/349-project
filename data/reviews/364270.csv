Both Dawn's Light and this game are the best RPGMaker games I have played, owing largely to the humor and the creative use of the engine.\n\nYou can never predict what you will see next in Lilly and Sasha. Houses, NPCs, quests, and other things are scattered around the fields. You might fight a goat, walk up the path a little bit to start a photography quest, and then ultimately find yourself in a Harvest Moon parody. All in the same field screen. For similar reasons, it is worth talking to everyone you see and doing all the quests. Some of the quests, such as one that involved watching an NPC interrogate people, caused me to burst out into laughter. There are also a couple of little easter eggs for those who have played Dawn's Light.\n\nPuzzles appear throughout the game (generally consisting of pushing objects around with different goals). They are easy early on, but they get progressively harder towards the end of the game. But don't pass on the game just because of some potentially annoying puzzles. I recommend looking at the solutions in the guide (available on the bottom right-hand side of the store page where it says "view the manual") if puzzles like this aren't your thing.\n\nMost experience comes from quests, so you can pretty much fight as much or as little as you want to. You shouldn't feel compelled to grind anything unless, perhaps, you are playing on hard difficulty (I didn't try it).\n\nThis is a game that, quality and creativity-wise, should set a standard for other RPGMaker games, and I am very much looking forward to starting the sequel.","June 11, 2015","true","20.2"," 44 of 46 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","44","46","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherry-sama/recommended/364270/","cherry-sama","CherryCo.Studios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherry-sama/","11 products in account","This game was not what I expected. By that I mean I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting a dark, over gritty story, and instead got a charming little adventure. Sure, there are parts that are darker, but the majority of the gameplay is quite pleasant, both in tone and to play. Granted, I picked the “Easy Setting” to get through the game faster (because I’m a lazy person), but there was still some challenge to the game despite that. The official artwork is seriously misleading in what the content of the game is like. But I wouldn’t consider that a bad thing (especially how great they look).\n\nThis game is a good example of what you can do with default RPG Maker assets. True, I think there are some custom assets in the game, but a lot of this game works with the default icons and tilesets and…it actually gives it charm. For me, at least. But it may be a deterrent for some other people. (I’m looking at you, SakifX9.)\n\nThe writing in the game was, overall, decent. Make no mistake—this game is no literary masterpiece. Not by a longshot. But there were a lot of moments I thought were cute. However, as a writer myself, I remember reading the dialogue and constantly thinking of little tweaks that would improve it. There were some moments that I thought would be just that much better if they reworded slightly. But it’s also worth noting that I found myself skimming through text during the latter half of the game. True, there were probably a lot of good moments I missed, but I always got the gist of things. If you think this invalidates my opinion on the writing in this game, then I can’t blame you.\n\nOne major complaint I have about the game, though, is the multitude of puzzles. It’s clear that’s what the developer/s love to do, but I’m not a person that particularly enjoys them. Sure, puzzles are kinda something to expect with the RPG package, but my brain just isn’t built that way. I usually avoid looking up walkthroughs until I get hopelessly stuck. I got hopelessly stuck in two places in this game due to the puzzles. One of them wasn’t mandatory, so I just gave up after a couple hours of frustration, but the second one was mandatory to continuing the plot. That is bull. It should not take me looking up the strategy guide to be able to beat the game.\n\n(Also, to anyone who is interested in buying this game, do not, do not, do NOT do the Treasure Dungeons! Ever! You get the first key in the main quest...DO NOT FOLLOW UP ON IT! Why? I sat through it, all five of them, putting in hours and hours of work, and the reward was super lame. Like, lamer than I could even expect. If you’re doing the quest called Grammy on the Run, then you’ll have to do all five, but DO NOT DO ANYTHING MORE THAN FINDING HER! I’M DEAD SERIOUS! If you’re a person who doesn’t enjoy puzzles, THEN STAY AWAY!)\n\nA second complaint I have is with the quests are in this game. After a while, they started to really get on my nerves for one reason: they’re rarely straightforward. I know it’s kinda standard RPG territory, but this game really went overboard with it. I’ll make up an example to avoid potential spoilers:\nYou come across a guy who wants a flyswatter he left at his ex-girlfriend’s house. You go to her house, and then she says she sold the flyswatter to a peddler after the two broke up. You find this peddler halfway across the world only to discover that he sold the flyswatter to a witch. You find the witch in a remote location only to be told that the witch DOES have the flyswatter, but she put a curse on it for the lulz, and anyone who touches the flyswatter will instantly die. So you have to explore the nearby swamp to collect the necessary ingredients to create a potion to break the curse. Once you collect all eight ingredients, the witch breaks the curse on the flyswatter, so you can finally take it with you. You then travel back to the first guy and give him his flyswatter. He rewards you for your efforts with a borderline useless item (and you usually get some EXP too).\nLike I said, that’s not an actual quest in the game, but over 75% of the quests in the game operate like this. Sometimes the rewards are worth the effort, sometimes they’re not. Again, I shouldn’t complain, since quests like this come with the territory, but this game REALLY went overboard with it. Again, not a deal breaker for me, but it might be for you, dear reader.\n\nAfter that little tangent, let me just say that the music in the game is awesome and perfectly atmospheric. Granted, I recognized one track from an RPG Maker Music Album, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a good song.\n\nOne halfhearted complaint I have is on the artwork and face graphics themselves. They’re beautiful and realistic. However, they create artistic dissonance between them and the pixel artwork of the rest of the game. Again, not really a complaint, but they just seem really out of place.\n\nAlso, this game has commentary in it! About a whole range of topics to: mostly on RPG Maker Game Logic, but there was this long segment that criticized playwriting and acting. I think one of my favourite moments in this game was when the characters were watching a play in a mansion, and the developers actually took the time to show the actors run on and off stage. However, there was some commentary that I found either weak or just didn’t understand. There was this entire town whose dialogue was apparently shallow and weak, but I found it just fine. On the other hand, some commentary was hilariously spot on. All the characters you come across are using RPG Maker XP sprites, but then they come across a city of “dwarves”, which is made up of entirely RPG Maker VX/Ace sprites. THAT made me laugh, even though my game’s characters are made up of these sprites.\n\nProbably one of the biggest disappointments of this game was the character of Viper; at least for me. At first I thought she looked really cool, but she was so inconsistently written that I became turned off of her character. There were several moments where they could have developed her character, but didn’t. Other times they tried to develop her character in ways that contradicted what was already established. Lastly, after she joins the party, she takes up around 70% of the dialogue, leaving 30% for the other characters. The title implies that Lily and Sasha are the main focus, but then why does Viper hog so much screentime? The game kept trying to build her up as someone important and useful, when really, she wasn't. There IS something that happens near the very end, where you were supposed to feel sorry for her, but I was just too annoyed with her, so I actually found it very satisfying.\n\nAlso, fair warning for any of you out there thinking of getting this game, the ending is pretty big sequel bait. I didn’t mind this, since I have the sequel as well, but it makes me dread playing it because I know there’s another sequel after that which I don’t have. The ending can work on its own, I guess, but really, this is a game that you play to play the entire series, not just the first entry. Which confuses me…why have three short games when you can combine them into one long game? I dunno. Anyway, just thought I’d warn you all.\n\nDespite all of this, I still recommend this game. Sure, Viper annoyed me a little, and I found the puzzles a bit overkill, but if you, dear reader, play it, maybe these things won’t rub you the wrong way like they did for me. Is it the best game ever? No. Every game has its flaws, and I think the positives outweigh the negatives with this one.","September 26, 2015","true","22.8"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","31","33","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/364270/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1583 products in account","Lilly and Sasha: Curse of the Immortals is a game created with RPGMaker software. It’s a 2D pixelated tale revolving around the two sisters the game is named after. After being fooled into reawakening the evil immortal Zahhak by Donovan the wizard, you spend the rest of the game trying to rectify the mistake, meeting party members and helping people along the way. This title is fun and retro, I enjoyed the hours of gameplay that I put into it as I was very eager to see how the story concluded.\n\nWhen you start the game you watch as Zahhak possesses Sasha’s body and her twin Lilly can only watch in horror. She then vows to do whatever it takes to save Sasha from the curse and their quest begins to find more information or a cure. Along the way you meet Griffin, a member of the Fighter’s Guild who wants to live up to the glory his father once had. With his help your journey then takes you to Enoch for answers as he to ends up joining your cause. Eventually you also meet Viper, a member of the Thieves Guild, you bring her on your quest as she possesses vital information you need. In total you have five party members, each with different strengths and weaknesses. They all become friends as they travel, taking on each enemy that gets in their way. I felt that the cast melded well together, each having a unique personality. Their story seems straight forward but there a few twists and turns that I won’t mention but they’ll keep you on your toes.\n\nThat, however, is where my praise of the story comes to a bit of a halt. While the main storyline is about saving Sasha, most of the game is spent doing side quests and running around in circles. Lilly often complains she wants to hurry up and save her sister yet doesn’t seem to have much issue with getting side-tracked. I’m ok with an RPG having side-quests, they’re  interesting and in this game you need the extra experience points, but the ones in Lilly and Sasha: Curse of the Immortals  are very drawn out. An example would be a quest where a ghost asks you to deliver letters, as he was a postman before death. It’s easy to deliver these letters as you travel along your main quest, which is awesome and makes a lot of sense. Once you’re done, however, things take a turn in the quest which is also ok. I found the extra task of getting coffee for the party members so they could stay awake to be extremely annoying. While it is during the quest, it’s a very unnecessary objective to have there. Repeat unnecessary objectives in all of the side quests and main quests and it adds up. I imagine this is to make up for the fact that the world in the game is actually pretty small and with not much to do aside from save Sasha the gameplay had to be extended. Yes, sadly none of the side quests are story driven and don’t add much more depth to the characters.\n\nWhile you’re knee deep in side quests, you will notice the game mechanics are pretty simple. You walk around and interact with people and objects. Enemies roam around freely so you can engage with them or try to avoid them. Most move pretty slowly and in predictable patterns so it’s not hard to walk around them. When you are in battle you’ll be fighting with only three characters and a pet, if you have one. Your options are a bit limited, you can do a special move, a quick attack, a strong attack, a team attack or use an item. You can’t block unfortunately and you never gain any new skills. Your moves all rely on stamina as mana is not present in the game. You can augment your characters with weapons, armor, charms, trinkets and runes. The only real variety comes from trinkets and runes. Trinkets add special aspects such as “always have the first turn” or “dodge easier” and the runes affect your strong and weak attacks adding poison, blind and other bonuses to them. The game mechanics work but they can seem a bit boring in this modern age. While it is only an RPGMaker game a bit more variety and features would have been nice.\n\nThe art in the game is fine, using retro-style pixels except for the character portraits. One thing I did not like was during battle the character portraits were not there, instead at the bottom of the screen where their stats are you only see their sprite enlarged. This seemed like a wasted opportunity since the portrait artwork is nice. The audio in the game is also fine. The game has sound effects where they should be and the characters even make grunts when they attack or are attacked. What I really enjoyed was the music. Most of it fit the game very well and kept the tempo of the story points. The battle music was very catchy, which is good since you will end up hearing it a lot.\n\nI ended the game at level 25 with about 20 hours of gameplay though I’m sure a good bit of that was idle time. Despite being overrun with side quests I did enjoy the story. The game also adds in puzzles to keep you on your toes, though I found a lot of them to be annoying personally.  The greatest flaw of  Lilly and Sasha: Curse of the Immortals is that it’s the first game in a trilogy. The game is drawn out to make it seem longer than it has to be if it was just one whole entity. In the end, you don’t feel fulfilled because the story carries over to the next game so really not much is accomplished making this title feel like a very long prologue. While I liked it I would warn buyers that you should be prepared to buy the next two games to finish things completely. Luckily you can carry over your save files between games so you don’t have to start from scratch each time. With trading cards, a humorous story, and fun RPG elements, the good certainly outweighs the bad, so pick this one up.\n\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favorite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","April 1","true","24.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I actually laughed out loud a lot.  And I didn't spot any major grammar or spelling errors, which was a nice change; I'm used to RPGs where the creator doesn't know the difference between "your" and "you're" which drives me crazy.\nOverall, I would recommend this game to people who like puzzles.

So far, the game has been a lot of fun.\n\nCombat mechanics aren't very complicated; each character has\n1.  A weak attack, a strong attack, (both of which start generic but can be altered by runes)\n2.  A powerful attack, heal or buff unique to that character, and\n3.  Team attacks based on the other people placed on the team with them.\nIn place of a static MP system, characters use Stamina, which regenerates in battle.\n\nThe dialogue is pretty entertaining, with characters feeling pretty well fleshed out in personality.  This occasionally gives rise to conflict within the party, which gives the group a degree of believabilty many games lack.\n\nEDIT: I forgot in my first draft to mention the puzzles, which deserve recognition.  While they wren't quite as common or as intense as Lufia/Lufia II, they bring those games to mind.  Specifically, a LOT of the side quests offer tangible rewards for playing through puzzles, so while they aren't "necessary," those of us who enjoy such things get a warm fuzzy feeling AND better gear.\n\nMy only complaint (and it's a doozy) is that as of the time of this writing, gear bonuses are not being added properly to your chars.  I haven't done my homework on things like Strength, and Agility, but they seem to be working.  However, Spirit (which adds HP) is NOT being added to the characters' HP totals.  This means characters whose gear focuses on toughness (like Griffin, one of your early chars) suffer, since their gear gives up points in other stats which do seem to be added in.  Hopefully the devs will fix this.\n\nIn all, it's been a fun game so far.  Seems a bit brief, but for the price, the length is reasonable.","August 2, 2015","true","17.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It knows its limitations yet it makes the most of what it has and still pushes on to innovate in the various areas that it can do so.\n\nIts a tale of two sisters, the attractive one gets cursed because some cheeky sod thought it would be a great idea to opne up a lichgate(a gate of death), satan was intriuged by this so satan is now inside one of the protagonists. Its one of those deal with it situations, you might think this is a great situation, no. All that really happens is a few dodgy words come out every now and then, a hatred for churches, dogs running away and pigeons getting way out of dodge.\n\nAlong your journey to kindly ask satan to go about his day you pick up a kid that dreams of becoming famous, he believes that killing satan might help to achieve this, there is also some priest and some assasin is trying to keep you alive because they needed to broaden the types of customers they were taking I guess.\n\nThe quests are very varied, there is the standard fetch quests, the go here and kill it quest, but then there are the "perform a play in order to execute a heist" quest and the "convince a princess that she is real or "legit"" and illegal dog racing(the small one wins every time).\n\nBack on topic as with any rpgmaker game a lot of the time will be spent in combat and man is this just great, here you can enjoy the fantastic soundtrack which is just fantastic to the point where i wouldnt mind listening to it in my spare time, did i mention this soundtrack comes free with the game, well it does so umm yay i guess. The combat itself is great, you have standard attacks, character based attacks and co-op attacks which use the synergy between each character and then healing which you will need to be doing, you will need to actively change your party line up everynow and then in order to defeat a certain type of mob(you can select 3 at once but you generally have 4 or 5 people to choose from) and all characters gain xp regardless of them being in or out of battle which is great for people that hate grinding. The best part is no random encounters, any enemies will show up as physical objects unless there is a trap.\n\nThe map is very varied, you will be fighting on land, in caves facing the heat of lava, in a ganghideout facing pirates that are confused about their sexuality, in a crazy mans mansion or in a apple farm which is nice because ALL YOUR APPLES ARE BELONG TO US.\n\nThis game is great because its a step above the others in its class, ive played horrid rpgmaker games and ive played great ones, this though is one of the best, the music and complex combat are fantastic and you will just want more.\n\n-Note that the max resolution of this game is 640x480\n-While it works with a keyboard and mouse rather well i suggest a controller","January 5","true","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I didn't even get an hour of game time out of it.  I was only able to play the very beginning where it started out decently interesting then just became a mix of confusion and boredom.  I had a quest to talk to someone and had no direction whatsoever to who that person was, which meant I had to talk to everyone to try to find who I was looking for.  All of them had more quests to give me that seemed useless to the plot, that I wasn't aloud to refuse.  Then I wasn't sure which quest to follow and had no direction into where to find what I needed to do.  The story may pick up and be great after the beginning but I couldn't even get past the beggining, so I can't tell you about that.  I wouldn't recomend getting this game unless it is onsale for a VERY cheap price or you have already looked into the game and know you will enjoy it.","November 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I got more out of selling the cards from this game than I actually paid.  The game is wonderful (though I love RPG Maker games).  The music is absolutely amazing and the story has quite a bit of humour in it.  It's charming and I would normally strongly recommend it (in fact I convinced a couple of friends to pick up the game).  There are some minor issues, for instance the battle system is very "meh" and not involved... it's extremely easy.  The only con on the story I would say is that it's too dialogue heavy... or more accurately, it seems like there's a lot of dialogue that was just thrown in to be in there.  With that in mind though, I would still recommend this game if it were not for 1 thing.  I broke the game and can't play it anymore.  I posted on the forums for this game and have received no response.  If I do get a response that fixes the issue I will change my review.\n\nEssentially what happened was in Vault 2 there is a puzzle.  I completed the puzzle (and when you do you lose the ability to reset it).  The problem was the way I completed the puzzle blocked the way I came.  I thought nothing of this.  I finished the vault and there was a save point right at the end... so I saved it.  Upon trying to leave the vault... oh ♥♥♥♥... I blocked the door... now I can't leave.  I am literally stuck in this vault, unable to leave, and unable to play the game in any capacity.  Of course I only had 1 save and I was over 10 hours into the game... and quite frankly I don't feel like replaying those 10+ hours.  So until a fix is made... you get a negative review Lilly and Sasha.\n\nUPDATE: Dev got back to me and is fixing this for me as we speak.  Very helpful and quick... changed my review to a positive because the game is quite good and he fixed the issue so easily.","December 28, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sometimes I'd spend an hour trying to figure it out, and when I finally did, it was super fun!\nI recommend playing it through without long periods of time in between gaming sessions, as the story is pretty relevant and forgetting things might hinder your quest completion. The story line is good, with a nice twist at the end. The conversations throughout the game are funny and sarcastic.\n\nTo summarize:\n• super fun puzzles\n• decent storyline\n• funny convos\n\n","November 12, 2015","true","23.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In fact, it is far from a masterpiece, and I don't think it's worth its full price.\nThe battle system is somewhat simplistic (but maybe I'd be expecting too much from a RPG Maker game, I don't know), and the setting is not the most breath-taking I've ever seen, but this game does have its strengths.\nFor starters, I loved the soundtrack, not to mention the light-hearted (for the most part) atmosphere which I didn't expect from a game with such a title and the humour. Holy ♥♥♥♥, the surreal situations and interactions I've witnessed.\nSPOILER: This is a game where you see a dude make a bomb out of a wooden stake, a plastic frog and a book about cats (yes, the subject is apparently important), and a bridge out of a rose, a diamond, a bucket of straw and a BOOMERANG. If that doesn't sound awesome, I don't know what does.\n\nI had paid it 8 cents, true, but I'd recommend it anyway if it was discounted by, say, even a mere 50%.\n\nAnother nice feature is that you don't have to grind levels in order to advance through the game. I mean, if you do happen to be needing some, the quests are far more rewarding (experience-wise) than battling countless hoardes of monsters. Oh, and no random encounters à la Final Fantasy I-X, which is also good.","November 12, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Easy to Hard.\nShift tab doesnt work.\nYou can play the game with a xbox controller and with the mouse.\n\nAbout the game.\nYou play as a girl...\nYou play with multiple different characters.\nMusic is okay. Sort of looping or repeating...\nThere is an option menu in-game.\nThere are multiple save slots.\nGame stutters from time to time and freeze for 2 seconds and then move on.\nYou can slide the music/sound with a barslider.\nYou can choose between windows mode or fullscreen.\nThere is no option to change the resolution size.\nThere is no option to change graphical settings.\n\nDevelopers thought it was funny to add "sound effects" during scenes. In fact they aren't. They are rather annoying especially if they keep looping and looping and you hear the same stuff for 10 seconds.\n\nYou are able to see the Monsters wandering around. They will only attack you if you are 1 tile next to them. They will not sprint or run at you, even in eyesight.\nThere is combat music. It's ok. Combat music changes every fight.\nDuring combat you can see the current HP of the enemy.\nBackground fights are okay. It changes whenever you currently are. Cave = cave background.\nGrass = grass background.\n\nThere is a Stamina bar. It's like a mana bar basically. It entirely refills when the fight is over.\nHowever a low Stamina will put the character into sleep and will not be available for a couple of turns.\n\nOther things.\nI don't like people who are making games from RPGmaker. Unless the game is for free. This is a cheap way to get money.\nJust one of those other Rpgmaker boring games.. Every concept is the same.\nConstant freeze that shows up every 5 second. Really ruins the game.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 3/10","March 9","false","6.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

To be honest I had next to no expectations at all and itreally turned out to be a positive surprise. For the price I payed it was more than worth. After roughly 20 hours (which I never though I'd put on a RPG Maker game) I've 100-percented the game and feel it's time to write my review.\n\nPositive:\n* A lot of fun and rewarding side quests. My favourite is Well Traveled just for the final scene :3\n* Good dialogue and surprisingly fun - quite a lot of times you'll be laughing out loud. There are a lot of 4th wall jokes\n* Good and catchy music\n* The puzzles. It features some of the hardest and most challenging puzzles I've ever encountered across all genres.\n* The battle system! There is no such thing as mana, but instead a stamina bar which heals after every battle. Along with the battle system is a lot of customization options with trinkets and runes for buffs and perks.\n* A just enough long game with a lot of content and a well-polished world and some memorable characters\n\nNegative:\n* The game starts off reeaaally slow and the first hour it will seem kind amateurish\n* This one is a matter of taste but I personally think the character portraits are kinda ugly\n* Earlier I said that the side quests are fun. If so, all except the Treasure Hunting quest. I don't wanna spoil anything but it IS NOT worth your time. Only do it if you are determined to 100% the game. If not, just DON'T. If you don't mind the spoiler, see the spoiler text: You complete the hardest puzzles in the game just to get a trinket that turns the whole party into slimes in battle. That's it. No buffs, no runes, no nothing. A complete waste of time.\n* Some of the dialogues can be pretty bad (but for the most part it's really good with a lot of humor!)\n* No ability to screenshot in-game. The F12 button just to resizes your window but also resets the game. Be aware!\n* (No achievments) (But trading cards :3)\n\nThe final boss is both puzzling and challenging but the ending is kinda meh. It ends abruptly and will continue where it leaves off in the second and third game. But since the next two games doesn't seem nearly as good as the first, the adventures of Lilly and Sasha is something I don't think I'll fulfill.\n\nVerdict: I still don't think it's worth its full price but it's a good game nevertheless. I recommend it to any RPG fan if you can get it on a sale. It has its moments and when it's at its best it will get you hooked and give you solid old school JRPG fun.

Die Grafik ist nicht berauschend, die Steuerung eher behäbig, die Story kennt man auch schon, Immerhin ist die Musik, wenn auch nicht immer passend, so doch ganz gut.\n\nWas sind also die Unterschiede?\n\nDa wäre einmal das man keine Skills außerhalb der Kämpfe benutzen kann. Immerhin sieht man die Gegner auf dem\nBildschirm, es gibt also kaum Zufallskämpfe. Aber trotzdem ist es lästig. Entweder geht man nun den ganzen Weg\nbis zum Inn zurück um zu heilen oder man muß Items benutzen. Und da Gegner kaum Loot haben (Items und Geld)\nist das schon lästig. Auch in HInsicht, dass danach alle Gegner (außer Boss) wieder auferstanden sind, keine leichte\nEntscheidung. Zumindest braucht man sich keine Sorge über sein Gepäck machen....auch der Händler hat so gut\nwie nichts zu verkaufen.\n\nAls nächstes gibt es Haustiere zu kaufen. Diese geben im Kampf einen Bonus und können sogar bis Level 5 aufsteigen.\nAllerdings dauert es seeehhhr lange bis sie den nächsten Level erreichen...und so berauschend ist dieser Bonus auch nicht.\n\nWeiter gibt es noch einen Unterschied im Kampf. Jeder der 3 Recken hat 100 Aktionspunkte. Nun kann man zwischen\n4 Aktionen wählen. Items benutzen...umsonst. Schnellangriff, kostet kaum Punkte, haut aber auch nicht viel rein.\nGroßer Angriff/Heilzauber liegt bei 40 Punkten. Und dann noch Gruppenangriff, der bei 60 Punkten liegt...und meiner\nMeinung auch nicht viel besser als Großangriff ist.\nNach jeder Aktion bekommt man um 20 Punkte wieder gutgeschrieben....rechnet es euch aus, meistens reicht es gerade\nmal für 6 Angriffe...danach macht man ein kleines Nickerchen bis wieder genügend Punkte vorhanden sind.\nDa es halt aber auch nur 3 aktive Kämpfer gibt....und nur eine Heilerin!!!!\n\nAls letztes, gibt es ziemlich häufig Rätsel zu lösen...von der Sokoban Art.\n\n\nEmpfehlung? Schwierig. Das Spiel ist gerade Mittelmaß. Ich würde es also nur denjenigen empfehlen, die es im Bundle\noder sehr stark runtergesetzt bekommen. Ansonsten gibt es bessere Alternativen.","May 6, 2015","true","3.7"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","6","20","2","1"

This game is refreshingly self-aware; it maintains that classic feeling of accomplishment and nostalgia like when you brought home a new GameCube or N64 game. I find the cheesy yet sarcastic characters really enjoyable and the puzzle aspect a nice change of pace. The side quests are also a great addition to the main storyline.\n\nI did notice minor glitches, graphic inconsistiencs and some slight frusteration with the auto pathing for click movement, but overall they do not really effect gameplay. Just be sure to save often in case the game crashes or you get stuck somewhere.\n\nOverall, a great game to come home and unwind with.\n\n","January 30","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't want to pay 21.00 for the entire saga so I decided to try to find it on Steam. I was pleasantly surprised to find all 3 installments for around 6 bucks so I saved 15.00 which is GREAT. Second, if you like the classic RPG games like Aveyond, then you will love this game! I have been scouraging bigfish and amazon appstore trying to find more games like Aveyond and I was starting to be convinced that I had played them all. I read many reviews for this game here and on bigfish and after seeing the pictures, it looked to be exactly what I was hoping for. It is! Now, I havent finished the game yet as I have only been playing about 3 hours so far, but that is plenty of time for me to know that I love the game.\nSome "Pro's" I've found are:\n\n1. The monsters are visable so I can decide what to fight and when. I hate games where the monsters are invisable and you have to fight every 3 steps. That alone is enough to turn me off. So visable monsters are a HUGE must have for me.\n\n2. The story line is great. It's interesting and makes you want to know what will happen next. It is quite funny at times and makes me chuckle. Let's face it, in these kind of games the story line is pretty much what we're there for. Without a good story....you don't have a good game!\n\n3. The MAP is amazing! This is the first time I've seen maps like this in RPG games. I used to spend endless hours lost in a seeming maze until I got desperate and googled the map for the game lol This game has the maps included and are clearly labeled so it's pretty much impossible to get lost!\n\n4. It lets you choose the difficulty of the game (easy. medium, hard) I'll be honest, I normally choose the easiest mode. I don't like to spend endless hours fighting monsters just to die and have to fight them again. I like this style of games for the story line and the questing. Don't get me wrong, I know I have to fight monsters to level up enough to beat the final boss but I'd rather get it over with as quick as possible so I can get on with the story.\n\n5. It has a journal which clearly tells you what you have to do next. Now MOST RPG's that I've played have this but NOT all of them so (just by playing those games and knowing what it's like, to not know what to do next,) trust me it helps.\n\n6. There are a collection of pets you can get to give you extra stats while fighting. I only have a snake right now so I dont know a ton about the pets but I think I will enjoy finding out more about them and finding them all within the game.\n\n7. The controls are pretty standard. I can use the arrow keys and space bar or if I prefer to use my mousepad and "touch" the area I want to go to, then that works as well.\n\nNow I only found a few "Cons" but I feel that I should mention those too even though they were not NEARLY enough to turn me off of the game.\n\nCons:\n1: The character moves SOOOO SLOW. Now I know from other RPG's like this that you usually start out with a slow speed and you find shoes somewhere throughout the game to make your character speed up. This character just seems to move slower than most, I think lol. I can't wait to find those shoes!\n\n2. It seems to take a long time to level up but I guess since there are 3 installments of the game then they probably want you to stay at a specific level for each installment so again, not a biggie.\n\n3. It seems very hard to make money in this game. You can fight endless battles but you only get like 10 coins for each one. Again I've only been playing for about 3 hours and my characters are only a level 7 so I havent needed to buy them much of anything. It seems like money doesn't matter too much at this stage of the game. Hopefully I will start to gain more money as I fight higher level monsters.\n\nBut that's about it. I know I wrote a ton here and if you read it all then I do appreciate it lol I know that when I am looking for a game. I like to read the reviews before I spend my money on it. Especially on sites where you can't "try before you buy." I will say that if I hadn't came looking for the game on steam, and bigfish was the only option then I would have spent the 6.99 for each installment of the game. It is totally worth the money! You can download the free trial of the game on bigfishgames.com to try it out to see for yourself if you like it but i DEFINITELY would not buy it from there! lol","March 25","true","32.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are not into random battles, forget about em, you can avoid most battles in the field. Overall I thought the story held together really well and there were some good laughs throughout. Play this if you want a short(15-20hr getting 100% complete), well written JRPG, then this my friend is a great one!","May 8","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a very pleasant surprise, the story is alright but it's mostly the dialogues which made me love this. It makes the characters really likeable in the way they interract and mocks rpg cliches despite following rpg rules almost to the letter. It's really satisfying to not be a really good guy all the time.\nThe bad part is that it's quite slow, the software itself isn't very fluid expecially in some maps but even without that things like unskippable xp screen is a bit bothersome. It's relatively easy to avoid combat however, so it makes rushing through zones not as painful as in some old rpgs...\nOverall, a fun game. I'll most probably buy the sequels next sale","May 18","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
