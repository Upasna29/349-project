Actually even a b-horror comedy in many ways due to the main character being full of one liners, puns, and juvenile humor at times. The game also reminds me a bit of the POSTAL series in the way it looks as well as the over the top gore in certain situations, not to mention the vulgarity in humor. SOLD.\n\nBlackbay Asylum is a point and click adventure game at its heart, but most of my enjoyment came from the absurd humor. You are a psychopath and a serial killer that has been incarcerated in an asylum for the criminally insane. At the outset of the game you awaken in your cell with your only true friend, Teddy. He is your stuffed teddy bear and you think he is alive. You talk to him as if he were once in a while and care for him. He doesn't play much of a role past this other than some odd hallucinations you have later, but it gives you some insight into your childlike mind right from the start. You soon realize that your cell door is open and as you leave you find that there are no other inhabitants in the asylum besides you. Well...alive anywyas, or human. Your quest to escape the asylum is now underway.\n\nYou play as the pschopathic killer with his only true goal being one of escape. As you roam around the halls of the asylum you begin to uncover an occult element within the asylum that for some reason you decide you must solve and find out where it hails from! This is some of the silly in the game as the story combined with who you are as a protagonist doesn't really mesh. Why would this guy care, or why would he bother to look into this and try to stop it? There isn't much in the way of reason here, but that doesn't stop it from being fun!\n\nGore, vulgarity, and goofball humor follow you all the way through this tale. Most objects in the game world can be interacted with in some way. Well...they can be looked at and give you a bit of dialogue from the main character as he looks at them. Paintings will show his complete disdain for art in general, he will tell you how he doesn't believe in washing his hands in the sink you look at, and you will find out quickly that wooden boxes are useless! Our hero isn't a smart man, but he definitely enjoys the one liner. He also has a very dark sense of humor and leans heavily towards violence within it. He has a very childlike mind, but he can be quite clever in his quips at times as well. This dialogue from the protagonist is really the highlight of the game for me as it keeps you laughing throughout, but of course he makes you groan just as often.\n\nThis game has some interesting concepts and gameplay mechanics for an adventure title. It is designed like a point and click adventure game with the puzzles and the story elements where you play most of the game from an overhead view as you walk around the Blackbay Asylum, but certain chapters mix it up nicely and put you into first person mode! This isn't off putting at all. It is done very well and feels completely natural to go from the overhead to the first person views in certain levels. The first person levels actually lend to the horror elements and atmosphere better than the normal overhead view as well. While the graphics remind you some of the POSTAL series in the style, there are sections that have some creepy atomospheres. Sound helps to make these areas feel scary, and there are a couple sections that are very creepy with the use of drarkness, sound, and gore. The gore and violence is cartoonish for the most part with your character looking like a roided out weirdo covered in blood when you do get to see him most times, but the style fits fine and the graphics are fitting.\n\nLike any point and click adventure sort you will have to solve an array of puzzles. Blackbay Asylum excels in the puzzle realm. I played the game without guides and found that I was writing things down on paper and referring to them later for puzzles. This is always something I enjoy about adventure games when I must "work out" the puzzles in this way more than just pulling a lever here and there with no thought at all. The puzzles here are a good mix of using symbols, poetry, excerpts from books, some math, and many others. While most seem fairly logical, there are a few that are illogical such as the use of safe combinations. So just an FYI when it comes to using a combo safe lock...forget what you know about a traditional lock combo because this game doesn't abide by those. Turning a combo lock is MUCH more straightforward in game than it would be in real life. ;)\n\nCombat isn't a factor in the game really. You have a couple of scenes where you need to run away, but other than that you don't have too much in the way of "fighting". There are some boss "fights", but theese are actually done as puzzles rather than actual combat scenarios. The final boss is quite a unique battle I must say with several puzzle elements involved to win  he final battle. While I wouldn't say it was genius by any stretch, or even logical at all steps, it does offer a refreshing change to a boss fight that you won't see elsewhere.\n\nThe only major negative in the game is the lack of save features. The game saves when you complete a chapter. There are 10 chapters, but they all have varying lengths to them. Within these chapters are "checkpoints", BUT these checkpoints only matter for the current play session in case you happen to die. If you quit in the midst of a chapter you must start that chapter over the next time you play. Now...don't let this turn you off too much, however. This is a point and click adventure game with puzzles after all so levels can be VERY short once you know what you are doing. As in any adventure game the time it takes to get through an area depends mostly on your ability to solve the puzzles. So even if you must quit in the middle of a chapter, if you have solved most of the puzzles already it isn't a huge step back when you continue as you can breeze throught he puzzles you already know solutions to.\n\nOverall, Blackbay Asylum is quite a fun and entertaining adventure game. Full of gore, vulgar humor (I'm talking poop jokes even), and top notch puzzles. All combined with a strange occult tale as backdrop. Most of all I found this game to be incredibly FUN. I laughed throughout at the goofy lines, and was intrigued by an array of interesting puzzles. While I wouldn't recommend this as something to scare your pants off, I would recommend it for anyone looking to have a good time and enjoy a solid adventure game with childish humor and a lot of gore. :D\n\nIf you go through this without cheating it should probably take you around 5-10 hours to get through depending on your ability to solve puzzles. Blackbay Asylum also has Steam Trading Cards. 6 to be exact, which you will get 3 as drops.\n\n8/10 Demon Feces Piles","February 13, 2015","true","10.6"," 62 of 67 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","62","67","8","7"

This is a very good adventure game, well worth your time and money if you found yourself fascinated by the imagery and concept like I was. The story starts out simple, but as you progress it becomes clear there is more going on. The personality of the psychopath you play is quite amusing. Many objects in the game can be examined twice for humorous responses, and sometimes hints about what to do.\n\nThere are 10 chapters in all with varying length. If you don't use a guide the game will take 6 hours or more to beat (about 7 for me). I've personally found no bugs or glitches. What sound there is is well done and in certain places adds to the tension, as does the music. The game will occasionally switch to 1st person and this is done very well and further adds to the tension (this is first done in chapter 3, and if it had stayed in birds-eye view that section would not have been as interesting).\n\nThe meat of the game is indeed the puzzles. I admit I found myself stumped for awhile on several of them, but they are solvable without a guide. I did need a hint for one of them, and one particularly aggravating puzzle had me stumped for over 15 minutes. And this was just chapter 3! The puzzles continue to be challenging all the way to the end.\n\nMy only complaints are the numerous spelling and grammar errors, and the lack of a save anywhere feature. Otherwise I had a blast! I therefore recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of adventure games and wants something bloody and freaky.","August 1, 2014","true","7.7"," 81 of 97 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","81","97","0","0"

Some are straight forward, others are trial and error and others definetely require you to think about it, so all in all a good balance as of yet.\nAnd what I love most of all so far is that the game actually manages to scare me and I am glad to admit it. The scares are well spaced from one another and are varied. One in Chapter 2 comes out of nowhere and when you reach Chapter 3....well, let's just say I definetely wanted to "chicken out" at one or two stages when my "Nope"-senses were tingling. The transitions from birds-eye view to first person definetely add to immerse yourself in the atmosphere and the scares.\n\nAs such I can definetely recommend this game.","August 1, 2014","true","9.5"," 57 of 75 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","57","75","0","0"

It either means they don't actually take themselves seriously, or they take themselves SO seriously that you shouldn't bother to. Blackbay Asylum is the former sort, mashing top-down and first-person adventure gaming together with a liberal sprinkling of incredibly silly design. There's a lot of humor to be found here... which clashes more and more with the game itself the further in you get.\n\nYou play as... um... I think his name is Doug? I'm not entirely sure because it's never consistent, but he's a 6'8" mass murderer with a teddy bear and a soft side. My take is that you're not really supposed to sympathize with or revile him, just laugh along with him. And that's easy, because he has a ton of genuinely funny lines while examining the many hotspots of the asylum. I knew we were going to get along fine when he found someone ripped in half and shoved into a bookshelf, and said "That's why I don't read."\n\nMost of the game is played from a top-down perspective, with you leading Doug around the grim halls to examine things, collect items, solve puzzles, and maybe figure out why demons have ripped everyone else to pieces. The puzzles are generally very clear and well thought-out, though the top-down perspective can make it very hard to spot key elements on walls, or odd objects on tables or floors. I had a tricky time locating a puzzle box in one office because it looked like a tablecloth. Of course, if you just click on everything it'll be less of an issue, which you should to get more of Doug's musings.\n\nWhile the tone of the text is firmly tongue-in-cheek, the aesthetic is not and only gets darker. Flayed bodies are everywhere, and the demons get creepier and more startling the further in you get. The third chapter actually shifts things to first-person and ups the spooks pretty hard, with some corpse jumpscares, a lantern segment, and a gauntlet of horrors. Bear in mind that this all comes immediately after being eaten and pooped out of a giant monster. It starts to get weirdly whiplashy, alternating between goofy lines from Doug and Unity horror tropes.\n\nThere's a certain trashy charm to Blackbay Asylum, not quite as fully endearing as something like Splatter, but probably unique enough to keep you on board if you know what to expect. The exploring and puzzling is good as long as you're a little meticulous about it, and whether you're in for the laughs or the spooks, you're going to get something you're looking for.","October 30, 2015","true","1.3"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","20","23","4","0"

As captivating as the story is, if you have an hour to spend with this game, if you wanted to enjoy every single detail, every interactible and read every document (not to mention solving puzzles), an hour is not enough for most of the chapters (apart from few really short ones). So you either play this game when you have lots of time, or wait until you do, because lack of saving option might be frustrating at times.\n\nBut, if you like archaeology, ocult, bizarro, dark humour, obscure, sick and depraved climates, you don't mind playing as psychopath and you're not turned off by lots of blood, corpses, disturbing and disgusting environment, that game is for you.

Contains minor spoilers ahead!\n\n"Sometimes you play a game that defies all expectations. When you go in expecting roses, sometimes you get daisies and sometimes you get smacked in the face with a rotten tuna fish. Blackbay Asylum is like having both of those things at once."\nBlackbay Asylum is a top-down/first person puzzle/horror game set at the eponymous Blackbay Asylum, which is located off the coast of Innsmouth, Massachusetts. For those who are unfamiliar, Innsmouth is a fictional city known for it’s relation to the HP Lovecraft mythos. In here, you play as Doug, a large and heavily muscled man who recently incarcerated at Blackbay for being a mass murdering sociopath.\n\nGameplay in Blackbay Asylum generally consists of moving Doug through the level, collecting the equipment and knowledge to solve each puzzle as it pops up. Speaking of the game as a whole, the puzzler aspect is much stronger than the horror one. Although the first few chapters left me unimpressed, (if you can make sense of it then you can get through the first level within 10 minutes) it was probably designed that way to bring people into the game a lot more. The puzzles in the first level aren’t too difficult and they get you really immersed in the game and also makes you feel more intelligent than when you started. And it doesn’t take long for them to get genuinely tricky. Some of them have fairly simple gimmicks to work out before you can progress, but for the most part they’re cerebral enough to keep the old noggin’ working. Just like any good puzzler, the challenges you’re faced by start off fairly simple but ramp up the difficult as you go on.\n\nCharacters in the game are rare to come by; a lot of the other people that you see in the game are dead, dying or will soon be dead (either by monsters hands or by you) but the people you do come across aren’t overly well written. For instance you come across a man who is hiding in a dumpster in the first level who sounds insane, ironically, and some of the things he says just seem a bit too wild even for an insane asylum. Also a receptionist at the front desk who is working and on her cell phone the whole time doesn’t seem to care when a giant man covered in blood walks from Isolation into the lobby which is a bit odd. That being said, it’s worth reminding you that Blackbay is indeed a horror game. While the dialogue and descriptions are exceedingly silly, every aspect of the game is eerie.\n\nSo, I’d played through the first two chapters of the game and then I landed in Chapter 3. The third Chapter of BBA is almost flawless. It is genuine horror, perfectly executed. The camera moves from being a top down puzzle adventure game to a first person perspective and it’s at this point where you start to notice the graphics of the game, allowing you to see more of the surrounding environment more than before. From the top down perspective the graphics don’t really seem to great however once you start looking through Doug’s eyes you notice some smaller things in the game. And this was a great way to use the shift in perspective because there are things that you can only see through Doug’s eyes at this point such as items on the middle shelf or a piece of information written on a notice board. While in this first-person section, there were times when I had to stop playing for a few minutes, and just breath. I don’t mind admitting that I got genuinely spooked by the atmosphere it managed to create.\n\nWhether you should play this game is determined by your tastes as a gamer. If you’re on the older side and looking to play as many adventure games as you can or don’t like puzzles, horror games, or any horror games that don’t take themselves seriously, I can’t say I’d recommend BlackBay Asylum. As for me, I think that Blackbay Asylum is a welcome addition to my Steam library and hearkens back to the days of top down action adventure, with a touch of horror, and some first person puzzle games which is terrific.","April 1","true","5.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I’ve definitely played more than two, and I’ve finished the game.\nBlackbay Asylum is an unapologetic horror game, played from a top-down (not isometric) perspective, which then later shifts to and from a first-person perspective. This is done by design, thus you do not have the option to change viewpoints. The game has several puzzles, which run the gamut from extremely easy to maddeningly difficult. The story is decent, and I quite enjoyed his escape and subsequent adventure.\n\nIt’s bloody, offensive and harkens back to a time before SJW’s had soapboxes like what the Internet has provided, but above all that, it’s quite a fun game. As for the disclaimer that pops up prior to playing, it’s not lying.\n\nProsDecent  story that is twisted and dark\nSound effects and music are both good\nDecent graphics; they work well for the atmosphere of the game\nGreat imagery, very dark\nFairly lengthy and will take you a while\nEnvironments are good and varied for the most part\nFun flavor text when examining some items; your character is truly insaneConsVoiceovers are not the greatest\nSome puzzles are needlessly complex, and most of them don’t help you in any way whatsoever, even subtle clues\nNo save system; if you start a chapter, you need to finish it to save (chapters do have checkpoints, but not ones that you can load if you leave the chapter)\nTad expensive for what it isSummaryBlackbay Asylum is a decent game. It’s fun, but gets a bit repetitive, and is overly offensive. This is the kind of game that would give a “trigger warning”. It invokes the era of the mid to late 90s, but it does so while having decent puzzles and an interesting enough story that you’ll want to see it to the end.","January 25","true","2.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Their are no jump scares in the game nor should their be as its an adventure, puzzle based game and horror is not their goal. The game is littered with puzzles, and yet you don't see the same one twice, sure I may come across a door that's locked and need to find the code but each time I need to find the code for the door the process is different.\n\nThe voice acting will not win any awards, and the cut scenes while all skip able are simple and short, broken up enough not to be an issue, or take you out of your immersion.

In Blackbay Asylum you play as Doug. Doug is a serial killer and as soon as he gets caught hes sent to Blackbay asylum the home for the criminally insane. One night Doug is able to leave the prison cell without anyone in sight. And we soon find out that the guards got murdered by roaming monsters and its up to you to get out of Blackbay. So how is this game ? Its a great game and worth the purchase without a doubt. The game is played in a top down perspective with a few execptions where it switches to first person. The game is like a point and click adventure game but you have free will where you want to go. The game works great. So lets go through the pros and cons. Pros: the game is relativly creepy and has great atmosphere. Great soundtrack. Simple and fun gameplay. But its an adventure game so it has puzzles. Now i feel like i have to talk about the puzzles. The puzzles go from relativly simple to head scratching in a heart beat. The game has some illogical puzzles which make the game hard to beat. And some items are easy to miss because theyre are placed in dark corners. The story is also great and has a few funny moments too. Cons: The game is also quite short and a few minor bugs. Overall If you like adventure games Blackbay asylum is a must buy because its a fun game non the less. Great atmosphere, great puzzles and overall a great game.

I currently have nearly 5 hours on record while on Chapter 5, which for those unaware there are 10 Chapters included in the game. The graphics may not be the most amazing you have ever seen. However, you will not be disappointed as the game is packed with puzzles that will not only challenge you, but also test your ability to retain information.\n\nSome people have complained about "typos" or the fact that there is no ability to save between levels (that's right folks - you have to beat the chapter or it won't remember your progress). Despite the whining of others out there, I found the typos to be apart of the game's charm as you are playing a psychotic killer who obviously is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, lol. I also want to mention that Doug has a very dry sarcastic personality, which can sometimes be downright hilarious as well as borderline offensive; you will see his personality is based on his limited understanding of the world and society in general.\n\nAlso, the inability to save challenged me to focus and complete a chapter either in one sitting or retain where all the clues were so when I came back through I could catch-up to where I was quickly. Thus, I would not let a few minor things that people did not like keep you from this awesome indie horror game that you are sure to love. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves horror, puzzles, or adventure in general!","August 25, 2014","true","4.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Twenty dollars was too rich a gamble for me, seeing it on sale for 5 though I bought it immediately. No regrets.\n\nIt's a funny little puzzle adventure game with early nineties PC graphics. They're not beautiful, in fact they're really ugly but they fit well with the games flippant attitude. Doug, our protaganist, is the mouthpiece for the majority of the game and to be honest I thought his goofball one-liners were really at odd with who he is but whatever. The game doesn't take its self seriously so why should I?\n\nThe puzzles are pretty good. The first few are infantile but they get harder and more interesting. Sometimes you'll get stuck because you missed an item which is a common failing of Point-and-Clicks. But to be fair this is not a Point-and-Click, its a Move-and-Push-Space and Doug is one bigass cursor. So comparitivily it's a little easier to find things you missed.\n\nMy only solid complaint is the voice acting, it's terrible. Doug is mercifully mute but you meet NPCs whose voices are somehow both obnoxious and boring.

He probably made fun of it because the game looks terrible. And let's be honest, the graphics of this game are pretty awful. Animations are pretty ♥♥♥♥ too.\n\nHowever, the idea behind the game interested me so much that I bought the game. And it was very entertaining from start to finish!\n\nI'm usually not the puzzle-kind-of-guy, but the puzzles in this game were pretty understandable and fun to solve. The rest of the gameplay is your typical run around and discover what items to pick up and how to use them.\n\nThe best part about this game is the story. Being inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, there are very interesting (and disturbing) things that you find out about Black Bay Asylum. I'm not gonna spoil it, but it was an exciting time I had with the game, and every new unlocked part of the game made me more interested to find out what's happening next.\n\nAnother very fun thing about this game is the protagonist. Playing a psychopath opens some interesting ways to solve some puzzles. Also, Doug has funny lines even for some very mundane things, which keeps the game interesting, even if you are just running around clicking on random stuff.\n\nTwo major flaws that I want to mention:\n1. I don't like how some puzzles can actually kill you if you fail. This happens only 2-3 times in the game, but I don't like to re-do stuff, just because I didn't do it in the arbitrary way the dev wants me to.\n2. There are no save-games in this game. So if you start a chapter, you should make sure you complete it in one sitting, because the game only saves whatever chapter you have unlocked.\n\nBut even those flaws (while being a bit of annoying) did not lower the fun I had while playing.\n\nOverall I can recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the obscure story and doesn't care if the game looks like from the early PS1 era.","June 27, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zitterberg/recommended/313140/","Zitterberg","Zitterberg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zitterberg/","620 products in account","This game is not worth full price. 20€ is far too steep a price for titles such as Blackbay Asylum, a crass and ugly game that proudly tries to set itself by the mere basis of being edgy. With FMVs that are the graphical equivalent of the first MediEvil released in 1998 for the PlayStation (just way uglier and devoid of personality), the game is bereft of a soul. Its main strength comes from its humour which, to be fair, is largely hit or miss (mostly miss). If your sense of humour revolves around the idea that observing how security guards possessing pornographic magazines is hilarious then Blackbay Asylum is going to be a non-stop hoot and holler for you. That is, if you can ignore the many grammatical and spelling errors that litter this game.\n\nIts inspirations are clear but none of them are treated with respect. I recognised at least two or three puzzles directly copied from Sanitarium. H. P. Lovecraft's works serve mostly as a thematic concept for the visual design of the monsters and the story itself (which is then all thrown out the window at the end anyway). Other segments in the game - where you are forced to switch from a bird's-eye-view to first-person - come across as an unnavigable dime a dozen "white mouldy corridor walking simulator" rendition of SCP (if SCP actually was bad). I cannot express how clunky and mishandled this segment was, especially after it followed a childish but unique experience beforehand that made me respect the game to a degree. Additionally, there is no option for the player to change the brightness in the pause menu. I do not wish or try to be mean but this was easily one of the most annoying sequences I have ever played through in a video game. All this coupled with the fact that there exists no option for saving your game and that it does not feature a decent checkpoint system, and you're condemned to prolong your exposure to this game by retrying an entire level from scratch if you mess up.\n\nNevertheless, there are certainly segments in the game that show the developers' potential for creating a far better game than Blackbay Asylum ever could be. It  has some jokes that actually hit well, sometimes features interesting puzzle designs and has moments where there are some clever bits of storytelling through its environment. Unfortunately, it is all bogged down by its own nature. It is a disorganised, repulsive, mean-spirited and (at best) a barely subpar mess. Blackbay Asylum wears its hideousness as a badge of pride then forces you to respect it, but ultimately fails to offer anything of merit in return beyond the emptiness that is its creative bankruptcy.","May 28","false","5.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Now that I've finished it though, I have to say, I feel like I wasted a couple hours of my life on this game...or maybe it's just not for me.\n\nI could speak a little about the story, but I'll save myself (and you) the time of reading the same thing you'll read in the game's description, that's more then you really need to know, considering that the story is so horribly uninteresting. That said, the game does offer lots of cheap amusement at the comments and things that the main character makes fun off throughout the game, being a horrror game though, it offers too little on that front, aside from a few, very sporadic tense moments and one section that's in first person through a very creepy, hell-like room, there really isn't much else that makes the horror aspect of the game "stand out".\n\nThe gameplay is standard-fare, overhead perspective, exploration. Interact with various objects, find items that allow you to make progress, solve puzzles and amuse yourself throughout as the main character makes a funny comment about something or another. The puzzles are somewhat interesting, but most feel like a chore...this isn't a point and click adventure game, but the puzzles feel exactly out of one of those games.\n\nThe graphics aren't anything to write home about, they look like something from the mid 00s or even earlier and the music/sound effects are generally annoying.\n\nI'd say avoid this one, not really worth getting, unless it's part of a bundle.","November 3, 2014","false","6.8"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","0"

Let's look at the basics. It's a very old school looking top down (and occasionally First Person) adventure title. Gory and silly humour, horror theme, and plenty of puzzles along the way. The puzzles are generally fair (only ever found 1 that the clues, or lack thereof, weren't good enough for me to understand), and the story is just silly enough to keep you interested throughout the campaign.\n\nThe bad, however, are fairly obvious things. Firstly, it's a very old school game. Meaning the gameplay is a little clunky, the action sequences can frustrate, and the graphics are notably dated. It's also a fairly short game. Almost all of the chapters can be completed within about 10-20 minutes. The only exceptions are longer because the actual gameplay takes longer (such as the first person sections, where the movement is quite annoyingly slow).\n\nThose things aside though, I had fun with it, and for the price, I can't really argue with the length or gameplay quality. This is the kind of game that people who still revel in retro would find enjoyable.

For instance Blackbay Asylum starts you off in a birds-eye view perspective then depending on the chapter or/and situation will automatically switch you to a first-person view; then once you complete the chapter or complete a certain task in the game it switches back to birds-eye view which along with the graphics doesn’t clash with the overall gaming experience instead it enhances it.  While the game itself has sick twisted sense of humor to it that can be very funny at times which is due to the protagonist Doug reaction in not just in cut scenes and situations he finds himself in, but also when you interact with the environment around you in general in terms of dialogue.  Lastly the main strength of the Blackbay Asylum seems to be the puzzles which come in not just a mixture of reasonable difficulty, but also the creative ways you have to go about solving the puzzles by finding clues with in the environment itself which the clues presents themselves in a way that doesn’t hold your hand which helps with the overall pacing of the game and gave will give a sense of accomplishment (note: unless you have a photographic memory I would recommend pencil and paper on certain puzzles).\n\nWhile I did enjoyed playing Blackbay Asylum, however the game is not flawless it does have certain glitch issues and concerns I have (best way to describe it), but in no way ruin the gaming experience but stood out which I put them into two categories neutral = +/- and negative = -:\n\nNeutral:\n+/- Screen Settings: Which it can be only be access by going back to the point where the warning content label appears.  When you get to this setting you have two screen options window and fullscreen, now window no matter what screen resolution is chosen it works while fullscreen seems to only work on the first resolution 1024 X 780.\n\n+/- Story- The story is handled well when presented in forms journals, logs, files, letters and talking to some of the inhabitants while in general it does come across a little cliché and certain part seemed rushed; for example in one chapter Doug reminiscence’s a part of his previous life which would been interesting to see more of this in gameplay and/or story considering the ending that I saw which will make you formulate two conclusions.\n\n+/- atmosphere- Now the game doesn’t go out of its way to necessary scare you but does provide certain type of discomfort which seems to be more of a mix bag.  For instance in the game while in birds-eye view all you can here is the music and the sounds of your footsteps will creates an eerie feeling with in the game, then once you get further enough a in gameplay event occurs which the overall execution in terms of tension was great, but there was part of me that feels that this was put in too early while the other believes the main issue is that this gameplay event doesn’t occur little bit more.  Lastly the first person view is highly variable is the best way to describe it.  I think part of the problem is from my perspective there is no type of game over if protagonist becomes too distress going into certain areas which is understandable because base off of my time playing it seems the developers goal was to immerse player’s in the environment (recommend playing this game in dark with headset on ).\n\nNegative:\n-	Only saves fully after completing chapter\n-	Replay ability (note: review ends here and only represents my time playing the game and things that stood out to me which if your still not sure I recommend to read other reviews, go to the community forum to ask questions or check for any type of game updates.  And note also that experience my vary depending your OS and down below are in gameplay glitches I came across and one of them could be a potential spoiler)\n\nOther than that the game as whole was very enjoyable and I can't wait to see what content and/or game they come up with next (:\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIn game glitches:\n. Occasional black screen usually occurring during the start of gameplay\n. Chapter 10 had a sound glitch which upon death from boss I kept hearing the beam charge to point I had to exit the game, but this only occured once.","August 31, 2014","true","28.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One day you find your cell door open and off you go with the 'best friend' stuffed toy the character imagines is alive. (And for those who have played 'Edna and Harvey' that's where the similarity ends). Lovecraftian horror themes develop soon after.\n\nThis is a genius mix of 3rd person point and click, first person interactive horror story and short sequences of just running away from scary monsters. The tension in the first person sections is really well judged I had a few moments where I just had to hide my eyes.\n\nDespite the high gore content the game is not mindless. The point and click sections have some really involved puzzles and the writing of the main character is quite clever. I wouldn't say you get to like him but he's entertaining.\n\nA few bad points:\nThere is no save game capability. Subchapters of the game are unlocked when you reach checkpoints and chances are your character will die a lot and keep having to backtrack a few minutes.\nOh so many typos, some of them actively confusing.\n\nNot much more to say, it's scary and engaging. Essentially a point and click but with sections where you have to react quikly.","November 22, 2014","true","3.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The sound design isn't half bad either, but the regular $19.99 asking price is way too much in my opinion.\n\nSure, it has trading cards but the game isn't without its flaws, most notably in the form of typos and contradictions. The typos often take the form of broken English and as for 'contradictions' I believe the biggest that comes to mind is the fact that in the intro it states that Blackbay is 8 mi. off the coast of Innsmouth, Mass. yet a little later in the game there is an indication in a journal entry or pamphlet that states it's 12 mi.\n\nThat aside, I did enjoy this game and Lovecraftian themes are always a plus in my book (uber Lovecraft fans may argue that this borrows a little too heavily from HPL's lore without giving a proper shout-out to the mythos he created, such as by straight up saying that the main baddie in the game is Cthulhu...which it clearly is!!).\n\nRegardless, as far as puzzle/adventure games go, this isn't half bad, but do yourself a favor and hold out for a sale if you do decide to get a copy.","March 21, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

If you have the chance to purchase this at $5 or so then I'd give it a whirl.\n\nWhere to start?  It's an interesting concept, using a mental asylum as the backdrop.  A serial killer who's the protagonist.  Find your way out of the asylum and figure out what's going on.\n\nIt's a concept that has been done before, and better -- Asylum I & II (Med Systems Software) in the 1980s, Sanitarium in the 1990s (available at various websites).  Radio Shack had a ghetto version of the asylum thriller called "Bedlam", it wasn't that good.\n\nThe view is from above, and is basically a pixel hunt and a challenge of paying attention.  It's gruesome at times, inappropriately funny at others, sometimes just plain obscure.  Some of the puzzles are easy, some more complicated.\n\nI think that the main reason I would recommend against this game is the lack of a save feature.  You have to start at the beginning of a chapter each time you play.  This gets tedious.  Would it really have been that hard to add a save option?\n\nThe whole testosterone-fueled, inappropriately humorous game was played out by Duke Nuke'em.  The humor in this game isn't really so juvenile as it is unnecessary.  It adds nothing to the experience.  Much of the humor is merely recycled cliches in one way or another.\n\nSo, if I look at all the moments of my life as being precious and if I want to make sure that I don't waste those moments, I have to say no about this game.  All in all, it isn't that bad.  It just isn't that good.","January 30","false","12.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

You get a storyline, some humor, some gore, talking to people, doing puzzles, items snatching ... It is alot longer than you would expect.  There are 10 chapters (at least) I think?  Some chapters are longer than others, so you can't just save anywhere you're at.  So far, the game has not been so brutal that I wasn't able to figure something out.

I like it. There were a few occasions when I got stuck with the puzzles. In one instance I almost gave up. But once I got past that everything was okay lol\n\nhttp://youtu.be/FCLC-3d4Yik\nThere is no combat. It's basically a series of riddles and puzzles. The puzzles are challenging and feature quite a bit of variety. I had to sort of cheat a bit by checking the community for answers and tips.\n\nThe graphics are definitely not amazing. But I was happy with how the game looks. I thought it actually kind of looked better in first person perspective. Perhaps the whole game should be like that. However one really annoying issue with first person view for me was that the cursor would go into my outside the screen to my second screen. If I clicked while it was there the game would be minimized. This was a constant issue in first person view. I hope the dev fixes this. Yes the game is really gory which personally I generally don't really mind. But the one thing I would have liked not to have seen is the naked backside of the monster after it has passed you through it's system at the start of chapter 3. Also the game is full of jokes which I usually found amusing.\n\nSo yeah if the style and the aesthetics of the game appeals and you like puzzles then this may be a good choice for you. It's not $5 but you can probably get an adequate amount of time out of the it for your money.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","August 1, 2014","true","4.5"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

Not that it is a horrible game by any stretch, just not my cup of tea I guess. I got it on sale for 5$ however and if you are lucky enough to grab that up then maybe. I think I'd actually be upset had I paid full price for it.\n\nBlackbay Asylum is a horror game set in asylum, and while asthetically that appealed to me I think the game designers could have done a better job with it's execution. But that isn't what they are all about either... It seems like their whole attitude about this game was to make it as over the line as they could...right down to the disclaimer on the opening screen.\n\nOne of the things I like most about this game is that the (hero?) is such an... unlikeable; or even evil character. I thought that was a pretty interesting spin on it and was anxious to give that a shot. The menus and dialogue are intuitive and easy to use; it's not really a hard game to play.\n\nThe biggest reason I'm not recommending this game is because of the flow of the game. The game goes from a move at your own pace speed of game to a do this now or die speed with little to no warning at times. And when you have to redo an entire chapter because you weren't quite quick enough to figure that out it's a little annoying. Some of the puzzles in this game are easy, some of them a bit more challenging; and some of them are downright bizarre and not intuitive at all. I play a lot of video games and really very seldom have to look to community guides for help, but I did have to in here. And in all fairness even after having the answer I could say yeah, I never would have thought of that.\n\nOverall I'd rate this game about a 5 out of 10. I wish they had a step between recommend and not because to me this is neither really. It's not a horrible game, just not a good one. If you're interested, get it on sale and give it a shot. To me it would not be worth 20$ though.","April 23","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a lot like early Resident Evils without the action. The plot has been done so many times, I kept having flashbacks to various games when a particular beat in the story would play.  This game has a horror setting, but  isn't really a horror game. It's just a blood-soaked puzzle game. The graphics are really, really dated. The cut scenes and general animations look AT LEAST ten years old, probably more. But that doesn't really matter. The game is all about solving puzzles in order to advance. There's about half that are in the self-contained puzzle box format and about half in the environmental puzzle, where you have to find the right item and use it in the right spot. The puzzles weren't really too tough and could have actually been a little tougher. I did have to cheat once though during the 8 hours it took to finish the game. It was a simple solution that was staring me in the face that I just didn't see. The game does have some good humor to it. There's a lot of times I'd chuckle when the character would comment on non-usable items in the environment. There's just about the right amount of game here. The last couple of levels were getting dull.  The game could have benefited from a manual save option. As it stands, the game is broken up into chapters and sometimes makes you complete a whole chapter before being able to save. Normally, this isn't too bad, but the last level there is a lot of trial and error and having to keep re-doing the same parts over and over until getting it right made the last level take way longer than it should have. Overall, though, Blackbay Asylum was a fun game and puzzle adventure fans and fans of the macabre should check it out.","November 4, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only to find out the doctors of the place are performing experiments on all patients, even rats!\nIt gets nasty at times, with humans stitched upon other humans...in multiple ways.\nYou see rats dissected after they evolve into massive rodents.\n\nHas great atmosphere, multiple dialogs if you keep 'inspecting' things, which nowadays adventure games don't really do anymore. It also has a lot of puzzles.\n\nNow the puzzles for the most part, are logical. But at some points I just got so confused I had to look up some door codes or set patterns because it became frustrating going back to read a certain clue and remember it by the time you needed it. Sometimes I had no clue at all what to do even when reading the clues, but it all does really make sense but might turn off people who don't like puzzles. Make no mistake, this is a puzzle game.\n\nGraphic wise, it reminds me of old PSX games. You play from a top down perspective, and a few levels use first person, which I could have done without.\n\nThe game runs on my toaster of a PC no problem.\nit works flawlessly with my Steam Controller.\n\nAdventure game fans would love this. So I say yeah, go for it, it is truly unique and nothing else is like it.\n\n","January 26","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seeing some of the early gameplay and the casual racism and sexism thrown around was not exactly winning me over, never mind the visuals. However, I found out I'd picked it up somewhere along the line, probably in a bundle, and figured I'd give it a shot. Blackbay Asylum, while problematic, actually delivers quite the gameplay experience.\n\nAs quite the physical specimen and not quite the mental specimen of an asylum patient, you're given a surprise opportunity to escape Blackbay and quickly learn a lot of strange things have been going on. Between terrible things happening to other inmates/patients and walls suddenly being covered with blood and/or weird fleshy masses, things ramp up quickly in Blackbay Asylum.\n\nPuzzle-solving and combat are fairly well balanced in the game, with the latter not coming up too often, but feeling just difficult enough when it does. The former, however, suffers from a lot of solution-integral items or spots to investigate proving much more difficult to spot visually than they really needed to be. I recommend falling back on the time-honored tradition of repeatedly investigating every little thing to make sure you don't miss such items, as frustration is easy to come by when you do. At least the puzzles are interesting despite their roughness, and the results of solving many of them is entertaining, to say the least.\n\nWhat really surprised me is how the plot, about halfway through, takes a shift for an even darker, clearly Lovecraftian vibe, though this is telegraphed early on by Blackbay's geographical location. The nods to and influence from tales of old gods is very clear, and woven in more and more expertly as the later stages carry on. It feels a lot like the game's writer worked from beginning to end rather than stringing together plot points, and got progressively better at writing as they went on. It's not perfect, by any means, but it definitely improves upon the usual first impressions.\n\nLong story short, if you can get over the offensive bits and the visuals, consider picking Blackbay Asylum up. Much like its Lovecraftian inspiration, it's clearly got problematic elements, but it's still worthwhile.","January 7","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

BA (Blackbay Asylum) is exactly what I needed at a recent time of personal horror/adventure-craving. It's not easy finding many horror games that are this scary while focusing on puzzles. Yes, BA is at its core an adventure/puzzle game. It's even comparable to Sherlock Holmes The Awakened in a few ways: puzzle-heavy game with Lovecraftian horror and Cthulhu story.\n\nPROS: Considering that most of the game is in top-down perspective, the creep factor is still huge as you wonder what you're going to come across at every corner. I say "most" because a few parts of this game are in first-person. Amazingly the game brilliantly combines the two gameplay styles together without difficulty. I have to admit that Chapter 3 (in its 1st person) was a level I won't forget anytime soon; this area frightened me so much I had to take minor breaks. While I don't need breathers while replaying (knowing now what to expect) I will say the level including some horrific/bizarre imagery and edge-of-your-seat sound. You'll find more quality and depth in this one mission than the entirety of most other horror games! I also love the protagonist's endless un-PC comments whenever he interacts with something he cannot pick up. If you aren't easily offended, you'll get more than a few laughs. There are some good challenging puzzles which ocassionally required a walkthrough, but otherwise make you feel good as you accomplish them.\n\nCONS: Given the chapter count, you would think during the first few levels that the game is lengthy. Unfortunately it's not. Surprisingly while some chapters are long, some are ridiculously short in comparison. If you know what to do, one of them can even be completed in less than 30 seconds! The second half of the game isn't as engaging either. From the 1st Chapter your character lawnmowers a mad cook, later followed by the horrifying 3rd. These left me wondering, could the game get any more compelling and strange? Maybe, but I wouldn't expect it to be less! As you delve close to the Cthulhu-mystery the game loses a lot of the shock and style that it opens up with. I liked the final boss "battle" but the final cutscene, though interesting, was brief and made little sense. It almost seemed very anti-climatic, and this doesn't look the kind of game that aches for a sequel.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game a lot and it's well worth a purchase. I do think there's a slight missed opportunity here though. As a Cthulhu-inspired story it had a lot of potential, and the game's first half makes you think it will realise it. Though it never ceases to be fun, I did feel a bit let down towards the end with the lack of horrifying build-up. Maybe I was expecting too much, but when the first few levels really displayed something special I would hope the game persisted from there. Still, if you're looking for some challenging puzzles filled with memorable and horrific moments then BA might be the right choice!\n\n77/100","May 9","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
