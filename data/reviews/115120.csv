(source)\n\nCo-op Iron Brigade is a lot of fun!\n\nGFWL is not dead. I had a working GFWL install from playing FUEL, and was up and running in 5 minutes. However, if you haven't, you probably need the updated client, which is here: http://www.xbox.com/Live/PC/DownloadClient You can probably download and install this before you download iron Brigade, or you can install Iron Brigeade, uninstall GFWL, and then install the newer version. Make an account, copy and Ctrl-V paste the serial, done. (GFWL often takes a minute ro more to connect, and sometimes needs more than one attempt.)\n\nYou need to play two missions in singleplayer; after that, you know the basics of the game and get access to the "radio room" where you can invite friends, search for games etc. "Friends" means GFWL friends and not Steam friends, of course, so you need to add each other on GFWL. You can do in-game text-chat with "T"; if you have configured speech in the GFWL settings, you'll also automatically have voice chat with everyone in your game (if your microphone isn't claimed by Steam). The co-op missions are the same as the singleplayer missions, so you advance in singleplayer as you play co-op.\n\nI like the co-op rules. You need to collect "scrap" (= drops from the enemies) to be able to build turrets; any scrap you collect (or that scrap collector turret collects) gets shared equally (as are the random chest drops), but any turrets you place go off your own budget. You can only build those turret types that you have equipped (they're called "emplacements" in the loadout screens), but you can upgrade any turrets on the battlefield regardless of type. Of course you can revive each other.\n\nTactics for us was to go into each new map with the same loadout as the previous one, slightly modified by the hints the game gives you. We were only defeated once, but then we do go back and refine our strategy for gold star performance. This means talking about weapon and turret loadaouts, turret placement strategy, fire sectors (very loose), and the like. We were already on the chassis that has a maximum of weapon slots and a minimum of turret slots, but careful planning was still necessary to get that coveted gold star: even at that extreme of the game balance spectrum, you can't just adopt "shoot everything that moves" as a viable tactic.\n\nGame balance is excellent: chassis types allow you to trade weaponry (fps) against turrets (tower defense) -- this affects both the turret types you can equip and their cost. Special skills are equipped via legs, and they're balanced as well: "quick reload" means you're stationary while that skill is engaged; "sprint" means you're fast, but can't turn while running, etc. You need to use your skill wisely, i.e. tactically.\n\nThe "stutter bug": 6 hours into the game, after 7 missions, the game started stuttering when scrap is being collected. That bug is not present in the Xbox version, and the FAQ says that since it seems related to GFWL, it is difficult/impossible to debug, and Microsoft is not being helpful. So that bug is there to stay. Since you can't shoot while collecting scrap, you tend to only do that when no enemies are around, which means the bug is an annoyance, not a showstopper at this point.\n\nI got Iron Brigade for free when I bought "Hack'n'Slash", possibly because I previously owned a lot of Double Fine games, including at least one bundle (Amnesia Fortnight). Getting it on sale seems definitely worthwhile even now, but if you have an Xbox, you're probably better off getting it there, because of the stutter bug.\n\nAs a game, Iron brigade is exceptionally well designed: it is easy to get into, has tactical depth, and allows for a wide variety of approaches to beating a level that are well balanced among each other, both in singleplayer and co-op.","December 15, 2014","true","14.4"," 81 of 89 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","81","89","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/recommended/115120/","blue_award","Blue Award","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/","803 products in account","A third person view mech shooter variation on tower defense genre, dipped in signature Double Fine humor sauce. If that sounds appealing to you, think no more, get it. It does its job very well!\n\nYou're a pilot of so-called mobile trench in a campaign against Monovision ravaging the world after mysterious Broadcast. The tongue-in-cheek campaign consists of missions tasking you with defense of a strategic point(s) from waves of enemies spawning at concrete locations on map and converging on their target. You fight partly yourself directly, dealing out punishment from guns mounted on your mechanized trench, and partly you summon turrets for help, paying for them with scrap gathered from fallen enemies.\n\nThere's a big selection of guns at your disposal - machine guns for relatively small but sustained damage, with flak variety focusing on airborne enemies, and a wide selection of burst damage weapons varying in range, area of effect, and reload times (shotguns, sniper rifles, grenade launchers, even artillery cannons). There's also a unique type of weapon - broadcasters, with huge, continuous damage, but very short range and long time to replenish (sort of like EMP version of flamethrower, I guess).\n\nAnd all these guns also come in a standalone, turret version, automatically tageting enemies in their range, except broadcaster type of turret is not for damage but rather a support one, slowing enemies down, and there's a type of turret that lays mines rather than shoots at enemies. Other support turrets include magnets that  automatically gather scrap for you or can repair your trench.\n\n(by the way, normally your mechanized trench CAN'T be blown up during a mission, you're just disabled for a short time and only lose when defended target is blown up, however stages of campaign end with boss fights where you yourself can be considered the target and then repair turret sure comes handy - or pretty much required)\n\nThere's a gotcha however - a harsh limit on what you can actually bring with you to a single mission, and mixing and matching a loadout before launch is big part of your success. Generally you can either go with a chassis that can dish out huge damage itself with lots of gun mounts, but very poor selection of turrets to summon, or a chassis that can deploy powerful turrets but has very limited space for guns on itself (there's also a middle ground, having an average number of gun mounts and limited only to light offensive turrets). These also differ in speed and armor values, and come with a choice of legs that give you some special move, for example let you sprint very fast in straight line, or give option for faster reload times if you root yourself in place. There's also a smashing variety of legs that complements your damage potential.\n\nThe selection of guns is ever expanding in their power and sometimes additional effects (like more scrap, or magnetic effect on grenades - very useful perk), you have this feeling of constant progress in power as you level up your pilot, very well realized indeed (but of course mission difficulty also ramps up to match it).\n\nWith rumors on GFWL closing down soon-ish and Double Fine not planning to port this game over to a different platform, it may be highest time to get this one, too, before it becomes unplayable (though it's not clear if it won't work at all or just the co-op version? btw yes there's co-op)","July 3, 2014","true","19.5"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/demgritz/recommended/115120/","demgritz","Nice Pete","http://steamcommunity.com/id/demgritz/","785 products in account","This game was "re-launched" a month ago, removing a performance-killing bug along with the terrible Games for Windows Live nonsense. Great news right?\n\nUnfortunately, a new bug was introduced that causes the game to crash if more than 2 players start a game. Since the whole point of this game is multi-player, this is a critical gamebreaking bug. It has persisted for over a month now, and the devs have honestly said that they are more interested in the supporting the recently kickstarted Massive Chalice than supporting this game.\n\nIt's shameful, and another example of DoubleFine giving their customers the shaft. Get it together.\n\nUpdate 12/3/15:\nRevisited the game tonight with 3 other friends based comments from DoubleFine that "Multiplayer is Fixed!". No, multiplayer is not at all fixed.\n\nThe synchronization error crash seems to be fixed (edit 1/16 - it's not, according to posts in the forums), but the game is just as choppy as it ever was two years ago. My group got through ONE multiplayer map, then the second map stuck on an endless loading screen.\n\nMy review stands. Do not buy this buggy pile of garbage.

I quickly snatched it on discount for under $4 during the 2015 mid year sale. Definitely worth more than that!\n\nIt's a wonderful coop experience. I'll never forget all the times the game crashed with authentication state error on each start-up when organising a game with sauce and trash. We'd all go crazy, revalidating Steam cache files, restarting Steam, restarting the PC. In some cases the game would crash sauce's PC. trash and I would be like, "sauce you still there?" as we watch his Mumble name disappear off the screen a few seconds later in dismay.\n\nSometimes we'd hit over wave 30 and for some reason sauce decided that it would be a good idea to unplug his Ethernet cable from the back of his PC. Who'd knew the game would be smart enough to detect that and show a message!? Meanwhile trash came up with this brilliant theory ... we must all press the ready button within 2 seconds of a mission launch in order to stop these connection problems. I guess ... sometimes it worked ...?\n\nEssentially this game is a 3rd person mechwarrior (trench) tower defence genre. There is a levelling up system with item drops to enhance your trench as you progress through the campaign and survival modes. You can customise the chassis to standard, assault or engineer. The chassis differs mainly by how much emplacement (towers) slots you can take, the amount of weapons you can arm yourself with, the costs to build the emplacements and speed at which you move. All in all we figured out that for a team of 3 players, it's good to have 1 engineer and 2 assault.\n\nThere is some really classy Charlie Chaplin style humour with the characters. Dynamic lighting and weather. And a very generous amount of survival maps ... three in total. Thanks devs. Each map was fun whilst it lasted, but with all those tubes collected with the collection prongs, sad everything had to end at wave 100.\n\nHad great fun figuring out the strategies cooperatively. There is some history to be dug up in the very tiny community. You'll find tips and tricks like knob traps, tactics and the best loadout for your trench. I would rate this game something like an 8.3 out of 10. All dem crashes was worth the pain.","November 15, 2015","true","64.2"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","70","21","30","9","1"

I will agree, the game need to be rid of Window Live and just work off of steam but the dev "Double Fine" has much bigger things to work on.

It spans many of my favorite genres, has plenty of content, co-op! I will just list things :)\n\nWhy this compelled me\n* Tower-defense, more so when playing single\n* Shooter, more so when playing multiplayer\n* Mech-game with customization; weapons, chassi, legs, towers, paintjob\n* Character progression, challenges, achievements, all doable without much grind outside of completing the game.\n* Customizable player character, only cosmetic, but fun when running around in the lobby before starting a multiplayer game.\n\nWhat impressed me\n* The multiplayer lobby is the same as single player, other people just loads up in the empty slots on your ship. It's great design really, and you can look at other people's mechs and gesture at their characters :)\n* Anyone you have invited to a multiplayer game ends up in your regiment, which has separate challenges to complete, it just happens automatically and it's kind of great :o\n* All customization on your mech and character are visible immediately in game, has custom animations and models, so nice :3\n\nWhat I found interesting\n* Many of your towers can actually be killed, and they are not at all used to build labyrinths, you cannot block enemies with towers. It's just different :)\n* The whole game design seems built around quirky humor, at first it's quite odd but after a while I just ran with it. Game mechanics sold me on the experience.\n\nWhat I missed/issues\n* An overhead map, on some symmetrical levels it can be really tricky to know where you've placed towers, makes for quite a bit of running around. It does make sense though as the player characters probably do not have any radar och satellite to provide map data.\n* In the shop I would love to see if I actually own an item already, especially the cosmetics for the marine, it's a minor gripe but it felt like an obvious feature.\n* Playing during a summer sale makes Steam a bit glitchy, several times one or several were disconnected from Steam during multiplayer which boots them from the game. Sadly you cannot rejoin, this was kind of annoying in Survival which can take 1-2 hours depending on your success. There were no issues while the USA was asleep though.\n* Some maps have places where you can get stuck, and you cannot jump or even walk over very low  walls, this is pretty annoying when it happens. But then I always try to get to places I'm not supposed to go :x\n* I took me a while to realize why this felt exactly like playing on a console, I think the game is locked to 30 fps, which is kind of a bummer when using a 120Hz monitor.\n\nAll in all I was very impressed by this game, I was looking for another tower defense game, saw this in a short clip on YouTube, and kept an eye out during a summer sale. Played it for an entire weekend with my brothers and a friend, great times was had :P","June 22, 2015","true","27.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Awesome 'pulp alternate history post-WWI' design and overall art style, crammed with attitude and goofiness.\nUp to 4 player online co-op.  If you got the friends for it and can get it working, probably THE best crafted and most fun to play co-op tower defense you can find.\nFor a long time after Steam release and after GFWL requirements were patched out of the game, the developers were very active in the community gathering feedback and letting the players know they were working on fixes for technical issues.  I LOVE seeing this, and wish more developers were as involved as these guys.\nFull controller support\nSteam version includes a nice DLC 'expansion' in which you travel to Mars, free of charge!\nCons:Game is locked to 30 frames per second.  Impossible to unrestrict.\nWhile playable in single player, IB is clearly not designed for it and most of the time is spent sprinting between lanes before defense points are destroyed\nOnline connectivity is a MESS.  This is a huge drawback as this is what the game is designed for, yet starting a game with 3 or 4 players is in my own experience 100% impossible without disconnects.  Some say they've had some success with it, but me and my friends were far from alone in not getting this game to work, AT ALL.  Playing with 2 players is slightly less disconnect prone but even then I see occational disconnects during levels.\nDespite working on the above point and many others for a long time, DF were never able to fully fix a number of technical problems with IB, most important being the co-op disconnect issue.\nDF then posted a check list of improvements they had made to the game and declared everything fixed, and that they were done.  An obvious lie right in our faces, and IB sits in the Steam store to this day pretending everything is great.  Such a disappointment seeing this after they had done such a good job being on the level with the community about the ongoing attempts to fix their game.\nIn summary this game has a lot of things going for it and is possibly the best co-op TD action you can get, IF you can get that to work.  The online connectivity problems this game has and Double Fine's dishonesty claiming this was resolved is why this game lands on a thumbs down, from me.","March 29","false","28.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I played this when it came out on Xbox.\n\nWhat is the gameplay?\n\nWell, you are in a mobile 'Trench' that can hold weapons on it. There are different "Chassis" which give you a certain amount of weapon slots on each side. A "big" chassis gives you 3 weapon slots on each side. A medium would give 2. A small would give you 1. Certain weapons take certain amount of slots. A machine takes 1 while a artillery will take all 3 on the one side. Snipers take 2 slots. Also, the weapons get stronger as you progress in the game, some getting "special" abilities. For example, an artillery that has shock, which stuns the monovision. Second thing is there are turret slots. Like machine gun turrets, Sniper turrets, land mines etc. they each take a slot and depends on what type of slot. There is a support, light, and heavy slot. Snipers and land mines are heavy, machine guns and shotgun turrets are light, a support would be a repair crane, Dampening Genarator, or a Magnet prong.\n\n\nWhat am i fighting?\n\nThey are called monovisions. Essentially, its kind of like an alien life form, but look allot like electricity and blue wires. There are unique monos that target certain things, or attack in certain ways.\n\nAll in all, i bought this game out of Nostalgia (i think thats how you spell it) and dont regret it at all. the game has replayability for the achievements, loot to find, and even has survival mode. *Kinda like Zombies on Call of booty* how long can you last. You even get loot from the survival mode. There are 3 survival maps from what i know. I got to 56 on one, 76 on another, and my favorite map, i got to 100.\n\nTruly, if you are into strategy, and want to use defences and even your own trench to protect a building, drill, or gun. Then you arent far from finding an amazing game. Look up some youtube videos and watch. Good luck on finding the game you want.","March 2","true","34.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There's interesting and varied loot, plenty of customisation for your mech and a variety of enemies and battle scenarios.\n\nUnfortunately, there is one significant misstep. This is a game built around a degree of repetition if not grinding for loot, XP and better results which by itself is fine. However, it contains unskippable dialogue and cutscenes. Something which was amusing the first time around is less so the second and third, and downright grating after that.\n\nThankfully you can get through at least the main campaign without grinding much. It might be a bit more of an issue if you want to finish the DLC or Survival mode, but you should well and truly get your money's worth before that.","March 5","true","11.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Customize your mech (known as trench) and go out into the field to defend the objective. Iron Brigade combines the 3rd person shooter combat with the classic tower defence gameplay of strategically placing turrets of various kinds to help you make a stand.\n\nThere is a large variety of enemies, which are introduced bit by bit throughout the campaign, ranging from fast fliers to slow yet durable Big Willies, to suicidal Blitzers, and hordes of spiky balls known as the Knobs. Each enemy has its own strengths and weaknesses and therefore you are required to outfit your trench with optimum weaponry for each mission in order to be effective. Most of the enemy designs were pretty creative and had a sort of personality.\n\nI've played throughout the whole game solo. The early missions are fairly easy, but latter ones do pose a substantial challenge and might require several tries to get your strategy up to perfection. It's fun if you like a challenge. The game also has a handful of boss fights, so to speak. They do feel kind of different and out of touch with the rest of the gameplay though, especially the final boss of the original campaign.\n\nThere were some small annoyances, like there being too little time in between the waves and cutscenes/dialogue not being skippable (not that I've found anyway), but other than this, it was fine.\n\nI didn't realise there was also an expansion act to the game, called 'Rise of the Martian Bear'. After playing the first mission, I'm a bit disappointed with it. It seems co-op play is encouraged much more here than solo play (so I might have to try them out on co-op), not to mention a strange lag that wasn't present in any of the previous missions. You also get some survival missions where you fight an endless horde of enemies.\n\nOverall it's a fun game. It has a nice sense of humour to it with a hint of silliness, but it certainly works and can often give you a good chuckle. So if you like tower defence games, you should find Iron Brigade worth playing.","September 9, 2015","true","10.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You control a walking WWII mecha with a variety of WWII and retro-like futuristic fantasy (WWII imagination) weaponry assortments ranging from machine guns, to sniper rifles, to futuristic "radar" like microwave guns and more. Towers to an extent are important, but this game focuses more on what YOU must do as the player/mecha, which you control. The main damage you do, is from the mecha and the assortments of weapons that you attach on it. As turrets are generally ♥♥♥♥ poor at dealing damage, and if you choose to ONLY use turrets, it can only carry you through the first level. As with later levels, it becomes more and more challenging, making you, the mecha/player and your strategy and weaponry, your involvement first hand more important.\n\nPros:\n- Mecha WWII machines of war\n\n- A lot of customization options\n\n- Really fun grinding for rare items and customizable clothes, weapons and paint jobs\n\n- Stupidly easy to play\n\n- Learning curve is on the softer side\n\n- Beefs up and becomes harder appropriately near the end\n\n- Co-op\n\n- Replay value is good\n\n- Amazing graphics, the main advertisement screenshots do not do it justice\n\n- Got the hang of the game in about 4 missions (learned how to play that is)\n\nCons:\n- Tutorial for me at least, threw me off a little\n\n- Wish they had more missions\n\n- About 4 different campaigns, with 4 to 6 missions in each\n\n- Co-op can get a little laggy at times\n\n- Replay value is cut short after you acquire all rare items and complete all missions and survival missions on gold\n\n- Wish they had even “more” weapons\n\nConclusion:\nI am simply aghast, amazed that this game isn't more popular. The graphics are great, the missions are fun, replay value is huge (especially co-op) and the price is cheap and out of this world. The ONLY reason this game doesn't have a lot more popularity and was put into the gutter and I did some research into this. Is, as I saw some other reviewers comment about this, and I did not understand what they were talking about. So bear with me quickly. Is because, the game was licensed to only be played/playable on and through the Microsoft Gaming Platform Program, the equivalent of Steam. Apparently playing the game through the Microsoft Gaming Platform really made the game laggy, crashed, and near impossible to play when it was streamed through the Microsoft Game Platform Software. The game owners then switched their accessibility to Steam and everything is all o'kay now.\n\nP.S.: (If you didn't understand, let me make this clear, yes, you can play this on Microsoft computers just fine, it is referring to Microsoft's attempt at making and implementing an online gaming platform equivalent to Steam and they failed horribly at it, which the above mentioned is about.) (The game runs fine.)\n\nAll in all, I am surprised I didn't find out about this MUCH game sooner, give it a chance, and I can promise you, you will be throughly impressed and satisfied. (Mobile Trench Brigade over and out!)\n\nI would definitely recommend and encourage this game to friend.\n","June 7, 2015","true","34.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the concept is quite fun, the number of bugs that exist due to Games for Windows Live makes the experience unenjoyable.  This is not a condemnation of GfWL, but rather entirely due to a bug caused by its implementation.   In short, a memory leak is introduced that, after a couple minutes, causes the system to begin delaying frames.   As levels drag on, this eventually renders the game unplayable.\n\nWhile this bug can be remedied in the campaign missions by quitting the game and restarting it after every mission, this option is not possible when playing the survival modes (which I would consider to be the most challenging aspect of the game.)\n\nIf Double Fine is ever able to remove the GfWL loader, then I will whole-hearedly recommend this product.  But until that time, any enjoyment of the game is ruined by the experience.","May 28, 2014","true","18.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","3"

On some maps you also need to attack the aliens and kill a boss.\n\nBetween the missions you are on the ship modifying your trench (the thing you are walking around with), adding friends to your game/joining other games and choosing your next mission.\n\nModifying your trench:\nThere is a level system which grants you to use specific items. There are a lot of items like many different types of legs, chassis, weapons and towers. All of them are also available with different abilities. Of course you can also change the color and the look of your trench and your marine.\n\nAdding friends/joining other games:\nThe multiplayer system works good. You can add your friends on steam and join random games. You might join games with people on a much higher level so with much more difficult missions. And from time to time (maybe once per hour) the game looses the connection to the lobby. The maximum number of players in a lobby is 4.\nWhen you are in the lobby you can see the other players and their trenches on the ship and together you can discuss the next mission or whatever.\n\nChoosing your mission:\nThere are different areas with different maps you can choose from. Furthermore there are some survival maps where you fight as long as you can. But all in all I would like to have more maps in the game.\n\nEnemys:\nLike there are many different enemys (fast and small, flying, heavy) there are also items effective against the different enemys. So you always need to check the equipment you and your teammates are using for the missions.\n\nI bought the game when it was on christmas sale and I do not regret it at all. ;)","January 9","true","25.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The personality in the game had me chuckling as my mates and I, kitted out in our multi coloured walking 'trenches', blast away wave after wave of downright impressive looking enemies. Diverse story maps, a hoard of loot and a garage load of customisation made this game a sure win.\n\nGameplay is entertaining and flexible, three types of trench giving you the choice between 'I'll kill it!' and 'Build ALL the turrets', and somewhere in between. Tactical placement decisions and rationing upgrade costs keeps your gears turning, and unique weapons and alternatives to standard turrets keep evolving your playstyle, which all comes together in the adequately challenging survival modes.\n\nThe negatives are few, but are as follows. I personally found the final map to be a bit underwhelming, the end of the game putting a single sour note on an otherwise awesome storyline. Wrestling with Games for Window's Live also made getting set up a bit of an issue, but that really can't be helped by Double Fine, so I won't hold it against them. Lastly, the game stutters nastily if your computer isn't up to scratch at handling the numerous turrets placed on an extended map, but that's likely just my old laptop struggling.\n\nOverall, this is a game I'm very glad I bought, and will likely put more hours into it in the future. I didn't expect any less, and I wasn't even slightly disappointed. A definate must buy for all fans of the defense strategy franchise.","March 11, 2014","true","44.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Tower defense + Mech offense = Helluvalotafun.  Unfortunately, as mentioned in other reviews, this game has some serious problems on PC.  Serious lag/stuttering in the later levels make the game barely playable.  I got up to level 13, where I really needed some help, but I heard things even get worse in multiplayer, so I didn't bother finishing the game.  Double Fine blames Microsoft (publisher) and Games for Windows Live, but really the game shouldn't have been released in this state. If you get a chance to play this on XBox 360, it is well worth your time.  It is fun on PC as well, just realize you may not want to play the last few levels.","May 22, 2014","true","22.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While it is a solid tower defense game, the enemies and maps just lack any personality and originality. I know Double Fine isn't the biggest company there is, and that there were several teams working on three different games basically all at the same time, but Iron Brigade lacks the charm  (not the humor) of Stacked and Costume Quest.\nFor a TD game Iron Brigade definitely has a lot of customization. Pretty much anything can be customized. Your trench, marine, turrets and weapons.\nKilled enemies will sometimes also drop loot boxes that give you random new gear.\nThe game certainly doesn't disappoint in that department.\nAnd unlike other TD games, the game will (properly) increase in difficulty as you progress.\nThere was a bit of a performance issue later on in the game, where it would freeze for a second while collecting scrap. Nothing major, but worth noting anyway.\nNow if only the maps and enemies were more diverse...\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","August 25, 2012","true","6.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I honestly thought it would suck but its a really fun game. I played many hours on my 360 till my 32" TV fired a month or so ago, and I have not played since. I ordered a new 24" Monitor with HDMI so once that gets in I am more then likely going to play it again on 360 also. I have it now on Steam which I bought two copies of one for myself, and the other for a friend on 360. Getting connected to each other to play seams like a real chore being he is in Netherlands, and I am in the USA. I don't know if there is an issues with the two locations or what but we didn't have this issue with the game on 360. I did manage to get into a game with 2 Japanese players which was cool until I got kicked from the game as it dropped when the game started. I also played with two other players after that so who knows. There are not a lot of people playing this game on computer so if you want to buy it keep in mind you may be playing alone or have huge wait times to find other players.\n\nIs it a good game: Yes\nIs it worth the money: Yes\nWould you recommend this game: Yes (If you don't mind playing solo)","January 2, 2014","true","14.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While early parts of the campaign can be done solo they are best done with friends. The graphics are nice and the plot while predictable is enjoyable and fun. You won't find incredible depth to the story but the game allows yo uto customize your Trench (the griant robot machines of carnage) to your playstyle with loot you earn or buyable shop items.\n\nTHE BAD! The worse thing has to be the co-op right now, the match making system can take a new player that is literally on the 1rst campaign mission and toss them with players that are at the end game, the new player ends up being like a flat tire on the team as they don't have the firepower to be useful on later missions.

It is very common to experience dropped sessions in multiplayer, and doing so often causes you to be booted out of the mission entirely. Additionally there is an extremely annoying sound glitch on the free-DLC missions (which represent about 25% of the total game length), which evidently also has to do with GFWL but occurs in whichever mode you play.\n\nWhen GFWL is phased out soon, it is uncertain if Iron Brigade will ever be patched to continue supporting multiplayer at all-- Microsoft is the publisher for Iron Brigade and DoubleFine can't fix this unless Microsoft tells them to, reportedly. Even so, as things stand now the lobby system drops your friends constantly and there's no way around it, so multiplayer as it stands right now requires a lot of patience and luck.\n\nOriginal Review: It's very good. I've stayed up late two nights playing it already (16 hrs total, haven't finished it yet, though I've been replaying missions a lot to get gold medals). It's skewed heavily towards action but it's still a tower defense game, which I usually avoid but big stompy mechs make it all good. It does have GFWL, which is still clunky and terrible, but after getting to grips with it and setting it to auto-login it's stayed out of my way entirely.. could suck if you lose internet for prolonged periods while playing though, since a GFWL connection is used to save your progress. However, I've still really been loving this game and couldn't recommend it heartily enough.","August 15, 2012","true","42.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm really sorry to not be recommending one of your games. :(\n\nUpdate: So, now that GFWL has been removed, I figured I would try playing the game. Loading seems fine, but matchmaking seems to be worse. I'm going to give it a tentative thumbs down simply because it is playable by myself, but I was unable to stay loaded in the game with another player (and it was not from connectivity issues, because we were talking on Skype at the same time).\n\nHere's to hoping for another patch!","December 31, 2014","false","10.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

But mostly because the game uses the Games for Windows Live system, which is absolutely horrible.\n\nBut on to the game. It's almost awesome. The first hour is tedious, but after that it gets progressively more fun. You want to go back and get perfect scores on maps to get extra experience points and bonuses, but that seems to me to max out a bit too soon.\nThe idea and the awesome mechs and fun characters would do well within a bigger game.\nIf it's on cheap, you like mechs, tower-defense games and/or FPS shooters, then it's definently reccomended.","August 27, 2012","true","8.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You pilot a Mobile Trench Unit (basically a pair of robo-legs with guns) and fend off incoming beasts built out of TV's and electronics, with the aid of some deployable towers and possibly a friend or two. You gradually unlock bigger and better guns and turrets, and it's great fun to just slap an artillery cannon on your trench and blow ♥♥♥♥ away. It's a decent game in solo, and a much better experience with other people who can run loadouts that complement yours.\n\nWhich brings us to the issue of multiplayer. Sadly, despite GFWL finally having been stripped from this beast years after the fact, the netcode is still tempermental at best and outright shoddy at worst. You can usually get a 2-player game going without much issue, but attempting a 3 or 4 player session has ended in crashes, hangs, and disconnects within minutes for me every single time I try.\n\n2 players insofar works just fine and dandy though.","June 13, 2015","true","15.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

So you have to choose between having a good mech, and only one type of tower, or 3-4 towers and a mech that can't put a dent in the weakest  enemys in the game.\n\nThis type of choice must have made more sense assuming people would be constantly multi-playering, like certain people could be the heavy hitters, but backed up by lightweights with good towers.  I could see it working.   But the multiplayer community is a ghosttown.  I littereally NEVER found anyone else to go in game with me.\n\nI'm giving this game a VERY RELUCTANT thumbs down.

Unfortunately, my computer is barely capable of running it with quite a bit of lag, and it's very fast-paced, so I can't really give this game the full trying-out it deserves.\n\nHowever, from what I was capable of playing, the interface was absolute ♥♥♥♥, and the controls were a little clunky (a bit of that was from the lag, though, but not that much) both of which seem like they stem from the game being designed for console controlers rather then keyboard and mouse. The actual gameplay, however, was quite fun, though it seems like it takes some getting used to. In particular, the game is very fast paced for a tower defense (the first wave, from the two levels I played not counting the tutorial, seems to always spawn immediately or nearly immediately upon starting the level, and there was very little time to gain your bearings between waves. I don't know how much of this was lag, however) added a nice, hectic pacing that really drew me in, though was not very conducive to strategic planning. It would probably be easier with multiple people, with at least one shooting and one planting turrets, and it did kinda seem like the game was really pushing me towards playing with multiple people, which can be a good or bad thing depending on how many friends you have. A minimap also wouldn't have been misplaced in this game, and seems like an odd omission that I found myself instinctively looking for.\n\nOverall, it's a fun second-person shoot-em-up game with some tower defense aspects thrown in. I would say it's worth the $15 if you like those kinda games. Especially if it's on sale, or if you have friends to play with.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and I forgot to mention; Unskippable cut-scenes warning.

SO much potential lost of this fundamental problem!\n\nDespite the confident Dev claims from a couple of months ago, playing in multi-player mode, one or more players WILL lose their connection at random. Thus, you get a long way into a Mars mission, only to have one or more players disconnected, and then everybody else quickly dies while the unlucky one(s) try to rejoin: Failed mission.\n\nAfter several retries like that, it gets frustrating that the maps are designed for multi-player, certain achievements are based upon multi-player, but the game engine CLEARLY does not yet solidly and reliably support multi-player. So, until it is truly fixed, my friends and I are tired of the frustration and wasted time of trying to beat hard missions and having key players dropped at crucial moments.\n\nPeople contemplating buying the game should understand that multi-player is NOT fixed nor reliable yet, so there is a core frustration to the game (particularly on the harder settings) that make it more luck (will everybody's connections hold?) than skill whether you'll be able to complete particularly the Mars maps.","January 25","false","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After a while it can get repetitive and very very boring\n\nAnd that is what made me stop playing Iron Brigade, the constant tower defence and wave based gameplay gets very boring after a while\n\nIron Brigade is a mixed bag to me, it is getting a recommend it because it is a fun little indie game to play but it can get boring after a while. Iron Brigade is only recommended if you like tower defence/wave based game or you are a fan of Double Fine Production and their games\n\nPlus, the game is locked at 30FPS, why? Have no idea why...\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","May 31","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each Trench has it's own setup for towers and each tower is color coded to fit into only certain slots, up to a max of four towers depending on your trench. Got a good selection of towers from disorienting slow fields, to mortars and snipers! Your main source of damage *early* in the game is, for the most part, inflicted by you. Not your towers. Don't get me wrong, those towers become godlike late in the game.. If you have a good selection, and even better placement.  It's a great way to kick you into the world of Tube stomping. I would give this a solid 8/10 based only on gameplay. It's definitely worth the buy if your into defense type games. Hell even robots.","June 2","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
