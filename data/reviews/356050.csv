It made me wonder what it’s like to be someone else.  It made me contemplate what I take for granted.  It made me admire an ordinary person’s courage.  It was a new experience, but rather than just a novelty, it felt like an experience worth having.\n\nThe game uses visuals to try and give you an idea of what it’s like to have no vision.  Things only reveal themselves when they make noise, and I was stunned more than once when I finally reached a sound only to discover it was something I couldn’t have expected.  I’ve never played a game that made me doubt my senses the way this one has.\n\nThe people who voted this game down are right, Rae moves very slowly.  Infuriatingly slowly.  Anyone who hurries to reach the end will only be aggravated.  But that’s the point: she’s blind.  She CAN’T hurry.  Running around without being able to tell where you’re going wouldn’t make any sense, especially for a timid little girl.\n\nIf I had to criticize, I would say that the story about the cat could have been fleshed out a little more before the hunt began.  I realize that it’s not really the point, but it would have been nice if there was a bit about Nani helping Rae reengage with the world after her accident or something.\n\nAll you do is walk around.  There are no challenges, no failure states.  The entire game is just slowly traversing an extremely simple maze, where you can only see a few feet in front of you.  As a videogame, that’s terrible.\n\nI knew I loved it when I realized that all the vibrant colors, all the lush plants and chirping birds and flowing creeks, weren’t real.  My character didn’t, COULDN’T, know what any of those things looked like.  That’s why the color drains from the world when she gets scared.\n\nThis is a story about a little girl, whose whole world is completely blank, and she chooses to fill it with color.\n\nAnd I think that’s beautiful.","August 14, 2015","true","4.3"," 357 of 372 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","357","372","4","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/piggybank12/recommended/356050/","piggybank12","Piggybank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/piggybank12/","268 products in account","Beyond Eyes is a very beautiful looking game (ironically enough, considering who you play as), with some stunning presentation, fitting music and an interesting story.  Despite all of that though, I've found it to have some flaws when it comes to the design of the game itself that really dragged it down for me.  Let's get into the good stuff first though, because there really is some great things to love here!\n\nThe concept and foundation of the game, where you play as a blind girl named Rae searching for a cat, lends itself well to some good storytelling, showing the journey and emotions of Rae with strong composition and animation that does the job.  The main hook of the game, where your world develops before you as you explore more of it, also tends to work very well, with some of the transitions actually looking very cool and beautiful.  The music and sound design is also great, and even gets some creative use through helping you find objects in Rae's world.  Anyone who's interested in more experimental video games will probably find quite a bit to love here.  There's a rather sizeable bit of other stuff to find too, for those who look for it.\n\nMy biggest qualm with the game, however, is how movement works.  Rae moves and turns very slowly.  For a game focused on using exploration to continue the story, I found it very odd that I had to spend a couple minutes doing nothing but traversing a small patch of land, only to find I had hit a wall or missed my mark and had to turn around.  Combined with how easy it can be to miss a hint the game is giving you (the hints are creative and subtle, but can also be a little too subtle), it quickly made me give up on learning about the environment and instead opt for getting to wherever the next point in the story was, since it would easily take ten to twenty minutes just to get that far.  It also didn't help much in moments where you had to fetch objects for other characters, with the other character telling you to go toward a direction multiple times before you've even left their vicinity.  In a game where I feel like I should be relaxed and enjoying what the game has to offer, I couldn't help but wonder why I felt very frustrated instead.\n\nBy the end, it ended up feeling less like an engaging, fulfilling adventure and more like, believe it or not, wandering around blind.  I found myself even in the introduction level wishing Rae would speed up in areas I had already discovered (making backtracking a lot easier), or that I had any sort of run button (although in this case, running would be out of character for Rae).  The novelty of discovering landscapes and more of the world quickly wore off once I realized most of my time was going to be spent not enjoying it, but walking over to it.\n\n(Sherida has recently clarified that she's looking into speeding up Rae's walk in an update, so I would keep an eye out for that. It might be worth holding off on buying the game until that update is released too, but that's up to you.)\n\nSomething else that bugged me (which I don't recall being in the demo given out to backers a while ago, although I could be wrong) was the short draw distance covered by fog.  Even if you had already discovered an area, it would get lost by the game not rendering everything in the level that you found.  This isn't a big deal for smaller levels, since you can easily see what you've discovered no matter where you go, but in larger levels it was an annoyance for me and made it even easier to lose your bearings.  I looked in the options menu to try and find some sort of setting that would turn off the fog or push the draw distance further away, but no dice.\n\nThis next point is mostly a personal nitpick of mine, but the ending and the story's overall focus about finding the cat felt underwhelming and unfinished to me.  I think that stemmed from my experience playing the backer demo, and believing the game would be less about Rae having one goal throughout the entire game, but more about just observing the world beyond her garden and creating adventures from what transpired.\n\nIn the end, I don't regret playing this game, nor helping to fund it years ago on Indiegogo.  Regardless of the frustrations I had playing it, I feel like I still got exactly what I helped to fund: a game where you played as a blind girl who's wandered out of her element to embark on an adventure into the unknown.  However, the more I think about it, the more I find it very hard to give any good recommendations for playing it to anyone who didn't back it.  It's a beautiful concept bogged down by some bizarre game design decisions, and that's honestly a real shame.\n\nIt was an absolute pleasure getting to help bring Sherida's project to life in an indirect way and see her come so far as a game developer, and I look forward to seeing any other projects she's working on.  Since I'm a sucker for these experimental games, I still find enough things to love about this game that make me want to keep my copy anyway.  However, if you're on the fence about it, I'd say to wait until it's on a good sale and pick it up then, or if you're not a big fan of these experimental games to begin with, just stay clear entirely.","August 11, 2015","false","2.5"," 179 of 261 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","179","261","5","8"

Rae also made a friend a ginger cat called Nani.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498383930\n\nIn this story Rae's cat wonders of and is no where to be seen, so Rae decides to wonder of in search of her best friend. All Rae can see is white and as she progresses, the enviroment she is in starts to open up, we then see the beautifully painted enviroments painted in pastel water colours.

You play as Rae, a blind girl who is searching for her kitty.  As you wander around, the environment changes from the white unknown to beautiful watercolor.  You can only sense what's in your immediate vicinity, leaving much to be discovered.\n\nWalking isn't the only way to "unlock" the environment.  Sounds jump out to you and evoke color as well.  For example, when the cat meows, a brief image of the kitty will flash onto the screen, giving Rae a sense of direction and clues on where to go.  Rae uses both touch and sound to find her way.\n\nBut sometimes things aren't as they seem.  Sounds can be misleading.  What sounds like one thing turns into something different when Rae gets close enough to interact with it.  What Rae thought was clothes drying on a clothesline turned out to be a scarecrow.  The world, though beautiful, is uncertain and changing.\n\nI've played about 17 minutes of it so far and have only unlocked 1/10 achievements.  Based on that, it seems like this game won't be over relatively quickly.  Gameplay will probably be a couple hours.\n\nThis game can appeal to a wide audience.  If you're a cat lover, you'll like this game.  If you like casual exploration, this is the game for you.  If you enjoy peaceful sounds from nature and soft, beautiful graphics, you'll appreciate Beyond Eyes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn2S83SdvJk","August 11, 2015","true","0.3"," 77 of 110 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","77","110","0","4"

The most successful part of the game is how it conveys her blindness. Often she’ll hear something ahead, and from her limited experience she’ll think it’s one thing, but when she gets close it turns out to be something else. At one point what she thinks is a fountain turns out to be a drain pipe, or what she thinks is scary birds turns out to be cuddly hens. At the start her frames of reference come from the environment she grew up in. But over the course of the game you see her learn what the world is really like through experience.\n\nThe animations are superb, as the girl gropes and feels her way through the world, and the art direction is wonderful. Other parts of the game like the voices and music are merely good. They do the job, but are a bit blunt. It’s the same with the sound design. I don’t think a blind person will be able to play this, as many of the queues a blind person uses to navigate the world aren’t here. This is generally a problem with games, as sound designers only tend to aim for movie realism, and never true realism. If you have sight you might not think about it, but you can hear how big a room is, and you can learn to hear where objects are by subtle wind sounds or echo location. I’m ok with Beyond Eyes lacking these things, because no games has those, not even blind games.\n\nThe girl walks slow, which gives the game a slow pace. This felt appropriate, as the environments are quite detailed, and it’d be easy to miss things if it was faster. The story follows a reasonably good dramatic curve, with a few scares, and moments of joy and wonder. How it wrapped up made the journey feel worth it. A strong payoff will always give the whole experience a rosy tint, and that's definitely the case here. It’s not a long game, but because of the deliberate simplicity of the story it’s the right length. I couldn’t ask for more.","August 15, 2015","true","1.5"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","32","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/356050/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","When I caught wind of Sherida Halatoe’s debut commercial release, Beyond Eyes, I was immediately hooked. I was attracted to the idea of exploring a world from the unique perspective of a young, blind girl—one who also did not possess special abilities like Daredevil or Zatoichi. Furthermore, the game appeared to possess a profound visual aesthetic that effectively communicated this experience in a markedly beautiful way. And my two experiences seeing the game in development left me still thirsty for more. However, once I finally sat down and played the game, which lasts less than two hours, I realized that I did not possess the same unbridled excitement I held once before.\n\nYour brief interlude begins with a short story sequence featuring our protagonist, Rae. During a celebration, sparks fly from a fireworks blast into her eyes, leaving her blind. Depressed about her disability, Rae becomes reclusive, spending much of her time alone in her garden while children play without her. During this time, she meets a stray cat, whom she names Nani, and for a brief while, she is happy. But when the cat disappears for longer than usual, Rae ventures out on her own to find out what happened.\n\nAs Rae explores the world around her, it slowly takes form around her, with pathways, fences, flora, and objects elegantly appearing into view. The effect is something like Okami’s blooming effect tearing across the white landscape of The Unfinished Swan. Unlike either, Rae’s world grows just as she walks around. I make the distinction that this environment belongs to her because as far as we know, it could be entirely different. Given that she used to see, she forms her own image of the world around her based on sounds, touch, and even smell, but these are based on her own memories. In some areas, her memories fool her, such as when a distant fountain turns out to be a leaking drainpipe up close.\n\nBesides walking around, Rae has very minimal interaction with the environment. Objects she can touch or hold are denoted by green wisps encircling them, such as fences she can hop over or a piece of bread she can break off a loaf. Although she is given a rather large amount of open space, each area’s sprawl is restrained by fences, bushes, and trees to keep players from losing themselves. Also, Rae will occasionally encounter scary noises, typically from crows or dogs, who are surrounded by swirling black wisps, which act as barriers. In some cases, she’ll need to walk around them, but in others, these are gates she’ll need to “unlock” by performing other actions in the environment.\n\nI do recommend, though, that you take a moment now and again to look behind you at the path you’ve traced through the blank page. The visual experience is always lovely and engaging. But later levels, which wash out your path with rain, challenge your ability to do just that or even to get a sense of direction, though not in a frustrating way. Either way, even against the stark white background, the game is always pleasing and somewhat calming for the eyes.\n\nRae’s pace is decidedly plodding, not that I blame her or the designer for it. There is an understandable need for her to be cautious about every step. But for that slow pace, I expected more rewarding stops more frequently—something interesting in every corner, if you will. There are very few real story points, and the overall plot is rather simple, though pleasingly bittersweet. Yet a few chapters are strung along by Rae either hearing a faraway noise she tries to follow or imagining a space Nani may have traversed, causing her to divert her path.\n\nApproaching this project with some childish glee, I imagined that Rae would really go on an adventure. She’s a young, blind girl on a mission, and she’s both imaginative and rather capable. And although there are several people she passes on her way to the end, only one of them interacts with her, making an impact. I thought she’d go farther, do more, run a full gamut of emotions, and both learn about life and teach us jaded players something in the process. Instead, the succinct experience lends itself more to a young child’s storybook, though a really lovely one at that.\n\nMaybe it’s petty to lay into a game for what it could’ve been, but this game, though unique, charming, and well-executed, feels like an appetizer when I really wanted a meal. Although the story doesn’t feel cut off, it just feels too brief overall. I’d have preferred a game that ended when I wanted it to end. Still, I’m impressed with the job Tiger & Squid did with Team17’s faithful help. It is at least a solid, unfettered artist’s vision, not sullied by AAA expectations and producer’s interjections. For that, I’ll take this short trip any day.","January 19","true","17.6"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","0"

I do not feel it's fair to judge it by the same standards you would judge larger and more complicated games. I believe that this game achieves what it has set out to do, providing a simple, beautiful and emotional experience.\n\nIt is true that the pace of the game becomes a problem towards then end, the speed Rae walks is quite slow but this does make narritive sense and i only found it a particular problem in the last two chapters, that is not to say you won't earlier tho, and out of all the critisms put towards this game it is probably the one i most understand and could agree with.\n\nNone-the-less this is a beautiful game that tell's it's story in a truly unique and (i found) powerful way.

All you can do is walk. I understand that this is an exploration game and therefore this shouldn't feel wrong, but I really would have wished for more possibilites to interact with the environment. If the areas would be bigger or you could explore the areas more freely (like in "Dear Esther") I would have no problem with "just" walking. But Beyond Eyes has kind of fixed paths you follow and there aren't much other routes to try. So the combination of limited exploration and lack of interactions don't really work for me and results in a slow 2 hours walk.\n\nPros:\n+ interesting and  innovative approach to a difficult topic\n+ sound and feel of the game is very atmospheric\n+ Beautiful graphics\n\nCons:\n- unsurprisingly ending\n- Rae walks just a little bit too slow\n- Too limited possibilites to interact\n- exploration is quite linear\n\nWhy do I recommend this game?\nThe cons aren't really that big of a problem and more like unfulfilled expectations.

Not only did it accomplish this goal via very creative game concepts, but it tells a simple and endearing yarn of a blind child in search of her feline friend that really made me feel for the main character, Rae.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint the gameplay is simply walking and exploring, but as you can imagine walking and exploring without sight would be anything but simple.  Beyond Eyes world is beautifully colored and rendered, think watercolor painting, but most of it is shrouded in white except for your near vicinity.  As you move thru the landscape your world literally pops into existence out of the white, often with annoying reality like a fence right where you are trying to walk.  Sound is a key part of the experience too, not only in the stellar game audio but in distant visual bubble that becomes a beacon in the unknown for Rae to navigate towards.  Smell is also represented visually by wind waves, but be warned, both smell and sound can be misleading.\n\nBeyond Eyes not only gave me a “glimpse” into the world of a blind person, but it succeeded in making me feel for Rae.  The frustration of another dead end, the confusion of thinking you hear or smell something interesting that turns out to be something completely different, the sadness of loss, the joy of succeeding at simple tasks previously taken for granted.

You'll be doing a lot of walking around an exploring in this game and, being blind, Rae is very slow at that; this definitely isn't for the game for you if you're rather impatient.\n\nOften, the path toward the advancement of the story isn't that hard to follow, though a lot of the enjoyment in this game comes from exploring the unknown areas and seeing how the interpretations Rae makes from the sounds she hears doesn't always match up with what she'd imagined.\nConversely, it can get very annoying how fumbly the controls get whilst you're near a wall. Objects are often placed near the edges of the explorable area, seemingly to prevent it from becoming mundane to walk the perimeter to get a feel for an area. Whilst this is something at which it succeeds, a lot of the time I found myself wishing they hadn't – walking around objects far, far too often resulted in Rae turning left, right, left, right, left, then right again before I had her take a step back and walk far around, giving ample room to whatever barrel or bench had impeded her way. It may seem like a petty complaint, but in a game where the main purpose is exploration like so, it can detract from drawing you in by being downright distracting.\n\nSometimes, after you've done or interacted with something, something else will have changed in what you've already explored. Seeing things change from how Rae imagines them to be is a neat little feature that I enjoyed. As I've said prior, advancing in the story is usually pretty intuitive, but there were one or two points when I wasn't sure where to go, and I ended up tracing back my steps for longer than I'd have liked before a realised where something had changed. Once again, this complaint seems silly in the sense that this sort of thing happens in all sorts of games to everyone, so why not suck it up and move on? In a game where you move so incredibly slowly, backtracking and wondering around to find your goal is something you don't ever want to happen. The main reason I point it out is because this game is meant to be an emotional explorative journey, and after I had braved through it, I decided to take a break from the game because on reflection I realised I wasn't enjoying it like I had been beforehand.\n\nAnd I don't what that to be misinterpreted, because I did enjoy this game. It wasn't fun, rather it was pleasant.\nDo I think it was worth full price (or even the 90% sale ongoing at the moment)? I'm honestly not sure about that. I bought it on a hunch after just getting paid and part of me regrets it. If the game goes on a real sale some time, and you've read this review and still think you'd enjoy it, I'd certainly say so.","August 17, 2015","true","11.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","1"

Beyond Eyes shows a creative approach to show the feelings of a character and does so with the world that looks like a painting, with colors and sounds as well as with Raes body language.

If you purchase this with the mindset of it being a game that will keep you entertained for several hours, you will be disappointed. If you purchase this knowing that it is a fairly linear, slow paced story of love and loss, and enjoy storytelling over gameplay, this is for you.\n\nBeyond Eyes is a story about a young girl named Rae who lost her vision to an accident. She befriends a cat she names Nani who keeps her company during a difficult transitional period in her life. One day, Nani fails to show up and Rae sets off to find Nani.\n\nInitially, the entire is world is little more than a white backdrop. As you walk, the sounds you hear help to map out the area, highlighting walls, fences, paths, etc. based on the sounds Rae interprets. Animals that sound frightening may very well be a harmless thing, though these fears of the unknown keep Rae from continuing on her path until she finds some way to bypass that which frightens her.\n\nI will not say much, as I do not want to spoil the short story but I will say that the art, sound and music within the game  helps the player empathise with Rae and her disability.\n\nI would highly recommend this for those who want a touching story.","December 2, 2015","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When her friend does not return she sets out on a journey to find the cat discovering the world around her on the way.\n\nWhat I liked about the game was the emotional story that captured me from the start right to the finish. The music complemented the emotion in the game and added a lot to the whole experience while not being too intrusive. The painting-like art style really worked well with the discovery mechanic, they both complemented each other greatly. I also loved that the game awarded you with achievements and small cut-scenes for exploring, it really gives you that extra push to go and explore.\n\nSome things wherent so great tho and made the expirance of the game some what worse. The walking speed for example was allright while exploring new areas, but as walking through areas allready explored the speed seemed way to slow and was quite painfull.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/recommended/356050/","silentcaay","SilentCaay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/","247 products in account","This is easily the best "walking simulator" I've played. I hate to be one of those people that gets pretentious about artistic video games so I'll try to remain as objective as possible but it is a very beautiful, well crafted game. More importantly, it needs to be a game. A lot of "walking sims" catch flak because some people think they would make better books or movies or are otherwise unsuited to the video game medium but Beyond Eyes has a very dynamic way of presenting the world and even though it doesn't have any traditional gameplay, it does have plenty of mechanics.\n\nFirst a little about the story. You play as Rae, a young girl who is currently blind but was not born that way. You have a little orange friend by the name of Nani who happens to be a cat. One day Nani neglects to stop by to visit. After not seeing him for awhile you decide it's time to venture out and find him.\n\nNow this is where things get interesting. Being blind, Rae's world begins as a blank slate, a white canvas. She adds things to her world by experiencing them with her remaining senses. This means things you have to touch like walls, trees, etc will only be added to her world when you're right on top of them. Things she can hear like a flowing river or a bird's song are added from further away since she can hear them before being able to touch them. It sounds fairly basic but the game has a number of mechanics that are delivered to you each chapter. If you want to know about them, read the next paragraph or skip it if you want to experience them firsthand for yourself. I'll keep from spoiling anything specific, though.\n\nThe first chapter presents you with two mechanics, the touching VS hearing one I just explained and the difference between permanence and impermanence. As Rae senses permanent objects like trees and walls, they remain in her world even when she walks away from them. They're in her mind's eye. As she experiences impermanent objects like animals that can move around of their own accord, however, they only appear briefly while making sound. The next chapter presents you with the mechanic of misunderstanding. You may hear something far away and Rae adds it to her world as what she imagines it to be but upon closer inspection it may turn out to be something else and so she may react to the difference and change the object in her mind's eye. The next chapter presents you with impermanent permanent objects. Just because an object can't move on it's own doesn't mean it can't ever move. You find out that maybe a box or gate that was barring your passage and added to your world was changed in your absence and only upon re-examining them will the change be reflected in Rae's world. There are more mechanics but you can experience the rest for yourself.\n\nIn addition to the dynamic world, though, the game also has a dynamic atmosphere. The world of a blind person could have been represented as a dull gray world devoid of features but Rae is a young girl, full of imagination. The empty world starts off bright white and as you fill it with objects, they're very colorful... while she's happy. She also has her own fears, though, especially since she's trekking out on her own for the first time. Certain encounters will color her world dark. The world literally reflects her feelings in the moment since it's all being seen with her mind's eye. It's one thing to see Rae moan and shrink away from things she fears but to see her entire world painted black because of it is rather powerful.\n\nIn summary, I think this game does an exceptional job telling the story it set out to tell. Just judging it on that alone, I'd give it a 10/10. There are a couple things people might not like, though. Firstly, you have to walk everywhere. Hey, you're a little blind girl. You shouldn't expect to sprint around the place. You have to be prepared to take this game at a slow pace. Secondly, it's about a 3 hour experience for $15 but you could probably complete it in 2 hours if you just bee-lined it to the exit every chapter. As such, the price might be a little off-putting. I highly recommend this but you might want to wait for a sale.","December 19, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Beyond Eyes is generally bright and colourful, but should Rae become scared, whether it's from a dog, seagulls, or something else, how she imagines the world will turn dark.\n\nSome may find how fast Rae moves to be a bit too slow. I personally found it just fine - she's blind, I don't expect her to go sprinting around the world. I found the overall game to be extremely enjoyable though, and the time I spent playing it was fantastic. Whenever something would happen to Rae, whether it was getting scared, being happy, or being sad, I felt the same as she did. The way everything is conveyed is absolutely fantastic.\n\nIf you love artistic games and/or good stories then this game is a high recommendation to check out.","August 23, 2015","true","4.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The "confused" visions the girl has when encountering new strange things are really neat. The watercolor visuals are just fantastic. There's a few emotional moments that are quite well done, and the journey itself is quite neat.\n\nBut the game is quite short and only padded by *painfully* slow walking speed. I made a mistake by not checking a gate in the garden at the start, and wandered around for *five minutes* in a garden most children could cross in about 10 seconds. The character is blind and it's a "walking sim" yes, but even just an optional run button, even if only through areas you've already "seen" would help a ton. The slow pace really adds nothing but frustration to the game.\n\nAnd again, the game's short, with no real replayability, so it's a hard sell at it's full $15 price tag, but I feel the experience itself was worth having, if flawed. All in all I give it a cautious recommendation if this is your sort of thing, but probably not at it's full price.\n\nIf walking sims are usually not your deal, this will definitely not be the one to change your mind.","October 13, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But in the end, it is also a piece art, so beautiful that it made me cry. It's a story, nay, an experience about seeing the world differently, about not letting your disabilities stand in your way, of lonelyness and not giving up. It's about believing in yourself, of perstistance and love in an everchanging world that isn't always what it seems at first. Is it worth the price at the moment? As a game, I'd say no. As a game this is little more than a bothersome walk through a pretty world. But then again, if you can appreciate it like I did, if you can feel what it made me feel, it is priceless.","August 25, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, except for a few interactable objects, slowly moving with imperfect knowledge of your surroundings is the entirety of the game. More to do would have been nice.\n\nHowever, the game is very beautiful. Rae is a cute little girl, and the world as she perceives it is both charming and evolving. Rae's interpretation of the sounds she hears based on her knowledge from her cloistered garden is very inventive.\n\nBeyond Eyes can be finished in one day, which is a bit of a problem at its price point. If Rae moved at anything less than her wary unseeing pace I am sure it could be finished in under two hours. As beautiful as it was, I was left wanting much more.

As a statement and thought-provoking exercise,it succeeds.\n\nThe problem with this as a game is that it requires you to bump your way around walls,fences etc. After a while this becomes incredibly frustrating, due to the slow pace of the game (mainly because the main character moves at a ponderous rate).\nThat said, it has beautiful visuals. The way the world paints itself as you move along and listen to passing fauna is well-done. The sounds of the game, from the trickle of water to the clucking of chickens goes a long way to painting the world as a real place. The developer has clearly put alot of work into the world, and it shows.\n\nI cannot honestly recommend this as a game at £9.99, but if it's on a sale or you wish to support these evocative indie games, go for it.","August 24, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a very short game - around 2 hours - that is focused on letting you feel how a blind girl perceives the world. She does so by sound, smell, touch and fills in the rest with her imagination based on memory. When she is close to her familiar home, it's a vibrant and colorful world unless something scary like a barking dog is closeby, then her whole world turns into a dark and frightening place. Alot of thought and detail has been put into this, for example the further away from home she is, the harder it becomes making sense of things and when it rains, it is almost impossible to navigate as the sound is drowned out.\nAs short and easy as the game is, there are quite a few secrets to be found that can make revisiting Rae's world worthwhile. I don't see a demographic for this, so it's hard to recommend. If you have children, play it with them, it will be a rewarding experience for both of you. If you like a unique, deliberately slow and engaging experience, buy it. If you think a game needs high scores, an inventory system, a GUI, crafting, objective markers or the like, stay clear.","August 28, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It brought me to Tears because of how well the game was executed through the story it told.\nNot to spoil the ending for anyone but this game is WELL designed and creatively crafted to walk you through the rain boots of a young blind girl, looking for her best friend, a cat.\n\nThis game is worth getting yet I find myself conflicted because of the amount of time it took me to run through the story and explore my way to finding out the primary goal of this game.\n\nYou challenged with a STUNNING and Great Visual Design to explore a world around you through the sensory interpretation of a young blind Girl. I often times found myself closing my own eyes just to take in the sounds and then occasionally opening them to get the rest of the sense the game accounts for into visual perspective.\n\nMy play time from start to finish was 2.2 hrs and Purchased from the Steam store at discount ($13.49).\n\nI would justify this game as a MUST get. Just to try out exploration through a different perspective.\n- But, I would have to say wait till a sale or the Price drops below $7 dollars.\n- I would justify getting the game at its current price only if they was to include another adventure or more content after the primary ending of the Journey.\n\nPro's\n- The game did a masterful job of walking me through a journey and narrating it with simple text about what the character knew and was feeling.\n- You can get some visual input on the matters of what it's like to be a blind person.\n- The music was well timed and properly placed for certain small events.\n- No threats or time sensitive objectives\n\nCon's\n- Short story - Less than 3 hours of straight run through.\n- Chapters instead of save current point in exploration.\n- A little too costly for the current content adventure. (At time of Review for sale on Steam $14.99)\n- Very slow movement but expected. (If you were blind would you sprint through locations you don't know?)\n- Requires plenty of Patience in re-exploring certain parts of the Map's for those that don't like fog of war style of effects.\n- Leaves you wanting more.\n\nIt’s up to you if you’re interested in getting this game, just be advised it’s a short run through at its current run time of 2 to maybe 3 hours in a short sit down.\n","August 18, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is set in the mind of a blind girl called Rae. What you are presented with on screen is the world as Rae imagines it based on what she experiences, well.. beyond her eyes (sorry.) This mechanic is an empathy machine.\nThere is a moment early on where after venturing beyond the limits of Rae's garden you come across what appears to be a fountain, as like the one in aforementioned garden, they both sound the same to (sound design is masterful.) But upon closer inspection, the fountain morphs into a sewer drain, accompanied with the message to the effect of 'the world is not always as Rae imagines it.'.\nThe game is tells you a story, develops character and takes you beyond the realm of your own life experience in ways that only videogames can, excellently.\nOkay, so this isn't one for the l33tnoscope360 COD morons but I implore you, if you are ever going to give videogames a chance THIS IS WHERE TO START.\n\nAnd guess what, your spud of a laptop will probably run it too\n","August 20, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It also has this storybook-like whimsical atmosphere that is beautiful. The watercolor style and text that comes up to convey the story work well together. However, the main character walks so slowly that the game becomes monotonous and painfully annoying after playing for a while. Eventually I gave up on the game and never finished it. I think if they sped up the walking a little bit they could have sustained the idea of it, her tentative walking because she is sensing her surroundings, while also making the game more playable.

I wave caution to you because there are some frustrating parts of this game. My biggest upset about this game are the bounding boxes on everything. You hit something and because of how the character controller works and now slow you move you spend 5 seconds moving off of a wall instead of 1 second and that really adds up when this game is about finding walls!!! It is something that needs fixed and maybe the dev just didn't ever run into the walls that they made. also personally a little feature that would not mess up game play or even change it would probably help it some is a little button to get a slight jog going. Rae's walk is way too slow personally when you're running from something and it just isnt fun walking away from danger in my opinion. There is only 2 cons with this game, bounding boxes and character controller and for each of those there are about 500 pros.

Even if it has some really cool concepts, it falls completely on its face in other aspects.\nYou walk very slowly, which makes sense given you are blind but it punishes you for exploring or back tracking. You get nothing, or very little for exploring other than a long and arduious walk back.\nPaths open and close seemingly randomly making it stupidly hard to get around or know where to go.\n"clues" as to where to go are misleading and you often have to go far out of your way, or opposite to the direction indicated to get there. (And no feedback during the process the majority of the time).\nI really like the depictions of things like cars, streets or other scary things that you couldn't identify until you were closer. A lawnmower engine shows a car until you figure out what it was, the street was a giant black foreboding wall of death, etc.\nThe level design seems very poorly thought through, and I wonder if they even listened to tester feedback (or had any testers at all).\nThe art is very nice, but very samey and you find yourself running into duplicates of everything (including birds, dogs, etc) which sure she's blind and likely can't tell the difference... but as a player I am not her.\nThe story is weak at best, I'm not sure why people are praising it. You're a blind girl, that's the end of your characterization. You are looking for a cat (by yourself in places you've never been) going in arbitrary directions because she imagines what they cat would do. 'fraid that's not very compelling.\nThe major problems are with consistancy, it doesn't feel consistant.","August 23, 2015","false","1.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

When you play a game, you need a sense of fulfilment and with this, all I felt was the guess I made waaay back in Chapter One was to come into fruition, and it left me angry.\n\nThe biggest beefs I have with the game comes from several things:\n* The "clues" you get to point you to your destination - with the time lapse from story intro to the impetus that drives the story, too much time had gone by to make it really feasible.\n* Blind people don't just up and wander like that - even at an early age.  They have walking sticks and other safety things they keep in consideration.  This child acted waay too sheltered to be believable.\n* The "true identity" concept - Hearing would be enhanced on a blind person to compensate - there is no way she would not have been able to idenify their owners better.  It ticked me off the most when going past cars, they didn't sound like either cars or road, and then when they were identified, they became the next "placeholder" for something like a lawnmower, which sounds nothing like a car, truth be told - and this is form a person with hearing problems!  The protagonist had hearing before this, and she SHOULD have been able to identify these things - including the CROWS!  Crows cawing should NOT have scared her as they did!  Going blind does not make you instantly forget how everything sounded!  You do not reset to "zero" in reality!\n\nThis last was the thing that caused me to uninstall the game.  Yes, you're trying to show someone how it feels to be in a world foreign to you, but at the same time, you need to add a bit more common sense to the concept, as well.\n\nAgain, If you like experimental and want to enjoy the concept, go ahead. but if you want a good story, I'd personally go with a different game.","December 22, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Beyond Eyes exceeds that standard in every way. The game mechanics and controls are simple, the gameplay is easy to follow, the visuals are beautiful, and this is a feels trip from beginning to end.\n\nCalling this game a "walking simulator" is not far off the mark. Aside from the occasional interaction with a ball or stile or bread, all you do in this game is navigate the big, ever-changing, and sometimes frightening world.  As a result, the controls are very simple: WASD, space bar, escape, and mouse. That's it, that's all you need.\n\nSimple controls are helpful, though, because at times it's easy to get turned around lose your way entirely. There were a few times that I really needed to concentrate to figure out where I need to be going, and how I should get there given all the new incoming information about the environment. But that's the beauty of the gameplay here: simple to learn, but difficult to master.\n\nGetting turned around isn't all that bad though. The art style, and watching the world form and change around you, are wonderful experiences in and of themselves. Beyond Eyes looks very much like a children's storybook, with the playful watercolor art and the short blurbs of text that pop up sometimes. I was especially impressed with how sounds are visualized, and how environment color changed to portray Rae's emotions.\n\nThe colored indications of Rae's feelings, however, did not prepare me for the emotions this game had in store. For all its bright, cheery colors, this is a very sad game-- even heartbreaking at times. I will admit it, I cried twice playing this. The sadness, though, and the way it reaches out and touches you are incredible. Not many games are able to accomplish this, in my experience.\n\nTaking everything into account-- the simplicity, the gameplay, the visuals, and the emotions-- I most definitely recommend this game. It's short, very well done, and an experience that will not soon be forgotten. Well done, Tiger and Squid! I hope to see more of what you come out with someday.","November 15, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Never did I think I'd ever play a game where you're a blind protagonist! The first time I read about this game I knew I was going to get it. It is so beautifully done as well and the graphics were so colourful and charming, as were the characters and atmospheres.\n\nI loved how no one spoke too and how the story was told. It added to the innocence that enveloped the story. A little blind girl going on a journey to find a cat is as innocent and cute as stories come. And with each new area I got excited at what clever ideas would come next. I loved so many of them. The way she assumed things but, as you get closer, realise she was wrong. The way you bumped into things and they appear. I loved the way traffic and other scary/loud noises were portrayed (as black scary smoke) to this vulnerable little girl.\n\nWhere it was nice, happy, innocent and pretty; with it came a sort of eeriness too, to me it did anyway. But personally I think that was something the developers caught well. Face it, being blind is a scary prospect, as is the unknown. I felt scared for her sometimes. Such a brave central character though and one to admire. My only regret is that I wish it was longer. The end made me well-up too, even though not too much is given away at what happened (yet implied).\n\nThe only other thing I'll say is that you have to be very patient to play this game as it focuses mainly on exploration and beauty. Thankfully I'm just that kinda person and can appreciate games that try something different, thus I enjoyed it.

It had an original idea, with a beautiful visual style and the possibility of some interesting mechanics.\n\nBut then I started playing it, and that's when it all fell apart...\n\nThis is a very soft recommendation.  If you're genuinly curious about this game, or you got it from a Humble Bundle, then you owe the game a playthrough.  It's not a great game, or even, in my opinion, a good game, but it is interesting enough to try.\n\nMy biggest issue stems from the games central idea.  Since you're playing as a blind girl, you're unable to perceive anything in the game world unless it's making a sound, or it's directly in front of you.  This encourages exploration, and since Rae seems to have a pretty good memory, she can remember just about everything about where she has already been.  It's a lot like dealing with the Fog of War in an RTS, but from a more personal perspective.\n\nThe downside is that you often don't realize you're walking into a dead end until a wall or other obstruction appears right in front of you.  This leads to a lot of frustrated wandering.  You spend a decent chunk of the game hugging a wall or fence, looking for the gate into a new area, or backtracking because once you realize you've just spent two minutes going the wrong way.\n\nAnd that's when my other major gripe with the game pops up.  It's one thing to have to backtrack, but having to do it over and over with Raes sluggish walking speed.  I haven't wanted a run button this bad since Gone Home.\n\nThe obvious counterpoint to these gripes is that the game is making an ernest attempt at replicating the experience of navigating an unfamiliar environment while blind; an effort that is both successful and admirable, yet seriously damages the overall gameplay.  Maybe there just isn't a good way to gamify blindness.\n\nBut even after managing to endure the gameplay issues, there's still not a whole lot to praise.  There's a simple story with a final emotional payoff that is both underwelming and predicable.  Replay value is almost completely non-existant; two or three hours is all you need to really need to see everything.","December 1, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing is developed beyond " Hey a blind girl as a protagonist! Arent we just sooo artsy" I want my disabled characters in videogames, as I am also disabled, though not physically, but reducing it to one gimmicky trait without any devolopment of character or story, is just lazy. What do we know about this girl besides her disabillity? I like artsy games, but this got too bogged down with art!, and everything is annoying. The walking, the white shining screen, the overall feeling of annoyance. I like games that are just art, but I need to enjoy being in that world. You couldn't enter houses, adults did not see you or acknowledge you. I have it on good authority that blind people are actually able to open doors, ask for directions and talk to people, besides shouting "nani", every 5 seconds.","February 9","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a very limited view around your character. Finding your way around walls and obstacles becomes very challenging.  sound is used in a very unique way in this game.\nI’d give this game 6.5 out of 10.\n","January 3","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For music and graphics (painting scenery) alone, the game can be quite enticing.\n\nPersonal issues with the game:\n\n1. Movement is terribly slow; this was probably enforced due to short timeframe to complete game.\n2. Dogs are made out to be evil.\n3.
