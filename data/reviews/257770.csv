"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slightlysignificant/recommended/257770/","slightlysignificant","swightly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slightlysignificant/","266 products in account","A unique squad based game where you control multiple agents at your secret base through multiple monitors in their first person POV. However, you won't be able to move much in the mission unless you let you crucial radio operator agent "Bolt" haul  his clunky radio backpack through various power sources and attaching signal extenders. The radio however loses power as you carry it, forcing you to relocate to another power source quickly before his monitor turns all static. Incase of such accidents you can control another agent who can give commands for bolt to move back to a targeted spot. Finding power sources and clearing them out of enemies is a rather tedious part of the game for me, making the game feel much more slower than it needs to be.\n\nThe enemy is easily controllable by pointing the gun at their heads behind them and "interacting" with them, causing them to just stand there hands up in surrender. This makes the game rather comical because the AI is too cowardly to shoot back even if you stopped pointing your gun on them. By utilizing the spy's ability to beckon the enemy to you, you can herd all the enemies to a secluded party where everyone's hands are in the air.\n\nMost enemies are oblivious to the spy in his gentleman outfit even while he strolls along military restricted zones in all of the missions, rendering him invincible due to the flawed AI. You'd be picking this old man most of the time because he can easily scout out power sources for Bolt to take the safest route in to extend the signal.\n\nThere is absolutely no point for running and gunning in the earlier missions. You really dont want to alert whole patrols of guards with the loud gunshots. Most enemies in the game are rather durable to gunshots even if you aim for the head, which deters any need of shootouts unless needed. On the otherhand melee just wrecks everything in your sight, that is if the enemy don't force your agents to surrender mid swing for bringing a knife to a gun fight.\n\nThe missions are nice and varied but sometimes leave very little leg room for stealth without arresting or killing guards. One puzzle I hated in the game was the pipe puzzle in the second mission. Even with a diagram in the room to help out I couldn't figure out which levers to pull with how clumped up most of the pipes are. Another thing I hated was respawning rebels in the later in the game which spawned like an army of them even after thinning out so much with a couple of bombardments and shootouts.\n\nFor an indie game it has done a pretty good job, but the game needs extra polishing up on making missions more enjoyable and squashing multiple bugs that I've come across along the way.","November 25, 2013","true","9.4"," 82 of 88 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","82","88","0","1"

You'll really want to like this game, but eventually you'll throw in the towel in frustration.\n\n1. The central game concept, having to move the radio throughout the level, becomes tedious fast.  They've since added in a difficulty slider to either compromise or completely remove the feature.\n\n2. Much like it's genre predecessors, HIdden and Dangerous and Rainbow Six, when stealth fails, you need to play it like an FPS.  Unfortunately, this is a terrible FPS, especially by modern standards.\n\n3. The stealth system is underdeveloped.  Supposedly there's a shadow and line of sight system.  However the art direction is so stylized it's hard to tell what's effective concealment.  For what's ultimately a stealth game, this is a pretty critical flaw.\n\nI really loved the art and writing in this game, it's just a shame it's so painful to play.","March 15, 2014","false","7.9"," 79 of 95 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","79","95","0","0"

In order to see your agents, you need to make sure they are within the signal range of your radio, which can be moved and requires a power source. When unplugged, you have a short amount of time to find another plug. Swapping between each agent gives you a chance to try a different tactics as each agent has a certain set of skills.

Set in a retro-futuristic 1940s, this bureaucratic society is governed by two feuding organisation, the military and the church. You play as an agent of the church, tasked with carrying out missions involving spying and espionage. However your character never actually enters combat but instead issues commands via video and radio links to the operatives in the field.\n\nThe game is a first person shooter and you control 3 operatives, at the same time, via these links in single player or cooperatively. This concept is very original but is also the games greatest achievement and weakness. The controls can be frustrating and take time to master. They require lots of patience, organisation and multitasking to pull off, even minor mistakes can lead to panic and mission failure. The gameplay mechanics are also very retro and rather basic when compared to more mainstream tactical espionage games.\n\nHowever, once you are accustomed with the basics this charming game, with it's stylized oil painting graphics, simple plot, humorous narrative and nods to cult film classic "Brazil", combine to form a really interesting tactical espionage action sandbox where objectives can be tackled in any number of ways, alone or with friends. 7/10","May 26, 2015","true","43.6"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

Infact this game reminded me what it was like when I first started playing video games, because it was so out there. It pretty much took me until 3/4ths into the game before I felt completely comfortable with the controls and gameplay, and the missions are very replayable both in design (large various paths) and with the fact that you can use different combination of agents.\n\nI feel though that anyone saying it's badly designed and clunky isn't really justified. This game relies a ton on strategy and positioning, so the most I would say is if you get caught completely out of position with your pants down it can feel clunky because you have to on the spot deal with pressure which is difficult when you have 2-3 sometimes 4 units in first person perspective. So being caught off guard can be really punishing at first when you're adjusting to the micromanaging, although it is a strategic game so it's fair.\n\nCombat is kind of a non-option in this game unless your idea of combat is flanking enemies and not having an open firefight. A lot of the guns aren't really effective on more than one guard (minus sniper and shield), however it is extremely forgiving defensive wise as your agents have a lot of health and you are given ~10-11 lives per level. Dying can be a pain though as the new agent is parachuted in at a certain point with nothing but a melee weapon, so you need to retrieve your items or just leave them and steal a guards guns (as long as you didn't lose a valuable item like the radio)\n\nAll in all, this game is 95% positioning and tactics 5% shooter, and it makes it really interesting and fun to play after you get use to having to micro 4 first person cameras.","December 29, 2014","true","49.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Its a challenging stealth coop experience with a central mechanic that makes coordination key. You play as field agents each with there own abilities in primary stealth based game. The catch is that you are  directing these agents from a remote base which needs the radio man to provide the signal needed to see. this means that youll be using one charecter to carry the radio ahead so that the other charecters can seewhat they are doing. This is what can make the game extermly tedious alone as you move each charecter 1 by 1 so you can see what they are doing instead of white static.Sometimes you have to use a charecter who is in vision to direct the others in the dark.\n\nThe radio signal booster has a battery life too and has to be moved from station to station. Lucily alot of stations once activated will provide a permanent signal in that area allowing you to move through there with vision at any time.Its tactical and requires alot of pre planning and foresight as the not 100% solid stealth mechanics can cause you to be gunned down very quickly if caught. You get the option of picking who goes into the missions down the line but youll need the radio man every time.\n\nThe previously mentioned notes are just a small explaination of the gameplay not pros or cons just a breakdown. I found it fun and so did my friends but we discussed how much of a grind it would be solo positioning all the agents instead of just splitting the work up between multiple players. Multiplayer uses ip addresses so if your familiar with port forwarding and whatnot you'll be all set for multiplayer. The multiplayer ui isnt 100% setup but its functional. It is strange that this game is 3 player coop and comes with a 2 pack though ,but its definitely a fun romp and a unique experience I would reccomend to anyone patient enough for a stealth game with some puzzles elements on top your in for a fun coop experience.","July 26, 2015","true","19.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It could just be me but I play on a TV so I had to input a custom resolution and all that. Also, you have to do the opening of ports and stuffs for multiplayer. The main thing about this game is that it is meant to be multiplayer in my opinion. They realllly should have a pack deal or something. If you can, get this on sale, and a second copy for a close bud with similar interests. There really isnt many people who play this either which is sad because it's really an innovative game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/igofast/recommended/257770/","igofast","FordGT90Concept","http://steamcommunity.com/id/igofast/","698 products in account","Well this game is definitely different.  It's the only game I know of where up to 6 view points (the player and up to 5 characters controllable by the player) are utilized at once.  It is also the first I've played that uses a radio mechanic to limit where players can go.\n\nI should make it clear right away that there are two fundamental things you need to know about this game:\n1) Radios: on Easy difficulty, all of the Radios are enabled and you don't have to worry about this.  On Normal, you have a "bolt" soldier which carries a radio to power boxes, sets it up, and then that power box becomes a permanent radio so you can move your portable radio to another box.  On Hard, the radios are not permanent which effectively requires two players to advance the game.  If a character leaves, or gets left out of, radio range, they effectively become deaf and blind.  This is the first time ever I experienced this in a game and at first, I have to say it is quite frightening.  In situations where you have to do this, you learn to rely on other characters to be the eyes for the one out of range.  This is a very unique mechanic and it serves its purpose well.\n\n2) FPS: Make no mistake that at its core, this is a shooter.  The only thing that's really different on this end is you can switch between up to five different shooters.  The shooting mechanics, after turning up the mouse sensitivity, are good.\n\nThat said, I really only have two complaints:\n1) I got stuck for hours, repeatedly, and Google/Bing were no help.  Searching Steam forums was so if you run into problems, don't bother with search engines, just search the Signal Ops Steam forum.\n\n2) Switching between perspectives isn't as easy as I'd like it to be because the game is set up to command first (hold that perspective's key), control second (push perspective's key 2-4 times--it should just be 2 but often find myself smashing it to change).  I really wish it was control first, and command second because it was really, really rare that I commanded and very, very frequent that I controlled.\n\nThat said, I enjoyed the game and recommend it.  I'll probably replay it sometime in the future.","March 27, 2015","true","31.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I do. But oftentimes, I want to strangle it senseless.\n\nI finally had to give in and put the thing on easy. That removes the need fot Bolt to lug his godd*amn radio around, which gives the player a little more breathing room. For a stealth game, the options to scout around and plan ahead are paramount, and that's nigh impossible with the radio mechanic. I understand why it's there -- your player character is only remotely controlling this team, after all -- but it's also the game's biggest flaw. Thankfully I bought the game after easy mode was introduced, otherwise I might have thrown it down in frustration like many others have.\n\nThe controls are... strange, but not as terrible as I've heard. Once you get used to them, they aren't quite second nature, but close. I wonder if that is something that's been tweaked since the beginning as well. I can't speak for how it feels with a controller, but aside from your team moving at a quick shamble of a walking pace, the keyboard and mouse feel pretty smooth. Not precise and refined, but smooth. My only other gripe is that, should you actually get into combat, you're probably going to lose. I don't know if the FPS portion is deliberately bad to discourage players from taking that route, or if it's just something that never really got finished, but if you find yourself in a shootout, you're probably better off reloading.\n\nI haven't gotten terribly far into the story, but what I have seen, I adore. The writing is sharp and witty, the artistic direction is beautiful, and I'm really fond of the painting-come-to-life graphics. While far from perfect, the heart that went into Signal Ops is readily apparent. More than anything, it's obviously and indie game, built on an indie budget, and it's up you if the flaws outweigh the gain.\n\nPersonally, I think that a fantastic game is waiting for you.","April 24","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I really wanted to just drop Signal Ops after diving into the first mission after the training session and just stream a playthrough to consume the story (after all, what was the harm if I had already purchased the game and had no intention or chance of getting a refund?).  Surprisingly, there are very few videos of this game that are not done by the developer, and even fewer online comments on strategy for some of the more challenging levels.  HowLongToBeat had zero actual submissions for the game when I started, and I was curious as to why.  Had I stumbled on to something so obscure nobody was playing it at all, and nobody had played it all?\nThankfully, I got through the first mission and was hooked.  The stealth mechanics are as addictive as any other AAA stealth game I've dove into in the past few years, and despite multiple failures a mission, I found myself coming back to the PC to give it another go.  While this game takes place from a first person perspective, gone are the reliable guns and fast, agile movements of a traditional FPS.  Movement is slower and feels almost cartoony by comparison.  This was the most jarring change for me as a player  of many multiplayer FPS titles.  Once I got the hang of the pace of the game through the course of the first mission, things started getting more interesting, so I reccomend the gameplay side of things with reservations that it may take some getting used to.  The main crux of the gameplay is you are sitting at a chair with multiple monitors, controlling multiple characters at once by switching monitors with the number keys.  The number of screens available depends on the mission, and you unlock more character archetypes as you progress through the story (Spy, Wrench, Bolt, Shield, etc.).  Each character has their own abilities like sniping and lock picking, and its up to the player to navigate through missions without getting caught by the enemies.\nThe developers have built a beautiful oil painting style world to go along with the game, where everything from the trucks to the door knobs adhere to this asymmetrical, painted aesthetic.  The environments lend themselves well to the Eastern European, Cold War vibe seen in titles like Papers, Please, with a slightly more animated, hand-drawn feel to them.  The story has a bit of mysterious religion versus government, new world order conspiracy stuff tied to it, with massive underground compounds, arms deals gone wrong, and lethal espionage capers all helping give the game a bit of a 50's spy movie feel at the same time.  The ending, while satisfactory, still left many questions in my mind about the world that was built around the gameplay, and I hope to revisit it again someday.\nIf you can get around the lack of resources for being stuck in the game, appreciate a good stealth experience, and have the patience to adapt to the controls, the game is really worth it.  I wanted to drop it after the first hour but logged almost 20 once I got into it.","May 12","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Did I mention coop? you can play with 2 others ether localy, online, LAN, or a combination of it!\n\nOverall, I give it a 8/10 as it is still abit buggy, but has alot of more to come!","December 21, 2013","true","43.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If it was not for the clunky shooting you sometime have to deal with, this would be my dream stealth/puzzle game. But after waiting all these years for something great in the genre, I have to say this is a must have for those looking to relive the feeling of your first Thief mission. Plus the art style is very interesting!","December 28, 2013","true","5.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Takes a simple framework and builds on it with some good quality voice-acting, unique world and story behind it.\n\nWorth the money, needs some practice to get things feeling natural though since the game cannot decide whether it exclusively wants to use a controller or not (still displaying controller Icons when no controller except a joystick is present).","December 27, 2013","true","1.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You get to fight the police and rebels. The game has a very cartoonish feel to it and has great art work.

Very awkward controls, poor gameplay, bugs, and dated graphics. This game requires you to have old graphic card drivers installed, so there were some capability problems with my modern Windows 7 64bit PC.\n\nGameplay is slow and movement is out of sync, it can be hard to tell what it is you are meant to be doing and the tutorial was not very helpful. There is very little to no fun to be had here.\n\nThis game was designed for the Xbox 360 controller in mind so it’s very difficult to play this mess of a game with a keyboard and mouse.\n\nI can't recommend this game to anybody and do not let that arty 1960's spy vibe lure you in like it did to me. There are so many other better spy games than Signal Ops like No One Lives Forever and Death to Spies which are much superior games then this mess.

Oh yes, the devs themselves hate critisicm and happily ban anybody with a different opinion than them. It's funny, all you have to do is write "troll" and put them on the ban list, nobody gives it a second thought. Such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attitude for amatuer indie devs, especially when some critisicm is what they need!\n\nThe game itself is a good idea done poorly. The game is supposedly a stealth based shooter, but any attempts of going in guns blazing are fairly futile without a full squad of players and the right characters. With a friend in coop the first mission was patently impossible. after a certain point the guards become so numerous a single mis-step results in doing everything over again.\n\nGraphically the game is horrid, the muddy graphics remind me of the days of playstation. Enemies wear urban colors that make them blend into the likewise muddy urban colors. guns sound and feel rediculous and underwhelming. Both of these problems I brought up in their initial gameplay trailer, apperently ignored. A similar game with clear graphics and well designed weaponry could easily outsell this peice of garbage.\n\nGet it on sale cheap if you can and reserve it for bad game night.\n\n","December 4, 2014","false","4.5"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","0"
