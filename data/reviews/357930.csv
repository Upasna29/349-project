This is one of my favorite genres, but R.O.O.T.S. is not a good example of the type. It brings to mind, and compares poorly against, other similar games.\n\nThe aesthetic is a little too close to Eufloria (trees on asteroids), and it plays a lot like Tentacle Wars (free flash game), both of which I loved. But Tentacle Wars had a lot of features that this sorely lacks.\n\nVolume controls. Or really, any options at all.\nColorblind-friendliness. There have been levels in R.O.O.T.S. where I don't know who is winning. There's no way to distinguish between my trees and the enemy's.\nMore tactical options (R.O.O.T.S. basically has one: Send a root out, or don't).\n(And, why does the title have periods in it? Does R.0.0.T.S. stand for something? It's not in the description anywhere)\n\nEufloria had a story; this doesn't. Tentacle Wars had MUCH more gameplay options. There may be *potential* for a good game here though. It's just not there yet, no matter how much I want it to be.","June 20, 2015","false","0.8"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

Power is not truly transferable(meaning you cannot indirectly project power), and several of the later levels are designed in such a way that the natural outcome is a "deadlock". Meaning, for example, that there's a choke-point of 2 planets, and you can direct 5 planets worth of power there, and the AI can project 5 or 6 planets worth of power there. The result is that even if you manage to focus down one of those planets, it is now further in the AI territory and it can bring additional 3 planets worth of power to bear against it, instantly taking it back.\n\nFor some of these levels, there are supposedly Youtube-walkthroughs from the creator. The problem is that either the enemy got smarter, some mechanics changed, or they are immensely luck-based. (e.g. level 35, even if I try to copy the walkthrough exactly to bypass the deadlock, the AI is always smart enough to "save" against backdoor intrusion, and thus ultimately has sufficient planets available to force the deadlock again.\n\nOther annoying aspects: There's obstacles that cause seemingly randomized pathfinding(meaning doing the exact same thing 2 times in a row produces different results), Enemies seem to focus on you(more obvious in a few maps featuring above-mentioned deadlocks), and seemingly "mirrored" maps are not(meaning the AI can reach a planet from a position where you cannot on your side of map, giving it an advantage).\n\nMost annoying, though, is the fact that all that excess power is lost. While i understand that this is part of the mechanic, it also turns some maps into slugfests, where you clearly have an advantage but have to battle it out for, depending on your individual skill, quite a long time. A more elegant mechanic would have been preferable here.\nEven if "boosting" a planet would just work as a tiebreaker against an unboosted enemy planet projecting power somewhere.\n\nAll in all, it is amusing for a while and the price is low. But it is a source of great frustration in some later levels, which is why I cannot recommend this. From its simplicity and tone, it aims to be similar to a number of games it lists in the store page. But it fails in providing that same fair and enjoyable playstyle.\n\n\nTL:DR: Several shortcomings and map design make this game infuriating in later levels, with luck-based and seemingly random success-chance, rather than strategy. As such, cannot recommend even at this price. If you pick it up in a bundle, go ahead and give the first couple levels a try-those are fine.","May 19, 2015","false","8.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Acecool/recommended/357930/","Acecool","Acecool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Acecool/","1154 products in account","The one way to win this game is by speed; if you've tried a level and have reached a "draw", you can move the connections around ( each time you do the computer has a high chance of redrawing theirs ) until the ai screws up, another way is to avoid that situation by simply being faster... Draw lines and disconnect them to plant seeds on more "planets" and repeat, then start connecting them together as you branch out.\n\nThere is another major issue with the gameplay in the sense that you can have 5 planets connecting to another planet which is occupied by the enemy and get nowhere... You can have them connected directly, or in a chain... Chains don't appear to do anything further than 1 or 2 out and trees by themselves don't appear to grow past a certain value ( be it in the early stages where they grow quickly or toward the end where they apparently stop growing unless consuming enemy trees ) making the game a bit more confusing because you never know if you'll consume an enemy that is at a disatvantage according to human though-processes based on the entire chain connected 1 by 1 to the enemy, or x lines to the target planet, etc....\n\nBasically, the game has unresolved issues in that regard...\n\nNote: A major issue with this game for many other people because this game isn't color-blind friendly and as a large portion of men also suffer from color-blindness in the form of a reduced range of typically visible, to the human eye, colors...\n\nUpdate:\nI posted on the developers website giving them 24 hours to resolve the issue; the comment is awaiting moderation at the time of posting this update. I did post a response to that original note threatening to expose them as thieves ( charging for a demo then charging again for the actual game despite there being no mention of this in the description or elsewhere ). The last post was over 6 months ago on their site, so the dev may be AWOL and if this is the case the game should be removed from Steam because of this bug or tactic.\n\nIt seems to have been either resolved, or relaunching the game and not playing level 12 or 13 doesn't trigger it again ( note, this is after rebooting; restarting the game didn't work prior to doing this which is strange, considering I leave my pc running 24/7 ).\n\nOriginal comment:\nI was going to write a positive review, however the game is asking me to purchase a key despite already owning the game on Steam. Steam provides keys when games are forthcoming about asking, this game has not been open therefore Steam isn't showing the key.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent Issues List ( Updated ):\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- Not color-blind friendly for those that are concerned with this.\n- Issue where the game doesn't allow you to continue playing ( triggered by beating level 12 and possibly by starting level 13; if you skip 12 and 13, you may be ok... )\n- After you are close to level 20, the menu zooms in making it impossible to select older levels ( Apparently clicking at the edge of the screen [ or a level you want to play ] restores proper zoom and then you're required to click again )\n- Defeating the enemy is based on how fast you spread the seeds instead of more thought-out strategy such as organizing lines in such a way that there would be a constant barrage on the enemy, etc... I wouldn't define this as strategy, but as Speed-Seed / Quicker Clicker Wins, etc... There's no real puzzle, challenge or any other strategy that is needed once you see speed makes all the difference and for the cases of draw you can create connections that'll never succeed and the ai will make a mistake for the draw to cease...\n- Zoom doesn't work properly in the sense that clicking planets is offset at zoomed-out levels causing you to incorrectly click / drag and making it difficult to move the screen to what you want to look at ( WASD or even arrow-key camera movement would be a simple, yet welcome, addition )\n- AI is terrible; creating connections that'll never succeed will make them make a mistake which will let you through. Ai could be more difficult, but then again regulating an enemy in a game where speed makes the difference really revolves around limiting their speed whereby it works as designed except for the flaw where they redraw lines based on lines that clearly can't succeed, etc...\n- Lack of basic options such as a volume slider; the only option is an icon on the main menu to mute all sound ( granted there is a major positive remark about not making an extra menu for a simple toggle, there is a major negative for not even having the most basic of options such as resolution control, windowed mode or anything else )...\n- No Help provided when selecting the About icon in the main menu.. You're provided with two names, the coder and the sound composer and an Ok button ( also a link to reMaginarium.com; mayber there is info there? ). The url and other info could've been cleanly integrated into the main menu, especially because it zooms in / out when it wants to... I guess it would be difficult to describe a game based around flawed logic too; what would they write? Speed is key, the fastest seed-spreader will win...\n- Wormholes ALWAYS work for the enemy, rarely for you ( instead of taking the shortest route, through the wormhole, it takes the longest; 1 out of 1000 it'll work for you, if that ).\n- Menu colors are terrible and hard to read during certain background scenes; again poor choice for color-blind people and even poorer choice because non-color-blind people have issues with the menu too... Drawing the text twice would resolve this; first time in some color and the second in its opposite such as white/black or black/white, orage/blue, etc...\n- Reserved...\n- Reserved...","February 2","false","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

If you don't clear a level, you can't access the rest of the game. And there is at least one level quite a few people have problems with (level 13).\nFor me this comes down to the question: can I click fast enough and precise enough to clear the level. It is not about the right strategy (that you can look up in youtube walkthroughs if you get stuck) but just pure click-n-drag-speed.\nAnd for me that is a sign of bad level design.","July 18, 2015","false","2.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"
