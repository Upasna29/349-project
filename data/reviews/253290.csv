A high speed running game with one button as the sum total of a player’s control. Don’t think of that as a limitation. Quite the opposite. Since this is first and foremost a sensory experience type of game, deriving much from little, it would be unfortunate if even the smallest part of a player’s attention were taken from the screen.\n\nThe player, as “runner”, travels very minimalistic landscapes. Some are vaguely identifiable, such as rooms in a sort of building. (The more identifiable the terrain, the faster landscapes seem to go by as the eye/brain connection struggles for context.) The runner also jumps, but I hesitate to call this a platformer. It does have platformer characteristics, such as the pink dots one attempts to acquire by contact. And the varying size and levels of platforms. Some game levels, in fact, are almost entirely platforms. These are generally the more difficult; as players struggle to attain the secondary goal, SPEED.\n\nThe primary goal of FOTONICA is scoring points. Every run scores points, even those ending in failure (carefully recorded on the Statistics screen.) Points are composed of distance traveled, dots attained and how much of the distance was in “gold” mode, above 60 mps. (There may be exceptions beyond the lower levels I’ve seen so far.) There are numerous levels, each beyond the first being unlocked through performance (so I hesitate to give too many details.) As well, there are 4 skill levels. Though they have Italian names, I presume them to be Agile, Energetic, Furious and Impetuous. Perhaps someone can clarify. Each game level at each skill level has its own leaderboard. A player can seek their own ranking, overall, or compare with any friends that have played. In addition to Arcade mode, composed of various tracks or terrains to run, there is Endless (presumably as described, though hitting 10,000 points (oddly enough) does indicate “completion”, but not the end. Each Arcade level also has a point of completion in which the player joyously jumps into a world of horizontal lines, not tracks or platforms.) FOTONICA also includes a third mode, multiplayer, which I am unable to comment on at this time.\n\nEach skill level is essentially an increase in speed, requiring different paths and strategies, often seeming almost as if a completely new level of the game involving new terrains. That’s the real excitement of FOTONICA, finding the BEST (perhaps only) path to the end, by exploring all the possibilities at the various speeds. Hints are offered. Sometimes the placement of a pink dot can offer a clue, as can the position of flag-like markers to indicate a jumping point. But be careful, sometimes a dot seems, at least at certain speeds, to sucker you into a dead end move.Very often the appropriate path or action is counterintuitive, such as jumping before maximum speed, in order to land more strategically. Or kicking off instead of running, for a similar purpose. Strange as it may sound, all movement is, as mentioned earlier, controlled by one button, ANY button. But that button does even more. It also controls landing from each leap, presumably to provide a smoother, less momentum disrupting transition. When at some point a leap goes too far, “the button” will also act to land the runner sooner (though at a cost to speed) to avoid leaping into space, the most common conclusion to a run. (After two days I have nearly 1,000 such “space leaps”.)\n\nIn real life I can’t run without a price, and have been severely limited in doing so for about 40 years. Perhaps that increases my enjoyment of this game. For others with limitations this game is nearly perfect with its simplicity of control and color. It also offers a feature by which a player can offset the timing of their input, in either direction, by 2 degrees each. This feature certainly deserves examination by any player, impaired or not.\n\nThe achievements are interesting and esoteric. One, in fact, is a total mystery, and the developers AREN’T talking. Ultimately what’s not to love in a game that gives an achievement for a huge number of face plants at high speed? (Which, incidentally, frequently leads to new discoveries.)\n\nA great game to be played with or without external controls, for a minute or for hours. Portrait mode is suggested, though you’ll need familiarity with the menus first, as it seems to have been an afterthought. Perhaps not the greatest of its type, but a darn good one that I certainly suggest, especially if it’s still so cheap. Hope to see you there.","March 28, 2015","true","22.0"," 51 of 56 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","51","56","2","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/253290/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","Fotonica is endless runner perfection in a most blissful series of beautifully crafted lightspeed stages, the warm vector lines and hallucinatory neon waves that illuminate from the sides of your vision like some kind of adrenaline induced euphoria. When you finally reach that zen-like state of focus things begin to speed up even more, the colors and movements are intensified for a wonderful audiovisual overload that sets it apart from the rest.\n\nThe music comes from a plethora of incredible artists (including the very talented Baiyon[baiyon.com] of Pixeljunk Eden fame) and ranges from shimmering, gorgeous soundscapes to heavy pulsing electric rhythms with infectious bass and they compliment the array of different environments and backdrops you'll encounter between each visually shifting level perfectly. The minimalistic yet abstractly complex interconnected series of lines in the classic vector style needs to be seen in motion and lends itself to the very reminiscent feel from the Death Star trench run section of Atari's Star Wars that most endless runners give.\n\nFotonica moves away from the single boring stretch of hallway players may be used to from other games in the endless runner genre, instead giving us varying heights of platforms. The player character runs at increasingly faster speeds with the holding of a single button, and releasing causes you to bound into the air and leap over gaps in the broken pathways before you. Aiming and timing your landings is the key to success, and overshooting your jump by even the slightest is enough to ruin a good run. The longer you keep your momentum up the faster you go, and the more complex these breaks and gaps in the trail become as they stretch out to seemingly infinite lengths.\n\nThe game features two main singleplayer modes including Arcade and Endless as well as a split screen Versus mode that makes for some great living room multiplayer. Arcade mode features eight stages of increasing difficulty as shorter, more rapid platforms are thrown at you forcing you to think on your feet. As you fly and leap past these deadly gaps you collect various score increasing orbs tucked in hard to land spots, spicing up how score chasers will approach the leaderboards. Endless mode is just as it sounds, giving players who have already mastered the several Arcade mode stages and want to put their endurance to the ultimate test.\n\nYou'll run again and again, jumping from cascading catwalks to other layers of psychedelically colored platforms only to watch your arms flail in terror as you plummet to your death. When you get back up again and check your score against your friends, you'll run again with reinvigorated motivation and eventually find that ultimate "Runner's High". From the incredibly creative minds behind MirrorMoonEP, Fotonica further proves that Santa Ragione has the potential to craft unique and memorable experiences in a multitude of genres and stands as what is most likely my "Runner of the Year" due to attractive, straightforward and addictive design.","November 27, 2014","true","10.1"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","45","51","0","2"

The artistry and style expressed in these moments is at times stunning and always stimulating, mesmerizing and drastically different in tone and setting in each passing scene. Minimal sound design serves as a constant reminder of the speed and velocity with which you move, being both an invigorating source of feedback when you successfully land a jump and make it to top speed, and a sudden jolt should you miss and slam headfirst into a platform before beginning a fall into nothingness. Being in this world is in itself something of a wonder and a thrill, though one that constantly wishes to throw you out before you have a chance to behold all there is to see.\n\nControlled via a single button, Fotonica is an runner which compensates for its simplicity in design with challenging, extremely fast, multilayered levels with a very small margin for error. Finding the best paths and secrets within each level is an interesting and engaging element that extends your goal beyond the omnipresent fear of missing a jump and falling to your doom, and an aspect I would have liked to have seen more focus put upon besides effecting your score. Successfully making your way through these levels is invigorating, but more often than not it falls into punishing loops of trial and error, punctuated by occasional success as you incrementally make your way through levels memorizing your path and planning your jumps to the exact second.\n\nIt’s a challenge that’s certainly passable in time, but one which rarely feels fair. The monochromatic environments are often difficult to tell apart from the background and the draw distance painfully short, making judging distance and timing jumps frustrating and tedious. With how exact jumps tend to need to be to land, not having enough input to make the call of when to jump is a huge detriment to the experience.\n\nSplit into just ten very short levels (though it will of course take you longer to clear them at first), Fotonica feels like almost a prelude to a larger game. Its lacking so much content as to feel empty and possibly even unfinished, leaving me wondering what I was intended to do after completing them all in only an hour or so. The endless mode is a rather disappointing and throwaway addition, ditching the involved multifaceted platform layouts from the arcade mode for bland, single platforms which I grew tired of traversing almost immediately.\n\nThe multiplayer mode actually fixes my biggest issue with the game, that being its relentlessly punishing nature, by only setting you back a short way when you fail and then making the challenge about being the first to get to the end instead of memorizing and clearing levels on your own. Sadly it’s local only, and I doubt many will sit down with a group to spend much time with it, but the one button control scheme does mean there’s no issue of not having enough controllers as everyone can play with a single keyboard (or gamepad, if you’re dexterous enough).\n\nI have a lot of problems with Fotonica, ones which fundamentally hurt my enjoyment of the game and have me incredibly confused on if I believe it’s worth anyone’s time to bother with. In that same instance though I’m reminded of just how artistic and imaginative running through these levels are, which caused me to continue playing far after I stopped having any great amount of “fun”. Is visual design alone enough to carry the game? I’m not sure I could give you a sincere answer, but even now I’m finding myself drawn back into it, no matter how loudly every other aspect is telling me to leave.\n\nFull disclosure: FOTONICA was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the developer.

The graphics remind me of what a child of the early 80's would think future video games would prolly look like. The Music is very good. Jumping from platforms can be exciting as your characters arms move around like he/she/it is trying to balance themselves. But with all that said, the biggest problem this game has is that it gets boring very fast. Now let me explain this.\n\nBasically you are running along a narrow path the entire time, gaining speed, jumping onto platforms, through Trippy retro computer like enviroments. It looks nice. But the problem i have is with how the game plays. You only press ONE BUTTON the entire time, holding the button(Any button) down makes your character speed up, and letting go of the button makes him jump. The longer you go without pressing "the button" , the longer your character will glide through the air untill they reach the ground. If in the air, you decide to push down on "the button", your character will promptly rush to the ground. Your Main objective is to run and jump onto different plaforms, all the while maintaining your speed and not running off any of the platforms, for that will restart the level. This type of game design works well , and the game functions as intented, but it gets old sooooo fast. Any normal person would get bored very quickly, unless your a 15-20 year old stoner that likes "trippy visuals" and listening to Tangerine Dream. Fotonica is interesting and i commend the devs for making something unique, but i feel the average person would get bored very quickly. and it's asking price of $10 is way to steep for the lack of gameplay and limited amount of levels.\n\nIf you like to pay daily visits to your local  independent pharmaceutical salesman for the latest in pizza toppings, then this game might be for you, but for everyone else , i wouldnt recommend this it.","March 5, 2015","false","1.0"," 30 of 47 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","30","47","6","5"

It strives to capture the same sense of speed and momentum while remaining visceral and intuitive by simplifying it's controls to a single button.\n\nFOTONICA thrives of the complexity of its levels and the best parts of its gameplay only emerge at higher difficulties. When traveling at incredible speeds with multiple paths ahead of you the game loses the feeling of platforming and truly starts to emulate the euphoric velocity fueled fever dream it sells its self as.\n\nThe elegant fluidity of its single button controls shine in these moments, allowing you interact with the game in a responsive and satisfying  way while remaining immersed. Unless you have on the input delay. Seriously, the input delay "interferes" with the experience in the same way a frying pan to the back of the head "interferes" with meditation.\n\nSo far I only have a little more than an hour clocked in the game, so I can't speak to its continued ability to induce the much sought after state of abstract techno zen.

Doesn't matter how many times you'll play it, you will always find at least some enjoyment out of running and jumping over an infinite void.\n\nDon't get me started on the art, which is the reason I first picked up the game; it's constant eye-candy for those who like dark, ethereal, psychedelic kind of art. I've always been fond of the use of simple geometry on games and art, and this game in special has amazing bright, sharp figures creating amazing fictional landscapes that almost induce vertigo on each jump.\n\nThe music is pretty fitting, and has a relaxing feel to it that goes perfect with the game. Some games fail to create a good visual-auditive connection, but this one in special is an exception on that. It has simple entrancing melodies that go perfect with the ambience the game tries to create.\n\nThe game is also pretty cheap, paying $10 or ($5 if the game is on sell) is pretty worth it, I'd rather love to be able to support the developers in more ways that just buying their game.\n\nOn the grimey side, it can sometimes get a bit repetitive, but you still gotta play quite the constant hours before you memorize all there is to memorize and learn in this game.\n\nIf you're wanting to play something casual during your free time, FOTONICA will bring you hours of learning how to jump through surreal landscapes, and will take your breath away everytime you fail that one jump you needed before finishing the level. You can even stay still, look around the level, and will still enjoy the art and music of the game.\n\n8.5/10 - Unique & Hypnotizing.","January 17, 2015","true","22.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

I've already beaten it. I know that there are more difficulty levels and an endless mode, but I somehow expected a little more from a game that normally asks $10.\n\nIt has a nice visual aesthetic, but at times only being able to see the outlines of objects can make it a pain in the ass to gauge whether you're about to jump onto or into the side of a pathway, or just straight into a hole.\nThe music has no inherent flaws, but the tracks are all short and have obvious points at which they loop that you'll undoubtedly begin to notice quickly as you are forced to restart time and time again, making the levels drag on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KliPeH/recommended/253290/","KliPeH","KliPeH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KliPeH/","115 products in account","TL;DR: I give it credit for being a good time waster, but for the amount of content FOTONICA has on PC, buying it for $10 is not justifiable. I bought it for $5 and I still regret it. I played it for ~40 minutes and got tired of it; if you're up for time wasting, get it on your mobile device and play it while you wait for a bus or take a dump. Otherwise, there are many other great games you can buy with 10 bucks or less.\n\nVisuals: 8/10 FOTONICA has an arcade-y, crisp feeling to its vector-style graphics. It is minimalistic, yet somehow still fairly elaborate when it comes to the track building, the only thing that is going attract your attention. Speaking of the track, it is outlined in white (golden-yellow when you reach a certain speed) but is not colored in anything but black, which is a bit confusing to say the least. Fear not, for once you die enough you will no longer be confused by these seemingly semi-translucent blocks. In later levels it becomes a bit tougher, when the game starts to spawn different, more complex kinds of "terrain". It's not an issue that would stop me from playing, but I would love to see the track change color or be colored differently from the background.\n\nControls and UI: 7/10 The game doesn't use a complex control scheme by any means. You will only use 3 buttons: any button to jump (I will talk about this in the 'Mechanics' section), M to mute and R to restart the level. You are able to invert the controls if you so desire (hold button to jump instead of hold to run). FOTONICA doesn't require many graphical options since it's very minimalistic, and most of them can be changed in a separate launcher. Navigating the menus is a bit weird with the keyboard, but you can navigate them with the mouse as well, so no problems here.\n\nMusic and SFX: 5/10 While this is a completely subjective argument, I did not enjoy the soundtracks FOTONICA offered.\nSure, I might not be into that kind of music, but I only heard the same 1-2 soundtracks for the 5-6 levels I got to play. No, they didn't SOUND the same, they were literally the only two songs I saw playing throughout the game (the name of the song is displayed at the beginning of each level). I do appreciate the effort put into creating them, hence giving Music a 5/10. The sound effects in general were decent, nothing too special.\n\nMechanics: 4/10 In my opinion, this is the biggest downfall of this game; you either really like it, or you don't. There's no in-between. As you can see, I didn't. Basically, you hold a button to run, and you release it to jump when necessary. It's all very very simple, and I feel like people who aren't looking for depth will enjoy it a lot. It takes a short while to get used to the jumping, but once you figure it out it becomes great fun to play...\nUNTIL you realize the levels aren't randomly generated, and there are only 11 of them.\nThis was a major turn-off for me personally. There is a limit to how many times you can fail/beat a certain level and not get bored. The game puts an emphasis on score-beating and being on the leaderboards, which I don't really like. If you're a score-attacker, FOTONICA is most likely your kind of game. People really like it because\na) you can play it with the Oculus Rift, and\nb) you can play the game locally with your friends.\nIf you don't have a VR headset, friends, or score-attacking tendencies, you will probably find this game shallow, repetitive and boring.\n\nReplayability: 5/10 As already mentioned in the Mechanics section above, the levels aren't randomly generated and there aren't many of them to begin with, a thing that significantly shortens the amount of time it'll take you to get tired of the game. There's barely any depth to the mechanics or the terrain itself, and there's no storyline to support them and make you want to continue playing. It takes a while to get used to the controls, and after that short period of time beating levels becomes lots of fun, hence the 5/10. Other than that, if you don't score-attack, you don't have much to do; you either fail a lot and replay the same levels to beat the game, or you quit trying. Playing (local only) co-op adds to the Replayability aspect, but then again, you're just playing on the same levels with another player.\n\n\nEDIT - 24/11/2014   Removed the Storyline aspect - I gotta be honest: I'm not great at story-telling, or explaining how a story in a game goes. I rather let people interpret it in their own way and decide whether or not they want to take it into consideration when playing a game, than mislead people with wrong facts or a wrong interpretation of the story and risk preventing them from buying an otherwise good game. Besides being a (fairly) subjective point, most Indie games don't have a storyline and so I decided to remove this aspect from future reviews, including this one. If the story is really good (or really bad) I will probably mention it somewhere else (possibly in the Mechanics section) in my review.\nAdded the Replayability aspect - when I play games, I usually look for replayability and not for a good story-line or great mechanics, so I decided to add this point to my future reviews, including this one.\nSide-note - Steam says I played FOTONICA for 4 hours, yet I said that I played it for ~40 minutes in my review. That is because I was idling for trading-cards since I didn't get my worth out of the game. I did, in fact, only play for a short while, and then just let it run in the background to get my cards and then deleted it from my library.\nWording.\nEDIT - 07/01/2015   Moved the TL;DR bit to the top - I realize some people don't feel like reading the whole review and just want to read my conclusion about the game right away. Reading the TL;DR first will probably help understand my point faster.","November 15, 2014","false","4.4"," 26 of 45 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","26","45","0","0"

I find the one button implementation kinda unique - it's not like you're non stop running and you have the one button for your jump, no no no - you run while holding the button, you jump by releasing the button, and you fall down faster, if you press the button while airborne. It works for almost any key on your keyboard, and there is even achievement to use different keys, while completing a level. It was a little bit counter intuitive for me at the start, nothing a few deaths couldn't fix :p and also produces fun sounds, if you decide for whatever reason to start mashing a key!\nI couldn't find any background story on who is running and why are they doing it, but I did notice that the gender of your runner alternates ( or maybe I'm delusional) from track to track (although I've only played the first 3 for now) going female male female. I was able to tell that ( or delude myself of it) just based on the moans your character does, while jumping. Now beware - the rhythmic music and the moaning can sound totally out of context to a person who has no idea, what are you doing on your pc :p In light of that fact, the game does offer you a one button (Q) instant exit with no confirmation required, for your plausible deniability!\nThe biggest plus for me though, are the online leaderboards - you have 5 min spare time and you can go for a couple runs ( the first 3 maps I've played don't take long) to beat that pesky neighbor, who topped your highscore once again :p\nThere is a local multiplayer, but I haven't had the pleasure to test that one yet.\nThe price tag might seem just a big high, in light of recent (Halloween) and upcoming (Xmas) sales, but if you're just a little bit competitive, I'm sure, you'll get your money's worth out of this game!\n\nTL:DR you want to watch me fail or see the gameplay, check out my overview video :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=339063934\n","November 8, 2014","true","4.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

At times mesmerizing and addicting, other times fustrating and simple.

The floaty jump takes sometime to get used to as well, but in the end of it all when it clicks there does seem to be a method to these strange design choices.

The graphical style is cool but the default render option of “vector” causes the screen to be blurry, better to choose complex.\n\nFor the game to be fun you have to go fast, and yet this makes the game much harder.  I put the game on easy difficulty, which slowed everything down to the point of causing the game to be a jumper instead of a runner.  It literally felt slower than Mario Bros.

Only get this if it's on sale.\nThat said, this game has a sort of intoxicating quality to it, something that most AAA titles seem to lack, and a lot of indie games with similar mechanics (such as Super Hexagon and Boson X, just to name a few), carry quite frequently. Regardless of that, though, Fotonica still feels unique because of its artstyle, suprisingly innovative one-button gameplay, calming soundtrack, and beautiful, diverse levels. While all these things have been done before, none of them have been incorporated into one game so expertly. Fotonica deserves your time if not only for that.\nThere are issues with the game, though; most notably how the artstyle interferes with your ablility to see platforms at a distance when playing on a smaller resolution monitor, and other things of that nature that really can't be helped, but said things never bothed me, even if they did end up hindering my experience. That was because the game itself, in combination with all of the elements that I listed previously, ended up being so relaxing that I just stopped caring about any objective flaws I might have come across. Maybe that's because the flaws just weren't very significant, but regardless of whether or not that's true, this game gets two thumbs up from me.\nWhether you're a casual or hardcore gamer, I strongly recommend Fotonica if you feel like destressing or just having some fun with an artsy little experience.","June 14, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I produce electronic music, so I always pay attention to sound-design. Most of the games I play have either no sound-design like Super Hexagon, or a really awful one, like Hero Siege and those mp3-quality swords and voices.\n\nAnd here, it's clean as hell, I was very surprised and very delighted ! Voices and shouts, breathing, motion, it's very, very precise and well-designed. And music is so good. I like this abstract, but heartful modern design.\n\nI went thru the first levels, nothing difficult, you run, you jump, with one button. It's not about the gameplay and the difficulty. You have to find the perfect timing (and you can take 4-5 different paths every level) for catch all the red circles and reach 10k points. You'll access next level without 10k points, and even if I think it's a mistake (at least for me), it keeps the game doable for somebody who don't want to play the same level for hours.\n\nDefault difficulty is 2, then 3 and 4, I'd have like 5, definitely.\n\nI think this game is about the pleasure of execute each jump with perfect timing, not for the performance or achievement but for feeling it. Feel the air, the gravity, and the overall quality of the way you move, of the code they wrote.\n\nIf you want a challenge and only this, it's not for you, you'll beat the game, you'll say it's easy and it isn't worth 9 bucks. I  think I would not buy it this price, since I'm more skill-side. But for 1,70 Euro, I have fresh air in my hands, thru a unique game.\n\nABOUT GAMEPLAY :\n\nI read a review about the fact that you only have to push one key for running, and release it for jumping. And the fact it's boring, and it gets old really fast. In fact, you can change the behaviour of the game and frankly, it really changes the way you play. Default is touch/release gameplay, but in the options, you can change it : it will run automatically, and it will jump when you press.\n\nNEGATIVE :\n\n- Each time the jump ends and I'm back on track, it's difficult to see what's in front of me. It's really immersive, yes, for the better and the worse. I just have to stick with it and to get used to it but still, I consider this is annoying.\n\n- Why always black background and white/gold people and road ? It gets visually boring really fast. I think one can maintain this minimalist look all the game, and still can make it more interesting for the player. It's kinda weird I'm saying this because I actually enjoy the overall look of this game, but... I dunno, I feel it deserves more spice.\n\nSo, I probably won't play more than a few minutes between two games. Or maybe I'll take a day for exploring it in depth and see what lies there. But definitely, for 9 bucks, it lacks something. Say, I would have loved a voice from time to time, since the shouts of the runner are so greatly designed. Or random events. Or something which breaks the rythm you take after one or two levels. Beginning/Straight-up level/End. Not so much.\n\nIf you're still there (I don't write short reviews, sorry), should you buy this game ?\n\nYes. Even for 9 bucks : the last game I played with this amazing feeling of sound-design clarity was Skyrim, one year ago. So even if you don't like the game, see it like a gesture for an amazing sound-designer.","July 30, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What should be a challenge of reflexes becomes instead a challenge of memorization of level maps and tolerance for constantly restarting a level. The graphical style, while interesting, and pleasantly reminiscent of old-school vector graphics ames, proves ultimately distracting and adds the additional challenge of perceiving edges that must be jumped from onrushing distracting decor, causing the memorization instead of reflexes issue.

For the multiplayer mode, both players need to hold down the button for a couple seconds for the match to start. we have probably spent more time holding the button down just until the bar is about to fill up and then letting go than actually playing the game. if you got an evening to kill i'd recommend seeing whether guerilla toss is playing in your town. if they are not, then i'd recommend playing fotonica. this game embodies the spirit of guerilla toss because the name is written in all-caps and therefore sounds like it is being shouted by kassie carlson. we love you kassie.","May 19","true","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has one button control - hold to run, release to jump, hold again to descend quicker. The game quickly goes from minimalistic to lacking when you realize there are only eight stages, and the imposing four difficulties presented only affect the speed. As the game progresses, the gameplay becomes increasingly frustrating, relying on memorizing the stage instead of reacting as you go, as one mistake near the end of the course can easily cost you the run.\nThe graphics aim for a retro vector screen look, but fall short because of lack of proper anti-aliasing - the wireframe lines are heavily pixelated and flickering. A clean look can only be achieved in "Solid" graphics mode, where white polygons are filled in, but even then the shaky particle effects appear somewhat out of place. Although the framerate seems to be uncapped, the camera movement appears jittery at times, especially at lower speed, further detracting from the game's promise of the experience of continous fluid movement.\nThe music is certainly not of bad quality, but quickly forgettable.\n\nIf you want this game, get it for your smartphone. It's good for short sessions, but not engaging enough for extended play.","May 31","false","6.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So I guess I should say during the Inaugural Lunar Sale. Sales aside, I was immediately pulled in by FOTONICA’s really interesting wireframe style, and impressive sense of speed!\n\nThe game’s details ask you if you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to run at 140mph. The answer to that question is: “Not until right now.”\n\nThe game was, and still is, on sale for a whopping $1.99. So I immediately jumped at the opportunity to play this game. And I have to say I love it. I’m not much of an endless runner kind of guy. But the first person perspective, interesting graphics, and break-neck speed were really fun to experience.\n\nAlso this game is hart wie Scheiße. one wrong move and you have to start the entire run over… Also no check points.\n\nI was playing this game about a week ago, and well… a game hasn’t made my palms sweat in a really long time. Not even Dark Souls. Apparently I was way into it. Sweaty palms, weak knees, heavy arms, sans Mom’s Spaghetti.\n\nI really enjoy this game’s sense of speed, and the challenge of running through a new level trying to figure out the timing you need to pull off in order to advance is quite enjoyable. For the most part.\n\nMost of my play time was probably stuck on one or two levels. THEY’RE SO DAMN HARD! I went into this game expecting it to be relaxing! Don’t get me wrong, it can be for sure… But, damn it’s rough sometimes. You really have to be on point to get through most of the game. Jump to early, miss the platform. Jump too late, hit the platform. Either way you’re falling into an endless void longingly reaching out to accept you.\n\nThe dream like sound design, and calming music betray that fact that this game will really screw you over if you’re not paying attention.\n\nFun Fact: your decreasing altitude is inversely proportional to your blood pressure.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my time with FOTONICA and would recommend it to anyone that really enjoys endless runner type games. However, the game is normally listed at $10! Which I feel is a little too expensive for the price, considering what is available. There are about eight or nine arcade levels, and three endless levels. All of which can be played on a variety of difficulties.\n\nInterestingly you can also play with up to four other people, which is nice! But I don’t think that’s enough content to justify the $10 price. I would say it’s more along the $5 to $7 range.\n\nSo just keep that in mind. I would say if you’re interested, and like endless runners definitely give this one a chance. It’s super cool, well made, and pretty trippy, yo.\n\nLike this review?

(Thankfully it's not actually dubstep, as another reviewer has erroniously written.) The controls are responsive and engaging as well, and suit the sort of first-person-unicorn-dash gameplay that the designers chose.\nAnd that brings me to my one major gripe. Unlike Rez, whose arcade shooter game style was challenging and varied, FOTONICA is pretty much a one-trick pony. The single-button control scheme (somehow incompatible with the XB360 controller - whether through laziness or evil) means that each level amounts to repetitive trial and error with the ultimate goal of course memorization. This in turn means that in order to progress in the game, you will need to know each level so well that the element of urgency and adrenaline (an area where this game excels) is pretty much lost. Nor are the collectibles an entertaining distraction; there is only one variety, an inornate red sphere. This, plus the lack of checkpoints and the game's tendency to put the most difficult obstacles at the end of each course, is why I can't recommend this game.\n\nTL:DR?\nIt's not completely non-fun, but probably fun and non-fun in equal measure.","November 7, 2014","false","3.0"," 23 of 52 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","23","52","0","0"

The gameplay mechanics are based on holding and releasing a single button. By holding it, you run foward and gain velocity (on the ground) or dash down (in the air) Releasing the button makes you jump.\n\nI had my doubts when I was introduced to this concept, but it works pretty well: The overall steering is responsive, and even with a single button, you feel in control of your character´s movement. If you fall down, it´s your fault most of the time, not the game´s.\n\nThe Levels\n\nThere is a total of ~10 levels in the game, each one playable in one of the 4 difficulties. The game is not unforgiving, and coming to a complete stop due to a collision doesn´t necessarily force you to restart the level. Your main objective is to get as fast as possible and collect as many red dots as you can in every level.\n\nIf you just run through every level to unlock the next one, the game will take ~1 hour. But the real satisfaction comes by trying out new routes, getting a new highscore and optimizing your "finger´s performance".\n\nEvery level is split into 3-4 "stacked" possible "floors", between which you can switch as you run. Split-second reflexes and good hand-eye coordination are reqiured to reach some harder (and more rewarding) passages.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe Soundtrack was created by 2 artists, and it fits perfectly in the game´s atmosphere; (mostly "Minimal"). Ambient sounds like moans, footsteps, and the characters breathing make the experience perfect. You can almost feel the wind in your face then you propel yourself into the air\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphic style is very interesting, the devs have created a surreal and touching world with basically only 3 colors (white, gold, blue) The surroundings are diverse and in 3D, reaching from mountain paths to appartments, churches and so on.\n\n\n>>Bought it for: 1.74$ (Sale)\n>>Traditional Rating: 8/10\n>>Price-related Rating: 11/10\n>> Estimated in-game-time: 2-10 hours\n\n>>>>Recommended?\n\nIf you like Mirrors Edge, Fast-paced games, or a simple yet beautiful art style, you can´t go wrong with this game.\n\n===Please leave a rating.

The visuals are minimalistic but convey all you need to know in the game, and the first person perspective can make the game quite exhilarating at times (which may be a problem for those suffering with motion sickness). Coupled with the fitting electronic soundtrack, this is a great game for fans of platformers or those who want to experience something new in the genre.","February 5, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What initially grabbed my attention was the minimalist art style. I’m generally a fan of anything that can look cool by using minimal amounts of colors or contours and Fotonica is about as simple as it gets. The bold black and white (and sometimes yellow) vector graphics invoke a bygone age, where the smooth lines of the Vectrex were a serious competitor to the blocky raster graphics.\n\nBut beyond that initial wow-factor, I’m not sure if I can fully recommend the game based on its gameplay alone. In the grand tradition of games where you have to run around in a straight line as fast as possible, Fotonica’s gameplay boils down to a single button. You either press it to accelerate, or you let it go to jump. In essence, you’re playing an old school 2D platformer from a first-person perspective.\n\nWhile this idea does have its charm, I feel that the game has a lot of somewhat missed potential there. The stages feature some verticality and multiple levels, which becomes apparent when increasing the difficulty which basically means you’re going to be running faster. Thus, certain paths you’ve carved out for yourself on lower levels aren’t feasible anymore. But other than jumping from platform to platform, there’s no challenge in there. If I may be so bold as to compare this to another very popular runner game, Temple Run, you’ll notice that that game features a variety of hazards, direction changes and power-ups. All of this is absent in Fotonica, you merely run in a straight line and avoid falling off the path.\n\nOne goal that Fotinica definitely manages to achieve is that it provides the player with a sense of speed. Running around in first-person will always be a more dramatic thing than having the camera float behind the character or racing car. It’s just a shame that this aspect, along with the gorgeous art style, are underserved by the minimal gameplay it has on offer, along with the very few levels. 8 regular levels and 3 infinite ones. There’s room for replayability there because of the difficulty levels, but overall I still feel that there aren’t enough levels, because the arcade levels are all fairly short.\n\nI guess I’ll give a mild recommendation for the title, since I like the central concept and the art style a lot, however with the caveat that I don’t think that Fotonica is worth the full price of $10 or €9. I had the good fortune of buying it during a Humble Bundle, which is why I’m more lenient in this regard.","August 20, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its very simple and fun, i found it to be a very relaxing game to play (if you play on easy) but on hard modes it turns from relaxing into very extreme which is a good thing. Having a balance between relaxing and extreme is a good thing to do. There are only a handful of levels and there is a endless mode which never actually ends, and a multiplayer mode but its only local multiplayer meaning you would need to hook up another keyboard. Like i said a simple sort of parkour game and i do think its worth it but not at this price. Currently the price as i make this review is 10$ which is a little extreme for such a simple game, but once it goes on sale or they lower the price i suggest you buy it. The rating i give the game is a 6/10 "a simple and very well made game but it costs to much at this time."\n","November 19, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Played more than just 40 mins, but my Steam doesn't always like to sync for some reason.\n\nTHE GOOD\n-Incredibly immersive and intuitive - literally two controls "On" and "Off". Run or Don't.\n-Landing is simple, and jumping is easy to judge (see the bad for a brief comment on this, though)\n-Music is appropriate and helps keep ya going.\n-You know when, in Mirror's Edge, you'd get a really good string of perfect jumps and mounts, gaining speed and flowing through the world in one of the best gameplay experiences ever? Remember how rarely that happened and how often it was unpleasantly cut off? Well, the only way it happens here is if you screw up or fall into oblivion.\n\nTHE BAD\n-when you go Super Saiyan and the screen goes ♥♥♥♥ Yellow, the sudden speedup pushes you forwards, and can make you 'misjudge' your landing. This can be day-ruining in frustration.\n-The 'dots' or Pacman Pills or whatever they are - the fastest route doesn't follow this and is a tad arbitrary, though enjoyable most of the time.\n-Making the sides of a linear path wobbly to make the map drastically different does not a cake make.\n-bit more variance? Maybe some aesthetic variance? Sure, the look is good, but a bit of something more 'out there' might be worth considering in the future.\n-collision with ledges can be hard to judge at times. Whether or not you automatically mount is sometimes just 'up in the air'.\n\nI am big on first-person parkour and this simplifies everything to core principles, and then turns the simple result to 11. Thoroughly enjoyable and worth playing. 6-6.5/10. Would pay full price.","June 28, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can get a little frustrating at times but that is all in the fun.\nFOTONICA is definitly a game that is easy to play but hard to master, it can many trials just to get all of the timings for every jump just right, or who knows you might just get lucky and get through on your first try.\n\n10/10 would hit my face on each track again","April 5","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
