"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keb47/recommended/322170/","keb47","Keboozle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keb47/","132 products in account","Another fun and addicting game. BE WARNED, this game may make you rage.\n\nFirst off, jumping. For PC version, you press the space bar, up button or the left mouse. On phone, just tap. It's harder on mobile device than PC, actually. The point of this game is passing each level by jumping and flying over objects. Try not to touch the blocks and other in-coming objects or you have to restart from the beginning and that's the main thing which makes you rage.\n\nFirst levels to start off are the easiests out of all levels, the lasts ones are insanely hard. "Demon" levels. You practically have to jump over in-coming objects, fly pass them to get through. 1st level easiest, 2nd level easier, 3rd level easy, 4th level not so easy and so on. The levels get more complex and more objects and have to dodge, it's hard to concentrate while you are disturbed and you lose control and touch a block, you restart and rage. There types of vehicles or forms you can change into from travelling through specific portals:\n\nCube form (which is the normal form),\n\nShip form (where you fly in the air dodging objects),\n\nBall form (which can travel in a vertical direction, defies gravity),\n\nUFO form (hopping in the air, also dodging objects. But they perform little jumps in the air),\n\nWave form (travels in a diagonally on a upward or downward position).\n\n*NEW* Robot form (It is the form first introduced in the level Geometrical Dominator. This form walks on 2 legs and has the ability to jump 4 times it's height by variation of holding on to the keyboard key or the your device)\n\nWhat is cool about this game is that throughout the levels, the backgrounds changes colour which grabs your attention, the patterns in the background and the music. Each levels have their own music. Without the music, you can't concentrate so you have to listen to the music while you play. The graphics are amazing in this game and this game can run on any laptops or PC.\n\nOn the moble version, there is a free version and a version where you have to buy it. With Steam, you need to purchase it. If you purchases the full version, you unlock more levels, features and icons. There are special icons if you purchase from Steam and there are "Companion Cube" and the Steam logo. Purchasing the full version, you have a feature where you can create your own level, download other levels by user created, rate levels etc.\n\nSo basically the concept of the game is:\n\n1. Jump\n2. Die\n3. Restart level\n4. Rage\n5. Repeat step 1, step 2, step 3 and step 4\n\nSo far, this game is very fun, addicting and makes you slam your keyboard or throw your phone on the floor. But, I've warned you. So be careful.\n\n8/10\n\nMORE REVIEWS ON OUR CURATOR PAGE","August 7, 2015","true","37.4"," 235 of 256 people (92%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","92","235","256","65","14"

If you've played the game, you've most likely passed it. (if not, you're just a n00b m8)\nBack On Track - This level kinda gets hard sometimes, just like life (and your mom (yes))\nPolargeist - First non-very easy level, but still not really that difficult. From this point on you really start to appreciate the music in the levels.\nDry Out - OH MY GOD I AM UPSIDE DOWN\nBase After Base - wubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwub\nCan't Let Go - This is where the game really gets difficult. I almost refunded the game because I couldn't pass it, but I did, and I'm glad I did it :P\nJumper - The music reminds me of a NES-type game. Sounds really good.\nTime Machine - TRIPLE SPIKES WATCH OUT FOR DEM TRIPLE SPIKES\nCycles - Remember that mobile game Gravity Guy? Yeah, that.\nxStep - This is the level that inspired so many people to make a level called yStep. A+ for originality.\nClutterfunk - A big SCREW YOU RIGHT IN THE BUNS for those who think "Hey, I'm actually getting kinda good at the game!"\nTheory of Everything - Just watch the trailer.\nElectroman Adventures - MEGA MAAAAN\nClubstep - If you try this level, you are either very brave or very stupid. (no, but seriously those flying parts are a pain in the buns...)\nElectrodynamix - HOLY CRAP I AM GOING SO FAST BUT THE MUSIC IS AMAZING WHAT IS GOING ON WHAT IS LIFE 42\nHexagon Force - For those with split personalities.\nBlast Processing - The level that introduces the hell on earth: the Wave.\nTheory of Everything 2 - More difficulty! Because that's fun... right? (at least the music is amazing)\nGeometrical Dominator - If Geometry Dash was an anime\nDeadlocked - FINALLY FREAKIN BEAT IT :D\nFingerbang - The next level. RubRub is seriously going to "Fingerbang" our bumholes with this level if you know what I mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nBut seriously. Buy this game.

I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to "Upgrade" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 freaking dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one fore effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.0!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good *insert lennyface here*.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD :v\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash fan. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN","December 23, 2014","true","785.5"," 80 of 88 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","80","88","2","6"

One button performs an action such as a jump, flip, or other momentum change. The game is either having the button down or not down, and performing this task correctly takes you to the end of the level where you can celebrate your victory as you see fit. Me I like a simple smile and approving nod, but I'm a class act that prefers to hide his emotions in the name of stoic professionalism, even in my moments alone.\n\nThis game is a grown up version of The Impossible Game who filled out quite nicely and gets much deserved attention. The look of the game can change substantially from level to level, particularly for the user submitted content, as can the music, but it is often colorful, minimalist, and very stimulating. There's a lot of great music tracks, and the game levels often use those tracks to determine when buttons are pressed yielding a feeling not unlike dancing, but on one button, which yields a pure sensation of rhythm.\n\nThere is a practice mode which is the preferred method for learning a level as death does not send you back to the beginning, and you can practice many areas repeatedly, although the real game is finishing real mode where you do the whole level in one shot.\n\nAchievements in this game are linked directly to customization options for your beautiful little shape man. Coins are collected in level and linked to achievements, and the unlocking of additional levels. They are a challenge though, requiring rerouting through a level to pick up. Once collected the stage must be finished, so it seemed prudent to leave these until a level was well learned, unless you learned the level in the way through picking them up.\n\nThere is a massive amount of content for this game thanks to the user friendly creation tools in a variety of difficulties from, "I tried everything to fail and couldn't, but what a trippy roller coaster" easy to "I failed a thousand times on practice mode and desperately searched for something near me cheap enough to break" hard. There's a reason they're called demons, and it requires dedication to slay one. Remember that this game is not your friend.\n\nGeometry dates back to the 6th century BC, and the first identified arithmetic related relic listed Pythagorean triples arising from geometry. The term dash can refer to a small quantity, typically when cooking. This random fact is brought to you in part by dashes from the Original Curator Group.","January 25","true","16.7"," 64 of 76 people (84%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","84","64","76","18","3"

First of all, for all of you wondering what kind of game is this, let's just say it's a The Impossible Game clone. Now, it might be a clone, but it's a damn good one. Gameplay is a lot more varied, there's a whole bunch of levels, great music, level editor and online level sharing(now with the ability to put custom music in your levels from Newgrounds!) , lots of unlockables and lots of dying. Yea, even though the controls are as simple as they can get, this isn't an easy game by any means, but if you are ready to accept the challenge, you're gonna enjoy this game a lot. The devs are amazing and they make constant free updates and keep adding new stuff into this alerady amazing game. I kind of wish they had added Steam leaderboards into this version, even though the game does have its own leaderboards for those who make Robtop account. Btw, currently there are some performance issues when playing the game in windowed mode, but besides that, this is a good port. All in all, I will give this game a 9/10, a must have have for all the fans of hardcore games.","January 22, 2015","true","94.1"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","32","34","2","0"

The genius of this game lies in its simplicity. If you're ADHD, emotionally  depleted, spiritually troubled, or just looking to unwind, Geometry Dash is one of the best panaceas for your psychic wounds. (I recommend muting the in-game soundtrack and playing your own.)\n\nSome may warn you of the "difficulty" of the game, and while it may be hard to master, there is nothing to fear because the satisfaction of winning trumps (hate you Trump) all frustrations. Keep in mind, however, that Geometry Dash will hold you in its vice-like grip of addiction. In fact, it is so addicting that you will shamefully fail to surface in search of food.

Back then it was called Geometry Jump, I loved it. i thought it was awesome, About a few months after the game got big updates. It helped getting the game ready for awesomeness! Any way, It is now December 24th 2014 (almost 2015 yay!) And it's been out on steam for about two days. It's great, I used to play this game on Blue stacks (Android emulator for PC and MAC) And it always lagged was really painful to use (blah blah blah). This game came out on steam, was amazing. No lag, no nothing (that is if, you have a computer that can run this game at a fair FPS) I loved it, I've been making tons of levels. But since the biggest update ever (Update 1.9) came out a few months ago, It's just been the best experience ever. You get custom music,  3D bricks and all that jazz.\n\nNow, YES I DO RECCOMEND THIS GAME!!\nNo, this game isn't dead, The creator Robert Topala (Rob Top) constantly updates the game!\n\nHope this was a helpful review! :D","December 24, 2014","true","726.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

It is a fast paced arkade game where there are endless of things you can do. You can try to get achievements, complete levels and unlock secrets, play and complete nearly impossible levels or build your own level. There are LOTS of unlocks in this game and when you complete and achievement you unlock an icon, ship, ball, ufo, trail or a colour. You can customize your icons with colours and make an account and have a name that none registered player will be able to use! Collect secret coins, rise in the leaderboards by completing usercreated levels that have been featured or/and given a star by the creator himself, Robtop! All and all, this is a very good game and i dont see too many flaws in it. I started playing this game a couple of years ago and i still loves it! If you want a challenge, go buy this game now!!!

This Game gives so much fun and you can basically play it forever and you won't get bored, thanks to updates that developer makes. This game contains level made by users and some of them are really amazing, or tho this game needs a lot of practice but its worth to learn the game. This game can be played infinitly and you  are still meeting new things. There are thousands of level to beat, and most of them are REALLY HARD, which makes game a good challenge to try out.

What can I say, well first of all this game is absolutely amazing. Perfect Controls, Graphics, and dont forget the endless character creation. This game will never "Dry Out" - Pun intended and is very easy to learn! You will get right "Back on Track" - Again pun Intended. I love this game because of the creativity. Btw a creative game will grow in a creative community of people. This game has a great community and its cool to watch it grow. It is well known on the ipad and now its on the pc.\n\nOnly a few problems-\n\nThe game is over priced, ok $4 isnt bad but I still think since you pay extra on the PC you should have everything unlocked. Now hold on I know thats a bit to ask for and its just my thought.\n\n[BIG ONE]\n\n4 words. Not Optimized For PC! It can get pretty annoying. Sometimes there are static lines going through the screen. It also gets blurry sometimes and it distracts you from the game. I am sure this can be fixed and I understand it may take some time.\n\nTo conclude my review, I think this game has a great potential, I cant wait to see it get updated and grow on the PC version. For people thinking if they should buy it, I would say YES! If you like platformers and hours of fun this game is for you!","January 3, 2015","true","11.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

This game is something you wouldn't think you would spend hours on. At first looks, most people will think of this game as just something to play once in a while. Well that isn't all that true. Me, Bluey has spent over 500 hours within this game. This is huge! This is one of the few games that I have spent even over 100 hours on. But why this game of all the games I own? Why Geometry Dash of everything? Well there are so many things to do in this game that it makes you wonder why this game is so cheap! You can play the 20 official levels, play user levels, make your own levels and much more!\n\nThanks to the 2.0 update, Geometry Dash isn't what it was before during 1.9 or before. Geometry Dash now has so many more things to explore that are amazing that if you played before 2.0, it makes you wonder how all of this amazing stuff got to this game. With new custom profiles you can now add people to your friends lists, post status messages on your profile, see how many stars, coins, and demons you have, create amazing levels with moving objects and disappearing and reappearing objects, create movie levels and much more!\n\nBut where has Geometry Dash come from? Well first things first, we should talk about where the idea for this game came from. Geometry Dash is a remake of a game called "The Impossible Game". (You may be thinking this right now... --> Remake? Oh then it must be bad right?) But wait! That's not all that comes with this rage and fun filling game! But why this game rather than "The Impossible Game"? Wouldn't they really be the same thing because Geometry Dash is really just a remake of The Impossible Game? If you think that, that is wrong. They are so different from each other, and hands down Geometry Dash wins at the end. Well lets discuss the pros and cons of Geometry Dash...\n\nPros  120 steam achievements!\n187 in-game achievements!\nTons of characterization & colors to make your cubes look fancy!\nSteam trading cards!\nCustom/User Levels & Level Creator!\nCustom Music for Custom/User Levels from Newgrounds!\n"Movie" auto levels!\nSix different game modes to play as! (Cube, ship, ufo, ball, wave, and robot)\nOne of the best remakes of a game there is! (This was based off of The Impossible Game)\nOther games transformed into Geometry Dash thanks to 2.0! (Such as Mario)\nDemon levels to test your skills!\nPlayer and creator leaderboard!\nStars & Coins Tracker! (for personal achievements and leaderboard)\n97% of reviews for this game is positive!\nNo DLC!\nEaster Eggs! :)\nRubrub! :D Cons  Community is somewhat bad (however doesn't change how I feel of this game itself).\nA ton of bugs!\nRage.\nThose triple spikes.\nCycles is the cycle of triple spikes.\nTime Machine is the Triple Spike Machine.\nToo many lennys ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) and Back On Track jokes.\nConclusion\nThere are tons of pros in Geometry Dash rather than cons. It's really just amazing how this game has grown. Before it was just a simple jump and complete game, but now it is so much more which helped this grow to the point where it is now. All of the updates Rubrub released for Geometry Dash has really gotten this game so far.

I started with the cracked version of the game couple years ago and didn't expect levels to get that hard and some amazing updates. I remember first when I started playing, the first few levels were the worst and the hardest. It was so exciting to get 50% on stereo madness when I first played the game x3\n\nWent through some levels and it got easier every day, even though I kept failing. At that moment the first few levels were a peice of cake, but electrodynamix was a bit annoying, i kept failing so much I stopped being angry. Failed at 93% then 95% then 97%, but I kept trying and got it, same with the other levels. Getting angry at the levels is pretty pointless, unless you want people to laugh at you. Just keep trying and you'll get it.\n\nAbout the community....Well, one of the most supportive and nicest community i've ever seen. Those people will always say something nice, about your level, about yourself..anything really. I'm creating levels and looking back at my old levels..I can say they are not good, but people thought it was good, they said it was cool so I just continued on creating, those people helped a lot.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons I love this game is cause of what people can create with the level editor (and the music, the music is awesome). I always thought the very first levels were cool, then I went to the online levels, my mind was blown. The beautiful, detailed, amazing levels that people can create it just insane. Bossfights, animations, custom backrounds, that was amazing to see. I started working on that too (I'm not a known creator, my levels are still bad compared to others x3) and hopefully to make something, and it kinda worked out. c:\n\nGod damn typing all of this was hard x3 Anyway, awesome game, awesome people, lanny faces, awesome levels, awesome community. Playing it and still gonna play it for a long time.

I'll get right to the chase.\n\nGeometry Dash is a VERY good game. It has currently 20 different main levels you can play, with each level introducing a new element/design/gamemode/portal to it. The soundtrack is AMAZING. But it gets better. Unlike most games, you can actually make your own levels and share it with the world to play. You can like/dislike, rate the difficulty, and play every online level uploaded, obviously. This is a HUGE upgrade from the Impossible Game, which obviously was the idea and point of this game.\n\nThere are some BIG cons however.\n\nFirst off, the community. The community is currently TORN with a mixture of different negative effects. There is racism, profanity, judgement, haters, etc. The community tends to always use overused memes, such as the "Back on Track Demon" for an example. Another thing is that creating levels just doesn't seem as fun anymore. It used to be making fun levels, but now all everyone cares about is decorative levels, but obviously not ENTIRELY true to most extents.\n\nOverall, this game is good. I personally don't like to get with the community anymore, as it has gone INSANE and will mess with your head. Some even thought about suicide over it. If you are going to play this game, just stay far, but not too far, from the community. This game is worth getting while it is on sale. While I put my recommendation of this game to "Yes." it is not ENTIRELY true. There are still some holes left to fix. I rate this game 7.5/10.","December 29, 2015","true","454.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","4"

It may look like that at first, but this game (in my opinion) is way better than the impossible game. For one, it's currently cheaper, 2, it has a WAY better soundtrack full of techno music (mostly) and has many different parts in the actual game that make it stand out, like rockets, UFOs, jump pads, gravity switchers and more! It also has a lot of replay value. Even if you finish all of the normal levels in the normal "Campaign mode", you can play custom-made levels made by the community, or make your own and share it with others! This game is addicting, enfuriating, and all around awsomely hard. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun short game to play.\n\nThe only problem with this game as of right now is that there is no easy way to record it. on the mobile version you can use Everyplay to record, but this version doesn't have Everyplay yet. So you will have to use an external recording program like FRAPS to record gameplay. Hopefully they add Everyplay to this version of Geometry Dash.","January 11, 2015","true","386.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

You can be a rocket ship, or UFO, just to name a few. There's a bunch of default levels, that go from easy to demon. Each level gets harder. First time playing it you may have a hard time, but the more you play it, the better you will get. Easy levels are, well, easy.  Then comes Normal, a bit harder then Easy. After that is Hard, which is quite hard. Then, there is Very Hard, which is very challenging. After that is Insane which is extremely hard, then Demon, the hardest. There's a bunch of community-made levels, so you can basically never get bored. It's a great game, all in all, and I totally recommend it.  It also goes VERY cheap on sales, so you can pick it up for 1.99 sometimes. 10/10.

I had a full life ahead of me, aspirations and dreams maybe even someone special someday. It was like any other day, waking up and getting ready to venture into the world. I could hear the birds chirping and the car not starting. I sat in the driver seat waiting to start the car up again. As I tried once more this time slightly pressing the gas pedal the car began with an unpleasant sound, but it started so I was content. The day progressed and I took some time to eat my lunch as I had an hour break between my next classes. I sat and opened up my laptop like everyother day. I watched some shows and browsed some steam games which I had been doing every other day. Today was different a game caught my eye, it appeared to be a simple concept for a game. Using only one key to move a cube up to dodge spikes, walls and other obstacles. I contemplated on buying it at first due to how simple it had appeared, but I overlooked this after seeing an overwhelming amount of people who liked the game. Even still though I hesitated before buying the game unsure why, almost as if I my subconscious was telling me something. I proceeded in buying the game but did not play it yet. I still had a few hours left before I would play this game for the first time. On the drive home I decided to tilt the car seat back for the first time, I'm not sure what made me decide to do this as I had been driving home for over 3 years but none the less I had decided to. I also have been listening to some classical music that plays on the radio. Beyond relaxed on the way home, I was unaware of what unfortunate fate would soon become of me. I pulled into my garage and parked the car, as I got out I grabbed my bag and headed inside the house. I knelt down and untied my boots and the was greeted by my dog. I let her outside and started to set up my laptop to play the game. As I loaded the game I heard a scratch at the door and let my dog inside. That was the last thing I remember of my life before this game. I started to play and was easily lured in by the friendly colours and the customizations. I started the first level and died , I then began attempt 2  ofthe level only to die once again. It was fun, frustrating and addicting, but after completing the first level I felt some satisfaction. It didn't stop there though, I needed to fully complete the level which would take more attempts replaying it  over and over until I could truly be free from the level. I have been seeing boxes and spikes and visions of the game since I have closed it. My thoughts are no longer my own I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to think without flashes of this game again. I have only one option now, attempt to play through the entire game and hope completing it will bring back what it has taken from me.","January 21, 2015","true","7.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","1"

I've had this on my Kindle Fire 2nd Gen and now having it on Steam is just..... wow. Even though it was kinda tough to switch from using my thumb and tapping on the screen to clicking and jumping, yet it was very worth it in the end.\n\nPlus, if you have played on another tablet (Like me) and want to sync, you can! One of the best features RobTop added so far in 2014 (In my opinion) is the Sync feature. Just create an account and bam, sync up your Phone/iPad/Kindle to your Steam just by clicking a few times and filling in a few text boxes.\n\nEven then, the game still creates a very hard (and rage inducing) challenge of timing your jumps, trying to figure out if I should fall or jump, etc., and in the end, you just get that happy feeling whenever you beat a level.\n\nThis game is an absolute must buy for those wanting to have a challenge.

A lot of people won't like it simply because of its genre, and admittedly, as a mobile port it does have some major UI issues (it's probably what keeps this from going onto my favourites list, hopefully the developer fixes up the PC version and gets some proper UI).\nOverall, however, this is an extremely enjoyable game brought down by its UI problems, and not everyone will enjoy this genre.\nTL;DR:\nPros:\n- Fun game, rewarding and challenging.\n- Level editor with built in sharing.\n- Plenty of levels, with updates bringing more.\n- Collectibles, which unlock new, hard levels.\n- Practice mode.\n\nCons:\n- Major UI issues - may bring the game too low to buy outside of a sale.\n- Semi-niche genre, you may hate the game because of it.\n~7-8/10","January 18, 2015","true","12.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

In all seriousness though, this is an incredibly fun game, with an awesome soundtrack throughout. It is challenging to put it mildly, and many rages will be experienced. After failing at one level for 100 consecutive attempts, my sanity was hanging together by a thread, but at least I was calmed by the music and pretty colours. It is not for the weak hearted, and is very mentally draining, but immensely enjoyable at the same time. I highly recommend it and get sturdy headphones first, they will be thrown reguarly.","April 5, 2015","true","12.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Geometry Dash takes that and increases what can be done with our subconceous muscle memory. Playing the same segment over and over with a little bit more recognition each time sounds kinda boring in hindsight but all i wanted to do was NOT jump when my hand said JUMP, anyway i like the in game level editor and community available to this game. however i wish there was an easier way to get levels from a phone onto my computer to continue editing. i had to publish an incomplete level with copy enabled and in the 10 minutes from my uploading to downloading it on my computer it had 2 more downloads and one negative rating... i put unfinished in the title and everything T.T again anyway this game is gud and you shud play it :3 Have fun and Game ON!","April 11, 2015","true","7.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Also Steam version has 2 unlockable icons!\n- Many Steam Achievements and also Trading Cards.\n\nInbetweens:\n- The rage.\n- Auto-checkpoints in practice mode can sometimes be annoying. (you can disable auto-checkpoints anyway)\n\nCons:\n- No keys configuration yet. You can only use Left Click, Spacebar and Up arrow atm.\n- The tutorial for new mechanics is pretty vague, but it is easy anyway so don't worry.\n- Triple spikes\n- Time Machine is a thing here\n\nConclusion: Geometry Dash is just awesome. Give it a try!\nRating: 10/10.\n=================\nIf you just bought this game, I highly recommend you reading this guide by DJ-$h0r7y, it explains pretty much everything you need to know when you play the game (version 1.9): http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=361157356.\nThanks for reading!","June 14, 2015","true","92.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I feel this game would fair better on handheld devices better than a PC though. Not that it's bad on PC, but the way you play this game isn't meant to be played in an extensive way that other games are meant to be played in like: RTS/RPGs/Adventure/, etc. These are the kind of games you put hours into in a single sitting, while this game you're off and on playing it no more than 30 minutes at a time before you go off to do something. So for that, I consider it as more of a time killer game, really. As far as the difficulty goes, I will say it starts amping up in the later levels as you progress through the game. At first, the game starts off pretty basic with you just going through the levels, and jumping over obstacles. Nothing too demanding. Then, as you start getting further in the game, the levels start becoming a little more unforgiving and you have to maneuver through even more obstacles that come your way. In some ways, it's almost too ballistic and random to even tell what's really going on. Even the community levels that are ranked "Demon" for difficulty are absolutely ridiculous. They're cool looking levels, but a little to high maintenance for my liking. Speaking of community levels, there is a tool in here that lets you make your own levels. I haven't messed around with it much personally, but you can make some pretty crazy stuff. Anyhow, that's pretty much all I have to say for this game. It's fun, and I recommend you give it a try when given the chance.","January 27","true","22.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It isn't just that, Its more to it, There is a ship, Gameplay is basic, You basically move up and down as usual, The ball, Acts as a gravity changing system, Its not jumping or flying, But changes your gravitation either Normal gravitation or Reverse gravitation, The UFO, It acts almost like a flappy bird,  At least theres no pipe , if you jump, Instead of whatever i just said it will go and jump once, Can be repeated or spammed, My personal favorite, The wave/dart, It flies in a diagonal pattern, Up and down, cannot be changed otherwise, And the robot, It acts as the cube, But can be holded to jump even further.\n\nPros + Increases your reaction time,\n+ Your friend will praise you since they cant get past the Stereo Madness and you're at Deadlocked!\n+ The best songs you'll hear in your lives\n+ Lots of icons to customize your character\n+ Colorful gameplay, Make your own levels.\n+ Easy to understand mechanics\n+ Not even a single lag!\n\nCons - You'll rage, but!

I feel this game would fair better on handheld devices better than a PC though. Not that it's bad on PC, but the way you play this game isn't meant to be played in an extensive way that other games are meant to be played in like: RTS/RPGs/Adventure/, etc. These are the kind of games you put hours into in a single sitting, while this game you're off and on playing it no more than 30 minutes at a time before you go off to do something. So for that, I consider it as more of a time killer game, really. As far as the difficulty goes, I will say it starts amping up in the later levels as you progress through the game. At first, the game starts off pretty basic with you just going through the levels, and jumping over obstacles. Nothing too demanding. Then, as you start getting further in the game, the levels start becoming a little more unforgiving and you have to maneuver through even more obstacles that come your way. In some ways, it's almost too ballistic and random to even tell what's really going on. Even the community levels that are ranked "Demon" for difficulty are absolutely ridiculous. They're cool looking levels, but a little to high maintenance for my liking. Speaking of community levels, there is a tool in here that lets you make your own levels. I haven't messed around with it much personally, but you can make some pretty crazy stuff. Anyhow, that's pretty much all I have to say for this game. It's fun, and I recommend you give it a try when given the chance.","January 27","true","22.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I feel this game would fair better on handheld devices better than a PC though. Not that it's bad on PC, but the way you play this game isn't meant to be played in an extensive way that other games are meant to be played in like: RTS/RPGs/Adventure/, etc. These are the kind of games you put hours into in a single sitting, while this game you're off and on playing it no more than 30 minutes at a time before you go off to do something.

Although people first playing it might call it a rubbish clone, if they play for more than 20 minutes, they will realise the game is far from a clone, and in the case of Geometry Dash at least, much better. The concept is exactly the same as The Impossible Game. You’re a cube, moving forwards and jumping over spikes and blocks making your way to the end of the level. However, Geometry Dash has way more customization, depth and intriguing mechanics. As of the 2.0 update, you can take control of a soaring ship, jumpy UFO, gravity-changing ball, trigonometrical wave, and a booster-jumping robot. There are 20 playable levels each with heart-pounding and bass-pumping atmospheric songs that fit perfectly with them. What’s more, new content and levels are added every few months to keep the experience fresh, alongside the infinite replayability of the level editor with a search function, and with dedicated and talented creators having their levels featured for everyone to easily see.\n\n\nPositive\n\n- Deliciously difficult and infuriating, meaning a huge sense of achievement upon completion\n- 20 levels taking about 30-40 hours of in-level time to finish every one\n- Dedicated level editor allowing you to create any level that the creators could with searching and featured levels\n-Tons of customisation\n- Tons of wacky and fun vehicles and mechanics that change how you play\n\nNegative\n\n-Can get very tiring, and some of the levels need updating\n-Not so easy for newcomers to the genre\n\nOverall\n\nGameplay : 9/10\nGraphics : 7/10\nReplayability : 9/10\n\nVERDICT : 8/10","January 2","true","102.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game reminds me of the original ''The Impossible Game'' but Geometry Dash is way more complex.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and straightforward. It consists of a square moving trough the level and you have to press space to jump. It sounds easy, but it really isn't, on your way you will encounter many obstacles such as spikes, gaps, saws, thorns, pads used to jump higher or even change the direction of gravity and portals. To pass these you will have to perfectly time every of your jumps. You will die if you touch any hazard and this will restart the level from the beginning. You can choose to play on practice mode, where checkpoints will be avalable instead of restarting the level from the beginning if dead. This game offers a great mix between easy levels and hard levels, but even easy levels will require skill and memorizing the level. The game is very addicting, you will want to continue on playing even though you keep on losing. The gameplay is very smooth and the controls are very responsive. Each time you complete a level you will be rewarded with stars which are used to unlock new things and there are secret coins hidden around the levels which require you to take alternate, harder and riskier paths to collect and also the level design is great. Every time you unlock an achievement, you will unlock a new geometry figure or a new colour as well. There are a lot of shapes and colours to unlock and customize your character as you like. If you completed the default levels, you can also play levels created by other players on the level editor. You can like, dislike, rate their difficulty and even comment on those levels. You can create and share your own levels on the level editor, and Steam users get two exclusive unlockable icons. If you played this game before on mobile, you can link your mobile version and unlock all achievements, colours and shapes for PC. The game gets constantly updated and the community is very nice and friendly.\n\nThe graphics look amazing, vibrant colours and beautiful visual effects with a simple, minimalistic design. The soundtrack is simply great, there are many songs which are very energetic and fast-paced just like the game.\n\nI recommend this game, fun addicting and simple with beautiful minimalistic graphics, 9/10.","December 23, 2014","true","96.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Geometry Dash features 18 levels and counting of timed jumps, flying, and great music! The music is what makes this game so great, and it really adds to the timing of your jumps. The game mostly features songs from Djvi and Waterflame. The level editor and custom song adder really makes for some great user made levels.\nNow that I've done a little overview let's get to the Pro and Cons.\n\nPros\n- Over 15 colorful and great levels!\n- Featuring the greatest songs in history such as "Jumper" and "Back On Track".\n- Very solid Level Editor\n- Great Controls\n- Has an IOS version and a sync option between the two versions\n- The colors of your avatar affect the background of the levels\n\nCons\nNone!

You can customize these characters with what their look is and 24 different colours to choose from.

Clever level design, AMAZING music, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of replay value and it has to be one of the most challenging games I have ever played. If you are into games that can realy test your skills, I would pick it up. As I said, this game is challenging, It took me 8 hours to beat 5/18 levels. The game is almost never puts you in a situation of a cheap death, if you die, its on you (Aside from a couple of controll issues here and there). If you are into games that will keep you occupied for weeks on end and have some of the best music in video game history, I would 100% recommend it.

Geometry Dash features 18 levels and counting of timed jumps, flying, and great music! The music is what makes this game so great, and it really adds to the timing of your jumps. The game mostly features songs from Djvi and Waterflame. The level editor and custom song adder really makes for some great user made levels.\nNow that I've done a little overview let's get to the Pro and Cons.\n\nPros\n- Over 15 colorful and great levels!\n- Featuring the greatest songs in history such as "Jumper" and "Back On Track".\n- Very solid Level Editor\n- Great Controls\n- Has an IOS version and a sync option between the two versions\n- The colors of your avatar affect the background of the levels\n\nCons\nNone! This is one of my No-Con games. :)\n\nFor 5 bucks, this game is a great deal! If you want to give it a trial run, you can get a demo of the game on IOS and Andriod!\n","April 14, 2015","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You think playing music is as easy as playing with a metronome? Guess again. The others in the band have never seen nor heard of a metronome. It is your job to follow whatever off-beat rhythm they decide is right, instead of the drum major, who will surely have bigger biceps after all that arm flailing he's been doing tonight.\n\nIn this way, the band can actually sound good, and because you care more than most about things like that, it is your duty to follow their gross transgressions rather than stick out like a toucan's beak in the jungles of Amazonia.\n\nBe the star!

They actually enhanced the game.\n\nThe starting levels are as fun as always but the custom levels are where this game really shines, the ability to upload your own music is amazing, and it adds a whole new level of depth and replayability to the game.\n\nGood Job","January 16, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When you get good enough and the game hits its stride you get that uphoric feeling of being "in the zone" similar to mastering an Expert Guitar Hero song you tearing through flawlessly or beating a butllet-hell shooter boss without getting hit.\n\nThe road is long and hard but when you get there it is glorious! It tends to have that little extra something that makes you want to try "just one more time" again and again. It also has a practice mode so you can practice the levels with infinate lives.\n\nDid I mention the music is catchy? Wonderful music. I want the sound track!\n\nCON\nThis game isn't for the faint of heart, nor is it for those who want an easy time, the levels are BRUTAL, One little messup or slip in input spells disaster. Also since each level is a full song they are not only a test of pattern recognition and reflex but also a test in endurance too. If brutally hard jump puzzles (akin to super meat boy or cloudberry kingdom) doesn't sound appealing then stay FAR AWAY!\n\nAlso note that the jump input timing takes some getting use to, and duplicate presses of the jump button can que up multiple jumps and kill you.","January 24, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are literally so many colors that you never feel too angry about failing a level, and you're even happier when you reach a new part. Also, the music is gorgeous.

You can play levels ranging from easy to down right difficult made by the all time genius Robtop. He created this game. You complete a level, complete the next! See a level, Play the level! You jump, fly, reverse gravity, teleport, and even create your very own levels! If you read this by the time you complete all levels, you may know by now you have to get all the star coins! Once you get enough coins, guess what? A new level appears! That level is not what you think. It is one of the hardest you will ever play. If you have lots of spare time, or just time in general, play it! I didn't even list HALF of what you will find in this game! Trust me, this game isn't even worth four dollars.

A side-scrolling platformer/rage game in which you play as a shape-shifting cube who must navigate through dangerous terrain in order to beat the level. It's genius! The developer is constantly working on new game modes to extend the already-extremely wide variety to gameplay and level design. The level editor is a very nice and convenient way of keeping players gripped to the game even after completing all 20 levels, while forming a community of great creations and amazing friends.\n\nHere's a few things I've enjoyed about this game:\nThe possibilities are endless! With the level editor you can create pretty much ANYTHING you like, with billions of possible design combinations.\nThe variety of gameplay is amazing and there are still plenty of different and unique game-modes to come.\nThe Leaderboard System is a great way to promote the incredible skill of some of the best players/creators.\nThe ability to change your icons, ships etc. makes every player uniq5e in a special way\nSo many features for such a LOW price!.\nPersonally, I think that this is one of the best games that you can get for the £2.79 it's worth. It shows that even at a low price, you can still get a fairly large amount of features. I've really enjoyed this game so far, and once you get it too, you'll see that it's really worth the £3/$4 you paid for it.\n\nScore:10/10\nAmazing game. Would recommend it to friends and family.\n\n-fabman650","January 10","true","746.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
