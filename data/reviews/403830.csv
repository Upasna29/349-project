At least, I think it's late. Keeping track of time isn't a priority - wherever I am now... like a purple nimbus cloud crackling with electricity.  What's important is that I've saved the world, and no one will be any the wiser.\n\n…\n\n"Not that I did this for recognition, no! I'm not vainglorious or anything. This was all honestly just a happy byproduct of my pursuit of arcane knowledge, of the Eldritch Truth. I was laughed out of the academy, and the very men and women who found my research so amusing now owe me their insignificant lives. If they had seen what I've seen, fought what I've fought, learned what I've learned, they'd still be laughing -  restrained in padded cells, or worse.\n\n"Now to busy myself for eternity, and let's hope it's a brisk one because I'm quickly running out of reading material."\n\n\nThe Consuming Shadow is great fun. It isn't the deepest or most challenging procedural-type game I've ever played, but it is one of the most unique... like if FTL and Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem finally hooked up and made an unholy union. You play as a nameless, silhouette-y scholar tasked with stopping an ancient alien god's invasion of England (in 60 hours no less) because, let's face it, anything fantastical or magical or evil is innately going to be drawn to England for its rich history, world-renowned cuisine, and year-round pleasant weather.\n\nAnd it goes without saying you'll have to remain sane, tricky business considering the position you're in.\n\nSat in your car with a helpful sticky note attached to the rearview mirror (“Don't look back,” Yahtzee's nod to Daenerys Targaryen, one assumes), you must work your way southward towards Stonehenge (the aforementioned ancient god couldn't be ♥♥♥♥♥ to research a less obvious pagan site), stopping at  all the quaint villages peppering the English countryside to take on jobs from the Ministry of Occultism, resupply, and generally pop in to make sure all the villagers haven't been replaced with horrible squid monsters and telemarketers.\n\nThat's the real pulsating meat of the game – you'll select a destination, drive a ways and encounter a particularly foggy town. Flavor text will inform you that everything isn't as it seems in Lil' Silent Hill, and you'll have to contend with a series of random dungeon scenarios – a hostage situation, sealing a rift, clearing an infestation... run of the mill English stuff, presumably. The dungeons are laid out in a random grid that you traverse like the 2D side-scrollin' badass you are.\n\nDepending on what kind of a dungeon you find yourself in (there's quite a few), you'll get ammo, health, spells, sundry helpful items, and clues to suss out just what kind of an ancient alien god you're dealing with. Of course, you can't enjoy all that ammo, health, spells and so on without killing all the creeping, crawling, and flying horrors occupying the dungeon. The combat is, for me anyway, akin to combat in Silent Hill 2. Your firearm autoaims, and mele is an incredibly viable (read: powerful) option, but you're going to take hits and the combat isn't going to feel amazing... just acceptable. Which is fine! Again, Silent Hill 2-y. I feel like a Joe Shmo fighting unspeakable horror, and I shouldn't feel like his loud cousin Joey Kickass, frequent ruiner of children parties. And if you take too much damage, or dabble too often in the sexy dark arts, you'll encounter some clever little status and sanity effects... nothing quite as memorable as, say Eternal Darkness', but much more impactful on gameplay.\n\nI mentioned that there are clues... see, part of the “stopping an ancient alien god's invasion” is knowing the proper incantation, which you aren't going to just know off the top of your head. Instead, you'll find helpful cultists have left various notes throughout dungeons providing contextual clues like, “the blue god is associated with raucous partying,” “Bytalia hates the ever-loving ♥♥♥♥ out of the god associated with the SMH rune,” and so on. Armed with a handy table, you can fill in pertinent information as you find it. This minor aspect of the game is what I found most fun, oddly enough. It felt like I was playing a boardgame. Once you have (or think you have) enough information you can brave Stonehenge itself for either a thrilling conclusion, a hilariously colossal cockup, or something in between.\n\nWith each subsequent playthrough you'll unlock new characters (three, each with a slightly different gameplay focus), constellations that let you focus on stats or abilities, and of course flavor text lore in the forms of a diary and bestiary.\n\nThe Consuming Shadow is going to have some complaints, and I'm sure a point of contention for some people will be the general aesthetic. While I initially found it less than easy on the eyes, The Consuming Shadow grew on me. There's something absolutely charming about it, I can't quite explain it. I felt immersed, like I was sitting in MY car, checking off a list, sleepily driving towards another cursed township (the otherworldly soundtrack helps a bunch in the ambiance department). My biggest qualm is that I wish there was MORE, which is asking a lot of a sole developer, I know. It's just that after a few playthroughs you'll encounter the same scenarios, same dungeons, same spook text messages, and same sanity effects. I would have loved more flavor text, more horrors, and while I thoroughly enjoyed the English setting I would have really liked some other maps... Australia perhaps, with the ancient god heading towards Uluru, or maybe the ancient god is in the continental United States in search of the first McDonald's.\n\nBut I digress. The Consuming Shadow is, as I said, great fun. It's cosmic horror-themed FTL when boiled down to its most basic concept, only instead of being chased by an ironically xenophobic intergalactic rebel fleet you're fleeing from pure, unadulterated EVIL™. The controls are tight and intuitive, the sound design is atmospheric, and... I don't know, it just feels good to play. Yahtzee took a bunch of great retro game mechanics and sensibilities and arranged them in such a way that it doesn't feel like another forced retro indie title.\n\nThis is one immersive, engaging, and well-written title. It's fulfilling to flesh out your diary and bestiary, it's thrilling when you finally win (and when you “win”), and it honestly makes for a fun little party game. My friends and I sat around for hours exploring dungeons, filling out the table, and dying.\n\nWe died a lot.\n\nAnd you will too.\n\nI've seen it in the stars.\n\nINSANITY EDIT: the Steam edition includes lots of challenges to keep you coming back for more, PLUS I've noticed a few new denizens occupying the dungeons... definitely a fan of the creepy skitterish guy with more head than can be reasonably explained by natural selection.","November 20, 2015","true","48.6"," 117 of 132 people (89%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","89","117","132","40","3"

Right. Now forget that, because it doesn't detract from the game at all.\n\nBasically, it's a Lovecraftian roguelite similar to FTL. You hop from town to town for supplies, quests, and most importantly, "dungeons" to explore. To win, you need to find four parts of a ritual spell, and deduce the identity of the invading god based on various clues offered throughout. The final level can be attempted at any time, allowing you to go in even with just an educated guess. Sometimes, your only choice is to make a guess, because you've got just 60 hours to work out an answer.\n\nMost importantly for this kind of game, there's plenty of replayability. There are multiple endings, characters, and lore to be unlocked, plus the challenge modes new in the Steam version.\n\nLastly, to address the RNG, the game is a random by nature, but never so much that it can kill you or deny you items unfairly. I have yet to find myself in an unwinnable situation, unless I caused it myself (by not stocking up on health for example).\n\nOh, and it's not wiki-reliant. Big plus for me personally.\n\nAnyway, it's well worth the $10, but sale or no, definitely consider picking this up.\n\n\n","November 21, 2015","true","10.6"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","46","52","0","0"

Definately not ten dollars good enough.\n\nIn many ways, the game succeeds.  It does evoke a feeling of despair and urgency.  Traveling from town to town and managing resources, health, and sanity is pretty fun and moody.  The proceedurally generated "mystery" is pretty fun to solve, but isn't challenging enough once you get the hang of it.  There are only three "suspect" Gods in each mystery, and its very easy to narrow it down to two gods--which gives you a 50/50 shot at closing the "portal" with a simple guess.\n\nWhere the game really fails, though, is in the "dungeons".  You spend a large portion of the game exploring these urban dungeons looking for clues, and the gameplay here is an unfortunate, flash-based arcade sequence that doesn't fit well with the rest of the game and just plays poorly.  I didn't want to spend the bulk of this game playing an arcade sequence--and it isn't even a good arcade sequence.  The combat is very clunky and not very fun.\n\nI wish instead of including these arcade dungeon runs, more time and effort would have been applied to further developing the proceedural mystery and the resource management aspects of the game.  The dungeon runs would have been handled better as turn based combat rather than the weak arcade combat.\n\nWould like to see this developer take another crack at a similar game.  There is a lot to like here, and it is very evocative at times--it just doesn't quite make the cut for a thumbs up at ten bucks.","January 28","false","10.6"," 29 of 42 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","29","42","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sutorei/recommended/403830/","sutorei","Sutorei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sutorei/","152 products in account","Don't be quick to judge The Consuming Shadow by the cover graphics. Sure, they certainly lack in production value, but not in impact. Twitchy sihoulettes of enemies, roadsigns and houses covered in heavy fog, special effects of unholy spells and crawling insanity - they're all simple, but they create a suprisingly strong sense of immersion once you familiarize yourself with the gameplay.\n\nThat would be easy, because, unlike most games of this kind, there are not that many aspects and resources to manage. You only have health and sanity as your stats, ammo, medical supplies and drugs as resources, and some buffing items which you may find as you explore the shadow-infested Britain, helping civilians and completing simple tasks while trying to avert the invasion of a malevolent god.\n\nThis doesn't mean it's easy to reach any of the good endings. You will die a lot, sometimes by your own hand, i.e. hitting 'Kill yourself' button which plagues your interface at low sanity. The combat system of this game takes some mastery and experimentation, however simple it may seem on the first glance. Carefully observing monster patterns and utilizing this knowledge will keep your health and sanity at tolerable levels. The combat and overall playstyle are also dependent on the character you play, which there're four.\n\nThe game, while being text-reliant, manages to avoid being text-heavy. The necessary information, describing the immediately concerning events and encounters, is written in condensed and atmospheric sentences. And, if you want, there's a whole lot more to read in the diary and enemy files which you collect across your playthroughs.\n\nThe sound and music also contribute greatly to the overall atmosphere. Calm and depressing piano pieces combined with eerie ambient noises really hit the spot. There's a practical component too - you can determine which kind of enemy you encounter even without seeing it. This is very important in the game when you can't see most of the room you're in.\n\nFor 10 bucks, The Consuming Shadow is a good deal - there's enough content for about 15-20 hours of gameplay, and the game is balanced to be challenging, but not frustrating.\n\nAs of today, this game has sold about 6.5 thousand copies on Steam. For more awesome hidden gems, follow the CRIMINALLY Low Sales curator.","January 30","true","8.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","13","15","4","0"

Simple at a glance but surprisingly deep you'll find yourself zipping around a randomly generated British countryside slaying demons and helping wayward souls in your mission to discover the dark god invading the world and the ritual required to banish it.\n\nI could most easily compare the basics of dark-god banishment as a sort of game of Clue, for those who remember the boardgame pasttime, a deductive reasoning experience where you strive to find clues infering what gods are present and what symbols they use with the goal of figuring out which god is invading and what rune holds its affinity. Combing the god's rune with a discovered ritual will allow you to make an attempt at saving the world in Stonehunge, if you can survive long enough to get there.\n\nCombat is hectic and claustrophobic as you battle quick, silhouetted beasties with limited light, pistol-whipping and firing wild shots in oppressively poorly lit dungeons. Choosing the right tactic, ammo and timing are all important.\n\nMagic plays a role as well as you must utilize a collection of runes to both banish dark gods as well as cast spells you may find in your searches, counterspell evil cultists to defeat their magical barriers or to close rifts allowing shadowy creatures into the living world.\n\nResource management, time management, trigger discipline, reasoning skills and a bit of a gambling nature all play their part in the game. Do you want a few extra hollow point bullets, or the useful piece of gear? Wlil you gamble on your intuition to keep you from wasting ammo on hallucinations as your sanity wanes, or shoot up with illicit narcotics to keep your calm? Should you try and stop the crazed gunman with your words or your hands?\n\nNew to the Steam edition are a number of challenge modes including a daily challenge with randomized modifiers, achievements and trading cards. There are several unlockable characters with differeing capabilities and a somewhat gentle progression system that optionally allows you to get a little bit better with each run if you so choose by spending 'birth stars' on a series of randomized stat boosts.\n\nThe Consuming Shadows won't be for everyone. Watch some videos and decide for yourself, what you see is what you get. It'll either be amazingly cool or completely out of your range of interests. And don't mind my playtime, I put quite a lot of time into it when it came out in the Humble Store. It will likely grow in time.","November 20, 2015","true","1.1"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

Yes\nIs it worth 10 bucks? Ehhhhhhh... That'll be up to you, of course.\n\nIt's a very well written and designed game. Not scary, nor particularly distrubing, but it is very very creepy. The art direction, although very simple, is also perfectly fitting. Even the text assets are acceptable despite being default plaintext, seeing as the character is either typing it out or reading it on typed paper.\n\nThe gameplay is uniqe, as far as I know. You simply walk left and right through procedurally generated dungeons and events, shooting, bashing, looting, running, and incanting your way past your foes. You have both health and sanity to monitor, of course. What makes it fun is whodunit take on figuring out which evil entity to banish, piece by piece assembling the know how to save the world. The fittingly abiguious yet descriptive writting also helps. Yes I know that's oxymoronic, but it just works.\n\nThe challenge is tight. At first I was sceptical of the difficulty. Then I realized you drain your health kit like a bullet hole riddled tub drains water. Then I couldn't find a way to permenantly restore sanity. Then I had broken legs, a panic attack, an was gushing blood, and proceded to clear three more towns that way before dying. ♥♥♥♥ was tense.\n\nReplayability also seems very high, which is good for a session based game like this. If you've played FTL, you'd probably find Consuming Shadow's game sessions similar in length. Besides the main gameplay supported story and unlocks, you also have a daily challenge generator, and an endless dungeon mode. The list of individual challenges you can also unlock is short, but the game makes up for it in other unlockables. It has a diary you can rebuild, page by page. It also has a typical 'bestiary', but one that unlocks word by word, creating a more rewarding 'bestiary' to fill than most every other game has.\n\nIn conclusion, sure, the game has problems. The obvious "how did they miss that" graphical bug, the graphics that obviously auto-scale for bigger monitors, and keys can't be rebound in the options. These little problems pale in comparison to everything it does right. Overall, I'd ask you to overlook the rough edges and buy this game if it interested you in any way.","November 20, 2015","true","21.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

This is done in both of the primary 'game modes' The Consuming Shadow features. The first is the overworld map, where you pick a town on your GPS and drive there via your very slow car to look for clues. Various 'text-only' events can happen both here and in the towns, where you will have to make a choice. These choices like FTL, can give you bonuses to your cash or equipment, or screw you over royally. There are often pieces of equipment you can use to sway these events in your favor, much like FTL.\n\nThe meat of your clue-finding will be done in the dungeon crawling sections however, where you enter a 2D side-scrolling section to kill monsters, open locked doors and scavenge chests. It is worth noting that while the keyboard controls function okay here, I found a PS3 or 360 pad is vastly superior. The keyboard controls remind me something of playing Resident Evil on a PS1 emulator, where your hands are spread thin across the keyboard. Speaking of Resident Evil, monsters are plentiful and ammo/health is scarce. You will have to wisely manage your bullets and learn how to melee attack most of the enemies to do well; running from encounters is NOT advisable, as you will take a penalty to your sanity for doing so.\n\nThe goal of each dungeon is to find a clue that will help you stop the Ancient, and ultimately you will need two things to win the game: A four-part Banishment Spell and the rune of the invading Ancient. The Banishment Spell is quite easy to attain, but finding the rune of the invading Ancient is tricky. You will need to use logical inferance and vague clues to figure out who is invading, who isn't invading, who is the God of what and so on. This is the funnest part of the game for me, as it balances the action elements with a fair bit of brain-teasing. The Ancient who is invading and what his rune is random on each playthrough too, so don't bother trying to reuse anything for a new run.\n\nThere are also a total of four different characters to play as, and unlocking them depends on a good deal of RNG unfortunately, but it's a wonderful way to mix things up. There are also some ties into Yahtzee's other games (Trilby and Chzo) but I haven't touched those yet, so I can't tell you if they are significant.\n\nOverall the Steam version is the same game (duh), it essentially just adds in some extra monsters and challenge modes if you find the main game to be getting stale. None of my complaints about the original game have been addressed; the visuals on some simple things (like your GPS) can be improved, and there should be more backgrounds for the 'text-only' events that happen on the road and in town.\n\nNone of this detracts from the gameplay though; if you enjoy Lovecraftian horror, light action and puzzle solving this game will keep you distracted for quite a while.","November 29, 2015","true","21.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The Consuming Shadow invites its players to come along on an adventure that's ripped right out of pages of the Providence writer's imagination. There are dozens of little details that fine tune the mood and atmosphere to just the right amount of uncertainty, danger, and dread, that the new player is never quite certain of what is going on while the veteran player is always unsure of what exactly is coming next. The game provides a sense of mystery in that the player must pursue information and collect clues in order to deduce just which god is invading, and which spell to cast in order to prevent this invasion. Through the powers of deduction and logical reasoning the player can find out exactly what they're up against, all while avoiding the terrible effects the invading god is having on the countryside around them.\n\nHighest marks to its designer Yahtzee, and one of the best Lovecraftian horror games on the market.","November 22, 2015","true","25.2"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

The Consuming Shadow is a very difficult roguelike thats been very well crafted, with a fantastic atmosphere. It makes me think of the Soul's titles: Its very unforgiving, but that makes success that much more sweeter from it. The story is simple: An evil god is trying to invade. Fight monsters and find clues to find out what god is trying to invade and assemble a banishment ritual to send them away. Sometimes you die, sometimes everything comes together and you have what you need, sometimes you have to sprint to the final room and attempt to win on a guess. I've had a few great runs ruined at the last moment because of a detail I missed. It's great.\n\nIf you've already played/watched video's from the Humble Bundle version, there has been a lot of changes from that version. Theres a daily challenge option, as well as various ways to play through with different scenarios to mix things up, theres been a few updates in the random events and enemies: More things can happen to your character and (to my knowlege) most enemies now have a large, very powerful varient, and theres been a few tweeks to the game that makes it more difficult.\n\nThere's a lot on offer here, and while its very difficult, its very fun to play. A successful run will last about 30 minutes, but its gameplay and fantasic atmosphere makes it easy to return and play again.","November 23, 2015","true","5.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This steam key was also included if the game got greenlit, so I put in just a few minutes to share my thoughts.\n\nWhen someone says that RNG can't make an experience that draws desperation and fear, be satisfying and not devolve into a frustrating pile of dogshit, this is the game that I will show them.\n\nYahtzee Croshaw is a well known critic of games and game design, and it seems he with this game, he shows that he can put his money where his mouth is.The game is incredibly well balanced, with every playable character having a different playstyle that will draw you into the world. Embark on an adventure, where ammo is scarce and every single item and clue is tantamount to preserving your life for that one last moment. The pool of dialogue and actions are somewhat scarce, but the ability to which they are done is profound. It's amazing that this game, with all of its well crafted design (bar the aesthetics that do the job but could be better), is  a simple logic puzzle at its core.\n\nThis game, despite its harshness, is fun. It's scary. It fills me with desperation knowing that it is up to me to help this man save the world before the toll on his mind breaks him, provided the monsters don't break his body first.\n\nEverything has a lovecraftean vibe that only adds to the tension. I am filled with dread once I complete a mission, scared that a powerful monster will spawn in moments, where I begin to freak out and attempt to escape before the giant face that consumes the room will eat me as well.\n\nThe game makes the smart move of balancing everything, so that the penalties have a large effect on the game but do not simply cause them to kill you without warning. Every option has something that can help the situation and even then it still can dangle hope within your grasp, as you agonize over whether or not you should save a boy from a burning car.\n\nThis game has many random elements, but have been able to apply balance and design in a way that makes the things keeping RNG in check in a meaningful and useful way, without removing the emotions the game wishes to elicit in all of its scenarios. I feel bad when I lose, I am relieved when I win. I don't feel frustrated by the game's systems, because my actions are that; my actions. I am responsible for taking care of my character and it will be my choice that leads him to saving the world or shooting himself in the head.","January 13","true","0.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombieplasticclock/recommended/403830/","zombieplasticclock","ZombiePlasticClock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombieplasticclock/","218 products in account","A chilling rouguelike Survival Horror game, erring more on "survival" rather than "Horror". An ancient god plans to invade the world, so you have to find parts of an ancient banishment ritual to stop them. Delve deep into infested monster dens, take drugs, do whatever you need to in order to save the world.\n\nOr die trying. That will happen a lot.\n\nPros:\n-Many aspects of the game are randomized every time. While you may explore similar locales, there's enough to spice things up every time.\n-Real survival horror gameplay. The enemies and atmosphere are oppresive and stressful, but trying to keep your health and supplies up to combat it can be equally stressful. Difficult but rewarding!\n-Unlockable characters, challenge modes, beastiary, this game is a Completionist's dream.\n-Despite the game's randomization, there aren't any truly "overpowered" item combinations. You'll be clawing your way through this game no matter what!\n\nCons:\n-Like many other rougelike games, you can get some really bad RNG. Be it a map full of monster-infested towns when you desperately need supplies, unfortunate monster spawns, or random events that conspire against your current run. be ready for lots of stress.\n-Graphics are simplistic by design. Think of something like Undertale: Not hyper-detailed, but it gets the job done. While I personally don't find this a dealbreaker, I can understand why it might be for others.\n-Another "mixed bag" criticism is the game's levelling system. As you complete (or fail) runs, you gain experience, unlocking new perks that can improve future playthroughs. While this is very encouraging, it makes early runs feel like you have an unfair disadvantage.\n\nConclusion:\nA great rougelike game that keeps you on the edge of your seat every time you play it. It's not slow-paced like FTL, but it's not as twitchy and fast as Spelunky; it finds a happy middle-ground of slow, methodical gameplay, along with plenty of monster fighting. This game can be very stressful, but I find it very rewarding.","November 23, 2015","true","10.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/403830/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","At its core, this game is very simple. A Lovecraftian procedurally generated CYOA with action sequences, simple shadowy graphics and a horrific plot.\n\nBut that simplicity in and of itself is what makes it so good. What it does, it does well.\n\nYou are the standard Lovecraftian "scholar of the occult turned bastion against the darkness, sacrificing your very self and mind to save the world from the mind tearing evil beyond".\n\nIn the main game mode you have 60 "hours" to find the keys to complete the banishment ritual to stop the dark god from entering the world through Stonehenge and warping all creation. To do this, you travel around the UK in your car, stopping at various towns. Some are peaceful and untainted, while others have been infested with the Shadow. In those you may investigate where the infection is and shut it down. Random text messages arrive, both people providing advice and cheering you on, and the Dark Forces taunting you (Cthulu has taught its minions to use SMS, I see...). Theres also random events as you travel around, sometimes leading to more investigation sequences.\n\nAll this comes at the cost of your own life and sanity, of course. In the action sequences the game turns into a 2d room by room maze, randomly generated. Search the rooms to find clues to which dark god is trying to get through stonehenge, and items and magic spells to help you in you journeys. Shoot horrid shadow monsters with your trusty gun, or just pistol whip the hell out of them, as you dont have many bullets. After completeting whatever it was that sent you there, sometimes you got to RUN as the dark forces dont like being thwarted. Fortunately theres a handy minimap in the corner that shows where youve been.\n\nOnce you have gathered enough clues to piece together which dark god is trying to f'up the earth, get to stonehenge and cast the banishment ritual (magic is used by quickly selecting symbols with RS) to keep it out.\n\nKind of like a game of Clue, only with much more insanity, Ia Ia Cthulu fhtagn-ing, and terror.\n\nThe sanity meter is cool. As you start going insane, weird things start happening on screen. Doors move, things vanish, all hell breaks loose (literally). And in the CYoA text segments, the words in the selection boxes start flicking back and forth between what you are trying to do (ie "Investigate Further", "Return to Car") and "KILL YOURSELF". You can imagine the end result of that one.\n\nThe writing in the CYoA segments is *awesome* and totally captures that Lovecraftian feel of flickers at the edge of vision, all consuming darkness, and incredible wrongness, and you are the only one who can stop it, although youd rather just curl up in a corner and die. Graphics are simple, but this game is proof positive you dont need ultra detailed gore to be creepy. In the action sequences you and the monsters are just shadows against a backdrop (rendered appropriately for the area graveyard/park, house, abandoned building etc).\n\nIt also has persistant unlocables to aid you in your quests. Extra abilities, items, diary entries, game modes and more unlockable characters provide a feeling of completion, even after watching the last nameless scholar slowly bring his gun to his head to end the madness within for the 10th time.\n\nMy only compaint is the XBox controller isnt perfect. Ive had issues getting it to register what I'm doing, randomly shutting off and so forth. Playing keyboard isnt an option for me because of physical issues, so I cant say if the k+M setup has the same control issues. But they are minor issues.\n\nLovecraft fans will love this one. I'd recommend it to anyone whos far more into psychological horror than gore and jumpscares horror because there isnt any of that (thank f'n god).","November 21, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's one of those "Huh, I'm enjoying this way more than I thought I would" games. It's by Yahtzee and, as it's obvious through the text of the game, this is what he was doing instead of writing a third novel. COME ON WRITE ANOTHER!!!! Anyway, the game:\n\nPROS:\n+The game is set in Britian and you're supposed to go from town to town finding information relating to which of the three dark gods. One of them is invading and you, as the player, gotta figure it out. This alone is the primary reason why you'll buy the game because, as I discovered in my exprience, I really found myself hunting for information and second guessing my findings until I was certain which god was invading. Mix this with the time limit and frailty of the character, and it becomes a glorious thing.\n+When you die, you die. Actions have consequences and you will probably bleed out while driving to your next location.\n+The time limit really adds to the tension of the game. Whenever that BUM sound happens and the big 55 hours left on the screen hits, I feel the great lovecraftian horror slowly manifesting in our world.\n+The art style is minimum but works really well.\n+Sound and music are perfect, both adding to the atmosphere.\n+The other three characters which can be unlocked play differently than the first enough to justify them.\n+When successfully banish the correct god, you really, really, REALLY feel like you've won.\n\nMIXED:\n+/- The learning curve and constantly dying when you start the game (or start a new character) can be grueling. The "Birth Stars" really help later play throughs, but you only get them after dying.\n+/- Unlocking the other characters ranges from beating the game with a good ending to randomly doing a task that an online guide has to tell you about.\n+/- The cell phone messages are perfect with ONE minor problem: If you're using a controller, which I recommend since mouse aiming isn't neccessar, be careful pressing A. Sometimes you'll decline a message when, in reality, you wanted to read it. Just warning you.\n+/- While some inventory items are really useful, others are useless to the player. There's only one use for items outside of the dungeons and that's the random encounters on the road. See below.\n\n\nCONS:\n-Many of the random encounters found on the road are a literally coin toss regardless of what action you choose if they are negative or not. Many of them have a "Run" or "Do something" with "Do Something" risking a 50/50 chance of bad. Unless you have the correct invetory item, I'd almsot recommend ignoring all of them. I feel like the investigation portion of the game is lost on these, like there should be certain words or descriptions that would signel "Run" rather than stay.\n-One of the updates reset some of my achievement progress.

While some may dislike the art style, I think the silhouette-backlight design actually works in the game's favour, as it leaves more to the imagination and emphasizes the (very effective) sound direction as well. The various challenges and achievements finally add a lot of depth, although the character balance is... debatable. Most bugs have been fixed since the original release. The writing and atmosphere are amazing, especially if you consider it's a procedurally generated roguelike. You do get used to it after a while and you develop a tolerance to the creepiness, but the game can still surprise you occasionally - especially when you're trying for a really hard challenge.\n\nThere are some issues. The game could have used more character-dependent flavour texts. The text messages are personalized for each character, but the other situations (mostly) aren't. It can break immersion somewhat at certain points since their personalities are so different. My biggest complaint is that you have to pay birth stars (character levels) to unlock new challenges. This means that a level 10 character can only get 2 (I think) stars at the start with all challenges unlocked, which makes the game even more difficult - as if it weren't difficult enough - and you'd have to play a LOT to make up for those lost stars because the XP requirement for newer levels increases exponentially. I think that area could have used a little more tweaking.\n\nFinally, I'm glad I got this on the day of the summer release for a cheaper price with Yahtzee's two novels thrown in, because the current price is really friggin' high for such a low-production (which is obviously not the same as "bad"), solo developed game in my opinion. Still, there are lots of much worse games to blow your money on with the apparent lack of quality control (Grass Simulator, Accidental Runner and the like, I'm looking at you).","November 21, 2015","true","41.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's a solid game that's enjoyable for the price, but there's just not enough vanilla content to keep me replaying it which is a big selling point for a rogue-like.\n\nAfter a few runs learning how to play the game (roughly 1-2 hours) I managed to get ending grade A after another 1-2 hours. There's nothing more the game offers in terms of content other than challenges and the endless gamemode.\nI don't believe 100% completion counts towards content, as such once you've reached a grade A ending you've seen everything the game has to offer.\n\nAt this point any additional content would likely change this review into a recommended.","January 7","false","12.3"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

I haven't even unlocked the last character yet, and I'm not even close to ending the game properly with all the other characters. The game has a lot of content, you see. I've been a fan of Yahtzee's for a while now, enjoying his earlier works, as well as the various series he does on youtube these days, so it comes as little surprise to me that he hits it out of the ball park with this one. The randomly generated nature of the game makes it different every time, and I've only ever once ran into an error with two assets not going together well and forcing me to restart the game. The writing, and  the themes of Lovecraftian cosmic horror in this game is pulled off fantastically.\nThe overarching puzzle mechanic of the game in which you must deduce who the invading god is is a fun little brain teaser. Nothing too brutal if you know what you're doing, but it can take you a bit at first.\nDon't get me wrong though, the game is brutal. Very much so. Each and every dungeon that must be explored to complete the game holds creatures spawned from the ancients. Rusted metal and deformed flesh is waiting inside to break your bones and.. make you go to a hospital. Speaking of that, the enconomy must be pretty damn good over there in the UK if you can get a set of body armor for a mere 20 pounds.\nThe dungeon sections are all enjoyable, and like I said, get pretty damn hard. But the combat is never something you can't win without practice. The dungeons are mostly exploration based anyway, and it's done well. The art style itself is, well, very reminscent of flash games, but the animation is enough to make up for it, I feel.\nPlay as Trilby, Gabe, or any of these other two random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and try to banish not-Czho-mythos-Chzo before he CONSUMES the world into his SHADOW.\nIf you like FTL, or you like Lovecraftian horror, definitely definitely definitely pick this one up. You'll be getting your moneys worth that's for sure.","February 6","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/achtung_etc/recommended/403830/","achtung_etc","achtung_etc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/achtung_etc/","51 products in account","The game does have some very telling issues: the visuals are less than flattering, the dungeon environments are repetitive, and the sound design is very average. I can hear the gap in the ambient audio loop when you visit an inflicted town, and the rain cuts out when you walk inside a house; in short, the sound design is basic, and - for the most part - is unnatural sounding. There are many minor details, apparently overlooked in development, which can take one out of the experience.\n\nDespite this, The Consuming Shadow is still largely a very immersive game. Very few games capture the heavy atmosphere of dread that is essential to survival horror, and this is something that the game does well. It is a genuinely tense and unnerving experience, with the pressure of time constantly weighing down on you as you evade enemies via the extremely clunky control scheme, exploring dungeons looking for clues so that you may potentially save the world. The puzzle system is very well designed, allowing you to hazard a guess at who the invader might be, in case you lack some information as the time runs out. It expects you to think for yourself from the information gathered, rather than simply gather clues and expect the answer to be handed to you once you've collected enough, which is rare and worth praising.\n\nPerhaps the strongest aspect of the game is the writing, and how the game treats writing as integral to the experience. It does lean somewhat towards the telling rather than showing, but the writing is solid nonetheless. Every piece of dialogue, monologue, fluff text, or any descriptions of any kind add to the overall atmosphere, and are more than barebones exposition.\n\nSo I would recommend this game; for the price it's worth checking out. It is an imaginative, tightly designed and highly atmospheric horror game that happens to be somewhat rough around the edges.","January 28","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It blends dungeon crawling and simple detective deduction work. During the course of the game, you're figuring out which god is the one invading, which one of the gods is helping them, and the god who's against both of the just because they're not partiularily fond of their cult's choice of colour. You find clues in dungeon instances when exploring towns, and during your downtime you're driving along spending money for dollar store kneepads and trying to avoid this game's version of dissentary.\n\nThe combat is what I can only describe as "artistically clunky". It's really easy for someone to shrug it off a clunky, but I kind of think it was an gameplay choice, much like how Resident Evil 4 played kind of clunky, and both times it works to the game's advantage. Bullets almost become irrelevent once you figure out the attack patterns of creatures, and you can pretty much rekt their ♥♥♥♥ by half-assedly flailing your gun if you got basic timing skills.\n\nHowever, this game isn't without it's several annoances. I'd like to think that I'm very familiar with what you can do in Game Maker, so all of these things could be corrected for sure.\n\nThe item equiping is really not mouse-friendly. You have to click on the 1-2-3 slot and then select an item from your inventory, but it's way easier if you just do a select and replace system. Just click one, click the other, and have them swap.\n\nLockpicks are completely unnessasary, outside of the final dungeon (if you have the Locksmith's Kit). There's always a set of keys someone in an accessable part of the dungeon, so waiting until you find them is always a good thing, since you get to explore more anyways and possibly find more clues. Also, I have never, ever sucessfully lockpicked a door without having to use at least 8 of them. It's pretty much against your best intrest.\n\nDunegon desiptions repeat themselves frequently, so the point where you just mash "Investage Further" and runing some of the buildup to it after you've heard about the 10th village in which everyone is errily happy. It's not really something that you can help completely, it just sucks.\n\nA majority of my playthoughs so far have consisted of me finding pretty much everyting about the god super early into the run, only having to go to stonehenge with an incomplete ritual, since the missing incantion pieces are dropped at the end of dungeon instances, where I usually find out info I already know about the gods, or I learn the lockpick spell again.\n\nAh, well. It's still an amazing game, and I say it's totally worth full price.","January 19","true","29.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now, if you’re an avid Steam user, you’d know how many dungeon crawler rough-likes there are on the market. They’re worth a dime a dozen at this point. So, I was more than pleased when I found this little gem. It's amazing how unique and promising this game is opposed to the other.\n\nPlot: A strange and horrific shadow is washing over Great Britain in full force. Cities have been ravished by otherworldly beasts, people have been melded into twisted shells of their previous selves, and in just three days, the country will fall… then the world. All mighty gods known as The Ancients are behind this mayhem, but it’s the player’s job to find out who’s to blame and banish them. You will travel from city to city, all across the UK in search of clues, answers, and knowledge.\n\nAs I mentioned before, The Consuming shadow really is its own game, and I doubt you can mistake it for another. Gameplay is rather straight forward, but it works great. You’ve got a plethora of items to find and collect, multiple ammo types, spells to master and more. Dungeons are grid based, and each one has its own objective. This may vary from securing an occult text, finding a missing person, destroying monster nests etc. And let me tell you, this game can be tough, and you will die. Monsters deal vicious damage and conserving ammo is not as easy as you might think. Driving also plays a big role in The Consuming Shadow. Driving from location to location takes time, so it’s important to set a predetermined path as to save every precious hour. But there’s a good chance you’ll bump into random events along the way. You’re usually given two choices to make, and more often than not, my decisions resulted in negative outcomes, like the loss of some health or sanity. There isn’t any pattern behind these events and making the right choice is based purely on luck.\n\nThere’s also a sanity meter that must be kept healthy. The madder you become, the more difficult the game is. But, unlike most games in the genera, dying isn’t a total lost. XP is still earned and built up through multiple playthroughs, and each time a player levels up, they’re given an array of buffs before they start their next run.\n\nNow, this is where a complaint of mine comes in. The max level is ten, and if you were to spend all ten of your buffs on health and sanity increases, it makes the game a bit underwhelming. If I’m sporting 456 health, it’s gonna take A LOT to kill me. It also makes your first bunch of playthroughs damn-near impossible, seeing as how you start off with such low stats.\n\nBut apart from that… there really isn’t much to complain about, here. The Consuming Shadows accomplishes what it aims to do with flying stars, and apart from a couple gripes, I’d say it’s definitely worth your money.","December 5, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_monkey/recommended/403830/","_monkey","Radmonkey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_monkey/","405 products in account","I like Ben Croshaw and his body of work about as much as any reasonable person can. I don't always agree with his reviews or his style, but he has cheeky charm and a sense of old-school fun that I've come to enjoy. Mogworld was lovely and rather clever. Zero Punctuation is hilarious and often insightful. This game, however, is disappointing.\n\nTL;DR: There are better roguelikes and better Lovecraftian games for around the same price point. I would struggle to recommend this game even if it were on sale.\n\nThe Consuming Shadow succeeds in two areas: difficulty and a cursory sense of novelistic credibility. I admit, Croshaw definitely pays proper dues to Howard Phillips Lovecraft. I admire his attempt at crafting a "literary" roguelike. Yahtzee definitely TRIED to capture the atmosphere of cosmic horror, and he occasionally succeeds with a taut line now and again. On the other hand, despite the "back-of-the-box" claim that there are "countless random encounters," there is little variety in the type of random events or in their textual prefacing. As of ~2 hours playtime, I have seen repetition of at least 3 of these random encounters (the hysterical woman on the side of the road, the businessman with a locked car, and the rescue of a person captured by cultists-- hilariously enough, the first time I shot the captive by accident, but the second time I was ready! Thanks, lazy programming!).\n\nLiterary though it may be, it fails to be genuinely interesting. Yes, Ben, you wrote some punchy sentences that, when jammed together according to certain scripts, make discernable paragraphs. None of these "Mad Libs: Eldritch Edition" entries are special nor particularly good. After trying very hard to enjoy the writing for some time, I began to skip virtually all of the text. It has made no difference in gameplay.\n\nLook, if you want to make a literary game, make the literature of the game important. I chuckled the first time I read "I found a black market dealer willing to sell me goods," and the fellow was selling hollowpoint ammunition and SKATEBOARD PADS. I know I'm not supposed to take it entirely seriously, but narrative consistency from a published author shouldn't be a tall order.\n\nThe game succeeds in being difficult, although not often for the right reasons. Because of the two-dimensional viewpoint, some overlapping enemies will be completely obscured at the outset of combat. Sanity loss is expressed in hallucinations and control manipulation (left is right and right is left, sometimes your character disappears, etc.) This is fun in an old-school way but is poorly executed and unbalanced. Lost ~20% of your sanity? You may end up accidentally killing yourself when the game starts flashing a suicide option over your medkit button. No, I'm not complaining that this happens, I'm frustrated that this happens with so much sanity remaining. It doesn't make sense. Hit detection is poor, and it is impossible to manually aim. On several occasions, I was staring down two or three foes and found myself unable to aim at the most dangerous, difficult-to-avoid enemy. A simple targeting option? Strangely absent.\n\nThe Consuming Shadow clearly capitalizes on the replay value associated with roguelikes, but unfortunately it doesn't provide enough variety to make it worthwhile. What are you to expect from adding handicaps from the various challenges offered? More of the same. Even as I progressed, gaining more customization options with birthsigns, for instance, (options which give the player various stat bonuses) I never felt as if I were enjoying the game more nor that the options available genuinely added to my experience. It felt lazy, just as many roguelikes feel lazy. It seems that with many indie devs, if you can't write a good story or design a good level, you make a roguelike.\n\nAdditonal notes:\n\n-Achievements are basically broken: I have received achievements for collecting all diary pages (which I haven't), rescuing 20 unbrainwashed humans (haven't done that either) and completing 50 dungeons (definitely have not done that).\n\n-Even if you can hear and partially see an enemy, if you fire from too great a distance, your shot will be wasted. It is still unclear to me why a targeting system is unavailable.\n\n-All of the encounters are either a) fetch quests b) rescue quests or c) kill quests. All of the rooms in the game are roughly the same size, and all of the locations have the same meager handful of elements to work from. Outdoor environments have leafy walls instead of plaster ones, for instance.\n\nI cannot recommend this game despite wanting to love it. I have played many roguelikes, and this is by far the most disappointing.\n\nEdit: I am extremely grateful to Steam for granting my refund in spite of my 2.1 hours of playtime, the latter 20 minutes or so which I accrued by preparing for this review.","April 15","false","2.1"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","14","27","0","1"

You are a single person trying to stop an Eldritch god from invading the world and taking over it and to stop it, you need to figure out the banishment ritual and which god is trying to enter. This game emphasizes time and resource management and how you approach situations. Rushing recklessly into a situation could cost your health, but the potential gains could be worthwhile.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Great atmosphere, music and sound effects.\n2. Using sillouettes rather than actual pictures for sprites makes you imagine what the horrors look like, which makes it much more tense.\n3. Driving from town to town builds on feelings of isolation and urgency, adding to the theme of the game.\n4. It is incredibly replayable, even with different characters.\n\nCons:\n1. The animation is incredibly stiff. I know I shouldn't dock it points but Yahtzee said two sprites make up the characer; the body and the legs, and it shows.\n2. The game is incredibly unforgiving, though this is a small complaint since you are going up against a supernatural force. The odds are indeed stacked against you.\n3. Notes and dialog tend to repeat after ten plays or so, even if it is wonderfully written.\n\nIn all honesty, buy this game and play it. It's worth the money.","November 23, 2015","true","8.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonatafanatica/recommended/403830/","sonatafanatica","SonataFanatica","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonatafanatica/","401 products in account","Here's another one of the ingenious games by Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw of "Zero Punctuation" fame. His most notable games are the four games which encompass the so-called "Chzo Mythos Games" quadrilogy of point & click adventure games: "5 Days a Stranger" (2003), "7 Days a Skeptic" (2004), "Trilby's Notes" (2006) and "6 Days a Sacrifice" (2007). While all of these games are really great, I consider "Trilby's Notes" one of the best adventure games of all time. The story alone, interspersed by brilliant flashback sequences, is an amazing experience nobody should pass up. The 2007 puzzle platformer "Trilby: The Art of Theft" featured the protagonist of the Chzo Mythos Games: Trilby, the cat burglar - a character somewhat reminiscent of Garrett from the "Thief" trilogy. The game is a bit like the 2013 game "Gunpoint", however a bit less action-oriented and with a slower pace.\n\nNow, "The Consuming Shadow" is another game which is set in the Chzo Mythos universe, but it's something completely different. This game is a roguelike variant in which an ancient god is about to invade our world. The game mechanics are very exciting and remind a bit of "The Organ Trail" (which was a zombie-themed remake of the classic education game "The Oregon Trail").\n\nYou drive around in your car (in "cockpit" perspective), choose your destination on a map and drive from town to town. (Every once in a while, various people also send you text messages on your phone.) Each town is either okay, which means you can stock up on medicine or ammo, or it is threatened by evil forces, so you have to solve the residents' problems. This is done by entering a location in a sidescrolling manner, explore it, finish a certain task and gather supplies, items and information about the ancient gods. These pieces of information can be collected in a notebook, so that you can attribute a specific color, rune, nature and intention to a specific god, figuring out which is the god that's planning to invade our world. This extensive road trip has a final destination, too: Stonehenge, where you can perform a ritual to end the threat once and for all.\n\nBeing a roguelike game, The Consuming Shadow doesn't allow saving and loading. However, each time you die, you get a certain amount of points which result in a rating and, better yet, so-called "birth stars" which function like traits or skills you can use when you start a new game. You get, for example, more health points, more sanity points, better lockpicking, a faster car, and some other advantages. This way it doesn't feel like your previous sessions were pointless, but instead serving as a great foundation for your next run.\n\nAll in all, I wholeheartedly recommend buying this game. I got the Insanity Edition from the Humble Store, which also includes Yahtzee's novels "Mogworld" and "Jam" as digital downloads. Go get it! It's WELL worth the asking price!","December 3, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Bit difficult to fully describe, to be honest, as there's a clash of game types going on here, but we have two major gameplay elements going through. Well, three technically, but there's some intermingling.\n\nFirstly, you begin the game as one of the four playable characters (the other three being unlocked over the course of playtime and challenges) with the goal of stopping a nebulous, eldritch god from invading the world and unleashing unspeakable horrors upon the people. To do this, you have your car and notebook; the first used (rather obviously) to drive around the English countryside, hitting town after town, with the intent of gathering information. Any information you find is added to your notebook, for you to peruse at your pleasure and have your own little wall of crazy to find out who the invading god is so you can adequately fight them.\n\nThe usual way you find clues and information is through the second game mode, which are a Dungeon-like environment. In these Dungeons, you'll fight against enemies spawned by the invading god, monsters and twisted horrors normally, though average folk make their appearances. The combat mechanics are extremely simple: A gun for ranged combat with three ammo types (Standard 9mm, Hollowpoint, Armour Piercing), the ability to pistol whip, and the ability to cast spells for various effects.\n\nStats in the game are also extremely simple: you get Health and Sanity, both obvious in and of themselves, although Sanity is a subtle nuisance that slowly grows bothersome throughout the game. Health is reduced by taking damage, while Sanity is reduced slightly by being damaged by monsters, by encountering terrifying or disturbing events, or by casting spells of the shadow. Effects of low sanity range from illusory monsters to dungeon doors and areas shifting, quite varied. The most dangerous mechanic, however, is in the overworld, where when you have an event or choice to make (such as in towns or when someone flags down your car), the choices may occasionally start shaking and change to "Kill Myself". Yes there's a suicide minigame, and if you fail it you die. Really encourages you to be paranoid and careful, which is what you would be when fighting eldritch horrors from another dimension.\n\nThe game's simplicity allows it to become complex through multiple playthroughs. The clues pile up after a while, and sorting through six pages of the blasted things, some of which are telling you the same information differently, becomes a logic puzzle on its own. So we know that Gnix is NOT the invading god, and the purple god hates the god of Fear, and the god of lust is identified by the EU rune, while the red god is the god of fear, that means Gnix is the purple god-wait, no, because the god identified by the EU rune is a friend of Gnix, or...\n\nIt gets confusing. And I like that.\n\nThe entire theme the game's going for is "Darkness there and nothing more." You're fighting against something that, even when you see it, is nebulous and strange and unusual, and you can't quite put your finger on what it is, you just know it's wrong. It's a well made game, with an average play time of 20-30 minutes per run, and rather enjoyable. For 10$ it's very much worth the price.","February 19","true","16.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the only time I was a little scared playing this game was when it was pitch black and I had only this dark game to illuminate the room, I would recommend this well-crafted horror game.\n\nPlaying The Consuming Shadow is no cakewalk; you will die, and you will die a lot. Dying is an integril part of it, actually, as the longer you last in a game, the more EXP you earn when you die, and the more advantages you can gain the next time you play. It's nice to know a game isn't babying me for once. This is a game for real men. Or women. Or everything else.\n\nIt's very much centered around time/resource management, and actually requires you to pay attention and apply the clues you find to figure out the mystery, rather than just letting you complete your goal after a certain point has been reached. Even when I thought I was certain as to the identity of my adversary, I was completely bamboozled when I found more clues as I approached my destination; you can never be too sure, and one slip up will cost you the world.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is the sanity meter. You know how in games such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent, being insane just makes the screen wobble, and give your character a headache that sounds like you're walking on bags of crisps? Well, insanity is actually a hindrance in this game; you cannot cast most spells while insane, as casting spells costs you sanity, it will be harder to see, doors will switch positions, and sometimes you'll just feel the overwhelming desire to put the cold barrel of the gun to your head.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend giving this game a go. The game is hard, but not to an annoying degree; if it was, I probably wouldn't play it as much as I do. It will challenge you at every opportunity, be it with stronger monsters or fighting off suicidal instinct, and that's always a plus; no one likes a game that holds your hand to walk you across the busy freeway, they're letting you walk across yourself to most likely get hit by a speeding car or pull the trigger before the cars can do it for you.\n\nOh, and if the game by itself is too easy for you, there's always Scourge of the Ancients. Have fun trying to do that, achievement hunters.\n\n...But uh, you can't actually consume the shadows, so. 0/10","February 14","true","14.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The dungeons are some of the most tense I've gone through in a game for quite a while. You'll learn to dread even the smallest monster for the entire game because every point in health/sanity counts. The problem is that once you've unlocked all the characters and gone through all the endings, there isn't much outside of a somewhat lacking 100% completion, and trying to unlock it all is pretty samey. Though to be fair, the diary pages are pretty cool, and worth getting and reading all of them. The challenges definitely help, but they may not be enough for you. The upside to that, however, is that it took me a damn long time to get to that point.

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Indie Adventure game The Consuming Shadow. The Consuming Shadow has been around for a while now, but was finally released onto Steam on November 20, 2015 by Developer/Publisher Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw.\n\n(NOTE: This game was NOT reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher, it was a game I purchased for my own account)\n\n\nVideo Review:\n\n(NO video...Shadowplay would not record this...I'm kinda scared!)\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nLovecraftian Rogue-Like is as good as that sounds. Low-quality visuals, high-quality gameplay.\n4/5 and easily worth $10\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nThe Consuming Shadow is a great Lovecraftian experience, gamers. This is good stuff here, if this is your kind of thing. Consider a blend between parts of Skyhill, FTL and the TV Show "Supernatural". That's essentially what you get here. You get texts and drive around in your car from town to town investigating events and essentially leveling (re: grinding) while finding the runes you need to succesfully cast a banishment ritual at Stonehenge to end all the evil chicanery. Good? Good. There are unlockable characters, different dungeon types, different missions, spells to learn, etc. The "Insanity Edition" on Steam adds some awesome play modes to increase replayability. There is an infinite dungeon mode known as "The Descent" and there are also Daily Challenges. This is going to be big with fans of Survival Horror, Rogue-Like Perma-Death Gameplay and especially Lovecraftian themes. The stories and events are fairly well done. The visuals are not the most modern and crisp, but aren't exactly what you are here for. To me, this is one of the only true cons. Also, if you do not like to read a bit or don't enjoy horror elements, maybe look elsewhere. All in all, a fantastic little Lovecraftian experience for me.  A solid 4/5 and hours can be lost to this little gem.

The exploration and sidescrolling parts of the game are very simple, though, and I can see it becoming monotonous since you're always facing the same enemies with the same abilities in environments with very little to distinguish between them. Some variety would improve the game, as every room looks pretty much the same as every other room and every highway looks the same as another highway. The sanity mechanic is done well; the encroaching static and the disturbing flashes of things you see when you're driving with low sanity add to the oppressive mood.\n\nI wouldn't say it's a scary game like Silent Hill or Fatal Frame, but there are surprises aplenty and the backstory is well-written and suitably Lovecraftian.

It's rigid, the visuals are weak and without any particular artistic flair, and the whole experience is dreadfully cramped and a large portion of the game hangs on the words of RNGesu, namely when random events happen on the overworld. That said, you'd be hard pressed to find a game more terrifying, and on the first playthrough the game will surprise you more than once, without the use of jump scares. As a horror game, that's probably all we could ask for.\nAnyway, on a more objective level, the game isn't particularly good, but on a subjective one, it has a special place in my heart. Maybe it'll carve one in yours with a rusty butcher knife.\n(Played the Humble Bundle edition, the differences between that and the Insanity Edition don't change this review.)","November 22, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That moment between casting the banishment ritual using the clues you'd gathered and the boss fight (or the lack thereof) is always incredibly tense, and it's euphoric being proven right (though this lessens with each playthrough). Sadly, none of the challenges do anything to try to make this aspect of the game harder - I'd love a mode where I had to decipher who the baddie was with the knowledge that there were FOUR gods in this fustercluck.\nThe game REALLY comes alive when you're close to losing (though this is true of everything, I think). When you're low on health and running away from a hunter, when you've got two minutes on the clock, are in stonehenge and have only half a banishment ritual, etc.\nOne extremely minor quibble I have (disregarding the first one) is that you can't just skip the astrology section once you've got birth stars. You HAVE to look for an empty space and choose it if you don't want any bonuses ruining your playthrough.\nIf I might suggest extra features, perhaps a hard mode where each astrology bonus comes with a penalty as well, or something - like, if you want +25 health, you have to take -25 sanity, or raising your medkit capacity means lowering your ammo-count, or something randomized.\n\nIf you want the game insultingly easy, and you've got some birth stars to spare, GET EXTRA AMMUNITION. Health and sanity are all well and good, but if you've got a tonne of ammo, you won't need to take hits to health or sanity at all. Once you maximize ammo capacity, you really only have to worry about your route and the clues - the game's extremely liberal with handing out ammo.\nAlternatively, increase Melee and keep ammo for bosses. (Almost) Every single minor enemy can easily be beaten through pistol-whipping, so just keep doing that and learn each enemy's pattern.","March 11","true","6.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's difficult for me to describe how awful this game is.\n\nFirst of all -- the game has nothing whatsoever that could be compared with H.P. Lovecraft's work.  Reviewers who keep using this in their reviews should actually read Lovecraft's work to see how truly psychological his horror was.  There's nothing psychological or suspensful about anything in this game.  Period.\n\nNext, the combat mechanics are questionable and dated -- click click click, bang bang bang.  Oh, wait a minute, the interface forgot to tell you you don't have ammo.  Sorry about that.\n\nUsually, when I feel the need to comment on a game, I try to play it for at least two hours.  This game p*sses me off so much I can't stand wasting the precious moments of my life to get to two hours.  Would a tutorial help?  Yes.  Would it make me give a positive review of this game?  No way in hell.\n\nIt's hard to believe that a developer has such little respect for consumers as to make a pointless, thrill-less, meaningfull-less game that makes you question your own sanity for buying it.  An example:  a headless body hops towards you and you click randomly at it.  There is no actual aiming, because it's a flash game -- your character (seen in blackened profile) fires at the headless body (seen in blackened profile) can either point at a 90 degree angle or not at all.  So there it is, the headless body is kicking the crap out of you and so you duck into a side room.  You're notified that running away from monsters reduces your sanity.  Why?\n\nSuffice it to say that I question my own sanity for putting in .3 hours of my life into this game!\n\nThe more I play games on steam that claim they are "Lovercraftian" or "atmospheric horror", the more I begin to believe that the developer was lazy and didn't want to invest time in the graphics, or did not know how.\n\nAs a casual gamer who counts the moments of my life preciously -- family, career, responsibilties, the need to escape from frustration -- this game served only to make me feel stupid for spending $5.  That's a lot of money to me, believe it or not -- I have four kids and a grandkid that, like many of us, works hard to support.  If I had spent $10 I most likely would have written a formal apology to my wife for spending that much of my Christmas money on this crap.\n\nPlease, for God's sake, don't waste your money of this game.  If you do and you get as angry as I am -- don't say I didn't warn you.\n","January 3","false","0.3"," 6 of 75 people (8%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","8","6","75","3","13"

You need to solve a mystery using a variety of clues that you need to desperately scavange from monster infested dungeons. You have a certain amount of time to solve said mystery, and if you get it wrong, it's all over.\nYou'll need to use your brain for this one. What do the clues mean? Do I have enough clues? Will I have enough time to get more? There's no one way to find the solution to the problem you're presented with, as everything is procedurally generated each time you play. And remember, if you don't get them all, you can always guess.\n- The replay value of The Consuming Shadow is one of it's biggest selling points, I've only played for a few hours, but I can't help but return to it to try and achieve all the different endings, or even to have a crack at the daily challenge.\n- The tone of a game like this is important, and in my opinion, The Consuming Shadow nails it perfectly. It's not the kind of horror that jumps out at you, but rather the kind of horror that may or may not be lurking around every corner. And... Well... You're never gonna be sure if there truly is something stalking you until it's burying it's teeth in your stupid face. The constant stress of a incomprehensible dark mass chasing you is thrilling, and at times really rather terrifying, which leads me onto my next point.\n- It's actually scary at times. The music provided is nothing crazy or over-the-top, but it helps to add to the constant feeling of misery and the eventual demise of the entire universe, unless you do something to stop it. Plus, the big ticking clock very blatently in your field of view the entire time adds so much to the experience. You need to manage your time appropriately, and if you don't, don't expect to get very far.\n- The last point I want to bring up concerns the lore of the game, and overall story. I'm not too sure I get it yet, and even if I did I wouldn't spoil it for anyone reading this, as it's meant to be worked out and interpretted in your own way. It's certainly mysterious, that's all I'll day.\n\nWhat I Don't Like So Much:\n- The visuals aren't great, and if you've seen any screenshots, you'll be thinking the same thing. Everything looks rough and most assets lack polish. The monster design is quite nice and the sillhouette style is commendable, but everything else is just lacking in the visual department\n(Although I do feel that the visual style of The Consuming Shadow is part of it's personality, and I've come to quite like it, it's completely understandable for it to put you off at first).\n- The levelling up system feels a bit... odd. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of levelling a character, and then being able to use a certain amount of points, or "birth stars" to give buffs to my character, but it's just too easy to exploit. By sticking birth stars in the right places I can give myself 200+ health and just be an unstoppable force of supernatural detective-ness. Or if I don't want to do that, I can focus heavily into health and sanity, giving myself about 150 in each, maybe more. Yes, I'm missing out on some other possible bonuses, but I'm literally so sane that I can look at all of the giant Lovecraftian death monsters and just shrug them off. This is definitely a problem for the main game (not including the challenges) as it's so exploititive. I believe a fix for this would be only allowing one star in each sign, or at the very least preventing people from placing stars in the exact same place.\n- The combat is... Okay. It takes a bit of getting used to, and I think it's definitely passable enough to keep people entertained, but it's not the game's strongpoint at all. It's quite clunky and without practice can be slightly jarring.\n\nSo, overall, I really like The Consuming Shadow. I think it's a great little indie game with plenty of replayability, and where it lacks in terms of visual fidelity and combat, it makes up for in terms of great writing and atmosphere.\nIf it sounds like your thing, give it a go, I think you'll enjoy it.","December 7, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Can you banish the Ancient before the looming Shadow consumes us all?\nThe Consuming Shadow is a Lovecraftian Horror, hybrid adventure/action/detective roguelike game. Don't expect to get the best ending on your first run. Or your fifth. Or twentieth. The truly random nature of dungeons, shop equipment and random events makes every single playthrough different and challenging. I've been playing since the Humble release, and I just recently got the best ending.\n\nYour main goal sounds deceptively simple - collect clues to find out which God is invading and what rune they’re associated with, deduce the four runes of the Banishment Ritual, then finally travel to Stonehenge and banish the hostile invading God. As you travel through the UK, you will be tasked with liberating fallen towns and keeping others safe from the influence of the Shadow. Hostages need rescuing, but sometimes it's too late. And make sure to keep an eye on the clock - the God is punctual and if you haven’t reached Stonehenge and banished it in time, you lose.\n\nFinding out which God is invading and which of the five Runes they are associated with is not always easy, and neither is assembling the banishment ritual. Clues about each of the three gods, their color, aspect, rune and relationship to the other gods are hidden in dungeons, and the banishment ritual runes are often given as rewards for completing them. Sometimes you may find a lot of clues early on, and others you may find yourself with only a few hours left when you finally uncover the secret. Don’t let a lack of clues discourage you, though - if you think you have a good idea of the God’s rune and the banishment ritual and time is short, you can hoof it to Stonehenge and go in on your best guess.\n\nTry to keep your health and sanity intact while you explore a variety of dungeons, slaying monsters with guns, melee attacks and (at the cost of some sanity) some helpful magic. Locked doors can interfere with your progress, and you’re not always lucky enough to find the keys, so keep your lockpicks handy. As your sanity drops, you’ll be plagued by a variety of problems, from illusory enemies to accidentally clicking the “Kill Yourself” option while trying to find supplies in town. Sometimes you’ll break an arm or a leg. You may become so anxious that firing your gun accurately becomes nearly impossible. Grotesque monsters like the Buzzer, a giant wasp-like creature; the Puker, a twisted humanoid that clings to the ceiling and vomits acid at you; and the Birther, a writhing mass that attacks by giving birth at you (no, really) will try to keep you from your goal. Unkillable hunters like the Overseer and the Tall Man will sometimes chase you from dungeons once you've reached your goal. These threats and more, plus the ever-looming 60 hour countdown clock, create a choking atmosphere of anxiety and horror.\n\nThe magic system is unique. Instead of having spells to start with and a traditional mana bar, you can find spells such as Clairvoyance (reveal the entire dungeon map), Healing Touch (regain HP), or Mass Death (deal heavy damage to everything in the room) as random drops in dungeons. Casting the spells requires the incantation of the correct runes, and every time you cast a spell, you lose some sanity. You can cast runes at random hoping to discover a spell, but casting the wrong runes can deal a pretty heavy blow to your sanity.\n\nAlongside ammo and spells, you’ll encounter a variety of useful items as you progress through the game. Body Armor makes you take less damage, the Rosary helps keep your sanity intact, the Lucky Charm skews the odds in your favor a bit when it comes to finding items and ammo. Plenty of other items have helpful effects such as staving off certain status effects, and random events will sometimes go better if you have certain items with you.\n\nDriving between the towns, there’s a chance that you’ll encounter random events, such as a husband attacking his wife, passing a nearby Church and wondering if you should drop in, or even getting pulled over by the police. Even using your best judgement, sometimes these things go wrong, and you can be pretty heavily penalized. I’ve had runs wherein I basically ignored all random events because I was having good luck and didn’t want to take too many risks.\n\nAn innovative level-up system allows you to customize your bonuses each time you play. Each level you gain grants you a Birth Star, which you can place in the sky to get bonuses to Sanity, Health, Ammo Capacity, Lockpicking Chance, etc. Some of the available bonuses are random, but I believe that Health and Sanity are always an options (which is good, because you’re going to need both of them. A lot.) Will you boost your health and focus on melee combat, or boost your sanity and cripple your opponents with magic? However you play, you’ll be dealing with random encounters, managing limited resources and hoping against hope that you can get the clues with enough time left to survive Stonehenge, banish the invading god and save us all.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to fans of Horror, Adventure games and Roguelikes. Although the graphics are a bit basic, the overall atmosphere is fantastic and with three unlockable characters, the replayability is nearly infinite. Challenge modes, daily challenges, and The Descent (an infinite dungeon) have been added to the game for the Steam release, as well as nearly 100 achievements (and trading cards are on the way). There’s so much more to it that I haven’t even touched on in this review, but I want to let you discover that for yourself.\n\nGood luck, Scholars.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046008636/recommended/403830/","76561198046008636","Crimson Lobstrosity","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046008636/","293 products in account","I was very surprised by The Consuming Shadow.\nThe idea of a Lovecraftian Rogue-like dealing with the concept of cosmic horror is certainly an interesting one, and who better to make it than Yahtzee Croshaw, the maker of the brilliant video game review series Zero Punctuation.\nWhat I Like:\n- The concept is definitely worth praising right off the bat, especially when you see how this relates to the gameplay. You need to solve a mystery using a variety of clues that you need to desperately scavange from monster infested dungeons. You have a certain amount of time to solve said mystery, and if you get it wrong, it's all over.\nYou'll need to use your brain for this one. What do the clues mean? Do I have enough clues? Will I have enough time to get more? There's no one way to find the solution to the problem you're presented with, as everything is procedurally generated each time you play. And remember, if you don't get them all, you can always guess.\n- The replay value of The Consuming Shadow is one of it's biggest selling points, I've only played for a few hours, but I can't help but return to it to try and achieve all the different endings, or even to have a crack at the daily challenge.\n- The tone of a game like this is important, and in my opinion, The Consuming Shadow nails it perfectly. It's not the kind of horror that jumps out at you, but rather the kind of horror that may or may not be lurking around every corner. And... Well... You're never gonna be sure if there truly is something stalking you until it's burying it's teeth in your stupid face. The constant stress of a incomprehensible dark mass chasing you is thrilling, and at times really rather terrifying, which leads me onto my next point.\n- It's actually scary at times. The music provided is nothing crazy or over-the-top, but it helps to add to the constant feeling of misery and the eventual demise of the entire universe, unless you do something to stop it. Plus, the big ticking clock very blatently in your field of view the entire time adds so much to the experience. You need to manage your time appropriately, and if you don't, don't expect to get very far.\n- The last point I want to bring up concerns the lore of the game, and overall story. I'm not too sure I get it yet, and even if I did I wouldn't spoil it for anyone reading this, as it's meant to be worked out and interpretted in your own way. It's certainly mysterious, that's all I'll day.\n\nWhat I Don't Like So Much:\n- The visuals aren't great, and if you've seen any screenshots, you'll be thinking the same thing. Everything looks rough and most assets lack polish. The monster design is quite nice and the sillhouette style is commendable, but everything else is just lacking in the visual department\n(Although I do feel that the visual style of The Consuming Shadow is part of it's personality, and I've come to quite like it, it's completely understandable for it to put you off at first).\n- The levelling up system feels a bit... odd. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of levelling a character, and then being able to use a certain amount of points, or "birth stars" to give buffs to my character, but it's just too easy to exploit. By sticking birth stars in the right places I can give myself 200+ health and just be an unstoppable force of supernatural detective-ness. Or if I don't want to do that, I can focus heavily into health and sanity, giving myself about 150 in each, maybe more. Yes, I'm missing out on some other possible bonuses, but I'm literally so sane that I can look at all of the giant Lovecraftian death monsters and just shrug them off. This is definitely a problem for the main game (not including the challenges) as it's so exploititive. I believe a fix for this would be only allowing one star in each sign, or at the very least preventing people from placing stars in the exact same place.\n- The combat is... Okay. It takes a bit of getting used to, and I think it's definitely passable enough to keep people entertained, but it's not the game's strongpoint at all. It's quite clunky and without practice can be slightly jarring.\n\nSo, overall, I really like The Consuming Shadow. I think it's a great little indie game with plenty of replayability, and where it lacks in terms of visual fidelity and combat, it makes up for in terms of great writing and atmosphere.\nIf it sounds like your thing, give it a go, I think you'll enjoy it.","December 7, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Solid design and the investigative gameplay is really fun. It's brutal and you both have to rush, due to the restrictive time limit, and take your time as to not take heavy damage to either your health or sanity.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone.
