This is not the programming game you want to buy. It is not worth the money, and it is not currently, by my standards, a finished puzzle game, much less one that teaches any reasonable amount of programming.\n\nIt is a beautiful idea for a game, and a very clever title for the idea. But this game does not live up to the beauty of its idea. If you must buy it, wait for the game that purports to teach programming to at least be itself adequately programmed. That is not the game that is available right now.\n\nHack 'n' Slash is a game in which you swing your USB sword to, instead of slaying things, set their hit points to 0. I can offer no higher praise for the integration of the "hacking" in the game for the first few minutes of gameplay. Instead of attacking the turtle, you hack its allegiance so it becomes your ally. Instead of finding the right order of blocks to push for a block pushing puzzle, you simply hack the number of remaining pushes allowed for one block. Reprogramming the movement of the guards was hilarious.\n\nThen, just as quickly as the fun begins, the clever puzzle design disintegrates.\n\nThe coding is still painfully inaccessible and unserviceable—if you're a programmer, it's boring and tedious for no apparent reason, and if you're not a programmer, there's no chance you'll really even understand the puzzle as it's presented. As an experienced programmer, putting together the clues using detailed understanding of how programming generally works got me through the "programming puzzles", but left me painfully frustrated by how obtuse they were guaranteed to be for someone who didn't automatically know that "HackBlock 1" is probably the same in-game object as "blocks[1]". I see no reason to relate a red letter 'a' directly to a red diamond symbol other than educated guesswork. A game which requires trial and error is fine, but a game that requires too much backtracking between trials and crashes when you don't know what you're doing is not a game that encourages learning.\n\nThe most frustrating thing for me was when I immediately saw the solution the programmers intended, but also that there were far more obvious and trivial solutions. Let's take a hypothetical locked gate as an example: if instead of entering the prescribed password, you simply toggled some output value from "false" to "true," you might bypass the intended lesson entirely. Not only are the puzzles poorly thought out, they don't even enforce the intended lesson. I can't imagine anything other than inexperienced players blundering their way through the "puzzles."\n\nThe game crashes when the built-in LUA interpreter falls apart, because instead of being a sandboxed interpreter, the game runs code you throw at it natively, and I wouldn't be surprised if the game was a legitimate security vulnerability for getting admin access to the local machine. What's worse, the programming conventions used are distracting, if not outright confusing. The variables that are useful to hack aren't even always next to the lines of code they relate to, requiring mundane back calculation or walking around to find the right variable.\n\nImagine if a game that wasn't about programming presented these qualities: for instance, you found yourself in a hallway with five switches, and the purpose of the switches only marginally explained to you. There is absolutely no feedback to tell you what each switch does, unless you've solved the puzzle, or unknowingly triggered a fail state. What's worse, these fail states cause you to lose any forward progress made not only on the current 5-switch puzzle, but also the 3-switch puzzles that you've managed to solve in the same hallway. This is not what I consider a good puzzle game, but it is exactly the sort of scenario Hack 'n' Slash unforgivingly drops players into. Where traditional games undergo thorough testing to prevent the player from causing crashes, Hack 'n' Slash markets the total (and completely unnecessary) instability of the game as a feature. Can you imagine an point and click adventure game that crashed when you used the wrong item on the wrong target? How is this fun for the player? Why aren't they simply preventing unnecessary modifications, and adding iteration limits and variable scopes to prevent accidents? The puzzles are poorly designed, and just aren't fun.\n\nAnd now for the rest of the game. As adventure games go, this game feels incomplete: shoddy collision detection make movement a confusing dance, total lack of information on what can and can't be done makes even thinking about solutions total guesswork.Traditional adventure games leave a trail of breadcrumbs to lead you along, and a useful assistant who makes sure the player is at least going in the right direction. Not so in this half-done game. Between acts the player is expected to know where they should romp for five minutes to get to the next destination, and while this could be "part of the puzzle" in some twisted logic the latter half of the game is a series of tedious activities: wander until you reach the next scripted destination, randomly permute code until success. Nothing is named in a useful fashion, nothing is provided, and the game gives you more ways to cause a crash than it does any meaningful direction towards a smart solution. There's invariably way too much information available as "clues," and the player has no idea what's useful and what's just there because the programmers thought it would be cool. I spend so much time wading through unnecessary details for reasons I don't understand to solve puzzles that aren't even intellectually challenging so much as they are a series of inside jokes. The final puzzles aren't so much arcane wizardry as they are exercises in variable tweaking, and there's not even any guide to explain which variables should really be tweaked to start with. Behaviors not explained before or after a particular puzzle are used and so players shouldn't even know to try the things the developers expect us to know.\n\nAs someone who actually studied computer science, incidentally, I'm disappointed by what the game refers to as algorithms. None of the implementations are meaningfully quantifiable algorithms. This is what most saddens me, to be honest: there are so many beautiful, challenging, and meaningful problems in computer science that programming games could explore and teach. Even the final chapter of the game, purported to be a legitimate programming challenge with actual security applications, boils down to a series of password reading tricks used earlier, or the mundane "wander, hack, permute" process. I was hoping to maybe see some binary search, or some loop iteration, or even just simple mathematics to inject actual challenge into the game, but instead found myself going through the exact motions I go through when debugging ugly, poorly written code. "If x ==y continue" tells me nothing about how many lines are actually part of the if statement, by the way. LUA probably wouldn't have been my first choice as a language for making the code readable to nonprogrammers. Might have been smarter to create a simpler, if still Turing complete domain specific version of LUA that doesn't throw unfamiliar terms like jump statements and closure operations. I'm saddened by the possibility that LUA was chosen not because it's a beautiful, educational language but because it made executing user code easy (and highly destructive and universe-collapsing). I spent more time shaking my head at the programming choices than solving the puzzles, and even more time wondering why Double Fine failed to even make the non-programming parts of the game enjoyable. It plays like a very promising alpha, which would be encouraging, if the game wasn't being marketed as a full release.\n\nThis is not a programming game. This is not a well-programmed game. And what's worse, this is not even a good game.

The first half of the game should be doable by almost anyone, but as soon as actual code is shown and modifiable (end of Act 4 and all of Act 5), it can be overwhelming.\n* The code you can hack is displayed in a very hard to understand way. I heard it's based on the game's Lua bytecode. Why not let people see/modify the source code instead? Bytecode is not meant to be read by humans.\nYou can see the code as text, or there is a sort of visual representation with machines and crystals, but it's just too confusing. As a professional programmer, I grasped most of it, but I think most people won't.\n* The graphics look mostly bad. The characters are OK but the backgrounds... The level design is meh, with many useless paths and dead ends.\n* The music is forgettable\n* A bit on the short side, with low replay value unless you just want to test how far you can go with the hacking. But then why not program your own game instead?\n* The ending is surprising but weird, nonsensical and abrupt to me.\n\nPros:\n* Awesome base concept\n* Some of the puzzles are quite cleverly made\n* The "Double Fine touch" is here, with quirky characters and dialogs, but it's a bit weak. Psychonauts is way better in that regard.\n* It's challenging for your brain for those who like that.\n\nNot really a pro nor a con:\n* Near the end I think I skipped an important scene completely with hacking. That's pretty cool but I'm missing part of the story!\n* It's only in English. I didn't really mind even though I'm French, but some people will. I think it would be really hard to translate such a game anyway (all the game's variables and functions would have to be translated)\n\nConclusion:\nIf you are a programming junkie, a bit curious, or just want to challenge your brain, buy this game when it gets cheaper.

Others will probably be confused and disappointed. This review itself will likely not make that much sense to the latter group.\n\nIt's in the current Humble Bundle Weekly at the $1 tier (ends 2015-11-5). Worth it at that price for sure.\n\nThis is not a "programming" game (like TIS-100, SpaceChem, Human Resource Machine, etc). It is a "hacking" game.\n\nIt is definitely not a "Hack and Slash" game as it may seem to be at first glance. There is very little of anything resembling a normal game here, although it has a vaguely Zelda-esque facade.\n\nAs a minor connoisseur of sorts when it comes to programming/hacking games, I'm not aware of any other game that has done what HnS has (Edit: The more recently released Else Heart.Break() seems to do something similar, but I haven't played it yet).\n\nThe title is more of a proof of concept than a fully featured game. Not really a surprise at this point coming from Double Fine. But the proof of concept alone should be worth the price of admission and the time for those interested in this sort of thing.\n\nMost of the game is written in Lua (a very common game scripting language). The game (gradually) exposes the ability to modify itself, but only to a limited extent. You start off being able to only modify some instance variables of certain entities (and later a handful of game instance globals, if you can find them). Eventually you gain the ability to examine the code of just about everything, but you can only modify constants (including the names of called functions in some cases). You can also swap a few operators.\n\nAlthough that sounds like a lot of power, there is actually fairly little you can do that is interesting or useful. The majority of the "puzzles" reduce to finding the right variable or operator to alter in typically fairly mundane ways (e.g. flip a bool, comparison operator, make a number very large or very small). That's not all that surprising considering how difficult it is to accomplish something more meaningful from a gameplay perspective in this kind of system. But what is there is reasonably fun/amusing. And thankfully it doesn't grow old because the game is quite short.\n\nTypically hackable entities can be "hacked" (have their state/instance vars altered) by attacking them with a weapon. Later in the game, you gain the ability to hack into a larger variety of entities by actually modifying the code (again, only specific parts of the code). This is done in an unusual, noteworthy fashion:\n\nInstead of simply editing the code text/values directly, a visual/spatial representation of the code is created in which you can walk around and modify particular constants and operators.\n\nStrangely, when the game shows you the Lua code, it doesn't actually show you the raw code. Instead, it displays it in a rather strange, awkward syntax that actually makes it more obfuscated than it is in the original Lua (for a typical programmer, at least). I guess it could be said that this better immerses already experienced programmers, forcing them to "learn" the system even if they already know Lua.\n\nNear the end of the game, you also gain the ability to browse the entire(?) lua game source. This is represented as a library in game, where each level of the library is a directory, and staircases are the means for directory traversal. Individual files are books on a bookshelf that can be stored in your inventory for direct hacking later. Again, despite how much power this seemingly conveys, the actual usefulness of this is quite limited. But it's a cool experiment.","November 1, 2015","true","9.0"," 117 of 132 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","117","132","2","2"

It's not puzzle, oh no, not your every day 'explore-and-find-clues' puzzle, it's a confusing, excrusiatingly painful coding experience.\n\nWorst of all, this game -crashes-, and by that I mean ALL the time. Any event where you mess up on either hacking things, digging into Algorithm, you have the potential to slam into different kind of bugs that the developer didn't iron out. If you hit too many bugs, it wouldn't even allow you to go back to your previous setting (An item in game that basically rewind what you do), forcing you to shut down the game and restart.\n\nOption menu is totally devoided of any options other than choosing fullscreen/window mode, as well as sound.

I've played the game until act 4, after a set of 3 easier puzzles that were quickly followed by puzzles incomprehensible to me, no matter how hard I tried.\n\nOverview: Hack 'n' Slash is a puzzle game with a small share of action. The puzzles are all related to programming, starting with simple stuff anyone should be able to sort out, but rapidly escalating to puzzles that require solid programming knowledge. You control a girl with her sprite friend and they collect tools that help you with the hacking, while trying to ultimately defeat an evil wizard.\n\nPros:\nAwesome concept\nCute graphics\nInteresting puzzles (as far as I was able to solve them, anyway)\nThe puzzles starting in the act 4 seem great, too--even better, actually-- if you're able to understand them, that is\nFunny characters and dialogues (but nothing special or memorable)\nProbably a good programming training session (but I'm just guessing)\nCons:\nAlmost no tutorial when the hacking gets really hard--if they had taken their time to make a great tutorial, it would probably be playable by everyone, but it isn't\nRequires solid programming knowledge and it really should be written in huge letters somewhere in the store page--since it's not, it feels like they're trying to fool people into buying a game they won't be able to play\nAction part of the game is clumsy, boring, and totally unnecessary\nAlthough there's controller support, it sucks--stick to your keyboard\nMusic is a bit annoying, even when you haven't reprogrammed the game speed\nBought on: I got it as a Christmas gift from Sweetheart Gamer! Thank you, despite everything. Sorry to rate a gift with thumbs down (again, but fair is fair). Well, if you care to know, it's been as cheap as US$ 4.54 (R$ 8,83) on Steam.\n\nVerdict: If you can't program (lua, I guess), STAY AWAY! You won't learn it in this game. You might get through acts 2 and 3, but you'll be stuck on act 4, and I'm 100% sure of that. And starting a game you won't be able to complete without a guide is more frustrating than not even trying. Well, if you are familiar with programming, lua, and all that stuff, then you'll probably enjoy it, despite its other minor flaws. So it's a thumbs down for most people, thumbs up for a few others.\n\nSimilar games: If you ended up on this game while looking for something similar to the classic 2D Zelda, you should try Ittle Dew, for both Ittle Dew and Hack 'n' Slash have the same sense of humor, graphics have their similarities--only Ittle Dew doesn't require you to know how to program.","January 9, 2015","false","3.3"," 74 of 87 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","74","87","2","0"

Just finished the game a few minutes ago. I'm happy to say that the bombs are great, they work very well. And the completed Act 5 is nice. But that's about it. After beating the game, I really don't have any incentive to go back and play it again. I know I still have secrets to discover, artifacts to find, and thousands of lines of Lua to exploit, but there's no reason why I should. I think the only hope this game has of being played again is if I forget how I solved all of the puzzles, and forget that I spent $20 on this thing. Unless there are even more updates coming in the future, this game is not worth $20. Maybe half that, at the most.\n\nYou had so much potential, Hack 'n' Slash. I'm so sorry.\n\nUntil that potential is met, rating revised to a solid 7/10 for gameplay. However, too overpriced at $20. Would not recommend.\n\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW:\n\nA great game, even at this current state. Yes, it's unfinished, but what is present already, when combined with the game's visible potential, makes it worth the money.\n\nA few things I would really like to see in future updates:\n* a completed Act V\n* a larger world to explore\n* something to explain why the game starts at Act II instead of the logical Act I (or even Act 0, considering this is about hacking)\n* more uses for the bombs (You get to use them once!

What begins as a generally fun and interesting educational puzzle game quickly devolves into a frustrating mess. The conveyance and presentation of important concepts, most notably the algorithm puzzles, is opaque. The paper-thin storyline, flat dialogue, and cardboard-cutout characters do nothing to make the puzzle headache worthwhile.\n\nThere are definitely a couple of good ideas that went into this game, but they're not developed adequately in the short playtime. The scarcity of interactive elements in the world makes the whole experience feel perfunctory and lifeless. With the sole exception of the clever and engaging boss fight with the corrupted turtle king early in the game, none of this really felt very fun. I managed to inadvertently skip about half of the prison level by rushing past the boss with the movement speed hack, which screwed me a bit later in the game as I was unable to decipher the runes made visible with the Third Eye Hat. The feeling the experience most left me with overall is confusion and frustration.\n\nIt took me about 3 hours in total to complete Hack N Slash, but I gave up and consulted a walkthrough upon being trapped in the algorithm puzzle caves of act IV. Had I not, I would likely never have been able to finish the game. Perhaps everything would have made more sense to a programmer, but it didn't to me and Double Fine made little effort to ameliorate that. Overall, this game is not worth $20.

Despite that, this game was a disappointment. The puzzles are either uninspired or obscure, the game is liable to crash often, and the dialogue is grating.\n\nSome of the early problems were promising, but simple. "Hacking" objects to modify high-level object properties made for some novel challenges, but there are few enough hackable objects and few enough properties within each that most of these puzzles reduced to "hack problem object, adjust obvious property."\n\nAt some point in the game we are given the ability to actually examine and edit objects' code. Unfortunately this also leads to either frustrating or overly simple puzzles. Many times in the game we simply enter an object's code and change it's "isHackable" property to true, then hack the object and change some obvious property. A fine puzzle to solve once, but to use it at several critical points seems repetitive.\n\nI'm not familiar with Lua (the langauge the player manipulates in-game) and figured this game would at least give me a sense of the language. This was not the case. The structure of the in-game code was such that its purpose was often impossible to decipher - loops and conditions were presumably present but all code was displayed in a perfectly linear manner and I emerged even more confused about Lua than when I began.\n\nMost of the late-game programming puzzles offer up the bit of code to be modified pretty easily. Upon entering an object's code you can visit various subclasses and functions, most of which are long and clearly critical to the game's normal function. The game does allow you to visit these blocks of code (though this sometimes crashes the game with longer sections) and does allow you to modify them, but their size and codepenence generally means that no meaningful changes can be made without "crashing the game" (errors created by the player result in the "end of the universe" and you must reload), and puzzles are rarely solved by doing so.\n\nIn contrast, other blocks of code have a very different style - short and with clearly labeled variables that pertain to the puzzle at hand. Identifying which blocks the game invites you to modify is pretty easy based only on this clear difference in style, and once you've found the critical function you can often change a simple boolean or integer without really understanding what you're doing, and solving the puzzle.\n\nThis is not to say the game is a breeze - many puzzles are not obvious. The challenge comes not from the innovation of the puzzles but by their obscurity. No direction is given to the player in several key sections, and it's often unclear whether you simply don't have the object required to get past a challenge, or if you haven't dig deep enough in the code.\n\nThe final puzzle was especially unrewarding. A deep delve into the final boss's code was fun, and I finally mananged to convice the boss to destroy itself. Success! ...or, nope, I'm just stuck in the boss screen with no boss. I reloaded and tried a different tactic, but this one defeated the boss as well as destroyed the universe. Suspecting a bug, I turned to a guide which presented a third, equally viable code tweak which was arbitrarily selected as the "correct" one by the designers and moved the plot forward.\n\nI also was able to accidentally skip a final puzzle by reloading at a particular spot (which I only realized by reading a guide after completing the game), which makes me unsure if this happened at other points in the game.\n\nA final note is the humor: The writers try painfully hard to make witty dialogue but it comes across as juvenile and bizzare. I'm a fan of good humor, high- or low-brow, but this game delivers neither.\n\nI DID finish the game in the hopes that such a novel concept would yield at least a few inspired puzzles or challenges, and admittely a few did come close. Riding the line between puzzle game and programming chalenge, ultimately the game fails as either. To programmers and puzzlers, I advise you to seek fun elsewhere.","January 5","false","6.0"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","39","42","0","0"

For a game as complex as this there really should be an objective indicator for those who want to progress the story. Those who want to fiddle about with any piece of code they can touch can do that if they want, but for those who want to go towards progression at all times, this game is very frustrating. I found myself wandering aimlessly several times with not a clue where to go until I looked up a guide, or simply stopped playing in anger. To be clear: I was not stuck on puzzles, I just had no idea where to go to get to the next puzzle etc.\n\nThe way the code is presented to you is very hard to understand. I am currently a computer science student at my university, so I know how to write code and make programs, mainly in Java, C, C++ etc, at the moment, and not Lua itself, but I know that no language looks like this game tries to make it look. Apparently it is based on the games Lua bytecode which FYI is not meant to be read by humans, it is meant for the computer to compile. If it were based on actual Source Code for the game, maybe it would be easier to grasp. But the implication of those weird crystals to represent hundreds of different things inside functions? Forget it. I can normally grasp programming ideas pretty quickly and easily, but in this game, I couldn't understand a thing during Act 5. This also links back to the previous point, if I was told perhaps what place to search in or maybe what function to investigate, not specifically what to do etc but at least a clue? Maybe then it would be easier to see what needed to be modified. Others may disagree with this one, but I personally found it very hard to grasp.\n\nThe entire atmosphere of this game is basically designed to be annoying. The sounds get extremely repetitve and annoying e.g going in and out of several functions in short amount of time. This also ties in with the first point, when wandering aimlessly not knowing where to go, I get frustrated a lot easier, so this may contribute to the fact that I'm complaining about this as well.\n\nALL IN ALL I think this game could have been great with different execution, and easier to understand interfaces/functions and such. As it is, I will not be completing it without a walkthrough of the (final?) Act 5, as I cannot progress on my own from here it seems.\n\n4/10\n\nEDITED 10/11/14\n\nI've been learning all about C this year in school, and I know now what the GOTO statements are really meant to do. You see these EVERYWHERE in the coding of the functions in the game, and they are one of the most out of date things ever. We learned in class that if you use Goto your code will be very difficult for people who are not yourself to read and manipulate so the fact that they spammed goto in the coding for this game is just ridiculous. It is much more clear to use definitive logic like if-else than goto. Although it is still valid syntax, stylistically it is horrible, especially considering this game was MADE to be read and manipulated...\n\n2/10\n:)","September 16, 2014","false","5.1"," 91 of 126 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","91","126","0","4"

It's a cheater's (and a critical thinker's) game. The only way to beat it is to cheat. No, really. The game kept it's difficulty consistent, as long as I cheated where, when, and how it's appropriate to. Simply put, it's like Game Genie/Gameshark/Action Replay/Cheat Engine not being used to cheat, exactly, but more as a series of tools to make progress, one way or another. For example, instead of avoiding enemies, be an enemy, and you'll hide in plain sight. Simple as that.\n\nAll the *cough*narrow-minded*cough* nay-sayers can say all they want, I enjoyed this. Took some serious lateral and Gestalt thinking in some areas to make the most of my situations. Ironically, I'm not the brightest person to play this game, but more often than not, I was able to keep a grasp of the big picture. I barely know crap about programming (learned a little more, with active examples as game elements), and yet, I beat it the same day I started it (with a few accidental crashings by my own clumsy code); simply put. Once more, to win, you must cheat. You don't need to be a 1337 hax0r; just be wise when, where, and how to modify things.\n\nThis game pretty much summarizes one of my life mottos the best:\n"There's always a simple solution to an otherwise complex problem."\n\nSometimes, people just think too hard, or not enough. Wisdom is required in this game more than intelligence. Oh, and before you accuse me of using FAQs and the like, the most I ever needed one was for a story item that seemed out of reach, with nowhere else to go (I did things correctly before looking, apparently I just encountered a bug when trying to collect it that prevented me from being able to pick it up). That aside, I figured out the rest. Oh yeah, and I managed to skip one or two parts by merely brute-forcing my own solution the developers didn't think of (one word, bridges. I didn't need to code a part of it to pass ^_^. Did my own brand of cheating in a game about cheating.).","July 3, 2015","true","6.5"," 51 of 63 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","51","63","6","0"

Later on it devolves into messy visual rooms of code that are more difficult to understand than actual code. Useless for someone without an understanding of coding concepts and for anyone else too simple to break through.\n\nThe story is rather dull and lacks direction. A huge amount of my time spent in this game is simply wandering around the world trying to figure out where to go rather than actually solving any puzzles.\n\nThe art style is very attractive but gets ruined by an item picked up later in the game which puts a messy overlay over this.\n\nThis game could really have benefitted with additional content, more purpose made interesting puzzles, a well thought out driving story rather than a balled up handful of clichés. The concept provides a basis for a useful way to introduce people to the concepts of programming which they managed well to a certain point after which it feels they lost focus, gave up and stamped it as finished.\n\nThe concept is great hopefully future games will learn from this game and improve upon it and create something fun and educational.","November 8, 2014","false","5.8"," 49 of 61 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","49","61","0","0"

One puzzle literally took me an hour because I could not figure it out. Near the end of the game, you can skip a portion of events by changing one event for another.\n\nThe interface is a real doozy at times, too. It took me a few minutes to get in the exact right spot to hack your sprite, and it also took me a couple minutes to find the exact right spot to grab the loupe.

You get a hat that lets you see overlays, then not even ten minutes later, you get an item that lets you toggle the overlay so you can use other items.\n\nThat said, this game is fairly unique and relatively enjoyable... despite getting stuck in three or four different places.

And if you mess around too much you'll crash the game. When it crashes you can go back in time to earlier states: it has version control. If you know what you're doing it's not a hard game at all and most puzzles are pretty straight forward.\n\nThe problem with it is that the story and pacing could have been better, and it seems that the narrative is only a means to string together the different puzzles.","June 16, 2015","true","8.1"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","0"

It basically allows you to edit the actual code of the game objects, which can lead to some enjoyable puzzles.\n- While the game begins similar to an action/adventure game, in that it focuses on combat more than elaborate “hacking,” it quickly transitions into a full-fledged puzzle game that focuses on coding solutions to problems.\n- The plot and storyline of the game is interesting and fresh in that “breaking the 4th wall” way.\n- The early-game code tweaking is empowering and gives a wonderful feeling of accomplishment when you solve a puzzle in an unique way.\n- Playing around with the variables of objects, such as their damage settings and idle settings, can create some unintentionally funny moments.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- As advertised before each play session there are a plethora of bugs, glitches, and missing features in this Alpha build. Some of the more bothersome ones were as follows:\n-There is no way to exit the game. It will continue to run until you force the application to close using your operating system. Anyone that doesn’t have a decent understanding of computing will be completely lost and frustrated. This has thankfully been patched on May 30th with a complete menu interface when using ESC in game.\n-Walking into a new area put me in the scenery that was off the main path, which caused me to keep from progressing. Using the “time reverse” ability simply replicated it each time. I was forced to start over.\n- The game took me about two hours to complete the currently contained four Acts (a final fifth one is planned), but unless the final act takes a considerable amount of time to complete, I feel as though the game is too short.\n- The puzzles on the fourth Act were considerably more tedious than fun. The early debugging moments of accomplishment were quickly replaced with a monotonous requirement to run from one place to another memorizing bits of code.\n\nCan you play it while the children are awake?\n\nYes! In fact I had a fun learning moment with my eight year old regarding the settings on each of the objects I was debugging. It may have piqued an interest in coding for him.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?\n\nI finished what was currently available, which were four Acts in total. It took me about two hours to complete.\n\nRedlight or Greenlight?\n\nThis game is currently at a redlight.\n\nI do not feel the content that is currently offered is enjoyable enough for a $19.99 purchase. The game has too many game-breaking bugs and missing features. That said, I am sure that it will be well worth that price when they’ve made some substantial updates. If you are a fan of unique gaming ideas then I would encourage you to purchase it as a support mechanism as the end product will be well worth it.

But the game also gives you access to some strings and function calls that you can change which makes you think you could do a lot more more.  Except that the moment you change a single character in the string, the entire game crashes.  Sometimes the crash is contained by the game, and you just have to reload a save.  Other times (and quite often) the crash isn't contained and the entire game will actually freeze, forcing you to give exit the game and close the game with task manager.\n\nOverall, the game actually is somewhat enjoyable, but it's hard to say that it would really appeal to anyone.  Having more versatility for injecting your own code into creatures would have made the challenges more thought provoking, I think.\n\nOh, before I forget.

Awakening in a dungeon, your character (who very much resembles Link) must find his way out. Meer moments after starting the game, the main weapon of the game appears..a usb sword.\n\nInteracting with objects in this game is unlike any other game before it. Upon coming into contact with items, your weapon displays an interactive box. This box shows a dumbed down version of some machine language akin to Java, setting up all your battles for the game. This is a feature that I loved, but to be honest, is going to put a lot of people off if they don't understand code. It also, while original, makes for a very boring game.\n\nGraphics\n\nThis game is without a doubt beautiful. While not quite cell-shaded, it personally reminds me of The Legend Of Zelda: Windwaker. Throughout the game you will encounter things that break the mold of it's pretty design, such as the toxic whirls of poliution near the factory. Amazingly animated, Hack 'n' Slash is one of the best looking games I've seen in quite some time\n\nGameplay\n\nBesides the interesting addition of using code to fight creatures and move blocks, there isn't much in the game that hasn't already been done before. It's a top down game much like the original Zelda games. If you've played an RPG, you're overly familiar with the design. Interacting with enemies and objects via the usb sword quickly becomes tedious, as the code box that appears takes you out of the heat of the moment, leading to a very jarring experience that leaves the game feeling more broken than finished.\n\nStory\n\nYou are a red headed Link. Awakening in a cell, you quickly get your sword and break out of the dungeon you've been being kept in with your sprite named Bob. After this, I couldn't honestly tell you the story because I can't figure out if there even is one.\n\n\nOverall, I wanted to love this game. It's an original game (when it doesn't scream Zelda), but sometimes orginality just isn't enough. I quickly found myself losing interest in the title not because of the graphics or because I didn't want to find out the story, but because of the unique combat system.

However, like many other negative reviews, the execution is lacking. I'd still recommend it, because I know that pulling this game off is extremely hard, and the devs did not fail terribly at doing so. They didn't pull it off great, just fine, but it's not game-wrecking either.\n\nHack 'n' Slash has a certain sense of novelty before you buy it.

People who have no prior background knowledge or experience with programming will find this game impossible to complete, and will leave it hanging in their game library.\n\nThe game is largely unguided, so you can actually run off and get yourself into the wrong room/place before completing a certain task, or getting a certain artifact. The game takes the difficulty up a few scary notches late into the story, notably within the castle. I'm no elite programmer by any standards, and I find that giving the entire library of source code in the castle is a little overwhelming. I also did get lost a few times within the game, not knowing if I should proceed this way or that.\n\nAll in all, I'd say it's a good challenge for those even with a strong programming background.

But I don't think I can generally recommend it.\n\nNote first: Hack 'n' Slash is not an action game; it's a programming puzzle game wearing RPG's clothing.\n\nIf you're not already a programmer, this game isn't for you. The game gives some playful programming lessons for starters, but as a programmer and a teacher, I declare that the instructions they give you in this game are ABSOLUTELY ABYSMAL. I have NEVER, IN MY LIFE, seen such a poor explanation of a for-loop, one of the easiest things to explain.\n\nIf you ARE already a programmer, though, this game may also not be for you. Their attempts to simplify the programming with colour schemes and visual metaphors, in my opinion, made things only more complicated. And most of all, you'll be grinding your teeth on how easy the solutions would be if you could just type your own lines (to manually call functions, for example), and how you're condemned to stitching together something from the arbitrary list of things you ARE allowed to edit.\n\nWhy did I like it then? The conversation isn't very good, the character designs are of varying appeal (quite liked Isis, liked most of Alice, hated almost every single aspect of Bob), the music is pretty sweet though and the world is nice and vibrant.\nBut at the end of the day, I liked it for being a puzzle game with a neat new idea to explore and that wasn't too easy or too hard.

Do NOT spend your time or money on it. I really can't tell who would be the proper fanbase for this game, or if there even is one.\n\nThe whole concept is fun and would be awesome if it was applied well, but right now this game is just pretty poorly done. Sure, the graphics took some time, but they're nothing that drastically special. Other than that, most of the game actually seems pretty slapped together by the time you get through it.\n\nFirstly, I am a really experienced programmer, at least for 7-8 years now. Obviously, I'm no amazing specialist, but I know waaaaaaay more than anything this game goes into. Even so, I thought it would be interesting. Turns out not.\n\nThe game has no difficulty as you're basically invincible from the beginning (which is possible through more than just 1 way). Even if you don't make yourself invincible, the fighting really isn't the focus and is pointless anyway.\n\nWhat's more important is the coding and hacking, which is a flop. The majority of the puzzles require barely any thought, except for one or two which require no real thought in programming but more thought in understanding what in the world you're supposed to be going for. For the former, most puzzles simply require setting a value to X or changing a "greater than" to a "less than" and you're done. For the latter, I mean things like what are required from the Library at the endgame--some are easy, some are just unintuitive to even know what you're meant to edit.\n\nAnyway, I beat the game in under 4 hours, probably closer to 3 hours as some of my gametime is spent with the game sitting up. For me, it was boring. For non-programmers, I feel like it would be a pain. The first couple of chapters would be fine, with some general understanding, but once you have non-programmers needing to delve 3+ levels into an object to find some function or variable, they're not really going to understand what this means anymore... they'll just sit with their game broken into 4 screens, confused.\n\nLastly, the whole story was boring and the dialogue was TERRIBLE. Oh man, I wanted to punch the screen so much, I kept skipping through more dialogue the further I was through the game. It was cheesily stupid to the point where it was annoying. I can deal with cheesiness and love overly-stupid humor, but this game's dialogue was just the worst.\n\nUsually I don't come out this gritty about a game, but it's just not done well. I wanted this game to be great, especially from Double Fine, but nope. I've played many other Double Fine games on console before (and bought them again for the PC to play again), but I still stick by (as many others do) Psychonauts being their best.\n\nAnyway: Just don't buy this game.","December 26, 2014","false","3.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Direct attacks are impossible, there is no penalty for dieing, and you don't need fast reflexes.\n\nI would give it a, perhaps generous, 7/10.  I base this on averaging the 5/10 I would give it for non-programmers since they can only play the first half of the game, and 10/10 for programmers who may find it enjoyable.\n\nQuite a bit of programming knowledge is assumed.  Almost nothing is explained.  At first, all you can do is alter the value of variables.  Soon “if” statements and logical operators are introduced.  The game spends quite a while at this level of sophistication, and an intelligent person that can read English can get by for the first half of the game.\n\nIntelligence is not sufficient.  Do you know the programming terms “function”, “iteration”, “modulo”, and “closure”?  Do you know programmer catchphrases like “hack the planet” well enough to recognize them even when letters are missing and the words are rearranged?  If not, you can't complete the last half of this game without a walkthrough.  Playing with a walkthrough will be no fun, since there is nothing to the game other than solving the puzzles.\n\nWhen the game does attempt to explain something, the explanations are often unhelpful, vague, and/or inaccurate.  For example, the game hints that a closure is “when a function has a pet function”.  That is unhelpful because it doesn't tell you what you can do with it, or what it's for.  Those features would help you use it to solve puzzles.  It is vague because it neglects to mention that a closure is an anonymous function (a function without a name), and that it can contain references to the values of variables in the enclosing scopes of where it was created.  Those features are why programmers care about closures.  It's inaccurate because a closure can be returned by a function.  It does not have to remain with the function that created it (that would be a nested function definition).  If none of that made sense to you, that's fine.  Just know that this game will not teach you to be a programmer.\n\nIt is perhaps for the best that the game does not teach programming, because the code you interact with appears to be produced by a Lua disassembler.  There is no indention, and very little code structure.  “goto” is heavily used.  This does make the game challenging for programmers near the end, but it would teach bad practices.\n\nFor programmers the first half of the game will be far too easy.  If you're creative you may be able to amuse yourself by solving the puzzles in roundabout or spectacular ways, but it is not required or rewarded.\n\nMost programmers should find the last half of the game difficult, but mostly fair.  Most of the difficulty comes from needing to debug (or carefully ‘bug’) code that is unfamiliar and poorly structured.  This is a valuable skill.\n\nThe story is serviceable.  Neither the plot nor the characters are very deep, but the ending is clever.  I won't spoil it.\n\nSome parts of the interface are very bad.\n\nA minor, but constant, problem is overlapping text.  This isn't just an eyesore.  It's hard to find a particular book in a burning library when all the titles have other words printed over them.  This could have been solved several ways.  Text could be nudged the minimal distance from its centered position to avoid overlapping (the best solution I've come up with).  Text could only appear when you mouseover something (likely a worse solution).  Different colors could be used (probably the worst solution).\n\nSource code (what a programmer writes to make a computer do things) is displayed two ways.\n\nOne view of the code is as mostly-text that should be familiar to most programmers.  I say “mostly” text because there are colored diamonds scattered throughout.  This form is used when you look at a 'signpost' for an algorithm before editing it.  I had no problem with it.\n\nThe other view of the code is as a collection of machines connected with wires, with beams firing at them from colored diamonds.  This form is used to make your changes to the code.  It is, to put it bluntly, terrible.  Each machine has some text on it.  This text is so small as to be illegible.  The machines are always arranged as a vertical line, causing the white lines indicating the control flow of the program to overlap, making it very difficult to understand.  Even small amounts of code presented this way results in large rooms that make it almost impossible to get a sense of the overall structure of the code, and require a lot of time spent walking.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the text view wasn't used for everything.\n\nThe interface seems to have been designed with gamepads in mind.  This makes editing the code slow and clumsy, and you occasionally have to type variable names and strings anyway.  It would have been better if normal text editing had been used for everything.\n\nThe engine itself is fascinating.  It appears to work by disassembling its own code, and letting you edit it while it runs.  It's very resilient.  If you make a mistake that would normally crash or hang a program the game doesn't crash or hang.  You get a message about the world collapsing, and restart from the point where you entered the room as if you had died.  This is even used in some traps late in the game.  The code is version-controlled, and you can return to a previous version of it, at the cost of any progress (location change and items gained) you made since then, when you die or by using an item you get early on.  That's nice if you mess things up too badly.  It would have been nice to have buttons to view the original code for things, and the changes that were made (probably in unified diff format).\n\nWhile this isn't the first programming game (Darwin was released in 1961), it might be the first that shows how to get a non-programmer interested in programming.  Editing the value of variables in the source code of BASIC games, and then proceeding to make more and more complex changes, are how I learned to program in the 80s, and the way this game starts out.  It's a pity that Hack 'n' Slash does such a poor job explaining things, and that the learning curve hits a brick wall so suddenly halfway through the game.  Hopefully future games will use this as a model to improve upon, rather than as a sign that such games cannot work.","October 29, 2014","true","11.4"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","17","30","0","0"

You walk up to a bush and hit it with your sword.  In the Zelda game, nothing would happen, right?  Well in this game, you insert the sword into the USB port on the back of the bush and you have the option to either make it moveable so you can push it out of the way, set it on fire, or extinguish the flame if it is on fire.  And you can set how many health hearts it drops if you let it burn.\n\nPicture this:  you're playing the original Legend of Zelda (yeah same game as before but a different reference this time I promise) and an enemy is charging at you.  You swing your sword to attack.  In the Zelda game, it would take two or three hits, then the enemy would curl up and die... possibly dropping a rupee or a heart.  Well, in this game you insert your sword in the USB port on the enemy's head and now you have several options:\n1.  you can change an enemy to a friend so it will seek and destroy other enemies!!\n2.  you can change the amount of HP the enemy has to make it easier (or harder) to kill.\n3.  you can change whether the enemy is looking for a fight, or running away.\n4.  you can change the enemy's movement patterns using an advanced programming menu.\n5.  you can change the amount of health hearts the enemy drops when it dies.\n\nSimilar changes are possible in all sorts of situations in this game.  In fact, if you are unwilling to hack your way out of trouble (as in computer hack, not hack and slash and stab) then you will FAIL.  Yep, this is the original game that is designed to be played BY CHEATING YOUR WAY THROUGH IT.  There are multiple solutions to most of the problems you encounter, but all of them will require creative use of MATH, LOGIC, and BASIC PROGRAMMING.\n\nBottom line:\nit's reminiscent of the old-school adventure RPG games like Legend of Zelda, except your main tool here is a super-hacker USB sword that you use to change the parameters of every item, spell, and character you encounter.  If you HATE hacking, programming, math/logic problems, and things of that nature then you will hate this game.  If you want to play a new take on an old genre, well then you might have a little fun with this.","March 15","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's worth while exploring all the corners, there are optional artifacts that makes the game much more pleasurable to play (e.g. time speed up/slow down).

I thought this game was right up my alley, being as I love programming, I love puzzles, and I love the Legend of Zelda-like look to it, but overall, this game was just completely underwhelming.\n\nIn general, the core mechanics of this game aren't all to great. Sure it seems cool looking at all the things that you can do, and all the possible puzzles, but nothing really feels very interesting. So many of the encounters you have are just the samet thing of dodging the enemy, reprogramming the enemy to something else, and repeat. It may seem pretty cool, and pretty limitless, but theres almost nothing interesting you can do. This game also looks like it has a lot of exploration to it, but it's really just extremely railroaded with the illusion of being truly open world. Its like "Sure you could go this way, but it doesn't lead anywhere for you right now and you don't get any hint what you need or how to get it."\nOn top of this, the challenge in this game comes from the wrong place. It should be in the interesting combat which changes constantly, but it's extremely repetetive, and you can become practically invincible extremely early on. The real challenge is the puzzles and the feeling of "Am I doing this right? I have no idea" and then going to the "There has to be another way, or some hint" but being as it's very railroaded, there's no hints, and nothing else to do other than look up what to do online, and being completely underwhelmed by the solution.\nJust overall, this game was a tremendous disappointment for someone who wanted to love this game, and if you're on the fence about buying this, don't.\n\nTL;DR: I would have loved this game, but I've only had experiences that are underwhelming, boring, repetetive, and just infuriating.

Sometimes I’m aware of games months or even years before their retail release. Other times a game will come out of nowhere and grab me instantly. Hack ‘n’ Slash from Double Fine is one of those games.\n\nThe first I heard of it was on Steam’s front page. I watched the trailer and was instantly hooked. On the surface Hack ‘n’ Slash appears to be a straight-forward Zelda clone, isometric adventure in a fantasy setting. I quickly realised it was a puzzle game in disguise, thanks to an ingenious central game mechanic: hacking.\n\nYour character has the ability to hack into enemies and world objects, enabling you to modify gameplay behaviour and unit characteristics. You can alter how much damage enemies cause, change their idle routine, and even turn them from enemies into allies. This hacking changes the actual object variables in realtime and I was blown away by the concept.\n\nI picked up the game on sale and sat down to play. My first playthrough I bounced off pretty hard. First of all the controls aren’t great. The joystick tends to travel a lot and I’ve died countless times because my character stayed in motion even after I took my thumb off the stick. As well, the starting area isn’t very intuitive and I found myself backtracking quite a bit. The hacking ability seemed largely restricted and I wasn’t having any fun.\n\nThis pattern repeated a few times as I tried to come back to the game. I knew there was something special with Hack ‘n’ Slash but I just wasn’t seeing it. Finally I gave it one last try and suddenly everything clicked. I saw the whole game open up in front of me and I realised how clever and innovative it really is.\n\nEven beyond the USB sword your character uses to hack, the game has a number of cool mechanics that allow you to play with the rules of the world. You can slow down or speed up time, change the day/night cycling, and view the hidden paths around the world. The main thrust of gameplay involves using a variety of items to manipulate and maneuver the world.\n\nI’m only a few hours into Hack ‘n’ Slash but the majority of that time’s been spent in exploration. Exploring the world, the game’s systems, and the methods you’re given to modify them.\n\nI’ve still got some minor gripes, like the controller issues I mentioned before, and other occasional platforming problems, but there’s a lot to like in Hack ‘n’ Slash. Double Fine have developed a clever, playful, and self-referential title that pays homage to classic RPGs while bringing something new to the genre. Give Hack ‘n’ Slash a try and, if required, a second, third, and fourth try.","January 9, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

There's a lot of pointless walking in this game, with empty rooms and maze-like paths that ultimately serve no purpose. I haven't finished the game so maybe there's something later on that's supposed to make up for this, but they could have just as easily trimmed down the convoluted paths, or make them accessible only later on with new powers.\n- The graphics are adequate, but messy. The walkable paths tend to blend into the background and get covered by stuff from the foreground. Seeing how this game take inspiration by Zelda they should have applied one of its most important lessons: don't clutter the screen. I know there's an item early on that clearly shows you the walkable areas, but it's no excuse.\n- Everything resets as soon as you leave the current "room". This avoids getting stuck, but it also means that you'll have to do specific actions over and over again, and seeing how most of this involves hacking it can get a bit tedious.\n\nFrom a purely mechanical standpoint I also have to say that:\n- only having 5 quick buttons (the space bar and buttons 1 through 4) is just inexcusable, especially seeing the vast abount of items you get to use. Of all games I expected this one to be more flexible in its options section, and to be at least more accomodating towards people who play with a keyboard.\n- The inventory only displays two rows of items at a time, despite clearly having room for a third one. This is a bit nitpicky, but it also caused me some confusion when I got an item that went in the third row of items, which I couldn't see at all until I scrolled down.\n\nThe pros are fewer in number, but ultimately redeem the game in my opinion:\n- The mechanics are really a lot of fun to use, and very insightful when it comes to game development. You can speed up and slow down time, change the beaviour of enemies and traps - and even of your own character! - and see behind the curtain of the graphics.\n- The puzzles can be really creative and complex, requiring you to think outside the box and make full use of your powers.\n\n\nOverall my impression is that a simpler, cleaner graphic style and more concise level design would have served this game much better. Aside from that it's definitely worth a try.","September 10, 2014","true","4.9"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","22","43","0","0"

To be honest, it even seems that this was the only element that had thoughts put into it (and I said thoughts, not work).\n\nThe game design is rather cartoony and, let's be honest, very pleasant to the eye, the developpers did a great job on the environnement. But it does NOT fit the gameplay at ALL. It's like having the gameplay of Darksouls on a Mario game : it just doesn't work. Gameplay is supposed to work together with the rest of the game, and here, it's in pure contradiction. It's too cutsy and cartoony, where realism or old-school pixelated graphics would've been way more fit.\nThere is also a total lack of story, as the dialogues are borderline stupid and make no sense. Now some game work very well without stories...but not this one. You're just thrown into it without knowing who you are, what you're supposed to do in a game where the level design is pretty confusing : roads everywhere, random chests everywhere, no logic, no explanation. You do get some little "quests" further but...by the time you reach (or rather, find) where the first lines of (still non-sensical) story happen, you have enough time to feel dissapointed and not invested in the game at all.\n\nThis is sad, because such gameplay elements could've been grounds for an amazing story.

It looked great!\nBut it's not. The game's sole interest was this gameplay system. To be honest, it even seems that this was the only element that had thoughts put into it (and I said thoughts, not work).\n\nThe game design is rather cartoony and, let's be honest, very pleasant to the eye, the developpers did a great job on the environnement. But it does NOT fit the gameplay at ALL. It's like having the gameplay of Darksouls on a Mario game : it just doesn't work. Gameplay is supposed to work together with the rest of the game, and here, it's in pure contradiction. It's too cutsy and cartoony, where realism or old-school pixelated graphics would've been way more fit.\nThere is also a total lack of story, as the dialogues are borderline stupid and make no sense. Now some game work very well without stories...but not this one. You're just thrown into it without knowing who you are, what you're supposed to do in a game where the level design is pretty confusing : roads everywhere, random chests everywhere, no logic, no explanation. You do get some little "quests" further but...by the time you reach (or rather, find) where the first lines of (still non-sensical) story happen, you have enough time to feel dissapointed and not invested in the game at all.\n\nThis is sad, because such gameplay elements could've been grounds for an amazing story. Or the artistic look of the game, that would've been great in any more classic RPG/Adventure game...but it just doesn't work. It feels off. And it sincerely disconnects you from the game.

You are Alice (by default or whatever name you want to give her). You begin the game in Act 2 finding yourself in a cage in a cave. (You'll know more about Act 1 later in the game.) You attempt to use your sword to break open the door of the cage, but your sword breaks. Now you can access the game's code on objects you attack with the broken sword. It's like tweaking game .ini or .xml configuration files in real-time. Want to unlock that door? Set it's DoorLocked flag to 0.\n\nBut it's not as simple as just 'cheating' your way through the game like with the opening act in the cage. There are some pretty tricky puzzles to solve where hacking certain objects or even global values is needed to solve some of them.\n\nYou'll encounter unique gear such as the Wizard Hat that allows you to see the game's raw pathing map layout, or artifacts that allow you to change the day/night cycle time and time ellapse speed. There are also some familiar items such as the classic blue boomerang. This boomerang though, allows you to attack, thus hack, yourself.\n\nThe music is charming and the visuals are genuinely unique. Everything is hand drawn 2D, and the music has a classic midi feel to it.\n\nThe game is kind of short though, so I won't tell you too much more.

The interface was controller-friendly, though.  I also like the concept behind the game.  The overall experience was just too buggy and frustrating to recommend buying the game at any price.\n\nWhat the game has going for it is a vector art style similar to a typical Flash-powered game.  Whether or not this game leveraged Flash is beyond my knowledge, but it looks like all the art was drawn in Flash or a similar vector drawing tool.  it also has one of the coolest concepts ever seen in action RPGs: hack things using their USB ports.  It's not simply a gag, though!  It's utilized at the game's core design level, allowing for very interesting puzzles.  The time travel aspect is cool, too, but I found myself avoiding that aspect of the game as much as possible.\n\nWhere this game goes wrong is it does not hold your hand enough in the beginning and has a very unintuitive hacking interface.  There's a slab near the beginning that shows you code that you can't edit at all... though it spawns a chest right away... not sure if that was hinting that future puzzles would use these slabs to give you clues, but that's my assumption.  Anyway, a lot of the puzzles can be messed up and require you to really think about what you're doing.  You have to contend with the game's poor implementation of riding on moving platforms, like swimming turtles, only to finally get across a small body of water after countless times getting pushed into the water by invisible forces.  Mildly frustrating... becomes tedious... becomes too tedious to keep going.  During playing this game, I felt like it would be easier to code my own game from scratch than it would be to play this game about hacking a game's logic.  It's silly, because I could just as easily really hack the game and just beat it right away, ruining what little gameplay the game provides.","March 17","false","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unfortunately this is another case of a neat concept with poor excecution. You solve problems by "modifying the game", but what "modifying the game" means is just changing object variables (i.e. modify a creature's health/alignment/damage, change the number of times you can move a block, volume of a sound, etc.). You don't actually write functions to run and make things happen in the game, or anything exciting like that. I could have been willing to look past this, however; after all, Brutal Legend, another Double Fine game, also suffers from somewhat lackluster (although i personally found it enjoyable) gameplay, but more than makes up for it with a fantastic environment, enjoyable characters, and excellent aesthetic. Hack 'n' Slash, sadly, fails on this front as well. The best way I could come up with to describe the writing is DESPERATELY trying to be clever but failing miserably. Every character is this way to the point of being irritating. The world itself isn't anything out of the ordinary either; generic "retro-styled" backgrounds and levels coupled with a boring soundtrack are largely ignorable.\n\nIn summary: excellent concept, mediocre excecution, TERRIBLE writing, bland aesthetic.\n\nEDIT: I've been told that later in the game you DO actually modify the game code and write lines yourself, but these sections are very poorly executed and are more confusing and frustrating than original and enjoyable.

It's probably one of my favourite Double Fine games ever so far. It really delivers on that concept of delving into the game code in a really clever way. I feel smart solving stuff, and don't feel like I'm being guided toward the solution in a really heavy-handed way.\n\nIt's a difficult game to get into if you're not willing to get your hands a little dirty. It rewards experimentation and isn't going to necessarily teach you all the steps so much as give you a bunch of tools and let you play. That's not to say there's no gradual introducing of concepts. There is, but it's not afraid to introduce quite a few new concepts at a time and expect you to wrap your head around that. It's a bit like SpaceChem in that you feel a little less like you're finding 'the' solution and more like you're given the tools, and with them you craft a solution. I find that very refreshing, but your mileage may vary!\n\nOne issue I've had is that the build doesn't seem entirely stable on my machine, I get a few crashes to desktop here and there. But they're pretty rare.

The game's many references to old-school games like the original Legend Of Zelda make it an enjoyable homage, and the game's rather innovative hacking mechanic challenged me in a way that I've never really experienced before. By hitting certain objects with your sword/USB drive, you can hack them, changing attributes to open locked doors, instantly defeat enemies, and give yourself extra health. With the ability to hack yourself to ludicrous levels of health, and the ability to hack enemies out of existence, you'd think that the game would get boring quickly, but that's not the case. The game barely pretends to be combat-oriented, and rather focuses on puzzles. Early in the game, the puzzles tend to be rather easy, such as hacking a movable block to increase the number of spaces it moves, but by the game's second chapter, the puzzles begin to become more complex. Around the game's third chapter, however, there is an abrupt gameplay shift.\n\nAt some point, you gain an item known as the "loupe", which allows you to, quite literally, look at and change the coding for in-game objects. At this point, the game shifts from relatively simple block-pushing puzzles to fiendishly difficult challenges that basically boil down to the problems you might find in a programming textbook. As a matter of fact, the second half of the game feels almost like an interactive tutorial to coding, and honestly, that's not neccesarily a bad thing. The puzzles may be difficult, but the game always provides you with more than enough information to solve them.  No programming knowledge is required to start this game, but once you get to the midpoint, you'll find that you may very well leave with some.\n\nOverall, I think this is a creative game that uses its innovative mechanic to the fullest extent. If you're looking for a relaxing game to zone out playing, I'd advise you to look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a fun and interesting challenge, then I would heartily reccomend Hack 'n' Slash.","October 9, 2014","true","6.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

If your looking for a game like Zelda, this is not what your looking for. It might look a bit similar but the game goals and mechanics are not even close..... unless you hacked in Zelda.\n\nIf your interested in hacking, cheating, programming or game mechanics in general this could be your thing. However as with hacking and programming you will need to have patience. You will crash the game when you make a mistake, sometimes not immediately but you can expect a crash later on. Most of the times its not a big deal the game auto saves when you enter a room and it takes less then a minute to restart the game.\n\nThe first half of the game you can play through without any knowledge of programming.

If your a hardcore developer you will likely over complicate the solution and ignore the hints left by the game developer. In most cases even the most complicated puzzles are solved by changing one variable to true/false or looking up the super secret password in the code.\n\nIf you have no programming skills at all you could figure stuff out by deduction. But the last few puzzles have a very steep learning grade, so I would combine this game with a 101 in programming and you will have a good "hello world" replacement program to play with. As for anyone else who is not a wanna be programmer I would say stick with your current favorite casual puzzle game.","September 15, 2014","true","12.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It has a good sense of humour and rolls out new mechanics and abilities at a nice pace; unfortunately the puzzle difficulty can be pretty spiky and I am not sure it really provides enough support for someone unfamiliar with programming to have a great time.\n\nAs the game progresses the level of abstraction increases and so there is a growing disconnect between your actions and the puzzles themselves. The end result is a puzzle solving process that is both more complicated and confusing, which means you really need to enjoy the process of experimenting in those machine states to continue to have fun.\n\nIf you enjoy programming and puzzle games I definitely recommend it otherwise I suspect there are better uses for your money.","September 30, 2014","true","9.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This game harnesses that exploration mechanic, and does it well.\n\nMy problem is exactly that, however. It makes no attempt to really explain itself to the player, and plays against logic to enable puzzles that I shouldn't have to deal with. I spent the first 30 minutes exploring aimlessly, until I found the sprites and was given a goal - fix the pollution. Okay. So I explore the complete area of pollution, and find only one potential progression point - a place where you walk on sleeping... turtles, I guess. Anyway, the puzzle comes in when your sidekick appears and just decides WOW I'M GONNA SING ON THIS. I died at least 5 times when what I SHOULD have been able to do was, I don't know, tell the little bugger to shut up, or hack him mute.\n\nUnfortunately, the player character never seems to think of these solutions, when the player themselves has only been taught to hack and move. Swing sword-thing. Hack object.\n\nI honestly stopped there because I was completely stuck. Maybe I would have gotten different results if I made it night, or if I went back to the sprites and got a comically large cork to shove in my sprite's big mouth.\n\nBut I didn't. Because I already wasn't enamored with the game: the writing felt flat and the mechanics were stale. Yes, I can make a block move 20 times in a milisecond with a single nudge of my Link-shaped hat. But I have to do that to every single block I come across with a cute puzzle to it. Or I waste about the same amount of time just... pushing it. The only creative application was when I had to put a delay and reverse the push of the block, and even then that was clearly "advanced puzzling 101", because it only ever hid excess content I thought didn't matter. The game doesn't expect much out of you, in other words.\n\nIf you want to get this game, and like what I'm saying, go for it. If you don't, great. Glad I could help.\n\nBy the way, I got this for free when SBDF-9 flopped. I cannot remotely understand why that would somehow make me feel better about Double Fine. You fail one game, you give me another one with poor storytelling for free? Thanks, Double Fine. Thanks.","December 19, 2014","false","0.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","4"

Let me just say- I'm glad I bought it anyway!\n\nI really did thoroughly enjoy this game- perhaps it was because I had read a lot of disclaimers, and was waiting for "a letdown" but for me, such a letdown never occured.\n\nI am a programmer (though I've never really delved into Lua specifically) so the obvious appeal of a "hacking game" was at the core of my reason for purchasing. I am typically a "whiner" when it comes to games (I set everything to easy, and try to "hack" around the difficulty if I decide that a game is too difficult) so this game was awesome, because it certainly encouarged the hacking!\n\nFor the first part of the game, I found the "hacking" of the entities kind of repetitive, and somewhat boring, but I pressed on. When I finally got to act 4 (where some many people start to see negatives)- I was extatic when I started to see real live code! Some have said it's not actual Lua source (I'm not sure- but it looks similar to source at any rate to me). I was really worried that it was going to be really difficult, but I found the puzzles intriguing. Some of the puzzles can be a bender (you start messing with something, and then you figure out the most obvious solution and it's like- "Gee, why didn't I see that in the first place?" lol).\n\n\n\ntl;dr\nOverall, I found the game highly enjoyable (low replay value, but that's not usually important to me in games- I conquer and move on). If you do any kind of intermediate coding (I HIGHLY stress that- you will need to have some kind of logic, math, or data structure training once you get to act 4) then you owe it to yourself to get this game and try it out!","December 22, 2014","true","12.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Unfortunately, this game which has the very original idea of breaking the barrier between the developer and the player by letting the latter change actual variables in order to progress, has a few flaws that turn it into a boring, repetitive chore. Just imagine having to cross different screens or rooms in a Zelda-like world, trying to find some clue to let you progress and having to fight the same ennemies and move the same blocks every time you pass by. Now imagine having to do this by a rather cumbersome system of reprogramming those ennemies and blocks every single time. Imagine there is no reward for this: no gold, souls or XP. You just run around aimlessly, hoping to find some clue somewhere that will finally allow you to progress. Imagine finding artifacts with functions so puzzling that you can't shake off the feeling that they might allow you to progress somehow, somewhere, but you don't have any clue about how and where because the game loves to troll you with garbled messages or nonsensical gibberish. That's my experience in Hack 'n' Slash.\nThe game could have been something if the developers had shown a little more concern about the players: give him a clue now and then, leave cleared stages cleared. I hate it when I have to use Google to progress in a game. No game in the world should ever need you to use a walkthrough or a forum in order to progress. This game makes it essential.\n\nPros:\n- Nice, retroish Zelda-like game world and graphics\n- Open world\n- Very original concept\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, ...\n- Puzzles are often too abstract to figure out; no clues\n- I heard you could make the game crash by fiddling with some variables\n\nTl;dr: This game has a very original concept. Get it if you're curious or if you're comfortable with the idea of playing a game that will make you feel completely lost in a world that makes you overcome the same obstacles over and over.","October 19, 2015","false","6.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

You are given no direction, and even walkthroughs are confusing. Because you can break the game basically from the outset, it's hard to figure what the solution to the puzzle is. Some can be deduced, but others require information that you really couldn't figure out without random guesswork. For example, one item can bounce off walls, and at angles, but how and when it can do this is arbitrary.\n\nMost things speak english, but item based anything are usually in a code of some sort. One is in what looks like feedback from an old TV and another speaks in arabic (i think). When i looked up what these items/characters actually did, i couldn't help but wonder how i was supposed to figure that out myself. There may be a way, but i never found it, which brings me to my next point\n\nYou can do things out of order, in unintended ways, and in completely broken ways. For example, One puzzle required both character/items i had obtained  to change my name  but i did it in a much more simplistic and sane way  i hacked myself, ramped my speed to max and ran past the warden ...\n\nI technically didn't need any story important items to progress, and you can get near infinite health and health pickups within 20 minutes. The gameplay was fun, but the lack of any sense of direction was crippling. the lack of boundaries, and the "do whatever you can think of" makes for a very loose experience.\n\nBasically this game is a very oldschool game mashed with newer mechanics and systems. If you loved the first Legend of Zelda for the NES and wished it was made to be more modern, this game is for you. If you prefered later games like Link to the Past or Ocarina of TIme, this game will be an exercise in disappointment.","May 21, 2015","false","2.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I think it's connected to the line "if not value", which doesn't make any sense to me.\n\nOnce you start scripting at the advanced stages, you will find yourself not only scanning through rows of code, but also entire libraries of files, to find that one or two hackable lines of "code". A few files even crash the game if you so much as open them.\n\nIf this game would have settled on just altering values, it would probably have been stable and tolerable. ...but instead it went the scripting mile - a mile that runs way ahead of the game.\n\nFurther, many of the challenges revolve around you not being able to add or remove lines of code, or change enough values, which you would very much be able to do if you were actually scripting in lua.\n\nToward the end, the game begins to have more and more trouble to relate its concepts back to the real world, ultimately culminating in the main state file being destroyed, and if that would be for real, or even for real in the game, that would have prevented you from hacking anything after that.\n\n...so this game is a noble and ambitious effort, and it's entertaining in its own unique way, but it could have been better.\n\n...but it's a fancy lowbudget game that does something unique. If you're into lua scripting already, you might find this more entertaining than I did.

The idea was great and I wanted to play it!\nHaving the possibility to reprogram lots of things in a RPG sounds like a lot of fun, so I'm sad to say that I was disappointed in Hack 'n' Slash...\n\nWhen I started off, there were only some minor issues. Little things that felt out of place like the weird animation, when you slash upward.\nFurthermore the long dialogs interupted the gameplay again and again.\n\nNothing dramatic so far. And I actually got to that enemy hacking, and reprogramming their idle-routines and so on.\nBut as soon as I got the hang of it, the next concept was intoduced. So the game designers kept giving me new mechanics to learn, but they never explored the single mechanics in their depths.\n\nThen again some dialogs, where the intended comedy just prolonged the texts and turned them tedious.\n\nI had some good moments with the game, but the overall game experience was rather frustrating than fun. And let me to abort it halfway through.\n\nThis game fails to figure out its core engagement. Being a puzzle game with great and innovative mechanics the focus should lie on those mechanics. As a game designer you should get to know them, explore them, get every puzzle possible out of them.\nInstead there was a lot of running through mazes, rather shallow puzzles and long dialogs that kept me from doing the fun stuff.","May 13","false","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can for example modify a trap so that it never triggers, or that it does trigger but doesn't do anything, or that it triggers but doesn't do damage, etc.  Actually I modified one of the rooms to have the entrance take me to where the exit was supposed to, bypassing the puzzle entirely :D\n\nSo, I highly recommend checking it out due to being so much fun and an interesting concept, but I do caution that the game is SHORT, and even more so once you get the coolest tools.  Maybe wait for a sale.","September 24, 2014","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It excels in this in that, unlike some other "hacking" games, you're not simulating trying to get into some generic linux server, you're given a world and as you play you learn how it works. As you progress you are slowly given more and more control over it, until by the end where you are given access to the entire "library" of scripts, which in this case is an actual library.\n\nAs a meta-game it does very well. It acts as a fairly good RPG in its own right [i.e. it has good art, a fairly good story, good music], as well as being a hacking game. But it is worth mentioning that if you don't get programming, then you shouldn't even go near this. The hacking is simple to begin with [almost boring], but it starts become more involved as you get a few levels in. But when you get to seeing and editing actual code, unless you have a grasp of the underlying concepts, you won't be able to do much.\n\nDefinitely worth playing if you like to tinker with code.","January 1","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It scratched an itch I didn't know I had. While my playtime does show 7 hours, I effectively beat the game in about four, only getting stuck on the final inch of the last puzzle due to a technicality (and a large amount of second-guessing myself). The game is quite short, almost disappointingly so, and the features available to you advance at a breakneck pace, which is extremely disorienting at first. You gain new abilities faster than I would like, and oftentimes they are not explained or even required for advancement, leaving you with items in your inventory that you have no idea how to use.  I used Ida and Halcyon a grand total of zero times throughout the game, and am still unsure as to what they were supposed to be used for\n\nAnother issue I have with this game, while not necessarily a "bad thing", is that oftentimes you will solve a puzzle without even knowing how you've done it or indeed, what exactly you were solving in the first place. The game's interface, while allowing you to view the code in macroscale, only allows you to edit it inside "algorithm rooms", which, besides being clunky on larger scripts, obfuscate the code by only allowing you to see a small amount of the script at a time while editing it, necessitating backing out of the room to view your changes on the code, and even then the behavioral changes to the game will only be apparent once you leave the room entirely. If your solution doesn't work, it's back to square one.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable game, but far from a polished experience.","September 10, 2014","true","6.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I come from a programming background so I was interested in the concept when it was described to me and it was really well executed.  I think it's telling that having finished Act 2, I ended up playing most of Act 3 last night before getting stuck looking for a missing door and then actually got up this morning, bought my laptop to bed and polished off Acts 3 and 4 - it's the sort of puzzle that I can't leave alone!\n\nAs you would expect, there is the odd glitch - I had a few crashes, but the reload is pretty fast and I didn't seem to lose data so that wasn't too bothersome.  In Act 3, I felt that the player direction needed some work - I skipped a puzzle because I couldn't figure it out and ended up completeing a couple of puzzles and not being able to understand what the people were saying to me when I completed it - perhaps a little more steering would have been a good idea here?  That being said, I didn't need to back track once I had solved the piano puzzle (that was the only one where I felt that I'd solved it by poking, not by figuring it out though).  There were also a couple of points where a map would have been helpful, although I ended up using the save points as a crude map which sorted out my problem in the end.  Also, I would like to register a complaint that you can't swap Bob the sprite for Script the cat - I would love to have Script follow me around and miow!\n\nOverall, I loved this and I can't wait for Act 5 to come out - the moment at the end of Act 4 where you really feel like you're inside the guts of the code actually feels pretty amazing and if you like puzzle type games I thoroughly recommend it.","May 26, 2014","true","6.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

What I've found instead is a massive amounts of bugs.\n\nMost of what I've experienced has been crash upon crash (usually freezing my entire screen with game image or font maps plastered across my screen).  The game also 'saves' not actually saving.  I've found when changing some of the codes in the game only to have them crash the game.  I'm quite tired of completing a puzzle, only to have the game freeze or return me to the same screen, only to try and progress - putting in the same answer, and freezing the game in an infinite loop. Ironic really.  For me, it's not playable at this point.\n\nUsing a controller is possible, but slow to change characters and strings, but I've alternatively found that the keyboard is much more likely to the crash the game.\n\nUnrelated to the constant crashes and terrible UI, I think the game is cute with a great idea behind it. But it lacks any depth, is incredibly short, unpolished, and nowhere near worth the money.  For example - I thought there was a massive bug as the game starts you off in act 2, only to do some research online and find that it doesn't have an act 1. Did anyone test this game beforehand?\n\nI will attempt to complete it, if I can get it started again.

It is a fun interesting game with interesting mechanics but the content so far lasts but a few hours supposidly only missing the final dungeon of what the release build will be. It is probably not a game you want to pick up at full price on day one when there is no user created content for it yet, but given a bit of time with Steam Works it can easily gain a lot more content to be worth the asking price.\n\nUnless it has a sale before getting Steamworks content I would say hold off on buying the game but definitly keep it in your watch list seeing when there is more content added to be worth the price, the soundtrack is quit good and once the game has enough content to be worth picking up I would definitly suggest getting the version with the soundtrack.","May 10, 2014","true","9.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

In fact, the alterations by and large felt unfulfilling, and in a lot of ways, simply an unneeded gimmick. I was willing to accept that until I hit a puzzle where I have to float around on invisible panels to slowly tweek the movement of a series of rotating rings.  It took way longer to complete than was entertaining. The hacking of each individual guard to get through certain areas gets tedious fast.\n\nI'll give the devs props on some things.The fact that the game runs in it's own virtual environment allowing it to restart seamlessly when crashes occure (and I assume they will even in the fully released game) is great design, and the idea itself is a very unique break of the 4th wall. Other issues, such as it's almost complete plotlessness might be ironed out as development continues, but there are many others that seem likely to not be.\n\nThe hacking, as I said, get tedious fast. The art style often leaves it difficult to tell the difference between walls, cliffs, and walkable areas without the use of the hat or info opacity tool (which really seem to do the exact same thing).  Which okay, the invisible platporms you use that ability for are okay at best, but it shouldn't be needed just to walk around some areas.\n\nAll this culminates in an unltimately frustrating gameplay experience that I'm not sure the original idea driving it can make up for. I'll probably come back to it later, but AS IT IS NOW, I can't recommend this game, hence the rating of NOT RECOMMENDED.","May 6, 2014","false","1.8"," 124 of 322 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","124","322","0","5"

Why?\n\nGreat ideas, sloppy execution.\n\nThe core mechanics of this game are brilliant. Unfortunately, the actual implementation seems to have been rushed out the door a bit. Certain puzzles are frustrating not due to difficult thinking, but because of the difficulty in interfacing with their components.\n\nThe puzzle shortly after you get the boomerang is a good example of this- one learns that the pyramids  "offset" value  can control concentric rings with gaps in them, letting you cause their rotations to sync up. Unfortunately, getting them to actually do this takes a lot of trial-and-error, and not the fun kind.This sort of problem, where you have mentally "solved" a puzzle but must still put in several minutes of effort to cause that solution to take effect, repeats itself regularly throughout the game.\n\nThe hacking interface, while pleasing and atmospheric initially, quickly becomes an irritant and discourages the use of complex hacking in favor of "Turn Thing Off" due to the clumsiness in setting advanced things like enemy pathing.\n\nThere may exist community mods that adress some of these issues, but for now, I don't recommend you pay full price for this.","December 19, 2014","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You pretty much need to be at least at an intermediate level with coding knowledge to have any chance of getting through this game without guides. It was fun to do quirky things like toggle friend/foe of enemies and hacking your character. However, the game does not provide a sufficient ramp up for those who simply don't understand the subtleties of programming. The common person probably wouldn't know what a "tick" or "init" function's purpose is. It was also frustrating that they pretty much expose the entire game's code. This can make for some very bad situations where you might actually break the game. You can always roll back but there's no indication of wheter you're making good progress or not. In the end even I had to refer to guides for a few puzzles, if for nothing else, to make sure that I was on the right track.\n\nCheck this out if you have programming experience. If not, go ahead and playthrough but make sure you've got a guide handy. Give yourself maybe 30 minutes/puzzle and if you're not making any progress, just look up the answer.

Had a LOT of potential, but ended up being a waste of my time.\n\nThe game has an interesting premise, but the execution is sorely lacking.  Hacking items gets old, especially since the world resets everytime you exit a room.  So that puzzle that you've completed already?  If you leave the area, you'll have to do it again.  And there's a lot of backtracking.  The idea of hacking items is interesting, and kinda cool the first few times, but eventually I just ended up running around enemies instead of hacking them, or just letting them hit me because I knew I'd heal up within a few seconds.\n\nThe enemies you DO need to hack (guards, mostly) can be finnicky.  You want them to go to a specific location, but often times I'd have to hack them one direction at a time to get them to the correct location.  And since, as mentioned above, you have to do this everytime you re-enter an area, it gets REAL old real fast.\n\nAlso, there's NO direction in this game.  I ended up using a walkthrough pretty religiously, because for the most part, I had NO idea where I needed to go next, or what I needed to be doing.  When I entered a puzzle room, I didn't know if I needed to come back later, or if it's something I could potentially solve with the tools on hand.  (Note: usually it's the tools on hand.)  But they certainly weren't clear about what needed to be done - although once you did it, it did appear fairly obvious most of the time.\n\nAnd even using a walkthough, I never finished the game.  The coding goes from changing values, to starting to do a bit of algorithmic stuff, to indepth coding REALLY fast, and as someone who codes for a living, the coding was either too simple, or stuff I didn't want to wade through to make sense of it.  And I know they had to "simplify" the interface for interacting with code, but my god if it didn't make my head hurt trying to figure out what I needed to deal with.  But eventually I just gave up, and quit the game.\n\nThe final insult? In quitting the game, it crashed my computer - this is one I'm deleting from my library and will likely never fire up again.  I can't say I'm at all impressed with any of the games Doublefine has come out with lately, from the unfinished DF-9 (or whatever the hell it is), the "we need more money" Broken Age (which I sadly backed - it's the only kickstarter I backed I regretted, and there were kickstarters I backed that I never saw anything from) and this, which feels like a really cool concept coded up by high school comp-sci students.\n\ntl;dr - Don't waste your money.  It might be worth picking up if you can get it for free, but I still think there are better things to do with your time, like anything else.  Watch a Let's Play, and you'll get to see the best and the worst of it.","December 30, 2014","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Had a LOT of potential, but ended up being a waste of my time.\n\nThe game has an interesting premise, but the execution is sorely lacking.  Hacking items gets old, especially since the world resets everytime you exit a room.  So that puzzle that you've completed already?  If you leave the area, you'll have to do it again.  And there's a lot of backtracking.  The idea of hacking items is interesting, and kinda cool the first few times, but eventually I just ended up running around enemies instead of hacking them, or just letting them hit me because I knew I'd heal up within a few seconds.\n\nThe enemies you DO need to hack (guards, mostly) can be finnicky.  You want them to go to a specific location, but often times I'd have to hack them one direction at a time to get them to the correct location.  And since, as mentioned above, you have to do this everytime you re-enter an area, it gets REAL old real fast.\n\nAlso, there's NO direction in this game.  I ended up using a walkthrough pretty religiously, because for the most part, I had NO idea where I needed to go next, or what I needed to be doing.  When I entered a puzzle room, I didn't know if I needed to come back later, or if it's something I could potentially solve with the tools on hand.  (Note: usually it's the tools on hand.)  But they certainly weren't clear about what needed to be done - although once you did it, it did appear fairly obvious most of the time.\n\nAnd even using a walkthough, I never finished the game.  The coding goes from changing values, to starting to do a bit of algorithmic stuff, to indepth coding REALLY fast, and as someone who codes for a living, the coding was either too simple, or stuff I didn't want to wade through to make sense of it.  And I know they had to "simplify" the interface for interacting with code, but my god if it didn't make my head hurt trying to figure out what I needed to deal with.  But eventually I just gave up, and quit the game.\n\nThe final insult? In quitting the game, it crashed my computer - this is one I'm deleting from my library and will likely never fire up again.  I can't say I'm at all impressed with any of the games Doublefine has come out with lately, from the unfinished DF-9 (or whatever the hell it is), the "we need more money" Broken Age (which I sadly backed - it's the only kickstarter I backed I regretted, and there were kickstarters I backed that I never saw anything from) and this, which feels like a really cool concept coded up by high school comp-sci students.\n\ntl;dr - Don't waste your money.  It might be worth picking up if you can get it for free, but I still think there are better things to do with your time, like anything else.  Watch a Let's Play, and you'll get to see the best and the worst of it.","December 30, 2014","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Indeed the only people I would even consider recommending this to are programmers. (Disclosure: I am a programmer) Ultimately I'd consider my rating as between the thumbs up and thumbs down.\n\nFirst off, as much as we'd all love if it was the case, it is not a video game that teaches programming. This is very much a video game made by programmers for programmers. If you are not a programmer, you'll need gameFAQs (or steam guide) up on your other screen. And even if you are, you still might need that aid from time to time.\n\nHack 'n' Slash can be clever at times, and can make you feel clever at times as well. But once the full extent of your powers are available, it is far too easy to be too clever to sequence break or crash the game. The game can also feel like an old school adventure game and not in the good way as you'll have puzzles that are not required to beat the game, ways of beating puzzles that bypass other critical puzzles, and puzzles that can't be solved until later. It can be difficult to figure out which of these situations is the case, although this was only an issue as part of the Escape from the Castle.\n\nDespite this, I enjoyed the presentation and the charm of the world and characters. By the end you are able to weld nearly godlike powers in this world in a way that seems clever... I just wish I got more chances to weld or misuse that power. Still... just like in real programming... debugging is such a pain. But it is even worse here thanks to a lack of a debugger.","December 26, 2014","false","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Specifically, there were a couple puzzles in the jail that I missed but I escaped anyway (without trying very hard) and had to lookup how to solve other puzzles I ran into in order to discover that I never should have made it out of the jail the way I did.\n\nAlso, the game bugged out when I tried to exit.

If you're not, the game concepts and joke references will likely fly right over your head.\n\n[Potential Spoilers Ahead]\n\nThe mechanics of the game are to hack the game to your benefit. Throughout the game, you slowly gain access to the very lua script files that make up the game itself, and you can edit all of it (within a limit), even to the point that the game crashes (with a cute dialog telling you that "the universe has imploded"). By the end of the game, you are literally editing the files of the game (in a virtual file system in memory) via a "Breakpoint Bomb". It's a hilariously ingenious concept taken to its logical conclusion with the final set of levels, and I loved it. It has a witty sense of humor about it (the main character's default names are "Alice" and "Bob", a cute reference for any security nerds out there) that leans very heavily on the fourth wall without ever actually completely breaking it (that is to say, the characters never actually say "oh this is a game", but they treat the fact that they are made of source code like its an everyday fact of life).\n\nA fun dalliance in the concept that'll last you about 4-8 hours, depending on how much bumbling and code examination about you do. I heartily recommend it for the concept alone.","December 26, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a silly plot, awkward controls, strange design choices, frustrating mechanics, etcetera.\n\nAt times I spent long minutes walking back and forth inside the code rooms trying to change a single variable, because the developers felt the need to fill the already poorly-designed rooms with large amounts of lag-inducing arrow animations, just in case the player is unable to understand that the red crystal is the red crystal and the blue crystal is the blue crystal - though of course you can't see the start and end points of the lag arrows without walking for a few minutes, anyway.\n\nIt's also surprisingly buggy. You'd think that in a game about hacking the game itself, you'd be allowed to solve puzzles multiple ways. For example, instead of entering a password, you might hack a gate to always be open - but this crashes the game's universe and forces you to go back. At the end when you're supposed to stop the boss from destroying things, with no real hints for how to do so, you might think the answer is to simply make him stop destroying things - but this results in the boss fight going on forever or else just crashes the game. And once you reach the end (most likely having had to look up the solution for the boss online), any attempt to continue the game causes a crash, which I suppose makes a twisted sort of sense since the boss fight inherently corrupts half the game.","December 27, 2014","false","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It sounds like a good combination in theory, but not so so in execution. What I love about 'The Legend of Zelda' games is the sense of adventure they convey and the freedom they give you to explore. 'Hack 'n' Slash' lacks both early in the game, and by the time the so-called "adventure" has begun, I had grown disinterested.\n\nThe early hacking puzzles were amusing at first. The game doesn't seem to give the player much of a tutorial on what to do with each weapon or artifact and how to "hack". Worse, many, if not all, puzzles reset after you returned from the next area. This made the puzzles repetitive and annoying quickly. Furthermore, it feels that your actions in the game have little consequence on your suroundings. It also doesn't help that objectives of some puzzles are not clearly explained.\n\nPrior to playing 'Hack 'n' Slash', I had less-than-exciting first impressions of 'The Witcher' and 'LEGO: Batman'.

You think creatively to continue on throughout the game. You gotta always be mindful of what items you've collected. There are many games that give you item after item after item, and it always seems like as you progress, your older items become obsolete, their effects being replace by newer, better ones. In Hack 'n' Slash all your items synergize and remain useful throughout the game.\n\nBlah blah blah. The game is 100% about the adventure, aaaaaaaand hackin' ♥♥♥♥ in your environment. But mostly about the adventure. It's definitely atmospheric and kept my attention well enough to keep me playing until I completed it in my first and only session.\n\nHack 'n' Slash can be really buggy, especially toward the end of the game, which would explain the, err, 8-10$ reduction from its original, Early Access pricepoint. I've gone out of bounds like four times in the prison. I've had the game relinquish my control over my character in one screen (while hacking) and give me control of my character in the original screen, effectively breaking the game by denying dialogue, access to inventory, or the ability to leave an area. And boy does all that break your immersion.\n\nBut hey it's actually a pretty amazing game. I was completely enthralled by the writing and the way cutscenes, acts, and the end flow so seamlessly.

It's fairly short, but I'd recommend it for $5-10 depending on how interested you are. This game is almost entirely programming/logic puzzles, and if that's what you're after, you'll have fun with this.\n\nInitially I was quite disappointed that the early puzzles were as simple as changing an enemy's damage to 0 or similar, but as the game progresses your toolkit expands quite drastically. It gets to the point where, for many puzzles, the "solution" you'll find is just to completely break it in a way that happens to work out for you.\n\nFor example, I had a room which spawned several quite annoying enemies, and shut the doors until they were destroyed. My "solution", rather than try to destroy the enemies, was to replace the part of the level script that closes the doors with another instance of the part that spawns the enemies, so there were now twice as many enemies, but I could just run past them and out the door. The later levels are really very fun, and you'll find yourself doing this sort of thing a lot. It's a pity there aren't more of them, but by the time I got to the final levels I was completely unsure whether I was "supposed" to be there or not, so I guess that would've only gotten worse.\n\nAnyway, if these scenarios sound like fun, give this a shot. It could do to be longer, but I think the Workshop might add levels (I haven't checked). This game is great for programmers or anyone who thinks messing with how the game world works while you're playing sounds like it could be interesting.","October 31, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You run around with a little sword that allows you access into what appears to be that entity's global variables, adjusting things such as HP, direction, alligience, etc. It has a decent storyline, and the game was actually quite entertaining.\n\nHowever, it gives you the sense that you are simply running around. There is no real sense of direction, similar to Pokemon that you just walked around until you found what you wanted, but to a bigger extreme.\n\nThe coding puzzles where you actually saw machines were not designed to encourage learning. My mentality going through those puzzles was "Ok hit this, look at random crap that makes no sense, change something, hit this, hit this, change, hit, change, OH I SOLVED IT!!" I am not a foreigner to coding, but the coding setups they have you work with are not intuitive in the slightest.\n\nThe game was incredibly short. I finished the game in about 4 hours, including loitering, screwing around with random objects, and having no idea where I was going. And the developers haven't made any contact or updates with the public really. It needs more content.\n\nOverall, the game felt like a side project, something that a few people casually worked on in their spare time, with user input being virtually useless, and no level of satisfaction from actually completing the puzzles. If you have money that you must spend, don't spend it here. But if you get the game for free, it will give you a couple hours of enjoyment","June 16, 2015","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Beware that it requires some experience in programming and code reading. Don't buy this game if you don't know anything about algorithmics (variable assignments, conditionals, loops, boolean algebra). The game won't teach you programming at all. It will just throw programming puzzles at your face and hope you understand what it all means. It's also worth noting that the code samples might frustrate experienced programmers because of the way the game wants you to edit scripts. The game doesn't let you modify everything you want in plain text. It just shows you the algorithms as machines and only lets you modify the code in a few spots. You can't remove or add code instructions for instance. And you can only modify some of the instructions, not all of them. But this doesn't mean that the game is simple. It is not. The amount of available scripts is quite big and each of them might contain dozens of code lines. Figuring what to modify remains fun and challenging. And some hacks will make you feel clever. There are also a few interesting secrets to uncover. In short, it's a great game but it's not for everyone.","January 1, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you don't have an active interest in programming or a ton of patience for bad design, it's not worth getting.\n\nAs a game, Hack 'n' Slash is simply unfun for the average player looking to immerse themselves in a cohesive narrative. The characters have some potential, but the world feels incomplete and the main mechanic becomes a chore surprisingly quickly. Even something as simple as remembering properties assigned to objects would have helped ease some of the burden. Instead, the player is forced to reprogram each object (aka hit it with a sword to bring up a selection menu of user-alterable variables within a preset range) every time they come across it. In effect, you're basically reminding a block that it needs to move a tile over so you can pass. Dodging flying enemies was especially infuriating as they're pretty much guaranteed to strip you of at least a heart each time upon being encountered - even with pre-emptive maneuvers. Add to that, exploration is obtuse, with multiple paths but nowhere to go.\n\nI'm likely not the target demographic here. I can imagine somebody out there will appreciate it as an example of game code being exposed in an interactive and novel way, but for the rest of us, it's just boring.

A Zelda-like game where you actively manipulate the game's internal structure to progress! Cool! Fun art style, buildup to a story, alright!\n3) Expands on 2. The puzzles ramp up, but in a mostly expected way. Wait, why did THAT crash everything? No worry. It still looks pretty fun.\n4) Um, ok, this is a huge step up from the past. Like, a completely different type of hacking. I did enjoy this part, as a legit challenge, since I do like learning about coding/scripting and and it seems like this is building up to a few hours of neat, coding inspired gameplay. ... Story here is basically nonexistent, though.\n5) ...What. Just, what. If you're going to throw THAT at me, why did you chose the very last couple of puzzles to do so?\n\nBasically, this is a game with a massive difficulty cliff at the very end of it for those not initially familiar with scripting. It is a game that can probably be beaten in 3 hours or less if you are, and if you are, you're wondering why you have to go through the game's UI of chapter 5 to do what you already know you need to do. Really, who on earth is the intended audience for the last chapter?! I'm pretty sure almost everyone is either nowhere near experienced enough in scripting to even know what to do, at all, or is experienced enough, and the ending is more an exercise in coping with a weird UI instead of just doing what you have to do yourself.\n\nAnd this is why I cannot recommend it. The first parts of the game as a great draw to people who like to think about changing variables, with an engaging gameplay style. The middle will do what's essentially a bait-and-switch from fun puzzle-action-adventure game to really tricky introduction to coding stuff. I had a hard time getting through Chapter 5 even WITH a walkthrough. I beat Chapter 4 without a guide or prior scripting experience in LUA.\n\nThat game really, REALLY feels like it ran out of budget in the end, and had to be really awkwardly compressed. The story's compression seems to second this.\n\nI beat that which I could be reasonably expected to complete, given my past coding/scripting knowledge, in about 2 and a half hours, and the last chapter felt completely inaccessible to me. For a game that costs over $10, it gives either 3-6 hours of gameplay before you hit a wall (be it the later parts of Chapter 3, Chapter 4 or Chapter 5)l or 3 or so hours of gameplay which is really not challenging because you KNOW what you're doing. Which isn't worth it.\n\nMaybe if you can get it on a pretty big discount, or in a bundle, it's worth experiencing. You're probably going to have fun for a little while, then wonder what the hell happened. I'd have loved a few hours of the first three or so chapters, instead of what I got.","October 14, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you don't understand some computer programming, the game becomes awkwardly difficult very suddenly, and if you do, then hacking in the game becomes very frustrating because it disallows multiple and creative solutions to puzzles. On top of all of this, the game will force repetitive dialogue and gameplay if you make a small mistake and have to reset a puzzle.

If you like games like Zelda, or Ittle Dew, this is the game for you. Hack 'n' Slash bring some comedy to the gameplay with quirky character design, and somewhat whitty dialogue. The gameplay is as the title suggests, a hack and slash. BUT, the twist is your sword won't do any damage, instead you'll have to manipulate the game as you play, rewriting pieces of code to suit your needs at that time. This is definitely for someone who might have an aptitude for understanding code (or looking up walkthroughs).\n\nTowards the end, there is a LOT of room for mistake, and I even caused the game to crash a number of times beacuse hacked together buggy code. It would seem Lua doesn't like my "creative" solutions to the problems at hand. But the autosave feature is well implemented, and when you resume a game, you pick at what point in space time you wish to continue, so I was never left stranded, nor did I have to start over.\n\nAll in all if you take your time to enjoy the game, it will last for 6 - 8 hours, which left me a little wanting when the credits started to roll. I hope Double FIne will double down and incorporate this unique gameplay aspect in another game.","July 6, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Likewise, if you go more than a step or two into water, you immediately fall beneath the waterline, giving the same animation and effect as if you had just walked off a cliff.

A Zelda-like game where you actively manipulate the game's internal structure to progress! Cool! Fun art style, buildup to a story, alright!\n3) Expands on 2. The puzzles ramp up, but in a mostly expected way. Wait, why did THAT crash everything? No worry. It still looks pretty fun.\n4) Um, ok, this is a huge step up from the past. Like, a completely different type of hacking. I did enjoy this part, as a legit challenge, since I do like learning about coding/scripting and and it seems like this is building up to a few hours of neat, coding inspired gameplay. ... Story here is basically nonexistent, though.\n5) ...What. Just, what. If you're going to throw THAT at me, why did you chose the very last couple of puzzles to do so?\n\nBasically, this is a game with a massive difficulty cliff at the very end of it for those not initially familiar with scripting. It is a game that can probably be beaten in 3 hours or less if you are, and if you are, you're wondering why you have to go through the game's UI of chapter 5 to do what you already know you need to do. Really, who on earth is the intended audience for the last chapter?! I'm pretty sure almost everyone is either nowhere near experienced enough in scripting to even know what to do, at all, or is experienced enough, and the ending is more an exercise in coping with a weird UI instead of just doing what you have to do yourself.\n\nAnd this is why I cannot recommend it. The first parts of the game as a great draw to people who like to think about changing variables, with an engaging gameplay style. The middle will do what's essentially a bait-and-switch from fun puzzle-action-adventure game to really tricky introduction to coding stuff. I had a hard time getting through Chapter 5 even WITH a walkthrough. I beat Chapter 4 without a guide or prior scripting experience in LUA.\n\nThat game really, REALLY feels like it ran out of budget in the end, and had to be really awkwardly compressed. The story's compression seems to second this.\n\nI beat that which I could be reasonably expected to complete, given my past coding/scripting knowledge, in about 2 and a half hours, and the last chapter felt completely inaccessible to me. For a game that costs over $10, it gives either 3-6 hours of gameplay before you hit a wall (be it the later parts of Chapter 3, Chapter 4 or Chapter 5)l or 3 or so hours of gameplay which is really not challenging because you KNOW what you're doing. Which isn't worth it.\n\nMaybe if you can get it on a pretty big discount, or in a bundle, it's worth experiencing. You're probably going to have fun for a little while, then wonder what the hell happened. I'd have loved a few hours of the first three or so chapters, instead of what I got.","October 14, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got to quite a far point in the game without collecting the glyph translator, something that I had difficulty getting around, but nonetheless I did get around it.\nAnd finally, it is very easy to hack it in a way it isn't supposed to be and break the game, and I could get over it. But when I got to the bosses castle I broke one of the battles beyond repair and to continue in the story line I would have to redo pretty much the entire castle, so this game will remain unfinished for me for a while.\nBut overall I did very much enjoy this game and the critical thinking part of it is something that you don't experience in very many games, so it has to get some merit for that.","October 11, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A Zelda-like game where you actively manipulate the game's internal structure to progress! Cool! Fun art style, buildup to a story, alright!\n3) Expands on 2. The puzzles ramp up, but in a mostly expected way. Wait, why did THAT crash everything? No worry. It still looks pretty fun.\n4) Um, ok, this is a huge step up from the past. Like, a completely different type of hacking. I did enjoy this part, as a legit challenge, since I do like learning about coding/scripting and and it seems like this is building up to a few hours of neat, coding inspired gameplay. ... Story here is basically nonexistent, though.\n5) ...What. Just, what. If you're going to throw THAT at me, why did you chose the very last couple of puzzles to do so?\n\nBasically, this is a game with a massive difficulty cliff at the very end of it for those not initially familiar with scripting. It is a game that can probably be beaten in 3 hours or less if you are, and if you are, you're wondering why you have to go through the game's UI of chapter 5 to do what you already know you need to do. Really, who on earth is the intended audience for the last chapter?! I'm pretty sure almost everyone is either nowhere near experienced enough in scripting to even know what to do, at all, or is experienced enough, and the ending is more an exercise in coping with a weird UI instead of just doing what you have to do yourself.\n\nAnd this is why I cannot recommend it. The first parts of the game as a great draw to people who like to think about changing variables, with an engaging gameplay style. The middle will do what's essentially a bait-and-switch from fun puzzle-action-adventure game to really tricky introduction to coding stuff. I had a hard time getting through Chapter 5 even WITH a walkthrough. I beat Chapter 4 without a guide or prior scripting experience in LUA.\n\nThat game really, REALLY feels like it ran out of budget in the end, and had to be really awkwardly compressed. The story's compression seems to second this.\n\nI beat that which I could be reasonably expected to complete, given my past coding/scripting knowledge, in about 2 and a half hours, and the last chapter felt completely inaccessible to me. For a game that costs over $10, it gives either 3-6 hours of gameplay before you hit a wall (be it the later parts of Chapter 3, Chapter 4 or Chapter 5)l or 3 or so hours of gameplay which is really not challenging because you KNOW what you're doing. Which isn't worth it.\n\nMaybe if you can get it on a pretty big discount, or in a bundle, it's worth experiencing. You're probably going to have fun for a little while, then wonder what the hell happened. I'd have loved a few hours of the first three or so chapters, instead of what I got.","October 14, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Art and characters were cute too. Unsure if there's just hidden content, but it starts at Act 2 and ends on Act 5. Act 2,3 were quite nice and interesting. Act 4,5 I found impossible to get through without a walkthrough for the most part.\n\nEven if you're into coding, it just gets so very busy (like for 1 object, there could be 6 code groups, which also have another sub-code within each of them), and there's barely any clues as to which variable(s) out of all that code you should mess with. One wrong step, you can "crash" your game, and have to restart the room.\nAnd later on, there's this huge place with dozens of code books, which like above, you'll have no idea what's important and what to edit.\n\nSometimes I would do something correctly, but still get an in-game crash, it just happens randomly (making me think I did something wrong and waste time trying other things), but other times, and unsure if just my computer (which is a nicely specced desktop), the game would freeze/crash, and I would have to end the process and restart the game entirely. Luckily it autosaves each time you go into a room.\n-------\n\nOverall, it's a very unique game, with great ideas, just can get kind of confusing, but I'm sure some would enjoy it.\nPersonally the frequency of real crashes and strange increase in coding difficulty were a bit off-putting, so I'm giving it a 6/10, but would still recommend it.","October 6, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But then I really enjoy it.  I've decided not to put it down for this reason, so I can complete it.\n\nThe music is great.  It grew on me.\nThe dialogue is also good.  It grew on me as well.\nI enjoy the puzzle solving immensely.  It feels very fresh and unique compared to other puzzles in games.  Some may be a little recycled but they still feel very novel to me.  Also, very rewarding to complete.  I would hate to ruin it with walkthroughs or spoilers.\nI really like the way you can seamlessly switch between mouse and keyboard.\n\n\nI do have a few complaints though.  The game is not entirely bug free.  For example, I had to hack "something"(real object omitted to avoid spoilers) to continue in the game, and while I thought of this solution first, I wasn't actually able to hack it.  So, I reluctantly resorted to a walkthrough just to find out that I had been right all along.  Then I continued to try and eventually it worked.  It may be less a bug and more of me not standing in the right place or something?  Weird hit detection?  I have no idea.\n\nAnother complaint is that, I have not been able to get the game to work with my rumblepad 2.  I assume the game uses Xinput, and my rumblepad only uses directinput.  Normally I just load X360ce into the folder and the controller works, but in this case I haven't been able to get it to work.  It may have something to do with some PS3 controller drivers interferring with x360ce, but I'm not sure.  However, the game is working my PS3 controller, using the aforementioned drivers, so this is the controller I've been using.  Also, in some ways the keyboard is superior, especially if you have a wireless keyboard.  And you can seamlessly switch between the controller and keyboard, which is nice.","September 20, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Initially you uncover the usual stuff - like get one heart more health etc. This seems important until basically two or three scenes later you discover how to raise your hearts to basically any amount you want. Yes, this teaches the basics of the game but is pretty disappointing, having such nonsensical interim achievements.\n\nSo, most of the first half of the game you interact with the game world by changing values in enemies and objects. This is generally fun and makes for some awesome puzzles, some of them so obscure they are true headscratchers. You also get to look at the first game scripts, but you cannot manipulate them directly, only the world.\n\nIn this way you keep collecting items that help you alter the game world and overcome scene by scene. Initially it seems like it is an open game world where you run around and do stuff in your own order. The walking around takes too long and adds no fun to the game itself or makes it more immersive. In reality it obscures that you can access maybe half a dozen initial areas, only half of which you can solve. The game is pretty linear in what order you must tackle things, it only makes solving the puzzles harder by not letting you know what fits where and what needs to be done next. Often frustratingly so! I missed up on the first boss because I didn't know where it would show up.\n\nIn general, the puzzles are between clever and entertaining to downright obscure in the first half of the game. Progress is good and you feel like accomplishing something. Just don't expect much of a plot or ability to divert from the order in which puzzles must be solved. The puzzles often involve manipulating the environment in new ways, sometimes you even miss out on the fact that you can affect the environment - like your little friend. Kudos to everyone who can beat this part without any sneak peeking, some stuff was really obscure.\n\nJust to make sure you know how the puzzles in this game are (mild spoiler follows): You need to guess correctly that the words you are trying to form by hacking several scripts are "Hack the planet." Good luck for those who didn't see "Hackers" or guess this right.\n\nIn the second half of the game you get to manipulate "game code" directly. So, you get access to the little scripts that steer things - doors, triggers, ports, etc. These scripts are written in some colorful Lua it seems. Expect no tutorial. People not knowing how to program need not apply. Don't know what a "continue" statement does? Now you will be in trouble. There is no help, no real tutorial, nothing. You just get presented with code and that's it. You then cannot freely modify it but only parts of it through a fairly obscure "walk around in the code" mini game. Most of the time the structure of the code is or seems fixed and you can only change values or operators to affect things.\n\nTo make matters worse and challening, the code is hacked and cobbled together. The more you progress, the more obscure the code becomes, and I still haven't found out how certain things work - especially since there seems to be some colored diamonds acting as variables and you never get to see all the code, nor modify all of it. As I understand it so far, you don't get to manipulate input parameters to the scripts - or to see them - and this makes the hacking all the more - well, hacky.\n\nI write code for a living and I find as I progress the game becomes more and more obscure. Lua is easy to pick up, but only the more logic-minded individuals with some previous programming knowledge will have a chance at succeeding. Plus, the code is deliberately obscure, so you will spend most of your time towards the end trying to outwit whoever wrote those scripts to solve puzzles. The game then becomes rather slow and tedious.\n\nI would say this game has a good and novel premise. It does not execute it well, nor does it a good job with teaching how to play itself, how to code, or how to understand code. There are sudden jumps in how challenging stuff is. Even trying to get a minor chest that was empty early on to spawn an item requires going through dozens of lines of obscure code, apparently even mixed up even with how the animations work. I gave up on that one.\n\nMost people who aren't into coding probably won't enjoy the game at all. Not everyone who does know how to write code might enjoy it either. The fun and charm of the characters from the beginning is practically absent in the second half where puzzles completely replace plot and all other elements of the game. Prepare to code yourself to victory. I didn't finish yet. Sooo tedious...","September 17, 2015","false","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is as the title suggests, a hack and slash. BUT, the twist is your sword won't do any damage, instead you'll have to manipulate the game as you play, rewriting pieces of code to suit your needs at that time. This is definitely for someone who might have an aptitude for understanding code (or looking up walkthroughs).\n\nTowards the end, there is a LOT of room for mistake, and I even caused the game to crash a number of times beacuse hacked together buggy code. It would seem Lua doesn't like my "creative" solutions to the problems at hand. But the autosave feature is well implemented, and when you resume a game, you pick at what point in space time you wish to continue, so I was never left stranded, nor did I have to start over.\n\nAll in all if you take your time to enjoy the game, it will last for 6 - 8 hours, which left me a little wanting when the credits started to roll.

The ability to hack and alter the parameters of the objects in the game world sounds like a cyberpunk dream come true - and to an extent, it is.  But only if your inner cyberpunker is also a pale, basement dwelling IT-phile whose only love in life is string after string of Python.\n\nThe IDEA is fantastic - the execution... lemme just say that if you don't have a programming background or interest, don't play.  The game assumes you know basic programming, drops a sword on you and says 'go' - pretty much literally.  There is no story to work from, no tutorial, the game just shoves you into the world and expects you to know what to do.  For a regular action adventure, sure!  But not offering even the slightest hint of how to play must be extremely frustrating for those who don't have the inside track on how to code.  All interactable objects require a series of variables to be changed in order to work properly.  Changing object parameters from 'true' to 'false' is the most basic, but later typing in strings of code from scratch is the order of the day.\n\nDon't be suckered into this beautiful game, thinking it's a Zelda homage or another Double Fine adventure brimming with personality - it's a university coding final with a GUI.","July 7, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a true novelty to it in this respect. After that it quickly turns into understanding how an object works internally and advances even quicker to a point where you have to cope with strange abominations of actual program code (looks like Lua). Without programming knowledge or a guide you only get about 50% of the game. The novelty then begins to wear off and you kinda ask yourself why they even bothered adding coding since the initial mechanics worked so well.\n\nI myself had to use a guide later on since even my considerable 10 years of coding experience didn't prepare me for how bad these puzzle can go. They are not even that complex, you just don't get what the game wants you to do. Later on you can seriously break the internals by accessing pretty much everything in the game world. That would be cool by itself, but it's really hard to decipher what was intented and what's simply a bug looking like ingame events.\n\nThat said, I kinda like what they did in the first half, but after that it pretty much goes downhill in terms of usability and understandability. If you like games for their ideas and concepts, it might be worthwhile.

Many people are not programmers, so it is difficult for them to progress in the game.  Lua is thankfully a friendlier language than C or Cobol.\n\nFor those who want to begin programming or try out programming, this game is great, but for those that just want to play a normal game,  don't buy it.","July 9, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However the learning curve for the puzzles gets too steep a few levels in, and can get very frustrating at that point. When wearing the hat, sometimes the platforms and depth of objects are near impossible to discern, which makes for further frustration. The first few levels, however, are pure genius.","March 17","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wish there were more quests to follow, though. The only way to continue getting better at using the hacking tools/weapons, and exploring the game's underbelly, is to play the game over again. It would be great to have additional quests, to keep going without repeating the story and starting over with fewer tools.","March 5","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is bizzare and weird and wonderful. You probbably need a decent grasp of how coding works to get the most out of the later parts of the game, but you don't need to have actually made a game before, I got by just fine with the gist of algorithms and a coupple of hours flailing about. It was a really cool and fun game, I really liked how open ended the later half of the game was, even if it ment having the entire universe collapse a few times. The early parts of the game are the simple "Hack" stuff, edditing a few select values, but later on the game litterally lets you edit the .lua files and really mess with it.\n\nNot everyone will like this game, The later half can be frustrating if you don't have a clue what you are doing, but ♥♥♥♥ing up and breaking with everything was part of the fun for me.\n\nI can definately see why people would dislike this game, the "Hack" stuff at the start of the game puts it into the wrong light.\n\nAlso supprising, the character design is really really good. There are like 5 or 6 characters in the whole game but I really enjoied the art and characterization of them.\n\nWell worth the about 14 dollars I spent on it, but if you are on the fence and not confident in your ability to read code, maybe wait for a sale.\n\nP.S. This may be the only game in my library that I can ♥♥♥♥ up so badly that I need to re-install every time I want to make a new game.","May 23","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
