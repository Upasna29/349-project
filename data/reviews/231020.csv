I have tried this game a few times earlier but quit because of bad controls - I am allergic to badly ported games. Now I have an XBox-controller and gave this game one more try.\n\nUnfortunately, Storm didn't convince me this time either. It's a shame because I really want to like this game. It's incredibly beautiful and has a great sountrack with relaxing sound effects. Also, it isn't developed by any big giants but by the much smaller Eko Software.\n\nI love the charming graphics but beyond that there isn't much in this game for me. I just get frustrated over stuck seeds and unmanageable controls. I can theoretically solve the required puzzles, but making the controls do what I want is a completely different matter. Maybe it is something for you if you like this kind of challenge, but for me this game experience turns into a stressful, frustrating mess. And I have to say it is a shame because, again, I love the concept and the visuals.\n\n2/10 seeds","November 29, 2014","false","0.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

That score is coming from a bunch of stuffy cublicle workers who work for big, conglomerated gamging sites. This is not a game for them, so it only stands they wouldn't like it. Do you enjoy puzzle games? Storm is for you. Did you enjoy Journey, Flower, flOw, or Puddle? Storm is for you. Storm isn't perfect by any means, don't get me wrong. But it is whimsical, relaxing, and nowhere near as frustrating as critics complain it is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luckspeare/recommended/231020/","Luckspeare","Luckspeare","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luckspeare/","58 products in account","Review of Storm, also referred to here as the "Rain Cooldown Waiting Simulator"\n\nThough it's touted as "family-friendly" and "serene," it is only so thematically.  In terms of actual gameplay, it is anything but serene, and far beyond what any but the most obsessive-compulsive and patient kids will tolerate.  In a nutshell, it is eye-poppingly, hair-tearingly, crying-out-loud frustrating, featuring arbitrary, artificial difficulty, abysmal controls, and more than anything, lots of waiting for the 10-second rain cooldown to go, go, GO.  Come ON, do I have to wait another 8 seconds to try something else on the 23rd try, again?  Really?\n\nWhat I mean by "arbitrary" and "artificial" difficulty is that, too often, because of some minor quirk, the right solution doesn't work.  In fact, there have been a number of levels where I did the correct solution to no avail, then spent another 30 minutes waiting for the rain cooldown timer over and over as I tried different solutions.  When I checked the solution, it just worked differently -- like, for example, using lightning to destroy a land formation to free a boulder, but the boulder falls the wrong way for whatever reason.\n\nThe worst is when you're on a multi-step puzzle with really fussy steps that are time-consuming (mostly because of that awful rain timer) and unreliable, and the nature of the puzzle means that a messup in timing or pixel clicking accuracy (especially with the clunky, imprecise controls and UI) on step 2 or 3 means you get knocked back to step 1.  I'm pretty patient with these sorts of things, but this just beat the hell out of my patience.  It's just infuriating when you've finally gotten it to work right on step two of a conceptually-simple three-step puzzle after 20 minutes, only to be sunk by some quirk of the third step and have to start all over.  My kids (10 and 13) scrunched their face and lost interest after giving a genuine, hours-long try.\n\nYou should not have to utter the words "life is too short for this" for a supposedly tranquility-inducing game.\n\n\nI really want to like this game.  I like the idea, I like the intent.  But playing it is like threading a needle with an excessively thick and frayed thread, with a mandatory 10-second retry timer and a 75% chance that something will come and randomly knock the thread back out every time you've gotten it almost through, so you have to start over.  It genuinely feels random all too often -- waiting for sparks from the grass fires to float in just the right way to a log somewhat nearby, waiting for the seed to float just right, etc.  And then you're constantly fighting with the UI, since the mouse-scrolling is hyper sensitive and quickly shifts the screen whenever you get within two inches of one side or the other -- which you will do constantly as you try to drag the mouse just right to generate a wind path.\n\nIt's a puzzle game where the right solution depends not only on whether you did the right thing, but a confluence of factors, half of them outside your effective control, that sometimes really don't quite come together for many tries, forcing you to start over and repeat the frustrating sequence of these puzzles again.\n\nAgain, I want to like it, but the developers have made it just punishing because of artificial difficulty and poor controls -- it's not difficult because it requires cleverness, but because it requires a confluence of things that feel random and/or not practicably controllable (i.e., will the wind carry one of these sparks that long distance just right?  I had to do the same action 10-20 times before it did it just right...  etc.).\n\nDevelopers, difficulty is good.  Replay value is good.  But the game being difficult because your controls are poor and because the structure of the game itself blocks successful interactions most of the time, even though the player does the right things, is bad.  And forcing the player to repeat the right solution over and over and over, waiting patiently for that long rain cooldown timer, is not replay value.\n\nWhile I appreciate the music and art style, I have come to be highly irritated by these problems in the game, and I can't but strongly recommend against it.\n\nIF the rain cooldown timer was shortened reasonably and some of the more nose-scrunching puzzles (Winter days 3 and 4, for example) were made less unreliable, I might be more forgiving of its other faults.  As it stands, I find that every time I quit this game, it's a rage-quit.  Aaarghghgh and all that.\n\nSide Note: I am clearly obsessive-compulsive myself, as else why would I have twelve hours in the game?  I guess I feel I have to give it a run all the way through if I'm going to give it a review as unfriendly as this...?  Maybe masochism.  But you can't say I haven't given it a really solid look.","October 4, 2015","false","11.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","0"

Despite all its visual beauty and tranquil atmosphere, Storm often manages to become irritating by (probably) unintended pitfalls in the level design or the clumsy implementation of its controls. The seed has a tendency to get stuck in places where no element can reach it, and perfectly good puzzles often become sour by the 10th slight off-placement of a wind or a 0.1s mistiming of a lightning.\nOn the other hand, Storm's basic concept is superb, and when none of the above clumsiness happens, it's sheer joy to guide your seed through the obstacles of nature. And, as hinted above, the hand-crafted visuals are a definite hit.\n\nIt would be too harsh to unrecommend the game, but I can only recommend it with reservation. If you're patient, you may be more forgiving towards the game's shortcomings, and have a great experience.

I can't comment on the gameplay, only the fact that you might need a new mouse to play the game.  Yes I am aware that some people can download software and reconfigure their mouse, but I wasn't one of those people and this information wasn't provided up front prior to purchasing.\n\nIn addition, even though my hardware and OS was much better than the recommended system requirements, there was a great deal of flickering and other issues that required closing and restarting the game several times each time I played.\n\nI hate to give a negative review, because it looks like a beautiful game with a teriffic concept, but if I can't play it, even at the sale price it's a waste of my money.","June 18, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
