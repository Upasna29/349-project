"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/415420/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Nyan Cat: Lost in Space is a platformer released in December 2015, developed by isTom Games Kft. The game focuses on the cute loveable meme , Nyan Cat.\n\nGameplay takes on the role of a very simple but highly addictive platformer. Nyan Cat is constantly moving across the screen and you control when to jump and how far. The aim of the game is to collect as many objects as possible to boost your score and multiplier rating. The game has a very infinite runner vibe to it as there is no actual end on the classic mode.  As you progress through the stages, you will encounter objects which are not always so kind to Nyan Cat, such as bombs, dogs and UFOs which attack you! There are a few other game modes, but none of them come close to being anywhere near as fun as the classic mode.\n\nGraphically Nyan Cat is really pleasing on the eye. The cartoon art style and cute animations really do the game justice. Of course it isn’t going to be super realistic visuals or high resolution, because well, it’s Nyan Cat who has been drawn on something like MS Paint. The classic Nyan Cat sound track is played constantly in the background, so if you are easily annoyed by it, you may want to mute the sound, however if you are the sort to be annoyed by it, you probably won’t be the sort to play this game either.\n\nThis isn’t a really hard game; it just takes a bit of practice to get really good at it. There will be moments where you just get recked by some random event that you had no control over, but that is part of the joy of this game. The game features loads of powerups which help you collect more objects to boost that score, but there are also plenty of downgrades too which will hinder you.\n\nThere are a couple of different backgrounds and themes to play in, all of which have a neat look which is represented very well. Not to mention there is an editor program that allows you to customize how your Nyan Cat looks, as well as Nyanagotchi, where you are able to look after your Nyan cat by washing him, tickling him etc. You are rewarded with gifts for making your Nyan happy which may be cosmetic items.\n\nNyan Cat is a very casual, pick up and play game, you won’t be able to play it for hours on end, but it is really fun for 15 minutes here and there. Whilst in total I have only played Nyan Cat for just under an hour, it is certainly a game I will keep installed as it always brings a smile to my face when I load it up. If you are really into your endless runner type of games, this is obviously not going to be better than the likes of BitTrip, but it is a really nice little competition in that genre. With the addition of leader boards for friends and globally, it adds a little edge to the game which may be overlooked in others of this type.\n\nI didn’t have any technical problems whilst playing. The game can be played either using a controller or mouse and keyboard. Either is fine due to the simplicity of the controls. I personally opt for the mouse option but both works just as good as each other.\n\nTo sum up, Nyan Cat is your run of the mill OK game. Its part of a genre which already has some really bit names but the low price tag makes this a really good entry level game for the endless runner genre. You of course have to find amusement in the Nyan Cat meme to get anywhere near as much of a smirk from the game though. £1.99 is a great deal and I would recommend you consider it today even just for half an hour of fun.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

To expect great things from the game, and to be disappointed when those expectations are not met, is quite normal. When judgement is rendered solely on the result of those expectations, the fatal mistake is made. It in turn leads to a propensity for jumping to conclusions, and from that point it's a rapid descent into ignorance.\n\nBack when Fallout 4 was released, most of the Steam reviews consisted of incoherent, furious ranting that tarnished the whole title after only a few hours worth of gameplay. After being shocked by the overwhelming amount of negativity, I decided to make my own and openly condemned the bad reviews for what they were: baseless and devoid of perspective. It was quite obvious the authors made that fatal mistake, which is unfair to the many developers who put their soul and passion into creating the game.\n\nIn the end, Fallout fans will almost assuredly find disappointments with Fallout 4, as did I. But if the ignorance of the older reviews and reception of previous games ought to teach one thing, it's that those disappointments are no excuse for blind judgement or jumping to conclusions. If an opinion is to be rendered of this game in the form of review, let it be guided by reason and supported by logic. It is in the pursuit of that fairness and clarity that I chose to write this review.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nFallout 4 is a deeply enjoyable and well-crafted game. However, it definitely has its issues. Bethesda tried new things in this title, some more ambitious than others, and not all of them were successful.\n\nIt's true that dialogue has been watered down as the devs chose to forgo text conversation choices in favor of a voiced and much more simplified dialogue wheel, which is further hampered by boring choices and weak voice work. Character advancements have been combined into a single perk/SPECIAL sheet. Settlement building, while certainly fun, is mostly aesthetic filler that has little impact on the game world. Side quests far too often amount to just killing some mandatory enemies, particularly with the Minutemen (who are supposed to be the "good guys" of this installment), and can become repetitive.\n\nMy most prominent grievance with Fallout 4 is the dialogue overhaul and removal of the karma system, which was completely unnecessary and not desired by a single player in existence. Unlike the previous flaws, this thoroughly irks me. I realized that this ties in to the primary weakness of Fallout 4: its lack of meaningful dialogue in comparison to most Bethesda titles. Far too often, your dialogue choices are short, shallow, meaningless, or all three.\n\nThe only choices that have any outcome are blatantly outlined as persuasion options, a lot of which only help you get some extra caps. It's not that you should be making major decisions all the time; the problem is that you, as a speaking character, now have a voice that carries no power. What you decide to say is almost always inconsequential. The dialogue system is highly reminiscent of Mass Effect except watered down; the reason it doesn't work in Fallout is that the two games have totally different approaches to conversation. The previous Fallout games had much better dialogue options because they meant something. Sometimes, your choice of words just made someone hate you, allowed you to entice or inspire others, or developed your reputation through the karma system. Now that karma is gone, your choices are just that much more pointless.\n\nThe bottom line is that Bethesda sacrificed a tremendous amount of RPG dialogue elements to accommodate full voice-work. While it was an ambitious attempt, it was an all-around mistake and it sticks out like a sore if you're a fan of Bethesda games or RPG's in general. The dialogue wheel system could have worked out just fine, but Bethesda carried it out in the wrong way.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nAll the aforementioned flaws are some of the most central complaints naysayers have about Fallout 4 and yet not a single one of them has been horrific enough to ruin my experience or let me down. Despite the few bugs I've come across, despite the certain questionable and sometimes idiotic design choices Bethesda made here, this game is still extremely well done. I still feel that incomparable thrill that only Fallout can bring.\n\nEven though Fallout 4 falls extremely short on dialogue and all aspects associated with it, it's still an improvement over its predecessors in almost every other way imaginable. The game suffers some graphical issues like muddy textures and poor lighting at times, like any good Bethesda game, but it's still astoundingly beautiful and even breathtaking at times. Movement, melee, gunplay, and physics are better and smoother than they've ever been.\n\nPeople were quick to judge the Commonwealth map based on its size and I was prepared to be disappointed as well, but it's surprisingly the best one Bethesda has whipped up thus far. The suburban locations are more organically dispersed and things become more compressed as you near the cities. Streets are narrow, buildings are tall, and locations are absolutely jam-packed alongside a ton of unmarked ruins and buildings you can enter. There are hardly any copy-pasted environments and they all show great attention to detail.\n\nI was also worried that granting access to power armor and a minigun within the first thirty minutes of the game would be a huge balancing issue as well, but it really isn’t. Power armor relies on uncommon fusion cores for power and you’re not an unstoppable god while wearing the suit, especially not at higher difficulties or levels. You can acquire some strong weapons like the minigun or Fatman relatively early but finding sufficient ammo is another matter entirely.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nSkyrim was a simplification of the Oblivion formula, but it was still a fantastic game. In much the same way, Fallout 4 is a simplification of the Fallout 3/New Vegas formula and is still extremely good. Even in light of its issues, this game has not been a disappointment at all. RPG elements can be enhanced through the wonderful modding community and will eventually make up for some of the game's weaker points, a perk of the PC version. Bethesda has, however, been on a recent trend of simplifying their games too much and I hope they change course.\n\nTruthfully, the negative Steam reviews had me partly worried that I’d be disappointed but I chose to disregard them and arrive at my own opinion. I’ve learned that nearly every point of contention was blown out of context. The few issues that haven’t been redeemed in my eyes still pale in the face of the tremendous work that was done to bring this new and beautiful Fallout world to life. I have no doubt that the naysayers worked up their expectations to heights beyond reason, and it’s therefore no mystery that they hit the ground so hard afterwards. I chose to see Fallout 4 for what it is rather than what I expected or imagined it to be: a lovingly crafted game that, despite being marred by some of its shortcomings, has that same engaging splendor that far supercedes its flaws.\n\nI highly recommend you try the game and approach it with a neutral and reasonable demeanor, and you won’t be disappointed.\n\n----------------------------------------\nEDIT\nI'm grateful that so many people have found this review helpful and I'd like to thank you all for commenting. I can't reply to everyone's comments but I've certainly read every one of them.\n\nI hope that my review has given you some useful perspective, either good or bad.\n\nEDIT #2\nReworked the intro to be less confrontational, as it was no longer needed. Changed some undesirable sentences.","April 13","true","0.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","9","11","7","4"

Control is simple you should jump and sometimes deactivating dynamites in a biggest part of time. It's used during some of the classic modes. But a game also have some another mode, for example Tamagotchi. In a classic modes you also collect coins, which you can spend for different level, or other kinds of boosts at Tamagotchi. The game offers some quest like : collect 100 bottles in one round etc. In a game when you run you can pick up a lot different boosters what makes your game even funnier. The graphic is simple, all confirmed in good known Nyan Cat style and music is also the classical Nyan music.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+multiple game modes\n+easy control\n+steam achievements and trading cards\n\n-if you play long time in a row can be tiresome\n-well if you listen too long a music its maybe can be annoying for you\n\nThe game does not want be more than what it is. Price for this game quite low, but I think its better buy with discount or in a bundle.\n\n7/10","December 31, 2015","true","6.0"," 35 of 63 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","35","63","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/recommended/415420/","MrWoodenSheep","MrWoodenSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/","2273 products in account","Nyan Cat: Lost in Space. An infinite runner about a pop tart meme cat that spews rainbows out of its butt.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9CB5l3431w\nI recommend the game, but perhaps not for its full price, and here's why:\nThe game is decent fun. It's a simple one with an easy to understand objective, that allows you to just relax and play for a bit from time to time, slowly upgrading your cat and beating your previous scores.\n\nYou can purchase temporary upgrades that make your life easier for that one run until you die, or permanent upgrades that cost a bit more, but will stick with you forever.\n\nThe game is simple fun, but the main problem is it gets repetitive. There isn't much to keep you engaged for long. There are a few game modes to choose from, but most of them offer very little in addition to the original gameplay.\n\nIn the Classic game mode, you need to survive as long as possible, jumping from platform to platform, collecting food to increase your score, and avoiding enemies while grabbing powerups.\n\nThe Universe game mode is exactly the same, but has a timer that will kill you when it counts down to zero. To avoid dying, you need to collect enough batteries to warp to the next area, which plays the same, but just has a different look. (In my opinion this is the most fun game mode)\n\nThe Nyan wings game mode is like the popular app "Tiny Wings". It's the most different game mode to the others. You hold the mouse button down to dive. You need to time your clicks properly to maintain your momentum throughout the level.\n\nThe Zen game mode is the same as Classic, however with less bombs and more platforms. Basically, easy mode.\n\nThe Tac Nayn game mode, has you play as Nyan cat's "rival". The only difference I've found so far is that you move from right to left instead.\n\nOut of all of these, you can see why the game might grow a bit old after a while. The upgrades can only offer incentive to continue playing for a small amount of time.\n\nYou can also take care of a virtual Nyan cat pet in Nyangotchi mode, where you buy food and toys for him, as well as petting him. Doing so will eventually yield a gift, but in my opinion it's too boring to be worth it.\n\nOne thing I loved is that you can create your own Nyan cat. There's an editor that allows you to draw each individual body part, including the trail you leave behind. I got to make a cute little MrWoodenSheep Nyan cat, which is fun.\n\nThe game is a mobile port, which is apparent at times with the lack of proper mouse navigation. You can use the keyboard just fine, but sometimes you'll need to either drag your mouse to flick through menus, or use the scroll wheel as opposed to just clicking on the option you want. It can be frustrating at times, but it's not a big deal.\n\nFinally, the music. The entire time that you're playing, you will be blessed/cursed with a constant infinite loop of the Nyan cat song. I think it's an alright song, but it gets very tiresome hearing it constantly, no matter what menu you're on. Playing the game, main menu or feeding your Nyangotchi. I get that it's the cat's theme song, but we could have done with some other songs. Occasionally some powerups change the song up a bit, but it isn't enough to keep it from getting annoying.\n\nOverall, the game is quite a bit of fun, but can get old quite quickly. I personally would only buy it if it's on sale, but the starter price is quite cheap anyway so it isn't a huge deal. Apart from the menu navigation and repetitive music, the game is decently made and can be a good time spender when you're bored.

The core gameplay is repetetitive though, so bear that in mind if Nyan Cat doesn't appeal to you.\n\nThe regular game mode has you guiding your Nyan through space and beyond, while collecting food (points) and coins (currency for tamogotchi accessories and unlockables). Your cat is on\n\nautopilot so the only controls needed are a jump button and the occasional mouse movement to guide rocket-powered Nyan or mouse click to disarm bombs. This mode is a somewhat samey,\n\nsurvive-as-long-as-you-can affair but the wide variety of funny powerups will keep you grinning from ear to ear.\n\nTrue Nyan Cat fans will be delighted to see that arch-nemesis Tac Nayn (how can you not laugh every time you say that?) not only makes apprearances as an enemy/pest but as a controller\n\ncharacter in his own game mode, complete with true anti-nyan right-to-left gameplay!\n\nThe tamogotchi mode is a joy. It gives you a real incentive to continue playing and collect more coins. Toys, goggles, hats, furniture, sets of skins etc can all be unlocked. Most importantly though, you can create your own Nyans (yes, multiple Nyans!) and completely customize them with a very easy to use editor. There really is a surprising amount of features and\n\npersonalisation present in this game.\n\nMy personal favourite modes to play are:\nthe tricky-to-master Nyan Wings, where you have to accelrate and decelerate across hills and valleys to build up enough speed to fly to the next planet!\nUniverse: collect enough flux batteries before time runs out and warp to the next area!\nI hope you like the Nyan Cat theme, because thats the only music track on offer. Anything else would be sacrilege. Your Nyan also "talks" via random text-only speech bubbles. Because he/she is a cat, the grammar isn't perfect. You can turn the music and speech bubbles off if you wish though.\n\nYou may not extract as much fun out of Nyan Cat: Lost in Space if you're not a fan of the meme or randomness or pixelated cats, but everyone else will certainly get more than enough fun for the slim 2.99 asking price. An ideal game for the Nyan cat appreciator.\n\n\nWatch some gameplay snippets here if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQo39wexVnI\n\n\nGiveaway here (ends January 4th 2016): https://www.bobmanbob.com","December 18, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But if you were to compare the prices between the two (if you were to buy into the paid items in the free app) this game is significantly a lot more cheaper. And after taking a look on iTunes (iOS) I've noticed that there's a Lot of in-app purchases same with Android of course. While the game on Steam makes it so you unlock everything.

Its fun! Yayyyy =3\nThe game has a  few different mini games, from sliding over hills getting chased by an evil nyan [Tac Nayn] to flying thru the endless galaxy.\nYou can smoke weed and become Nyan Marley.\nIf that isn't fun enough already you can be creative and make ur own Nyan cat.\nBut that's not all...\nThere is a Nyanagotchi mode where you need to keep ur Nyan cat happy by playing with him, feeding him, and train him. You get a room for ur Nyan that you can decorate. And not only the room but also Nyan cats appearance.\nThe game is worth way more than it actually costs. 3 Euro is like nothing!\nThe options are endless in this game. So don't wait any longer just buy it. You will love it.\n\n▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀█\n▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█░▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▓▒▒▓▒▒▒▒▒▒▒░█\n▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█░▒▒▓▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▄▄▒▓▒▒░█░▄▄\n▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▄▀▀▄▄█░▒▒▒▒▒▒▓▒▒▒▒█░░▀▄▄▄▄▄▀░░█\n▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█░░░░█░▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█░░░░░░░░░░░█\n▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▀▀▄▄█░▒▒▒▒▓▒▒▒▓▒█░░░█▒░░░░█▒░░█\n▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█░▒▓▒▒▒▒▓▒▒▒█░░░░░░░▀░░░░░█\n▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▄▄█░▒▒▒▓▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█░░█▄▄█▄▄█░░█\n▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█░░░█▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄█░█▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄█\n▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▄▄█░░█▄▄█░░░░░░█▄▄█░░█▄▄█\n\nTʜᴇʏ Tᴏʟᴅ ᴍᴇ I ᴄᴏᴜʟᴅ ʙᴇ ᴀɴʏᴛʜɪɴɢ!

I was looking for something cheap to buy.. Sadly I came across this game, I could not pass the opportunity. My brains did not allow me to click off to leave this page. I got this feeling I've never had before.. I had to buy this game. I knew this game would not entertain me for long but I had to get it. I added the game to the cart, after buying the game it took roughly 1minute to download. I hesitated to click "Play" but I did. First thing I hear is the theme song coming very loud through my headset to my ears... I try the game for the first time.. I feel stupid for wasting 2,60€ on a game which is pointless in a long run. After a few tries I noticed I am addicted, I needed to get higher and higher on the leaderboard as it would actually matter (it really does not) now sitting at roughly 90th I had to stop playing to save my ears for a while..\n\nOk now for the serious part:\n\nDo I recommend? : YES! Even though its quite expensive for a game like this you should get it. Its addicting like CS:GO.\nAre there any cons?: No :DD\n\nYayy release day review :D\n\nI rate 11/10.","December 4, 2015","true","1.3"," 14 of 55 people (25%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","25","14","55","7","0"

People might say ad things about this game because it's an "outdated meme" or something like that, but to break it down here's the good things and bad things:\n\nCONS:\n-Once everything is unlocked (which in all fairness, does take a while) there's no replayability\n-The annoying music, sounds, and phrases Nyan Cat says\n-The platforms are randomly generated, making it impossible to survive if you're at the bottom sometimes, which isn't relying on skill but just pure luck\n-Movement is extremely limited\n\nNow that all the ucky stuff is out of the way, let's get to the good:\n\nPROS:\n-Excellent, relaxing casual game\n-Custom Skins! (Someone as immature as me is loving this)\n-You can take care of and dress up your own Nyan!\n-5 different game modes\n-Funny and entertaining power-ups\n-Upgrades that make the game more fun\n-TAC NAYN MODE!\n\nAll in all, while this game can be tedious and annoying, it's cute and entertaining and a great casual game.\nI can say that it is worth it's low and generous price!","December 19, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The PC controls are better than I expected, the graphics were nice (excluding the 8bit space background) the permenant bonuses are cheaper thann mobile (a LOT cheaper like holy crap the mobile prices were extreme it took me HOURS to get all off those and here I got them in less than an hour).
