If he’s not really deep into Russian pop culture of course. Puzzles are… weird. Really weird. It has some kind of logic though. Totally drunk logic. What else? A Soviet/Russian mix of absurd jokes or better yet to say Absolut jokes.  Seriously. Characters seem to be drunk or a bit high all the time. Every single one of them.  I’m not surprised it was that popular in Russia back then in late 90s. Love, laugh and liquor make harsh times bearable. In case you want to enjoy this game, you should keep it in mind and a glass of vodka in your hand. You will definitely have some laughs then and, who knows, maybe you will start to love Russia afterwards.","February 21","true","3.6"," 67 of 72 people (93%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","93","67","72","15","4"

Can be completed in 7-8 hours.\n\n\nRecommended for:\nPlayers who can handle crude humor, some pixel nudity and for lovers of the point & click genre.\n\nThe good:\n+ Interesting characters, world and storyline\n+ Well animated\n+ Voice acting is good (in Russian, adding to the atmosphere)\n+ Good port to Unity with plenty of achievements and trade cards\n+ Alt+tab works fine, and so does the Steam overlay (even in your native resolution, which is rare for old games!)\n\n\nThe bad:\n- Too many random pauses between voice lines\n- Inconsistent art at some points (some characters look like they were drawn in MS Paint, for example the woman at the train station)\n- English translation is good, but has some errors in it (been typed as "ben", shall typed as "shell, etc)\n- The hints are sometimes completely useless and confusing\n- Game file compression: 400 MB download, but takes 3 GB of disk space, which is A LOT for a game from 1998\n- No music in a lot of interior maps\n- Some of the walking animations are long, tedious and unskippable.\n- There's only autosave. While this works fine, you're at constant risk to ruin your progress if you click "new game" in the main menu by accident. This is a poor design decision.\n- No actual tutorial telling you that you can quick travel using the map, explains interaction, ...\n\n\nGameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXof68TtA6Y (slightly cut, no voice comments)","February 19","true","7.4"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","38","39","2","0"

There are so many puzzles and things to explore in this game that you won't really get bored of it. The game itself is very good, although there are some things that aren't explained at all that makes this game fall a little but none the less it's a very good game,\n\nGame PlayThis game is basically a point and click puzzle game with some very funny humour implemented into it as well. From what I have played so far it seems to be really fun, the puzzles are very nicely created. If you ever get stuck there is a nice help system that points you in the right direction so that you don't get stuck and so that you can progress with the storyline. This really helps you as some point & click games are way too hard with the puzzles that they have created, but this has very simple and easy puzzles to solve. There is a lot of things to look at and find in this game so exploring everything right from the start is very essential to this game. The humour that is used is very funny at times, trying to chat up other girls, and using a substitute as a scarecrow really got me in stitches. It doesn't over do the humour in a sense that it gets boring, it does it just enough to keep you laughing and smiling when a joke does happen. There are a few problems I have with this game though, and that is the controls for the game. There is absolutely no indication of what controls do what, for example I didn't realise that I had the suitcase with all my stuff in until about a hour and half into the game. You really need to add either a controls section in the settings menu, or add it at the start of the game. This also caused the problem as Vasily Ivanovich is sometimes in the way of the arrow so that you can exit out of the area. Such as the bridge that have the guards, if you didn't know that you can move Vasily Ivanovich then you might have some trouble finding the arrow as it's right under where he is standing. Another thing that I wasn't aware of while playing the game until later on was the fast travel system. If you have been to a area then you can go onto the map and click on that area to fast travel there. This would've been really helpful if I would've known that earlier.\nScore (Out Of 10): 7 - nice game play, and well balanced puzzles. Need to add some way of telling the played what controls do what so that they can understand how to play more efficently.\n\nGraphics/art styleThe art style of this game is really nicely animated. It seems that there was a lot of time and dedication when it came to drawing out the backgrounds and the characters animations. I really don't really have anything to complain about this as it is just so well animated and drawn out. Although some of the art style seems to be a little blurry and don't fit in with the rest of them, but I guess that's just to help you with what you have to click on to explore and stuff.\nScore (Out Of 10): 8 - Very nice drawn graphics, and animated characters. Some of the art style seems to be a bit blurry and doesn't really fit in with the rest.\n\nMusic & SoundThe music is very fitting with the atmosphere as you walk around the areas, helping people out and solving puzzles. I would've liked to have some music in the background of the houses, as the music only comes on when your exploring the main area. The sounds are exceptionally good, I really liked all of the sounds that where played when certain things happened to characters.\nScore (Out Of 10): 9 - Really nice music and sounds, would've liked some music inside the houses.\n\nConclusionThis is defiantly a gem point & click game. It has some really nice puzzles that aren't too difficult to figure out, although I would've liked a small tutorial for what all the buttons are as I only figured out all the buttons after a hour and a half. The music and sounds are exceptionally good, and the art style is just superb. Along with the animations of the characters, I am really surprised of how well this game is for a drawn game. Would defiantly recommend this game to anyone.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","February 18","true","7.0"," 37 of 52 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","37","52","0","0"

It's a point'n'click game with the main story happening in Russia during a Civil War, where our characters go in a recovery mission for the lost flag, and they end up saving the world, at least for the moment. The main protagonist are Vasily Ivanovich Chapaev(in the subtitle Chapaev won't be mentioned) and Pete(like this his name is translated...I think in the old game he was called Petka) and for a short period even Anka.\n\nThe graphics are the original ones. The soundtrack is fitting with the environment. The only downside(if you can count it a downside) is the lack of the English voice over,English being present only as a subtitle. For the controls we have the clasic one and a new, simplified casual mode. There is an inventory system which is accesed by right click in casual mode or by selecting it from the menu in the clasic mode. Also there is a hint system which can help when you are stuck, sometimes the hints be vague and that can prologue the time required to figure what you need to do next. There are a lot of jokes and references in the game.\n\nThe game is divided in three sequences. Each one happening in another zone. First sequence is in the Red Base, second one in the White Base, where around half of the sequence Anka is the protagonist(as a spy with the name Anna), and the third one in the alien base on the moon.\n\nIf you are a big fan of achievements/trading cards no worry. Red Comrades Save the Galaxy: Reloaded have them both.\n\nNote - This game was reviewed using a key provided by the publisher.","February 21","true","9.6"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SteamUnderPressure/recommended/415610/","SteamUnderPressure","Air","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SteamUnderPressure/","1751 products in account","Point and click adventure game with a quest to find a Russian symbol.\n\nTrue to it's Russian nature you'll see a lot of Russian stereotypes and clichés which can be fun and annoying.\n\nI do wonder whether I'm walking through some sort of mini-Russia with drunks on the streets and being poor with almost everyone asking for money and many things just broken or in a worn down state. To come accross Very rude and impolite people is something I didn't expect, actually.\n\n\nThe game has a very usable system to interact with the envoirement and a handy map that will transport you trough the game if you don't feel like taking your characters walking. Beautifully drawn backgrounds and freshly designed lead characters. Still has that olden days Russia look of course. With Russian voices make it sound true to it's Russian nature. It's was hilarious to hear them talk in Russian for the first time, luckely the English subtiltes made sense. That's where this game differentiates from other point&click games, it's Russia style of handling things.\n\nYou can rely on an in-game help system although I still haven't found how to fully utilise, didn't stop me going exploring the game and but what seemed at first like a short game isn't true. It's prolly gonna take quite some hours to complete this game.\n\nThis game lives and breathes Russia, so buy it and give yourself a Russian adventure.\n\n\nA key was provided so this game could be reviewed.\n\nEdited to correct the spoiler tag.","February 18","true","18.0"," 29 of 45 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","29","45","3","1"

But in regards to the story, it is like an epitome of platitude! There are stupid jokes, there are dirty jokes, and there is nudity and nakedness and then even more nudity. A little bit of it could actually be funny, but put in just too much of it - and it would look and sound both strange and silly.\n\nBesides, while the remake is generally faithful to the 1998 original and very nice-looking, there are some critical bugs in it unfortunately - and NO manual saves! So, if you are unlucky enough to meet the Evil Alien who freezes the game or duplicates itself making it impossible for you to go further - you have to play again from the very beginning (or to look for somebody else's saves in community threads).\n\nSo - buy it only if you are sure you can handle a heavy load of dirty jokes - or if you have played this game in 1998 and just want to satisfy your nostalgia.","February 21","false","12.9"," 36 of 162 people (22%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","22","36","162","5","1"
