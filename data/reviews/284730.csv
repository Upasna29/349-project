You put together solid narratives, do interesting things with your plots, invest some time in your puzzles, and put out consistently good products. The monkey helper doesn't quite rate against the kitten helper, but this is still a sturdy little adventure. A lot of your games in this line are beautiful to play, but I can see why this one doesn't have the same aesthetic.\n\nBut let's talk about something, ok? Flint and steel. The rock shaves off tiny pieces of steel, and the combination of friction and the steel itself cause the steel to briefly burn. So: sparks.\n\nBanging two pieces of flint together just makes more chips of flint. No sparks.  You can keep giving me puzzles where I use pieces of flint to start fires if you want, this is a game, not a survival manual, but I want you to know: it does not work.","December 25, 2014","true","3.8"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","84","36","43","22","0"

Jim Gibbons seems to be behind that but why? It's up to you to discover the truth.\n\nThe story is well-written and full of twists. While the outcome is expected, the way to attain it is surprising.\n\nAnyway, if you're used to hidden objects games, Dark Arcana isn't a revolution: the hidden objects scenes are really easy, the puzzles aren't too hard. However, the addition of Miles, the little monkey, is nice. He can go grab objects out of your reach for you. And he makes noises when he's needed. However, what is disappointing is the fact that the map isn't used for travelling. After a while, you may be tired to go back and forth between two locations.\n\nAs I've said, Dark Arcana is set in a dark world and it's well represented without it being scary. I would have preferred more dark settings as the whole mirror world is yellowish. The soundtrack is also good: while the tune is known to be used in any fair settings, the small remix is enough to show that you're not in a joyful world.\n\nDark Arcana comes with bonus. I'm not speaking about achievements or trading cards. I'm speaking about the soundtrack you can save, wallpapers, hidden objects scenes, concept art or a bonus chapter, where you're Jim and if I remember well, is a sequel to the events.\n\nAnyway, if Dark Arcana isn't innovative, it's still a very good hidden object from Artifex Mundi. And well, while it has not the quality of Nightmares from the Deep or Grim Legends or even 9 Clues 2: The Ward, it's still better than some other games out there.","February 2","true","5.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Come, step right up! See the greatest show on Earth (or at least the part projected to the Earthly plane.  Then investigate the part that is not.)  One of the better off-kilter mystery circus/carnival games I have played.  Though Madame Fate and the sequel Fates Carnival is still among my favorite carnivals (most likely due to over the top characters and body count).\n\nStory: Jim Gibbons, a once famous precision knife thrower, has opened a carnival 25 years after the tragic death of his wife and asssistant, Alice.  One fine day, after taking her daughter to the House of Terror a woman named Susan Jones gets trapped and disappears in the House of Terror.  As a detective, the gamer must find the missing woman and reunite her with her daughter.  Any more storyline would spoil to the story and the surprises.  Concise fast paced storyline without plot holes that is mystery, action and adventure (with quite a bit of the supernatural thrown in).\n\nGameplay: Let us start with the Hidden Object aspect.  The HO scenes are predominate over the point and click aspect putting it firmly in the HO realm.  The find clues are easy to see and match the area they are found in.  There are a couple of odd clues like windwill (which is a fan).  Unsure if that is a translation error or if windwill is a type of fan.  Shrug.  The HO scenes I would rate on the top side of easy simply because I could actually find all the clues in less then a minute the first time I saw the scene.  (Usually I have to pick up that achievement - Find all clues in less then a minute - during the second playthough and after practicing.)  Not that easy HO scenes are a bad thing.  Helps keep the gamer's mind on the story more then the finding of clues.\n\nThis game is broken up into sections and takes place in two separate realms, the earthly plane and the mirror world.  Each section has its own objectives and build and use inventory.  This is a progressive game, so each section needs to be completed before the gamer can move on.  This gives the game a quasi-open world feel as each section's tasks are completed.  There is back and forth movement that occurs within the section, and some sections are larger then others.  There is a map, 3 in fact, but they are not fast travel.  (Fast travel is unnecessary.)  There are penalties for HO word find hints and misclicks when achievement hunting.\n\nNext .... The monkey; your little helper, and what a cute, fuzzy little helper he is.  Once the gamer has the monkey he is quite useful not only for reaching those out of reach places but he "screams/chatters" and waves at you when he has a task that he can perform somewhere.  He is a big hint when something out of reach needs to be found and retrieved.  He is quiet the rest of the time.  The animation of the monkey is unique since he crawls out of his little "use" circle then into the story scene.  Of course like all monkeys he is a lively character and it shows.\n\nActual puzzles include logic, music, circles, sliders, simple piece puzzles and cooking a turkey.  The basic usual fare with average difficulty.\n\nLast of all there is a required second playthrough for achievement hunters.  And with all Artifex Mundi games there is alternate game instead of the HO scene.  This time the game is Monaco, a strategy matching game.  Here is a hint about the Monaco gameplay for achievement hunters: If the gamer plays the hidden object scene until one or two word finds are left then switches to Monaco and finishes the Monaco game at least two of the achievements regarding Monaco are easy to obtain in that way.\n\nThis game comes with extras: wall papers, music, concept art, cut scene replay and a bonus chapter.  The bonus chapter is in many ways an epilogue, but is stand alone in its own right since the character changes as well as that character's objectives and motives.  (No spoilers.)\n\nFun and easy to play.  Well worth the price.","November 21, 2015","true","9.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.\n\nThat's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.\n\nThey do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.\n\nMy recommendation, because of the "if you've played one you've played them all" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games.","August 12, 2015","false","3.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Normally this leads to a stereotypical story, but the writing quickly falls apart: this police detective too casually accepts the existence of a magical mirror world ruled by the Evil One (yes, that really is its name). Still, all is not lost, since the third act has some excellent writing and clever plot twists that make up for the blunders of the first two acts.\n\nThe gameplay has a similar dichotomy. The hidden object scenes are either impossibly crowded or too empty. The puzzles are usually easy, but the amount of backtracking is just insane… at least it helps to boost the game time well over three hours.\n\nIf you like Artifex Mundi, Dark Arcana is a solid pick, but for the average hidden object game fan it is recommended to play through the publisher’s other games first.","January 1, 2015","true","4.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I've stayed away mainly because I didn't have 'enough time' to play this kind of games. Reason for avoiding the whole genre is because it was dumbed down on mobile phones and social network platforms, plus the last time I've played it, it was way too simple and rested on eye-hand-spot-and-click coordination.\n\nI've managed to snatch Artifex Mundi 10 games pack super cheap and decided to see what's new in the genre. Dark Arcana: The Carnival for installed first because of the name. Anything that whispers 'paranormal' and has carnival theme, I'm on it.\n\nThe storyline is cheap, yet effective, holding attention and progressing nicely, with few dull moments by the end. Also, it contains a 'plot twist' which most players will probably expect, but I didn't think about it, so it rewarded me with pleasant surprise. It's cheesy, but not super cheap.\n\nBeside hidden objects scenes, you also have mini game puzzles and certain aspects of point'n'click adventures. HOG players might find it strange I'm pointing this out, but as I said, I'm not a HOG player and didn't follow progression of the genre. Mini games are easy and fun, usually a different variants of well known puzzling designs. There's an evident difficulty progression which I did like and some puzzles by the end took some more effort, but none of those are frustrating or super hard. When you solve hidden object scene or mini puzzle, you usually get an item you need to use somewhere and most of the time you're well aware where to use it.\n\nGraphically, Dark Arcana is presented via nice, hand drawn backgrounds, music and sounds are appropriate and movie scenes are super cheap and feel like something that came out of the nineties, but they also set the mood in a way, by being what they are. Horror fans will also enjoy different tributes, intentional or unintentional, such as Freddy Krueger's glove, Chucky-like dolls, Frighteners movie inspired villains and so on.\n\nTo sum it up, Dark Arcana: The Carnival is short, sweet HOG experience that keeps your attention for three hours which is enough for one walkthrough (and you'll do more if you want to unlock all achievements). I've enjoyed its settings and occasional story silliness and it made me want to play another HOG adventure sometime soon.","November 26, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I am a big fan of their previous outings (see my reviews), but this one left much to be desired.  Even on expert mode, it was far too easy and incredibly straightforward.  It's quite a shame given that their track record is typically very good, but I guess they can't all be amazing works.\n\nDark Arcana is standard Mundi fare with HOGs sandwiched between various puzzles and item fetches.  There's nothing you don't expect in here and naturally, the creepy character models make a triumphant return.  Oddly, the fortune teller is animated very differently with classic "open mouth" animation whereas other characters speak with typical mouth-morphing "lip sync".  At any rate, not that we play these games for story, this one is a bit of a stinker, imo, but more importantly, the puzzles make absolutely no sense.  Granted, in a Mundi game, many puzzles are somewhat out of place in the way you wonder why the police station in Raccoon City is so ridiculously push-blocky.  However, here, there just seems to be a disconnect, moreso than in other Mundi games, and I felt that Dark Arcana was phoned in; even the items in the HOGs don't randomize like they usually do.

It's largely unfun and keep in mind that I despise shanghai/mahjong when I say this - I would rather play shanghai/mahjong.\n\nAnyways, if you have a choice of Mundi games, I would choose another one, but this one will keep you occupied for a couple of hours.

The game seems a little on the short side, but the story and the well done eerie atmosphere does tend to make up for it. The point and click sections that link everything together are also well enough done (although the monkey animations are pretty dodgy).\n\nThere were three flaws that did stand out, with one being the repetitiveness of some of the HOG scenes - while the two parallel worlds theme was quite cool, and reusing but warping some of the locations was a good idea, it meant you ended up doing the same scene up to 3 times in some cases, often having to find a bunch of the exact same items in the exact same places - now where the item had changed a lot this sort of worked, but plenty of the items don't significantly change so it just feels too much like a retread.\n\nThe other two main negatives were the naming bugs in a couple of the HOG scenes (if you are told to look for a Windwill, it means a fan, and one time you are told to look for a record but it means a plate/large bowl, and in the bonus content the plate they ask you to find is actually a record, etc.) The other issue I had was the puzzles, which were all easy, tending to trivial,","September 5, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(If anyone knows games where you just get the puzzles, no story, no hidden objects, let me know.)\n\nAs to the rest, the images (scenes) are pleasant, the hidden object games and story are nice (and as mentioned, I don't actually play this for them), the alternative to the hidden object games is interesting too (though it took me a bit to realize that column, symbol, and row wouldn't remove objects, but cards in the Monaco game).\n\nIt was entertaining enough to play through 3 times, to complete the achievements. (First time I alternated between HO/Monaco a few times, so be sure I got them all, I did the expert mode right after the first play-through, with only Monaco, and another easy play-through for HO.)

I like what they did aesthetically with the mirroring of locations and puzzles.\n\nThere aren't quite as many HOSs as I would have liked, but I enjoyed the ones that were there, and I liked how they kept getting more and more absurd as the game went on. I honestly never thought I'd be scouring a puzzle to find a "chicken manicure," but this game just said, "You know what? severed chicken feet deserve to feel pretty too." I can respect that.\n\nThere were a handful of repeated puzzle screens, but most of the time the game either changed something about the visuals to make it feel fresh, or it had you searching for a different set of items than the first time. The bonus mission got a bit lazy in this regard, though.\n\nThere were also a few labeling snafus in the HOSs, such as a vinyl record being labeled as a plate, a bowl being labeled as a record, and a fan being labeled as a "windwill." Just one good beta test would have caught these errors.\n\nAs an alternative to the HOSs, you can play a game of Monoco. I had never heard of this game before, and they don't provide you with in-game instructions (unless that was part of the general tutorial that I skipped), so I was a bit lost trying to figure out what to do. Basically, the goal is to clear all of the fancy-bordered tiles by matching them with adjacent tiles that share the same core image. You can also make matches between two normal cards to clear them from the board and shift tiles over, but only the fancy cards count towards solving the puzzle. As you make matches, meters will fill up in the side bar. When a meter is full, you can click on it to clear an entire row, column, or set of symbols from the board.\n\nOn the whole, the HOSs and mini-games were too easy, even by genre standards. It almost felt like the game didn't know who its audience was, since the subject matter dealt with horror and death, but the puzzles felt child-like in their simplicity.\n\nAnother thing to note about the mini-games is that a few rely on colour recognition. You are able to skip these challenges, but colourblind individuals will have difficulty if they are going for any of the mini-game completion achievements.\n\nIn the game, you get a monkey companion who can be used as an object to fetch hard-to-reach items. He will screech on any screen that requires you to use him. I like this game mechanic because it makes more sense in the context of a carnival to be running around with a trained monkey than with an armful of poles, ladders, and grappling hooks.\n\nOne side thing that kind of amused me was that the writers of this game know nothing about fires. Rubbing two pieces of flint together will not create a fire, and pouring water on an electric fire will not put it out. Smokey Bear should pay these guys a visit.\n\nOverall, this is a fairly standard formulaic title from Artifex Mundi. If you like their other games, and are looking for something in the same vein, you will not be disappointed. If you are just a fan of HOGs in general, and want to play a game with good graphics, a coherent enough story, very casual puzzles, the ability to play a card game if you get stuck, and built-in bonus content, then definitely give this a try.

Unfortunately, it's one of their less recent ones.  So, it will require at least two runthroughs to get 100% Achievements (and if you mess up part way through a run, you can't quit and start over -- you'll have to finish the game you started before restarting).  The story and voice acting are decent (well, for a HOG), and the graphics and puzzles are fine.  I did notice quite a few more blatant language issues in the HOGs though.  Three of the most egregious are 1) a record is not a plate, a fan is not a windmill, and the golden mask of King Tut is not a sphinx.  The only other negative I can come up with is that the storyline in the Bonus Chapter is, in a word, dumb.\n\nIt took me 3.6 hours to finish my first run of the main game, another 0.7 hours for the Bonus Chapter, and then another 2.1 hours for my second run of the main game to get 100% Achievements.  That's 6.4 hours of decent game play.  So, I'm recommending the game.  But, I'd also recommend finding it on sale for something close to $5.","August 31, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like what they did aesthetically with the mirroring of locations and puzzles.\n\nThere aren't quite as many HOSs as I would have liked, but I enjoyed the ones that were there, and I liked how they kept getting more and more absurd as the game went on. I honestly never thought I'd be scouring a puzzle to find a "chicken manicure," but this game just said, "You know what? severed chicken feet deserve to feel pretty too." I can respect that.\n\nThere were a handful of repeated puzzle screens, but most of the time the game either changed something about the visuals to make it feel fresh, or it had you searching for a different set of items than the first time. The bonus mission got a bit lazy in this regard, though.\n\nThere were also a few labeling snafus in the HOSs, such as a vinyl record being labeled as a plate, a bowl being labeled as a record, and a fan being labeled as a "windwill." Just one good beta test would have caught these errors.\n\nAs an alternative to the HOSs, you can play a game of Monoco. I had never heard of this game before, and they don't provide you with in-game instructions (unless that was part of the general tutorial that I skipped), so I was a bit lost trying to figure out what to do. Basically, the goal is to clear all of the fancy-bordered tiles by matching them with adjacent tiles that share the same core image. You can also make matches between two normal cards to clear them from the board and shift tiles over, but only the fancy cards count towards solving the puzzle. As you make matches, meters will fill up in the side bar. When a meter is full, you can click on it to clear an entire row, column, or set of symbols from the board.\n\nOn the whole, the HOSs and mini-games were too easy, even by genre standards. It almost felt like the game didn't know who its audience was, since the subject matter dealt with horror and death, but the puzzles felt child-like in their simplicity.\n\nAnother thing to note about the mini-games is that a few rely on colour recognition. You are able to skip these challenges, but colourblind individuals will have difficulty if they are going for any of the mini-game completion achievements.\n\nIn the game, you get a monkey companion who can be used as an object to fetch hard-to-reach items. He will screech on any screen that requires you to use him. I like this game mechanic because it makes more sense in the context of a carnival to be running around with a trained monkey than with an armful of poles, ladders, and grappling hooks.\n\nOne side thing that kind of amused me was that the writers of this game know nothing about fires. Rubbing two pieces of flint together will not create a fire, and pouring water on an electric fire will not put it out. Smokey Bear should pay these guys a visit.\n\nOverall, this is a fairly standard formulaic title from Artifex Mundi. If you like their other games, and are looking for something in the same vein, you will not be disappointed. If you are just a fan of HOGs in general, and want to play a game with good graphics, a coherent enough story, very casual puzzles, the ability to play a card game if you get stuck, and built-in bonus content, then definitely give this a try. It doesn't have nearly the same gravitas or challenge level as some of the studio's other games, but it scratches the HOG itch pretty well. I give it a 7.5/10.","May 4, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
