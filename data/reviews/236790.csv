BUT.......... No support from the developers and the fact that you cannot even start a new game makes this product unuseable. It's too bad that this has happened to this game because I enjoyed it very much up until I was unable to play due to the developer abandoning us here on Steam. I cannot give this game a good reveiw at all. Purchase Farming Simulator 2013 instead.","November 25, 2013","false","231.1"," 169 of 203 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","169","203","0","14"

The developer Actalogic is just not up to par to develop quality games, since they use an outdated and broken game engine that has so many holes you'd think it was Fallout New Vegas' Hoover Dam being fought over by the NCR and Ceasar's Legion.\n\nFor 1 whole month a number of players and the CEO of Actalogic tried to work together to debug the game by testing over and over to make a list of reproducable errors (not all that easy to do for some).  Each little 'patch' would end up plugging one hole to only create 3 new holes in the 'Hoover Dam' that is AG2013.  In the end Mr. CeO just left for vacation and never returned leaving us with a long list of promises and upcoming updates.\n\nIF you're lucky to get it to work on your PC and think all is smooth sailing, just wait...you just wait.   Play the game using the same save file for 20+hrs using the equipment to build your own farm up.  Then, you'll know what we already know.","November 27, 2013","false","149.4"," 96 of 110 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","96","110","0","0"

As someone who has played and enjoyed many hours of Farming Simulator 2013 but found certain aspects lacking I saw Agricltural Simulator 2013 to be the answer my wants. With the ability to reshape fields, hire workers and manage them in all aspects it seemed to have all the features I was looking for. Unfortunately, while those features are present, the game itself is a horrible pile of bugs which make it unplayable even at lowest settings. I cannot recommend that anyone spend actual money on this game.","November 27, 2013","false","12.1"," 90 of 103 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","90","103","0","0"

He also owns a lot of toy versions of them and plays a lot of them.\n\nHowever - I thought it could be fun to show him a few things in this game. I really tried to get into the routines and the GUI and controls....but nothing is made well.\n\nThe worst point of all is that it's not running smooth at all. It's lagging all the time and it's looking terrible if I turn everything down. It's not a problem of my rig. I know that a lot of people are able to play this game without any problems but I can't. I tried different video drivers and a few other tweaks.\n\nCheck the forums - there is no support for this game anymore. No patches. The game feels like a beta build.\n\nEven if you are able to play the game smooth, a lot of gear and naturals are randomly disappearing, the GUI is not intuitive, you are "waking up" at a huge famn and have no idea what animals you have, what fields you have, where they are, what vehicles you have,... nothing. You have to figure out everything on your own.\n\nFor a short period I thought it's maybe my fault,...that my rig is guilty that this game is not running well, that I'm too stupid to manage my farm and so on. I downloaded the free Farming Simulator 2013 demo and it's great.\n\nTL;TR\nThis game is NOT Farming Simulator (Landwirtschafts-Simutator).

Instead, they choose to sell it at full price even though they abandoned all work on it in the summer of 2013. AS2013 could have been the game to beat, with its awesome terrain deformation and beautiful lighting effect. Instead it's just a sad reminder of what could have been if it had been given to a responsible developer.\n\nThis game is utterly, utterly broken and should not be bought by anyone.","October 10, 2014","false","126.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

I have no severe lag or studdering as I've seen mentioned, nothing really out of the ordinary given that I know the game has a few problems.  I also haven't gone looking for problems either.\n\nI did follow the advice of a couple of posts about adjusting the some settings using the command window, don't know if that helped or not but the game runs fine.  As long as you're not expecting to aquire a polished and completely stable game and you don't mind the occasional/frequent glitches you should be able to enjoy the game.  Be advised, it is a true farming sim unlike Farming Simulator (which I own) or the new Pro Farmer (I've tried the demo).  You have to do everything manually and it takes time.\n\nI hate to be the oddball posting a positive review amongst the overwhelming negative but given I know it has problems, it's not that bad.  Maybe I'm just one of the lucky ones but then again if you think about it most product reviews are reviews written by people that had problems with the item.

Graphics are worse, gameplay is worse, UI is worse.  Everything about this game is worse than the one they released in 2011.\n\nI've only played it a short little bit due to how bad everything is.  The textures are constantly tearing.  There are gaps in the world, and the mipmipping of textures works terribly.  Roads disappear and reappear as sections of a different road.  Trees will change types due to mipmipping as well (moving away from object.)  The tractor parts disappear if you get to far (short) away.\n\nThe town is smaller, however you get 4 different smaller ones to look at now.  Fields are much different, you no longer have preset fields but instead make your own.  However it doesn't work nor tell you where to make one.\n\nEverything about this game is "bad," as an understatement.

Graphics are also sub par.\n\nShame when a game is released that isn't finished and the makers don't appear to have wanted to come back and finish the job either. This game looked to have a lot of potential with some polishing.","August 16, 2014","false","38.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Here's just some of the issues I've had within just 20 mins of "gameplay":\n- Have to play on Very Low settings in order to get FPS over 15. My rig can play games like BF3/Skyrim at Ultra High and at least get 30 - not bragging, just to give you an idea of what kind of system this thing lags on.\n- You can easily get stuck in a tree using the tractor. Thank god for the reset key (I think it's Q)\n- The back end of the tractor glitched out and had a VERY LONG POLE coming out of the side.\n- - Props to the physics engine though - it recognized this and made the tractor tilt realistically. I guess that's a plus?\n- I pick up where I left off and my character won't stop moving left. I tried everything short of restarting the game, no dice.\n- At one tutorial, the tractor just took off by itself.\n\nSeriously, if I knew what caused these glitches, I'd avoid them, but I'm finding more and more as I start to play. On a side note, the game looks great, and it seems like this would be a great simulator if, you know, it worked. I'd demand a refund, but I picked it up in a humble bundle.

He uses his magic powers to teleport himself into various vehicles (even ones with doors blocked or are completely flipped over!) and connect parts of machines together from 3 feet away. He can also control objects from a medium range. Sadly, due to corporate greed, only the back half of all of the things available in the game are solid. However, one may easily drive over cattle and make pigs spin to make up for this fact. Vehicles are equipped with amazing features such as having no pedals, having your feet go through the floor, and the brilliant safety feature of being made of rubber. This makes it so when you flip over repeatadly, you simply bounce back up again. Other vehicles can simply ride along the ground sideways with ease. I am excited for the sequel to this glorious game where our wizard has mastered the art of time travel. Perhaps it was hidden in the playgrounds next to the gas station libraries.","March 14, 2014","false","3.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

To start with the game was near impossible to launch. I had to reinstall my PhysX drivers (This seems to be a common issue). Finally after getting the game to work I opened the game to be very disappointed. Just moving the mouse around on the menu is painfully laggy so doing precise things like ploughing is near impossible.\n\nI have a high spec Gaming PC with the Latest Nvidia Graphics card, so my hardware is not the issue.

And two, It lacks direction, you have to frustrate yourself by trying to figure out how to do everything. I'm not saying it needs a four hour tutorial before you spawn in but it would be nice to have some sort of system in place to not only get the player obvious information, but to make sure that the information is suficient and not just one or two sentences unless necessary.\nI played it some on my older computer but when I downloaded and installed the game on my new very capable computer the game couldn't even complete the initial boot of the game.

It worked at first for the first 2 days fine... then I started messing with the graphics options. I would think my $800 build would be able to play this game flawlessly as I have no problems with Battlefield 4, Skyrim, GTA IV  running at MAX settings. Well, turning the settings down in the game made it play worse! The FPS was probably like 10-15 FPS on the worst settings. MAX settings had about 20-30 FPS. The combination of bugs and horriblie coding of this game makes it unplayable. Not to mention it's hard to find video tutorials online and forums about the game since Farming Simulator gets mistaken for it on Google, making it hard to find out what to do in the game to get started. For example, the game never tells you where to buy seeds, or that there even is a market where you can buy seeds.

Perhaps, it may be much better if I WAS ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME RIGHT. The engine is actually really beautiful for a simulator and such, but that comes with a downside. It is terribly optimized. I have a really fair computer that actually meets the recommended requirements, yet I can barely top off 30 fps (frames per second) on medium. In retrospect, I was not able to play this game. I can say that I really don't mind if the graphics are good or not, but when I can't get a respectable fps, it's too hard for me to play.\n\nThe driving is abyssal with very simple physic calculations, like flipping over a tractor going five MPH and taking a small turn. Sadly, because of my previous woe with the performance, I was not able to try much of the game out, so for those with really powerful computers and want to try this, go ahead, but don't expect much.\n\nThe game would've been amazing if it wasn't for the ♥♥♥♥-poor performance with the engine.","March 27, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game was not that bad, but it had some major issues with gameplay. So I was waiting and during that I was able to play it.. more or less.... and after some patch or what.... it was even more broken than before. I couldnt play it anymore. I decided to wait for some patches ? Fixes ? Now after a very loooong time I upgraded my PC. This is compare for games recommended HW configuration and my HW configuration:\n\nRecommended HW        My HW                Windows 7        Windows 7 64bit                2.6 GHz Quad Core (Intel Core i5, AMD Phenom X4)        4.00GHz Intel Core i7 4790k                4GB RAM        16GB RAM            Geforce GTX 560 or Radeon HD 7790        GTX 980 4GB            Dx 9.0        Dx 11.1\nAnd the result ? So I'm forced to lower my Graphic setting to medium (to make game run at + - 60FPS 1080p) and my game runs at 1080p with very unstable FPS (18FPS is the lowest I had). I drive around map and my FPS jumping like some bunny.... 18, 40, 30, 50, 60, 40, 30.... LOLz. Very badly optimized game and what is even more sad..... the game developers obviously decided to leave this game as it is and dont bother to come up with some patch to fix this.... nice.\n\nOther than that... I think this game have some good potential.... it could be one of the best farming sim games there ever was.... agrar sim 2011 is just one empty boring game.... this game could have been so much better.... there are so many things you can do.... seed, harvest, have animals like sheeps, cows, bulls, horses, feed them, sell them, sell their products, manage your greenhouses, water crops there and much more. I think that those greenhouses in this game are so much more fun to play with than in any other farming sim game.... I was really enjoying it until that patch they once released completely made my game to not run slightly playable anymore.\n\nSo my rating for this game is like 4/10 - I DO NOT recommend. If you cant play it properly, you cant enjoy it and if you cant enjoy it, there is no reason to buy this game. Right now with my PC I'm slightly able to play it again and it makes it even more sad that developers decided to dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about this game. At the start they seem that they really care about this game... they were actively responding to players in discussion section, were giving some tips on how to make the game run.\n\nIf you are some game developer and want to release game in beta with bugs and other problems... trust me... it can NEVER end well. Your game will be always the game that was buggy and horrible even when you release patches and fixes to repair it... or if you not... then it will end up like this game. Total disaster. So sad...\n\n\n","May 29","false","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are alot of problems with this game. For starters, like the sims 3, it'll set the graphics on the lowest possible setting. Second of all, the game crashed while I was looking for a trailer to tow with my truck (i don't know if trailers can be towed with trucks but i tried anyway) And by the way, the truck is the ONLY good thing about this game. And for the graphics, my Alienware can't even handle them. Last but not least, there are so many little bugs as well. Like when I clicked on the icon next to my cellar, the camera locked up and I could only look forward for the entire time. And why can the truck only fo 20mph on cruise level 3? Overall, this game SUCKS and I don't recommend it to anyone. And no, unlike the screenshots, there are no John Deere tractors in this game, except that one that appered to be over 80 years old.\n\nUPDATE - Now the game won't open at all.","January 8, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Why is this guy recommending some BS game? Well, we all have diffrent opinions, right? There isnt much to say about this, so i'll just go for the 3 things im aiming for in this review. First things first, it likes to crash, everytime you start a new game straight after one in the game. But it doesnt bother me much. The other thing which is a thing with me personally, is the detail. Its very high, and requiers a very, very good computer to run, but mine just about runs on a detailed enough setting, but I have it on the lowest settings, but it doesnt bother me, all I want is for it to run good so that I can get a unfortunately low-graphic, but smoother gameplay. And last, but not least, we move on to veichles. Again, high detail which is good, and some various ones we are all familiar with (Fendt, Massey Ferguson) and some that are made up (Gecko) but are good working and based on a real model! (Claas) Overall, the game isnt great, but then isnt awful. Its the middle man of simulation in my opinion.

I want to like it so much, but I can't. For every right thing this game does there are three things done wrong.\n\nMost glaringly, the game performs terribly on its higher settings. I have a GTX 770 with a 570 for PhysX, 16 GB RAM, and an i5 overclocked to 4 Ghz. It can't handle AgrarSim 2013 on anything higher than Medium. Know this before playing it.\n\nNow on to the gameplay. Common to all the other farming simulations out there, the game's tutorial only cares about teaching you how to operate the machinery. The tutorial doesn't tell you anything about:\n\n1. Making fields (you can just plow anywhere, it turns out, and marking them out on the map is only for the benefit of AI workers).\n2. How and where to sell your harvest (the mill, the town, the agrarian centre).\n3. How and where to buy the things you need, like animals, seeds, and fertilisers (seed bags from town, seed loads from the agrarian centre, animals from the stables).\n4. How to buy new equipment (the O key).\n5. The differences between scenarios (the two hardest scenarios for each map have the same descriptions, but the second one is easier because it gives you an extra $10,000 and some basic machinery).\n6. Where things are on the map and how to use the map view.\n7. How to advance to the next day (hold down Ctrl and click on the sun icon near the clock).\n\nThe game requires a LOT of micro-management. You need to drive your harvest to the sale point. You need to buy individual bags of seed to load the bottom-of-the-line ('historical') seeder, and you need to load those bags into the seeder yourself. There is a grain shower that you can use to load trailers with grain from your silo, but you can't use it to load the historical seeder. You need a gravity hopper to bag your grain so that you can load the seeder. You need to drive your machinery all the way to the agrarian centre to sell it, and in the early game your tractor does an average of 15 mph, so it takes about 10 minutes to travel anywhere.\n\nAgrarSim 2013 is also legendary for its crazy physics and unintuitive behaviour. Attachments fall at awkward angles that prevent attachment, and there's no way to rescue or reset them. A several-ton combine harvester can do a backflip when driven over a furrow at 5 mph. The historical seeder can often go nuts and flip your tractor over. There's no way to nudge around an unhitched trailer on foot, so you need to keep adjusting your tractor. If you try to sprint while carrying a seed bag, its collider bumps up against you and slows you down. The on-foot FOV is the narrowest I've ever seen in a video game (45° horizontal), and you will be disoriented for a second or two every time you step off the tractor. The mill won't buy trailers full of grain from you, it only wants bags. A MILL, FOR GOD'S SAKE. And one time I loaded some bags of grain onto a trailer and brought it halfway home, then saved the game and played something else. When I reloaded, the grain bags were gone! Just disappeared into the aether, never to be seen again!\n\nAnd yet for all its massive, unforgiveable problems and its numerous hair-tearing moments of frustration and confusion, AgrarSim offers something you can't get out of any other game right now. Because you see, when you drop a plow into the ground in AgrarSim, it actually digs out a furrow. It's a hole, an excavation, you can stand inside it. And when you drag a cultivator over that land, it smooths the furrows out. The simple act of working the soil is immediate and rewarding, and when you seed it and see your crops springing up there's a great sense of satisfaction and wonder.\n\nI think as a gaming experience, this game is worth about $5. As a simulator it's worth about $0.50. The gameplay is just too unpredictable. But it sure is fun to work the land!","December 10, 2013","true","17.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/236790/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Agricultural Simulator 2013 - Steam Edition, is a simulator that allows you to learn all of the aspects of running a modern farm, from the comfort of your chair. As far as simulators go, it is one of the easiest I've seen in a long time. The tutorial walks you through each step and let's you play through the process of how to hook up and unhook equipment, manage fields and livestock, maintaining your equipment, as well as much more. You are given a choice of 4 different regions to choose from, as well as three different maps. The farm equipment used in-game, is based on actual equipment farmers use,  bringing another immersive level to the game.\n\nCampaign mode is available, aside from tutorial missions, and you can also start a new game and build your own fully functioning Agricultural Farm from the ground up with only the bare minimum. Campaign mode has several missions for you to complete, for those want a little more direction, and there are a bunch of different types of crops you can grow. They seem to have a pretty healthy selection, each with their own challenges and rewards. All in all this is a pretty fun simulator, which kind of surprised me. I didn't think farming would actually be fun, but if you like simulator games, this is a good one to try out.","July 18, 2015","true","0.8"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

Years from now, people will be wondering if gaming will ever reach the high standards of Agricultural Simulator 2013. Believe the hype, this game constantly pushes the boundaries of quality story, graphics, and gameplay. Every now and then I have to remind myself that this is a game, and I'm not actually farming.

Heed my warning: Agricultural Simulation 2013 is beyond my mortal comprehension. I have now seen the true face of evil.\n\nThe best part of this game was the menu screen, and just because it was in HD. And it had a tractor in it. I was sceptic at best, but proceeded to selection screen. "Hmm, Tuscany, that seems nice enough", I thought to myself. Without any ceremonies, the game dumps me onto a courtyard filled with chickens, multiple buildings, a dog and a tractor. In glorious 3D, except ran through multiple gaussian blur filters.\n\nChickens flee at my wake as I run around the yard for a while. I take my hands off the keyboard, and my farmer alter ego keeps running. I disconnect gamepad and joystick, to no avail. Dog on the yard barks as I strafe around the yard, unable to stop. I try to steer myself towards the tractor standing in the corner of the yard, but I just climb over the damn thing and keep on running. Finally, after fiddling around with sound (wtf?!) options, I manage to disable the mystical autopilot feature.\n\nI fiddle around with tractor for a while, managing to fire it up. The farmer is walking faster than the damn machine, so I just ditch it. I start rummaging through the multitude of various buildings around. I find some supplies from the cellar of my house. Items vanish into thin air as the farmer uses his nifty jedi powers to move sacks, milk containers and crates of fruit around.\n\nI spot some livestock on the other side of the yard. Apparently I have some cows, a horse and a sheep or two. They make funny sounds when you click them. After few clicks I realize I have now managed to lock my horse into infite rotating loop. Few short moments later all my livestock are rotating around like some ♥♥♥♥ed up experimental farm yard merry-go-round. The display is too grotesque to behold, so I close the pen behind me, jump onto my trusty Massey-Ferguson and ride out of the farm.\n\nMassey charges forward like a crippled manatee. I manage to enable autopilot again, and the top speed settles around 10. Mph or Kph, I have no clue. Running would be faster, but I dare not to challenge the wilds by foot. I take a smoke break. Get some late night snack. Take a leak. I come back to find massey around 100m away from the farm. In my frustration, I steer right, and all the rules of physics and universe fly out of the window. Massey's nose goes up, right around it's axle, and I land the vehicle upside down. My farmer doesn't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ as the camera clips inside his skull, apparently the weight of the tractor doesn't really bother him.\n\nAt this point, I pressed escape, exited the game, uninstalled it and removed it from my Steam game list.","December 23, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If the creators of the game would actually take the time to make it right by removing all of the bugs and crashes and with all of the concepts still in the game, then this game would be worth a whole lot more to people who actually enjoy these games.\n\nI can't recommend this product due to the bugs and crashes as mentioned, but if they come out with a game that doesn't crash all the time then I would more than honored to recommend a game when it works.  I know the creators of the game Actalogic can make a great game.
