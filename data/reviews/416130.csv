It is free, but it is only an hr long visual novel, probably even shorter if you read faster.  It sets up a story that finishes quick with no actual goal to the end.  The story, the characters, none of it matters since they just toss everything and end it.  There is a 18+ love scene (by text) in this game and for some reason this is the reason to thumb it up for most the reviewers here.\n\nBottom line, the story is interesting at first (an alien ring is found by a girl) til you realized it is rushed only to make an end, it is something they could have ran with and made a full visual novel with high praises.  This just seems to be a quick attempt to get noticed and throw out a Ren'py visual novel (basically RPG maker for visual novels) that took little effort.\n\nFriends don't waste your time on this one, unless you want two easy achievements.  I can appreciate effort but this had very little unfortunately.","November 10, 2015","false","1.4"," 196 of 255 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","196","255","8","9"

ON STEAM?!  ‚Ä¶..FOR FREE?!?!?!\n\nYou heard right.   This game is a lesbian visual novel that is actually 18+ and does show girl nipples.  So, what‚Äôs this game about?  Really?  Well, I guess I should tell you.\n\nIn general, you follow a brat loli called Azure (who is apparently 18) who skips class and doesn‚Äôt give a sh*t about her father who loves her..the same father who works as an ace detective who is probably working on a homicide case each day.  She one day steals a ring after sneaking out of her room after being grounded and is hunted down by a voluptuous girl who wants marry Azure because she permanently has a ring on her finger.  This alien girl Sienna‚Ä¶she pretty much wants to--\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552877220\n\nWait, I didn‚Äôt quite catch that, did she say--?   Yes‚Ä¶.The one cutscene that has people rating this game up instantly near the end (Should you choose 18+.  If you don‚Äôt, it just skips that scene entirely, giving you a rather lackluster story)\n\nPROS:\nFree\n2 Achievements\nLesbian romance\nNekkid lesbian cutscene (Explicit content‚Ä¶.with sex dialogue)\nSienna\nShort? (See concluding details)\n\nCONS:\nSubpar story with inconsistencies  (Not terrible, it‚Äôs cute‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶the main character really ruins it.  Consistencies like "Why can't Sienna just put the ring on herself...and why didn't she?")\nTrash tier loli waifu Azure  (I‚Äôm serious, she‚Äôs a brat whose actions either make her own loving father live the rest of his life in guilt or taking his own life‚Ä¶she‚Äôs that bad.)\nTurning out a lamp in a room apparently makes it night time with stars in the sky\nHas NOTHING to do with the title of the game\nExaggerated teaser video that paints the protagonist as the "reluctant heroine" when she's really a disobediant brat\nShort?  (See concluding details)\n\nIt‚Äôs free, it‚Äôs got nekkid girlz, it‚Äôs got achievements.   Depending on the reading speed, it‚Äôll take you between 25 minutes to 100 minutes to finish reading.  (100 for me as I‚Äôm a slow reader‚Ä¶who took snapshots and found inconsistencies)    Of course, most people here will cheat by skipping all dialogue in like 2 minutes to finish it.\n\n\nMoral of the story:  You can‚Äôt marry someone you just met‚Ä¶..unless it involves lesbian sex.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552877416\n\nI recommend this game simply because it's a rare sight for an appearance on Steam.  Check it out.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúI want to *#&@ you‚Äù / 10\n\nIn all seriousness, 6/10.  If the story was better (and if the main character wasn‚Äôt a b*tch), then the game would have a higher rating.","November 12, 2015","true","2.1"," 75 of 96 people (78%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","78","75","96","27","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altkiwi/recommended/416130/","altkiwi","altKiwi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altkiwi/","36 products in account","Written in the Sky is extremely short as far as visual novels go. The reader is given a look into three days of Azure's life as she goes through the daily drag of high school. It's made immediately clear that Azure, an 18(?) year old girl, dislikes school, but we're given a little insight into why - her father works long hours (present only to reprimand her for her behavior at school) and she longs for his approval or his attention. Her characterization ends there.\n\nAzure is a truant who was raised by a single father - a world-class detective - and one day, after being scolded by her father and sneaking out of her home, she happens across a mysterious and powerful alien ring. This ring puts her in the sights of the equally mysterious and powerful Sienna - a woman who claims to be from mars. Sienna's characterization ends there.\n\nThe reader is given no agency over the development of the story and the art is nothing to really talk about - the father himself isn't even given a character sprite, even despite being a major player as far as story/character development goes. The porn is mediocre at best. The story fails to make the reader want to care about any of the characters or events. It ends on a cliffhanger - or rather, a very vague hint at things to come. If this story is a prologue to something else then it falls short of making the reader care want more, aside from handwaving everything away as "terrible things happened because militants" which itself is never really explained.\n\nThere are many more questions raised than answered, which is frustrating considering it could have been developed in many different ways. It's a worthwhile read only if you have thirty minutes to burn and really want two achievements.","November 9, 2015","false","0.4"," 81 of 126 people (64%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","64","81","126","10","2"

It is also largely devoid of obvious editing for coherency and contains numerous abrupt leaps of tone, wild shifts in characterisation and several near complete breakdowns in logic.\n\nNote that as a classic visual novel there are no choices to be made. Written in the Sky is simply an exercise in reading the dialogue as it is fed to you one line at a tedious time. This is a story that, without the line-by-line delivery, would take literally around three minutes to read if printed as text and therefore barely qualifies as a short story.\n\nBackground images are repetitive (there are only three or four significant locations) and these add little if anything to the story. Character images have almost exactly as much variety as shown in the representative images on the main store page, which is to say, each has perhaps two almost indistinguishable expressions.\n\nWritten in the Sky also contains what might easily be one of the worst, most clinical and unnecessarily drawn out sex scenes ever written, with lines such as "The wet sound of our bodies against one another echoed throughout the room, drowned out only by our overlapping cries." The single sex scene itself takes up around 25% of the novel‚Äôs total content.\n\nFinally, if you come for the bewbs you will be sadly disappointed. There is only one scene with a single nipple, and it‚Äôs pretty tame at that. The writing for the sex scene, however, is extremely explicit with the word ‚Äòv@gina‚Äô at one stage appearing in every second or third line, but for all the heavy breathing and leaking body fluids Written in the Sky is just unsexy in its blandness.","December 30, 2015","false","1.1"," 73 of 122 people (60%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","60","73","122","14","2"

I'm also a big fan of visual novels with LGBT themes. And this one certainly has one of the most interesting yuri (lesbian) relationships that I've seen in a game in quite a while. Azure is your normal high school girl who's almost constantly bored with everything in her life. At least until she meets Sienna, who ends up being the Queen of Mars. Picking up the One Ring (seriously it looks just like it) she puts it on. She later finds out that this is a bonding ring that mates her with the alien and they fall in love.

Writing this review on the other hand will be a waste of time because some prude (or someone going all hurr durr lesbians double standard) is going to throw a fit over those two CGs with visible nipples.","November 9, 2015","true","0.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

I admit it, I read it only for the achievements and because I felt bored. It was entertaining but disappointing, but probably for different reasons for me than for most others.\n\nA minor ambiguous spoilers warning: I discuss portions of the novel but hopefully in an ambiguous light.\n\nStory time!\nNot a fan of the category itself, this is apparently what's called a Yuri novel - a story about women in love with each other (either romantic or sexual). Consequently, this is the visual novel infamous for its lesbian sex scene. Whatever. What about the novel itself?\n\nI can't say much about the graphical style. It looks good to me, pretty usual, and the music is pleasant but forgettable. It's a kinetic novel - no choices, just a linear story to follow.\n\nThe novel starts out as a high school story (IMHO boooring) but later turns into a science fiction story. The latter is frequently hinted at and that's how it got my interest: I crave scifi-fantasy literature so this winded up right in my alley. But I've given it thumbs down. Why?\n\nThe meat of the plot\nYou see, about 2/5 of the novel is about the high school and rebel thing that I find so dull. Sure, there's a mysterious detective dad who unfortunately ends up as a comedy relief. Then there's another 2/5 for the Yuri love and (if you turned the adult content on) sex stuff. Alright, that's what gets most people here. The scene isn't terribly graphic but the writing does get rather detailed and colourful. But it's only special since it's currently the only thing like that on Steam that's free (to my knowledge anyway).\n\nBut the last fifth or so is spent with the kind of awesome corny retro scifi theme I dig. The last part I found actually pretty interesting since I'm a huge nerd. Then it suddenly stops, just when it gets really interesting with the ominous space empire plot stuff.\n\nOver already?!?\nA read of 45 minutes, it's okay for a freebie but the sudden stop and a cliffhanger breaks it for me. Were this a first of a series it would be suitable as a demo and perhaps a thumbs up. Now, the scifi content is left mediocre and scarce - even underdeveloped. Perhaps I wasn't the target audience after all.","February 16","false","0.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","3"

This game is sexy as hell!\nTo be honest, it's not really much of a game, as you don't really do anything except click the mouse to make the story progress. It's more like just reading a story.\nBut the story is interesting and sexy.\nIn short, it's about a human girl who is said to be 18 (though that's a bit scetchy dawg) and an older Martian princess, who I guess is in her mid to late 20's. It's hard to tell with the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing anime characters.\nThe girl, Azure, finds some mystical ring that the princess is looking for before the Martian can, and puts it on. This sets up the story where now the two girls are set to be married from this act and Azure to become the King of Mars to stop a war with Mercury. This is where the best part is. The Martian princess wants to consumate the marriage and they ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. x3\nIt goes into a very descriptive sex scene with good still graphics. I'm talking a lesbian sex scene in a free game on Steam! And it shows ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•! The Martian girls' are big to! You can see them and watch the girls rub themselves together and suck on eachother's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. So great and gets me hard and wet!

They advance the quickest arranged marriage ever (for strengthening galactic politics) in order to excuse a single steamy sex scene, then the game very abruptly ends shortly after. There is then a moment of epilogue that is so vague it might as well have not been there. That's it.\n\nGraphicsDecent character artwork as seen in the Steam screenshots are about as conclusive as you'll get, with backgrounds of the few locations used along the same lines. Most notably, the main character looks considerably younger than the 18 years the novel insists that she is, which is quite disturbing giving the adult scene. The latter scene includes very suggestive, but not explicit artwork.\n\nMediaNothing special to report aside from standard BG music and the usual rolling credits. No voices, songs or cutscenes.\n\nAchievementsThe first achievement is for reaching the ending, and the second is for completing the epilogue that lasts at most a few minutes after the ending. A walk in the park.\n\nOverallFor once I might find myself obliged to agree with the various trolls in the review section and only recommend this game for its forced use of 18+ content. But since I don't feel this is a reasonable objective argument, the overall verdict remains a thumbs down. Even for a free game, there are much better alternatives out there.\n\nPros        Cons                Decent for a free game        Generally quite bad                Acceptable graphics and media        Extremely short                Barely coherent plot        Completely bland plot                Adult scene        ... with a disturbingly young character\nGameplay: N/A\nStory: 4/10\nGraphics: 6/10\nMedia: 4/10\n\nOverall: 4/10","November 26, 2015","false","0.5"," 44 of 79 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","44","79","2","0"

There is nothing original or charming. I was so zoned out with boredom that I didnt even realized I beat it. The music's trash, the backgrounds are garbage (other than the sky), and the plot is just...stupid.\nThe game starts off with OH SO ORIGINAL TOMBOY CHARACTER complaining about school. Boy, how original. Then it turns out her dad is hard on her. Revolutionary. Then an alien shows up, tomboy steals her ring, puts it on and apparently marries her because of it. Then they ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Then shes King of Mars and theres a flash forward, talking about how the alien wants her baby and its totally fine because aliens reproduce with fluids just like we do, and then theres a random ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• giant ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing green Gundam for lord knows what reason, and then the game just ends. It took me less than a minute to beat the game the first tme, as I was just holding down the CTRL key, and less than 20 minutes the second time. I went back to see if I missed anything in the options menus, and I didnt. The games just that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing short.\nThis game is well-known for having hentai on Steam, but its basic vanilla garbage. I literally couldnt have had a more vanilla experience than if i was eating vanilla ice-cream, wearing a Vanilla Ice T-Shirt, listening to Milli Vanilli, and playing the latest Vanillaware game alongside this one.\nThen again, two free achievements.\nHonestly, I say support it not because its good, because its not. Its a dreck. Its like a 3/10 at BEST. Support this game because it may, in the future, lead to better, actually quality hentai like Rance or Fate getting onto Steam, and then the future will have arrived.","November 17, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

She's bored with her life. There's nothing she enjoys doing. One day she finds an alien box with a ring inside. After that day, everything changes. For the next three days, she'll have a crazy life and have to make a crazy decision.\n\nWritten in the Sky is a VN that has no choices... well, one choice. The only "choice' you have to make is whether or not you turn on the 18+ content. This content will add a scene, and that one scene feels like it had the most work put into it. While the writing did feel generally good, the story didn't make much sense at times. There's also a couple locations where I spotted some spelling mistakes, such as "regieme" instead of "regime" and "kind" instead of "king".\n\nSince there's no neutral option on Steam, this one is a shaky recommend from me. The visuals are good (some people do look a lot younger than they are, though it still is a bit weird), but I do wish there was another track or two in the soundtrack.","November 10, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I would give her until 25 where she commits suicide due to depression and regret.\n\nAzure, as her parents named her when they were still playing World of Warcraft, decides to sneak out of the house one day to avoid being physically abused by her even more depressed father. As the delinquet she is, she gets lost and somehow makes her way into the wrong neighbourhood and decides to ask the wrong person to help her. The person she tries to ask help her, who by god is probably a pornography actor with that outfit of hers, runs away and Azure proceeds to pursue her where you think there could be other people around to ask but that's part of the trait of being a delinquet. Azure finds herself in a dark warehouse (probably a gang safehouse) and finds a peculiar box with a peculiar ring inside of it and then proceeds to steal it even though she calls herself a detective as she stalked the poor pornography actor. The unknown actor now witnesses the birth of a female pimp as the ring lights up signaling the birth of an abomination and then becomes attracted to said abomination. With such a beautiful ring, Azure indulges herelf in fantasies of being married and somehow makes her way back home only to find that it is time to go to school.\n\nCome first class the pornography actor, who is literally leaving a trail of water, stalks Azure in the shadows conducting indecent actions furiously. Azure who is unaware of this decides to skip class to gain some sleep, even though knowing that her father would once again be furious and probably commit a sin, then proceeds to sleep in a empty classroom. Several hours pass as she wakes up. The actor who can no longer hold her anxiety reveals herself to the girl (whos name is Sienna and a Martian whos parent are also a lot more normal than Azure's parents) to hastily speed up the marriage process as that is what the ring is in "humanese."  The actor asks for her finger, to obviously commit crimes to herself with, but Azure mistook it for "Can I chop off your ring finger and use it as my own ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•?" and hastily runs for home.\n\nAzure reaches her home and finds her father's consciencness swapped with her pet gold fish in retaliation by the now heartbroken grade "A" stalker, Sienna. Sienna, calm and collectively begins her long and boring story of how she was part of a mafia, how she is the next heir, blah blah blah. Azure who can no longer escape this predicament ask Sienna to give her time to think about this.\n\nNext day at school, young Azure begins to have indecent thoughts and fills the entire school with an unknown fluid to the brim as she becomes excited with her discovery in her sexual orientation. She hastily runs back home and gives her final answer of being her godfather in her mafia. With both mutual loves confirmed they slowly and passionately share a drink of champagne, puke all over the house, purchase some guns, and defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.\n\nA few years later, Earth is caught between a war with Mars and Mercury fighting in Gundams.\n________________________________________________________________\n\n*TL;DR*: If you have a fetish for lesbian inter-planetary love then you may like this. Roughly more than 30 minutes.","November 21, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","1","1","3","0"

The character designs are good with there only being 2 designs in the game and the artwork is good. The story is alright with it mainly revolving around the two main characters and ending up in a hentai scene and that's it and they rule mars after it.\n\nIts really obvious why a lot of people downloaded this game and i wont judge cause i own it and its probably to see how the 1st hentai steam game is.\n\nI would recommend this game to the curious type of people only due to one being the 1st hentai game and its free so it should be a easy to pick up "game".\n\nAlso side note the main point everyone wants a opinion of the adult scene was relatively simple and a typical adult scene.....The reason i know this is.....classified..yea classified.","November 26, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

The plot (there actually is one) is handled alright, with bored little Azure finding herself the unwitting recipient of a powerful ring that has consequences not just for her own life, but for all the lives on another planet. The writing is pretty decent for a change, although it's obvious that autocorrection was used instead of a human proofreader (for example, "kind" is used instead of "king"). Character art is nice looking but pretty sparse, and you'll find yourself staring at empty backgrounds for long periods of time. In fact, I actually came on the discussion group to see if there was a problem with the display of foreground art (as in the "Heileen" series).\n\nThings progress fairly well (although there are zero choices to be made in "Written in the Sky"), until the whole thing comes screeching to a halt with a bizarre and unecessary lesbian scene (featuring a minor...oh, joy). Not only is it uncomfortable to watch, the scene actually takes away from what little charm the game would have had without it. It also has as much descriptive language as the rest of the preceding game and, even if you treat your mouse like you're playing "Clicker Heroes" it still goes on far too long.\n\nFortunately, the plot picks up again after, building to the promise of an epic finale - and cue end credits. Wha....?\n*shrugs*\n\nOnce again I find myself wishing Steam had a "Meh" rating button.  "Written in the Sky" is what it is, I guess. It could have been pretty decent, though, which is such a shame. At any rate, it's free, and it gives you a quick two achievements (for which, you do absolutely nothing), and a "perfect" game completion.

Be warned, I considered the adult portion of the game to be mild and tame, but some may disagree.\n\nThe love story itself, I liked the idea even though it did feel a bit rushed.\n\nThe game does have an even more brief epilogue that hints that this may be part of a greater story. Possibly a teaser to a future game to be released by this developer.\n\nOverall, if you like VNs, if you aren't squeamish about adult themes or lesbian relationships, and if you like sci-fi themed humor, this free game is worth a short play through.\n\nOnly drawback for me was.... I felt bad for Azure's father.\n","December 11, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Azure, as the King of Mars, discovers being King is not easy.\n\nLittle else can be said, other then the fact I actually did not turn it off after the first five minutes or after I figured out it was yuri.

The backstory refers to a conflict between two planets, one that can only be ended by the union of two houses. However, the breakdown of this relation, a obvious reference to the weak rule of Henry VI and the ambiguity that agnatic primogeniture created, reignites conflict.  The two sides provide a decisive parallel to the Lancastrian and Yorkist houses, over the true claim to kingship. It is only by the protagonist's marriage, the main plot elements, that this conflict has any hope of ending, a analogue to the kingship of Henry VII.

However Azure feels frustrated, she feels school is a waste of time so skiping school becomes her defining characteristic. Afterwards Azure pursues her pashions of absolutely nothing. She has no hobbies, ambitions, or girlfriends. So most people playing this game will deeply relate to Azure.\n\nSienna's plight however is the true crux of the story, and saddly one I may fear my never have a happy ending. You see this young seemingly completely normal spandex wearing girl is hiding an insidous secret. Thats right, shes the queen of the Martian people tasked with ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing whoever wears the ring of her people, but if she fails... Lesbian space queens help us all... If Sienna fails the Mercury aliens will attack making their friendship truce all but meaningless. I'm glad you can appreciate the gravity of this situation, not many can handle playing through such a sobering experience while coming out unperturbed.\n\nAnd who can forget one of the most invigorating background characters to date, Azure's father. Take a mother ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•en step back Boba Fett. Azure's father isn't one of those boring normal fathers, hes a detective. Responsible for teaching Azure all of her detective tricks that she uses to detect numerous investigations. Now it would be brazen of me to go any further into Azure's father significance to the plot, but I can promise it will as satisfying as any lesbian space sex.\n\nHuh, oh yeah they screw for a bit, plus there is a nipple.\n\nAnd there you have it, a tantalizing tease into the groundbreaking Visual Novel "Written in the Sky" Really thats all there is to say since it ends there, but- Oh, you ravenous aficionado of romance~ Do you truly wish to know what happens next? Well I forbidden it. Absolutely not. Ahhh okay you've convinced me you inquisitive neerdowell, however! You must swear to your waifu that you will not read on until you've finished Written in the sky (I'll know because I'll look at your steam achievements, DON'T MAKE ME!)\n\nAlright... Read on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNiiiiiice Azure gets a Gundam. Ahhhhhhh thats so cool, I wish I had a Gundam.

(Totally sure no one to this day had clicked on the off option tho) Like that, Its completely legal to have it. It's simple, but it works.\n\nThe fact that the story involve 2 girls having sexual relationship (and one being really young) its also good, it shows valve its not closed minded about this polemic topics.

Not much else to say other then clicking through all this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• just to get a perfect game doesn't seem really worth it.\n\nThe good well it's pretty and no I'm not talking about the sex scene... the art is overall pleasing to look at and so is the interface, text etc. For a visual novel it seems to have nice writing but to be fair I only read like 3-4 lines more like skimmed through 3-4 lines and that was when some epic space stuff popped up with gundam looking pilots or some ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• like that. The game doesn't have much options BUT it is only a visual novel so it's decent, windowed and fullscreen is there with a bunch of text speed options etc.\n\nNow the bad to be honest there's really nothing bad to say other than perhaps the fact it's luring people in with a sex scene... that and I think if you don't like visual novels at all like me it'll be bad and this won't be the game to change your mind.\n\nIt's a good free visual novel by the looks of it, it's also odd and charming but really I was only in if for the perfect game. Even though this felt like a waste of 7 minutes I'll still recommend it just because I got a free prefect game out of it!","December 21, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not sure who marked it as "action" or "adventure", but it's just wrong. All you do in this "game" is you read a story without interacting with it. Texts are accompanied by fullscreen images (anime/later almost hentai if you've enabled 18+ content), but that's it.\n\nAs the game is pretty much just a slideshow, it's not something I enjoy, so for likeminded people I wouldn't recommend it. If you're into visual novels though, give it a shot and see for yourself. It's not horrible, just don't expect Tolkien or you'll be dissapointed.\n\nI've marked "No" because of few reasons:\n- bad tags (adventure, action and not a hint it's a visual novel)\n- it's not really a game\n- visual novels are not something I enjoy\n- kinda shallow story comparable to porn movies :/","November 10, 2015","false","1.6"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","0"

Quite frankly, I dont know what to feel about what it did have to offer.\n\nThe art is okay, the music is okay, the writing is okay (but very ??? at many times - I cant even put it to words).

The main story follows Azure and the person she meets who is found out to be an alien. After Azure taking a ring she basically has to marry this alien they have a awkward scene *Ahem a sex scene as the term is called* And they go to mars to become king and queen the end. This really isn't that great and unless you've got time to kill i really don't suggest playing this.\n\nNow for my thoughts on the visuals: Not that great it overall was okay tho i didn't find myself liking them. The characters didn't have that many emotions in terms of visuals so it really was boring to look at as well.\n\nThis isn't that great of a visual novel so i don't suggest reading it unless you want to kill some time.","November 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

This piece of modern art isn't like those other piece of carp vns that can't be played in one memory lapse. The plot revolves around a human girl, although I would prefer salmon else for protagonist, raised by a fish dad as she learns with the help of a mysterious alien that anyfinn is possible (as long as you leave this fish-bigoted planet for a more tolerant one, with water ofc). I think they really should have scaled up my goldfish dad character a bit but nevertheless oh my cod I love this game. I would gladly trout my friends to this wonderful game, as there is no way to be shellfish as it's free for everyone. I know this product has caused some controversy because no ofishal Steam vn has attempted to keep us in mind as their target audience (and give us a chance to experience getting ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed in the bass by a martian queen, it is a bit of a gill-ty pleasure game for me personally).

The characters are more or less interesting, okay visuals, I'd say it was worth my time, i only wish the story was a bit longer than a hour long worh of gameplay, but that's fine.\n\nWritten in the Sky receives a 9/10 rating from me.\n\nI recommend picking it up as it after all is a F2P (Free-to-play) title.","April 7","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The main character is 'barely legal' but she SEEMS LIKE A ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING TWELVE YEARS OLD GIRL, HAVING SEX, ITS SO ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING NAUGHTY, GOD.\n\nAlso, it was awfully short, no alternatives routes. you don't even need to read it, you only need to repeatedly do M1 in order to get all the achievements (who are senseless, by the way) and done, no choices, no different endings\n\nThen, the Story of the game, its quite regular, a regular girl with a regular life, but then, everything changed when  The Fire Nation attacked, I mean, when she founds a ring, a magical rings which bonds her to the Alien Queen of Mars. Then, she reconsiders getting married with her, they get married, have a single sex scene with only a pic, then, they move to Mars, they show a MECHA suit in order to defend the 'Kingdom of Mars' and then, the game ends.\n\nI know that free games usually don't have a good story, but, this Story was just so lame, so vague that I rather thumb it down.\n\nTL,DR: Don't play it unless you like yuri alien CP wacky games.\n\n\n\n","November 27, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are no choices. No mutliple endings. Just reading. And except for the one sex sence its written on a 5th grade level. Its not bad. its way to short. Its like something, minus the sex sence, you might read to your child as a bed time story over 2 or three nights if you don't mind a lesbian relationship.\n\nThe art work is very simple. There are maybe 7 or 8 places the story goes back and forth to and from.  There are 4 charactors, if you don't include the gold fish, but you only get to see two of them.\n\nTaking into mind the length of the story, 30-45 min., and the fact that the story is open ended this is more like a demo or chapter one. I am very glad it was free.\n\nI did enjoy it. I just wish more had been put into it and that it was longer. Two things I found odd.  1) Is that  on the Steam Game Page it tells you that the ring was stolen by the FBI during an intergalactic peace conference. Why wasn't this in the story?  Are parts missing? 2) At the end it say "Thank You For Playing". What did I play? All I did was read and hit the little star to forward the story. What play?\n\nBut since its free I recommend it.

Well alrighty then, let's give it a go.\n\n*an hour later*\n\nI want my hour back!!!\n\nStory/Character Development: Story is generic and cliched. And development is thin to non-existant. There is little to no story for this game. Who is Azure? Who is Sienna? What are they like? Why should I care?!\nMusic: Bland, bargain bin and repetitive. There are only 3 tracks that I can think of in this game: Normal, Serious, and Making Whoopie.\nArt: Sub-par. Better than most, but still pretty generic.\nThe yuri: UNINTERESTING! How can you feel anything remotely between the two if there is absolutely NO development between them!\n\nOh and also... it's a KINETIC novel, not a VISUAL novel! Get it right!!\n\nOverall, It's a 0/5.\nIf you are looking for a game for a comedic and possibly sweet romance with some yuri, what you expect from the description, LOOK ELSEWHERE!\nIf you are looking for a baseless excuse to just see yuri and not care about anything but that yuri action, FINE!

It was rather just walking through the dialouge and so. I did like the sceneries, very well drawn and fitted the needed setting, but they were also limited to where some were a bit overused. Characters had a funny blending; the main character absolutely did not look like her age given in the story.\n\nStory wasn't very good either and its one scene containing nudity unessary and also didn't make it any better as it was.

There are no choices. No mutliple endings. Just reading. And except for the one sex sence its written on a 5th grade level. Its not bad. its way to short.

There are maybe 7 or 8 places the story goes back and forth to and from.  There are 4 charactors, if you don't include the gold fish, but you only get to see two of them.\n\nTaking into mind the length of the story, 30-45 min., and the fact that the story is open ended this is more like a demo or chapter one. I am very glad it was free.\n\nI did enjoy it. I just wish more had been put into it and that it was longer. Two things I found odd.  1) Is that  on the Steam Game Page it tells you that the ring was stolen by the FBI during an intergalactic peace conference. Why wasn't this in the story?  Are parts missing? 2) At the end it say "Thank You For Playing". What did I play? All I did was read and hit the little star to forward the story. What play?\n\nBut since its free I recommend it.

There are no major choices (where there could be some) and it's all very straightforward.\nHowever, being this short removes any time for decent character development or any real plot. The nudity in it is, despite being 18+ (and having a sex scene), is not super heavy. There's boobs and that's about it, so this isn't a hentai game. If you were looking for one, A: you aren't gonna find one on steam, and B: sicko.\nThis would be a lot better if it were longer and given choices. Both characters have some merit to them, and i'd love to see it expanded upon.\nThere are better free dating simulator/visual novels out there on steam (See: Seduce Me the Otome) but if it's late at night, you don't want to think, and you just want a quick yuri romp to read through then go download this. It's free.","November 12, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was horribly drawn and the dialogue was even worse. I actually wish I had chosen the option of no sex. I was most annoyed at how ammature it was. Poor choice in words, random/weird vulgar words thrown in there occationally, and overall it was a cliche weeaboo hentai scene. I don't recomend playing this for the sex.\n\nOther than that awful scene, I loved it! This is a really short visual novel with no choices but I really enjoyed it, which has never happened because I really hate just reading a game. There is some stupid humor but it made me laugh a lot.

There are no choices. No mutliple endings. Just reading. And except for the one sex sence its written on a 5th grade level. Its not bad. its way to short. Its like something, minus the sex sence, you might read to your child as a bed time story over 2 or three nights if you don't mind a lesbian relationship.\n\nThe art work is very simple. There are maybe 7 or 8 places the story goes back and forth to and from.  There are 4 charactors, if you don't include the gold fish, but you only get to see two of them.\n\nTaking into mind the length of the story, 30-45 min., and the fact that the story is open ended this is more like a demo or chapter one. I am very glad it was free.\n\nI did enjoy it. I just wish more had been put into it and that it was longer. Two things I found odd.  1) Is that  on the Steam Game Page it tells you that the ring was stolen by the FBI during an intergalactic peace conference. Why wasn't this in the story?  Are parts missing? 2) At the end it say "Thank You For Playing". What did I play? All I did was read and hit the little star to forward the story. What play?\n\nBut since its free I recommend it.

I kept watching and started liking her more and more. The story keeps on going in it's own and pleasing pace. We then get to the "adult scene" which is at first a turn-on, but later leads to more of a "WTF" moment. I personally had no problem with it and would have no problem watching it again, though I think the creators took it a little too far and I feel a lot of people will feel pretty uncomfortable watching it. The ending is...meh. You don't get the real excitment for a sequel, though I would definently watch it.\n\nOverall, Written in the Sky is a good novel for people that does not like long and boring, unoriginal stories and scenes. I would recommend checking it out for sure, one reason is that it's free so why not.\n\nI would give this novel a 8/10. The reason being a pretty boring ending and a little too much sex.\n\nPS.

It was horribly drawn and the dialogue was even worse. I actually wish I had chosen the option of no sex. I was most annoyed at how ammature it was. Poor choice in words, random/weird vulgar words thrown in there occationally, and overall it was a cliche weeaboo hentai scene. I don't recomend playing this for the sex.\n\nOther than that awful scene, I loved it! This is a really short visual novel with no choices but I really enjoyed it, which has never happened because I really hate just reading a game. There is some stupid humor but it made me laugh a lot. The story is also something you wouldn't expect unless you read the description beforehand.\n\n10/10 Great game! ^_^","November 25, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kittell22/recommended/416130/","Kittell22","Instinct22","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kittell22/","73 products in account","Let's start this review by saying this is 100% serious. I've seen many, many review saying just skip to the sex scene (It will spoken of in this review) and I feel the need to offer a review from a vetern of both VNs and yuri. Let's begin.\n\nStoryObviously, the most important part of a visual novel.\nThe story in this one is, quite frankly, not the worst nor the best. It offers a somewhat original Idea, and the writing itself is rather good. There's a typo here and there, but for the most part, it's competently written. (Spoiler section will be at the end of this review) All-in-all, the story isn't anything to shout from the rooftops about, but it's enough to keep you going.\n5/10\n\n[h1[Characters[/h1]\nAzure-Good god is she boring. I've honestly seen more personality from a plank. She has absolutely no character, though I suppose that's what the author intended. Still, I found myself kind of not caring at ALL about her through the whole game. For example, Azure's only personality trait is that she seems to hate school and reguarly ditches class early and often contemplates not going at all.\n\nSienna-I can honestly say Sienna is what kept me going. After she appeared, I found myself alot more interested. She actually gave me a chuckle and one point. She has alot more personality then azure, I mean ALOT more. I honestly say play it just for Sienna.\n\nAzure's father-A minor character, with more personality then Azure. Quite frankly, they missed alot of oppertunities with him. He get's angry at azure for skipping school and he's a detective. This could have easily been longer had they exploired a few plot points with this guy.\n\nAs far as characters go, I was not impressed. The lead is boring and sienna doesn't appear till halfway through this rather short Visual Novel (Look at my play time.)\n\nCharacters 4/10\n\nArtThe other most important factor in a visual novel. The art in this one is rather typical, yet, I couldn't help but notice the detail they put into some images, and the complete lack of in others. CG involving characters is well done, but most everything falls pitifully short. As an example, during the sex scene, the images are so detailed to the point whre shadows from blinds are clearly visible. This shows alot of care put into these 2 scenes. To contrast, background images look rather shallow and generic. I swear, i've seen some of those backgrounds in other visual novels.\nArt is something that is just as important as story in a visual novel. (Hence the Visual aspect) and this one is so all over the place between backgrounds and the rather good CG images, to the point where I find it hard to give it a solid score.\n4-5/10\n\nMusicI admit, the music is easily the best part of this game. Almost all of the tracks are soothing and fit well within the context of the game. Sienna and the music are the only 2 truly reddeming qualities about this game.\n\nYuriI admit, i'm sort of a snob when it comes to my yuri, so expect this to be very critical.\nThe yuri in this is very...forced. In order for yuri to achieve it's full emotional effect, you have to be invested in the characters BEFORE they officially fall in love. You need to care about these two people for it to matter. I found no reason to like this couple because Azure is so boring I simply didn't care and Sienna didn't get enough time to really develop as a character all that much. Though I like Sienna, I still couldn't care about their relationship because I didn't get the time to know Sienna and Azure was to boring for me to care.\nIn terms of the quality of the yuri 2/10\nin terms of quantity of yuri 9/10\n\nSex SceneI feel like this is what everyone was waiting for, but expect to be critical about this as well.\nThe writing for this is ,surprisingly, very good. But it's a little TOO good. What do I mean by this? The writing for this scene is descriptive, uses words no one really thinks of, and does it's job well. The issue is that the writing doesn't match up with the rest of the game. The rest of isn't very descriptive and uses plain words. It perplexes me how different the writing is between the story and this sex scene. Quite frankly, it's painfully obvious what they put all their time and effort into.\n7/10\n\nSpoiler section!So the story starts with our main character, Azure, in class being bored. She leves class early, goes home, and gets scolded by her father. In order to advance the plot, she sneaks out on a school night and just sorta walks. She gets lost and comes across a box with a ring in it. She puts on the ring and gets home right when she has to leave for school. She finds an empty classroom and takes a nap. Whens he wakes up, we get the first appearence of the only character with any personality, Sienna. Sienna is the current queen of mars and because Azure put the ring on, she is engaged to Sienna. Sienna gives her the option to go with her to Mars, or stay on Earth. Azure mopes about the next day thinking about Sienna's offer. She, of course, accepts. Sex scene happens. Then they leave to Mars and it just ends. After the credits you get a screen with more good CG involving the two mains (SFW). The speak of a story that sounds alot more interesting then this and it ends for real.\n\n\nSo, what do I think of this overall? Quite frankly, this is one of the worse examples of how to do Yuri. If you're new to the genre, this is not what most if it is. This was an excuse to put something with sex in it undert the guise of a game. I'm all for promoting games like these, don't get me wrong. But they need to be done BETTER. A better story, better characters, better art. All of their time went into developing a sex scene and not much else. If you follow Yuri as much as I do, you'll know that Kindred Spirits on the Rooftop is eventually coming to Steam in an uncensored version. I can't wait for that day, as I know that it will be done RIGHT and will promote Yuri in a somewhat good way.\n\nFinal Score:5/10In closing, it's free, won't take up much of your time. I worry this game will make valve think twice about alowing 18+ games on steam. It far from a good example, though I have seen much worse before. They did not quite know who they were trying to target with this, but then again, I don't think they cared. it's free.","November 17, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do have mixed feelings about the direction the epilogue takes (I'm no fan of the implied "relationship and life in jeopardy" situation, since it just seems mean-spirited considering what was taking place prior), but otherwise, it's a nice little time-eater for those who don't mind yuri stuff.  I hope there's a sequel that sees the couple return in a much calmer Martian environment so we can focus on more cuteness!","November 17, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visual novel later redeemed it's self with a scene between a alien and a human, so overall a great visual novel.

I myself am not a big fan of yaoi or yuri but this was really good, I played the censored version and loved it. The only reason I am not recommending it is because it is too short, I only had 50 minutes on it and that is because I left my computer on the game for about 20 of that.  I wish it had more choices and I wish it were longer but it wasnt, I can only rate it 5/10 though if they made it longer or updated it I would definetly raise it up quite a bit. I also loved the sort of sci-fi twist to it, since I am a big fan of sci-fi and supernatural games.","November 13, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With those two scenes the only thing left is the dialogue present, and you have to use your imagination on it, since the actual scene doesn't change and you have to imagine the way they are doing it.\nYou can save your time and visit this link instead (NSFW): https://www.fakku.net/tags/yuri\n\nThe story, as I said, has potential, but it would need more time and writing to make it shine: A girl with a somewhat messed up life that hates school, has an encounter with an alien with the mission of saving her people; However, its all writen to make both girls to engage in love with each other, and quite fast, pretty much in a "average hentai doujin" way.\n\nI can understand that writing a VN is not easy (since I'm on my way to make one), but this is not how you publish a short VN on Steam, it's not enjoyable, neither bad, but it left me with the desire to see more, an expanded storyline, but i insist, i know that the purpose of this all the way was to be a short VN, but its not satisfying; A good example of a short VN done is Without Within, you should check it out.","November 11, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
