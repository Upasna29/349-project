Some story elements and puzzles makes absolutely no sense (Part of your clock ending up I think in a police officer's safe??), and the way characters move is a little rigid - though the developers took their time to animate whole body-scale moving of lots of (!) characters, this is quite a minor flaw.\n\nStrong aspects of the game:\nThere is a story with lots of small details in it and lots ( and I do mean lots) of dialogue with actually quite deep characters.\nReally nice, albeit short soundtracks which are pleasant to listen to even after half an hour.\nSome puzzles are extraordinary. Lots of the puzzles' design is original, but there are some in the bonus chapter that actually challenging, and I'm really happy about it.\nNice graphics and quality hidden object scenes\nReally intresting Interview with the Developers in Extras :) Check it out! (Sadly only with subtitles)\nAnd lastly: a game that is a little darker than the usual. Sorry, but I'm a little fed up with HOGs where there is such a happy ending that even the murderous ghosts end up happy and content. (Khm, Nightmares from the Deep 1,3) I wanted a game similar to The Dorian Gray Syndrome, and this really brings the same atmosphere :)Weak aspects of the game:\nRelatively low number of Hidden Object Scenes, if you're liking them, you'll definitely feel this as a negative.\nStrange logic of item placement, even compared to other hidden object games - it's especially easy to notice as the story heavily leans on logic.\nA little short? I've ~ 10 hours in the game (at least 1 hour afk) and this is 2 full gameplay without skipping dialoguesPricewise: I've got this game in a 3-game bundle for 2$ maybe, for that price it was really worth it.  I would say it's a good purchase if you can get it for 1-5 $/€ - the lower, the better  for you :)","March 16, 2015","true","11.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

How am I supposed to enjoy the story if the gameplay doesn't make any sense. Everything is just so random... I mean, there is a secret compartment in someone's house containing a puzzle piece that fits in a puzzle in MY house and when I open it I'll find a door handle or something, because that was worth hiding, right? Why the hell is a cuckoo from my grandfather clock hidden on the police station?\nYou're supposed to be an investigator but everything is so devoid of logic that there is no "investigating" at all, you're just running around collecting random stuff (mostly keys, handles and puzzle pieces). Also because everything is scattered without any logic you either have to write down the location of every puzzle or you have to rely on the hint system constantly.\nThe thing is I KNOW that it's possible to make a game in this genre that makes at least some sense, you just have to put some effort in it.\n\nThe graphics and animations are fine, but the story is really stupid and the characters are either annoying or boring. There is a cutscene where some character starts to explain, well, everything and it takes like 10 minutes... it's so boring that even the main hero falls asleep!","June 20, 2015","false","5.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

I most certainly liked it. The terror factor is lighter compared to the first game, yet the elegance of Victorian Gothic is present and well grasped. It serves as an adventure game rather than a HOG however, which makes the game memorable compared to others of the genre. If you've played the first game, this prequel is meaningful.

Deadly. It lacks everything. HOGs are rarely logical but this one wins the absurdity trophy: the story is totaly silly, clues are hidden in everybody's homes and the characters rarely make any sens and constantly act stupid. The graphics are very dark and dull; and when they're not dark they lack contrast. So it's hard to distinguish anything and it makes everything ugly.  It also makes the HOG scenes a torture. The general darkness do get a bit better in the second half of the game but comes back in the bonus chapter.\n\nThe animations are horrible, the characters are stiff as wood logs and glide everywhere.The voice overs are quite good but the story and the characters are so silly and boring that you'll fall asleep; there's far too much dialogue. Yes, I did fell asleep during the ending dialogue that lasts 5 long minutes! The music is re used from the Women's Murder Club games (those are good, get them) and clearly doesn't fit this setting and only enhances the general dullness. The mini-games are fine but easy.\n\nI didn't like it at all, it's boring and dull. There's plenty of better HOGs out there, so I cannot recommend this game, even on sale, and even though it's a good cure for insomnia.\nAvoid at all cost.","August 23, 2015","false","4.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Just don’t expect much logic in level progression, because there is none.\n\nLong version:The Lonely Hearts Murders is sort of a prequel to Dorian Gray Syndrome, set in London around the turn of the 20th century. It is more of a classic detective story than a psychological thriller. You play as a middle-aged father who, with the help of the police, is trying to save his daughter from the clutches of a serial murderer who “helps” heartbroken young people by killing them.\nIt isn’t really original, but which murder mystery really is? What is important that excellent actors play well-written characters, and there is more dialogue than in any other hidden object game ever made.\n\nIf not for the gameplay, this one could have been a perfect one. But unlike Dorian Gray Syndrome, the progression here isn’t really logical, quite the opposite. Items are always found in the most ridiculous and illogical places, and there are barely enough scenes to really classify it as a hidden object title.\nStill… if you want a great story for a casual game, get it. I cannot express in words how much it will be worth it.","July 31, 2015","true","4.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

While I enjoyed it better than the first installment I also can't pin point what exactly I liked about it. It's a classic hidden item game, nothing about it breaks any molds. You play Owen who is looking for his kidnapped daughter Olivia. It's fully voiced, beautiful artwork, good mini games and hidden item scenes and the story is decent...so I don't know why I feel meh about it.\n\nThe story is what I'll touch on first. I liked it, I liked the mystery element and the hunt for a killer. What I didn't like was waiting until the very end to know who did it. There were no clues or build up to the identity, the cops didn't figure out jack and I wasn't given enough info to try to figure it out on my own. Instead, the whole game is spent wandering about and doing puzzles oddly placed in people's homes while Owen shouts and acts melodramatic.\n\nThis isn't a huge issue but it really annoyed me, however, the general story itself was alright so I continued playing until the story played out. The mini games and hidden item scenes offered nice challenges and I was able to skip any that I wasn't in the mood to play since there are no achievements attached to this title to worry about. Gameplay was fine, except for the map. The map doesn't do much, you can't even use it to move around quicker. Instead be ready to back track a lot constantly.\n\nThe game slightly connects to first game, it's set before Brink of Consciousness: Dorian Gray Syndrome and one of the characters in this game is related to Oscar, the main antagonist in the first installment. Not going to say who, though it seems a bit tacked on as an after thought. You don't need to play one to play the other. Story is alright, the gameplay is enjoyable and the artwork is nice on the eyes. While not a favorite hidden item game of mine, I do recommend giving it a shot.\n\nThis review is exclusively written for Y.A - Yolo Army, follow the group's curations here!","September 22, 2015","true","5.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The graphics and story are just a lot more involved and in depth. I really enjoyed listening to the developers explain some of the story lines in the game. Also the puzzles for the most part were a lot better done in this game then the other 2 in the series. If your a fan of HOG then you should love this game.

It has a dark feel to it, that never really lets up. For the most part the HOGs are not clever just well hidden. No tricks but nothing slick either. I hate it when an HOG hides 3/4 of the object and then your have to guess at it. The Brink games  are not like that at all. And minimal language complications although watch out for the trumpet really being a french horn (so common in HOGs). I would rate this game a tad lower than the Dorian Grey game. However, where Dorian gets a 10 this game gets an 8.5. The story and atomspher are top notch for an HOG, The acting is passable but falls way short of the first game. I think for me the thing that makes Lonely Hearts a good game and not a great game is that there is too much going back and forth to the scenes and it almost . . . almost got to be tedius. Still, I like this game and look forward to any more games in the Brink of Consciousness series.","May 16","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It moved forward at a good pace, had several interesting characters, and they bothered to explain most of what was going on.\n\nIt was the puzzles that kind of had me disappointed. There was some really random stuff going on. Like why were so many pieces of deeply personal belongings hiddein behind painting in someone else's house? Why does my main character just randomly break into his friend's safe? It also turned into a goose chase where you'd only have one item in your inventory.

And I can be very forgiving about things - too many HOS and not enough puzzles (or vice versa), puzzles which are so easy they're boring or so hard they inspire rage-quitting, lame live-action actors or bad voice acting, even graphics which are pedestrian. But this is far and away the most frustrating and irritating HOS adventure I've ever played. There are just WAY too many cut scenes, and those cut scenes go on FOREVER. At one point I got up when a cut scene had started, and spent a few minutes getting my nephew a cup of juice, only to find that when I saw back down the scene was still going. And it KEPT going, for at least another five minutes.\n\nAnd the ending of both the main and the bonus chapters, is entirely cut scene, with no significant player involvement at all. I wouldn't be surprised if there genuinely more cut-scene time than playing time in this game (but I didn't do the math, and I damned sure am not replaying to find out. And nothing about the game play itself, the graphics, the characters, or the strange storyline, made up for insanely long over-abundance of cut scenes.\n\nLike I said, I'm a forgiving reviewer most of the time, but this is easily the worst HOS adventure I've ever played, and nothing redeemed it's shortcomings.","December 26, 2015","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was alright, but just seemed to drag even though the game is rather short. I agree with how others mentioned that the placement of objects is very random and does not seem to follow any logic. Also There is just too much running around with just an item for my taste.\n\nVisually, the novel is not bad, but I have played ones that I think look much nicer. The voice acting is a nice touch though and I do really like the soundtrack.\n\nI think if you enjoy the plot, this could be a fun game for you.\n\nOverall the game is not bad and fun if you enjoy the genre, but I have certainly played better. I say, if you can get it on sale, go for it.","May 6","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The detective did not do much in the story, and no weapons which was strange, and in this day and age would need the weapons. Some puzzles or objects did not make sense, the characters could of been more devoloped the picture of the girl should be replaced as you only meet her in the end a average  game buy it on special not worth the full price. I have started the bonus chapter which has you as the detective.","September 4, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game breaking bug 0/10.\n\nEDIT: For some reason I was pulled back to complete this game. I experienced another bug, where it would not save at the end (meaning I had to complete the entire extra bonus level in one sitting). There is a fun HOBO game here, albeit with stodgy acting, but the bugs prevent me from being able to recommend it. 5/10","April 13","false","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
