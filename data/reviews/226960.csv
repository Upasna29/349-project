Unfortunately this feature is only seen in the first half dozen cards before never being seen again.\n\nThe game also featured several factions with different tactics and units that you can mix and match. Unfortunately again, all the factions with the exception of the army (Union and Confederate's are both considered the same, begging the question as to why it is set in the Civil War) have barely enough cards for a playable deck, much less one that you can base a unique strategy out of. This is further made worse by every faction's units being essentially the same thing (Army riflemen and bandits have absolutely no distinguising characteristics between them).\n\nEven worse, the potential dynamic was there, in the form of unattainable weapons and units the computer gets during the campaign. After completing the game, and every last achievement (both single player and multiplayer) I was upset that the only things I receieved were more of the same cards. Indeed, the final boss's deck is displayed as an available playable faction, but does not have a single unit or weapon card in it.\n\nThe story serves it's purpose I suppose, so it is hardly disappointing, but it is somewhat baffling that early in the story you can clearly see a sibling rivalry, only for one of the brothers to disapear, and only come back at the end of the game to do absolutely nothing, unlike the collection of minor characters who assemble for the purpose of serving as an Deus Ex Machina during a mission. Whoever is actually manning and directing your ironclads is never mentioned (unless it is assumed that the sergeant who gets a brief mention early in the game is the PC). The Civil war is barely mentioned, and the game might as well be set during the Anglo-Russian war for all it matters.\n\nThe campaign itself is not so much challenging as it is putting you in a situation with an outright disadvantage. In the early stages this disadvantage is negated by unlocking a new weapon. However, due to the fact that there are no decent unlocks in the later missions the game simply becomes a matter of chance. Hoping that the luck of the draw gets you exactly the unit you need, and that the computer does not use the obnoxiously overpowered ability that he is granted this mission on the turn it would hurt the most. The last mission in particular is guilty in that the enemy boss is not only invincible (unless you kill two heavily armoured units guarding an electric outlet, and procede to occupy both outlets with infantry that can be killed instantly by said boss) but possessing a repetoire of weapons far superior to what you can get, and heals completely should you fail to stop him from going to your side. The strategy towards defeating him involves praying to your chosen deity that the enemy AI will decide to lay waste to your ironclads, rather then stepping on your infantry, and will stand still for that brief moment where you miraculously achieve enough firepower to destroy him in one turn. God help you if you decide to go for the achievements.\n\nAll that said, the game has potential. If it simply had more content and diverse factions that would allow for actual tactical options.","December 11, 2013","false","10.6"," 209 of 273 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","209","273","3","7"

I like it a lot. The setting is good and the gameplay is fun. It's a lot like Monster Monopiece, which I loved, but without the embarrising rub mechanics. Which is good.\n\nSo why don't I recommend it? Simply put, the single player campaign is cheap. Really, really cheap. After the first few missions you're almost always started off at a huge disadvantage.\n\nThe enemy has powerful cards that you don't have access to yet. The enemy starts with more AP than you. The enemy can field four ironclads at a time. The enemy has squares that provide and advantage much closer to their side. The enemy has a deck tailored exactly to take advantage of the battlefield.\n\nThe only way to finish a mission is to have the exact cards the game wants you to. Want to build a deck around certain cards, certian factions or a certain strategy? Too bad. You don't get to choose your strategy. What you do get to do is play a mission several times to see what cards the enemy has and where he tends to play them. Then you get to build a deck specifically to counter the enemy's deck.\n\nEven then, there's a good chance you'll still end up playing the same mission several times. Like every card game, luck plays a large role. In this game it plays a very, very large role. Don't draw a single ironclad in the first six turns? Have four ironclads but no weapons? Have only powerful cards you don't have the AP for?\n\nToo bad.\n\nThe worst part of this is that it's very hard to rebound from a bad initial hand. You'll run into situations where the enemy has four ironclads on the battlefield, while you have none. Even if you draw a few ironclads, chances are that the enemy's have better gear by this point and are already halfway to your side.\n\nSo yeah, this game is a lot of fun. It's also a good way to see how much patience you have.","July 24, 2015","false","4.7"," 55 of 66 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","55","66","4","0"

Even so, it was fairly short (around 12 hours for a full-clear?)  The multiplayer was also enjoyable, but not a compelling reason to buy.  The campaign missions, challenges, and puzzles were solid and I really enjoyed the setting for the game (more than I expected to.)  I recommend picking this up if you like a good strategic game with reasonable depth and multiple paths to victory.  I bought it as part of a full price two-pack and would buy again.

If so, then you'll probably enjoy Ironclad Tactics.\n\nIt's possible to slog your way through missions with sub-optimal builds/tactics, and granted, it is incredibly frustrating when played in that manner. The core missions are tolerant of bad play, so you can get pretty far into the game before realizing what you're doing wrong. After unwittingly playing badly throughout the main campaign, I eventually hit a wall in the additional content.\n\nThe final mission of New Game Plus was particularly brutal, and I barely beat it after a couple hours of reckless attempts. As I moved onto the DLC missions, I found myself frequently devastated by the enemy having 1.5-2 times the resources that I do. Slogging through these missions was becoming increasingly unlikely, and I was questioning whether these missions were fairly balanced. Did I have to rely on the AI screwing up to stand a chance, or was there another way?\n\nAt that point, I approached the game from a different angle. First play a mission noncommitally with a simple deck, just to grasp what's being thrown my way. Then go to the drawing board and construct a deck particularly for that mission. With that mindset, I was crushing missions on the first "serious attempt" and feeling accomplished in my decision making.\n\nPlaying in this manner is a bit artificial. In what other game do you play a level for the first time solely to analyze it, with no intent of winning? I wonder if Ironclad Tactics could have been more forthcoming with its mission content, rather than have players flail through the motions with an uncatered deck.\n\nI recommend trying Ironclad Tactics with the "study first, succeed later" approach. That's what tipped me into the "recommended" camp. This is certainly a game for analysts/tinkerers.","March 24, 2015","true","22.9"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeepbarnett/recommended/226960/","jeepbarnett","PersonGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeepbarnett/","715 products in account","I've been playing Ironclad Tactics off and on for over a year. Only now, after earning every card, I realize that I forgot to write a review. It’s sort of a Plants VS Zombies game except that it’s Zombies VS Zombies, and the zombies are steampunk mechs.\n\nThe pace is realtime, but it moves slow enough to allow some thinking time for your next moves. Most of the challenge comes from building specialized decks to solve the puzzle that each level presents. Your AI opponent will have the upper hand with some new attack or defense and you’ll have to come up with a counter. Most of the time this results in a tense battle of planning, wits, and fortune. When you tweak a deck combo into working just right it feels great! Each new card opens up lots of tactical options and completing challenges for cards feels rewarding.\n\nThe civil war theme and story are awesome. I love the characters and animated comics that set up you journey across America. The in-game art and animation is beautiful. It’s easy to tell every unit apart and their abilities match the visuals. A robot with a jetpack files, dude with a shotgun has spread attack, and a flame thrower hits multiple targets. The music fits and is serviceable, but for me it’s one of the weakest points of the game. Something less traditional and more gutsy could have really helped some of the longer play sessions.\n\nEach level starts by showing you 5 random cards from your deck of 20, so sometimes it feels like a lucky/unlucky start can make or break a win. If cards come out in just the wrong order it can kill a plan, but managing this problem is also part of the art of deck building. It improved a bit with the release of the first DLC where you can now spend 1 action point to ‘save’ a critical card for later.\n\nThe first DLC uses an army with a completely different and fun style of play. It’s satisfying playing as the boss enemies that were beating you down in the final levels and to understanding the logic behind how their robots transform. It also fills in missing parts of the story with more comics. The second DLC is very stripped down, but still provides new interesting abilities. Playing the ‘War’ mode, where you’re stuck with either French or Germany armies, varies the play styles just enough to keep things fresh.\n\nAfter completing everything it feels like every inch of the design space has been explored. Not every ability or tactic is perfectly balanced, but there’s lots of viable strategies to solve each problem. That said, I haven’t played multiplayer which would be a much better gauge of balance. There’s not enough players to support random matchmaking and I don’t feel like it would be that fun against friends (even if they unlocked all the cards). I also haven’t tried the co-op mode, which is supported throughout the entire game.\n\nIf you liked Spacechem, you might like this. It’s about building machines, but stochastic machines rather than logical ones. If you loved Spacechem then definitely play this to support the awesome developers!","October 12, 2014","true","46.5"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","30","40","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/226960/","strategikal","Strategikal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/","1935 products in account","I was unsure about purchasing this game initially, but I'm glad I did. Although the gameplay looks quite simplistic, it turns out that there are many different tactical possibilities. Each level can be a bit of a puzzle to solve, and the solution often comes down to building a different deck. If at first you don't succeed, change the cards in your deck. Even so, you could have a good deck but still lose due the random chance of which cards are drawn. The first few cards are often crucial at the start of a battle, but don't give up, I've come back from some bad starts and still won.\n\nCard games are usually turn based so I was a little surprised to find out that there's a fairly quick timer running constantly (with no pause unless you press escape, but you can't study the board while paused), so you have real time pressure forcing you to make quick decisions. Normally I hate this sort of thing, but in this case I actually like it. It didn't take long to get used to it, it ensures quick battles (which makes a nice change of pace for me because I normally play slowly) and while it puts you under pressure, the timer lasts long enough for you to make good decisions most of the time, although occasionally you'll mess up.\n\nMy advice is to have a clear strategy in mind before you start each battle (and construct a deck to support that strategy), so that you know exactly what you plan to do during the battle. This makes it much easier to make quick decisions. Often you'll lose each battle on the first attempt, usually because the deck you're using isn't appropriate for the new situation, but just treat that as a learning battle to help figure out the best strategy to win it.\n\nEach battle often has 3 different victory conditions. You only need to win the battle to progress the storyline, but if you fulfill the extra victory conditions you win more cards. Often you'll need to play each battle 2 or 3 times to win them all, since you usually need to win some new cards to help you fulfil the extra victory conditions.\n\nThere's a multi-player option and some cards can only be won by using this option. I'm not normally a fan of multi-player but this game seems ideal for it because of the fast play timer and the short games. I also think that playing against another human with a custom deck would make the strategy a lot more unpredictable and hence interesting.\n\nI've only played through about 10 battles so far so I'm not sure how much more the game has to offer yet. I may add to this review once I've played more.\n\nMy conclusion so far is that the gameplay and tactics are better and more varied than I expected and it's proving to be quite an addictive game. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the random nature of tactical card based games, and the ability to create custom decks and play multi-player.\n\n[Edit] I've finished the main campaign now, there's 19 battles in all. Later battles become extremely difficult and can be frustrating to complete. But they're all winnable, the key comes down to designing an appropriate deck, but even then it may take several attempts due to the random nature of card drawing. In spite of the difficulty, or rather because of it, I found winning to be even more satisfying.\n\nI still haven't beaten all the battles with the extra victory conditions yet, but I'll be going back to do that. Not only that, but once you've beaten the campaign once, you can play the entire campaign again at a higher level of difficulty. I've spent 21 hours on it so far so there's plenty of value to be had from this game, and that's not even mentioning the DLCs which add new campaigns.\n\nIn response to some people who've said that there's not much depth to the strategy, they're wrong IMO. There's a massive number of different ways that you can construct decks and many different strategies you can use, you just need to use your imagination. For example, the rubbish prototype ironclads you get at the start of the campaign often came in very useful in the difficult later battles, simply because they are so cheap (you can spam them and use them as blockers).\n\nSo my final conclusion is that I highly recommend this game, provided you enjoy the random nature of card games and can handle the stress of the fast turns (you have about 3 seconds in which to play cards each turn, plus another 2 or 3 seconds to resolve the turn).","May 22, 2014","true","21.3"," 50 of 78 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","50","78","0","0"

While this has some great deck building elements and interesting play mechanic, it seems to just boil down to spamming cards. And sometimes the only way to learn a level is play it and lose 20 times with different deck builds each time before finally one clicks. Now this same process can be said for many games like Super Meat Boy or others of the same ilk, but while those are quick to reset and get you back into the meat of it, this game takes time and turn order. It builds up and leaves you very twitchy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when the next deck combo doesn't work.

The AI isn't particularly intelligent. The computer will frequently, for example, equip a weapon to an ironclad that is 3 empty spaces away from making it to your side, which is a waste of AP.  If you pop an ironclad with a melee weapon right in front of an AI ironclad two spaces from your side equipped with a 2+ range weapon, they wont swap that weapon out to kill your ironclad and make it to your side-- it'll just sit there and die. To make up for the lackluster AI, however, the player is handicapped in a number of ways, making the game feel exceedingly frustrating at times.\n\nThe player receives a base 1.0AP per turn, while the computer gets 1.5AP.  Then add on the fact that many of the AP-boosting objectives tend to be on the enemy's side, and the enemy often has units on the field to claim or defend them before turn 1.\n\nThis provides the illusion that the enemy's deck is an endless bag of cards where they can just pull out any card they desire at any point. The computer rarely needs to play defensively because they can just spam units to put YOU on defense.  Maybe 10% of the time am I able to sneak a raider by the AI when there is an ironclad in play that they can maneuver into his path.  Manage to an armored ironclad out to scrap with one weilding a 1 damage weapon? you've got about a 75% chance that they have some way to boost the damage to ignore the armor(depending on enemy factions).  You can see how many cards the enemy has in hand, so I don't think the computer actively cheats in this regard-- it's just because of the massive AP boost that the AI gets-- cards don't need to go to waste.\n\nTL;DR- Playing checkers with a skilled player is fun, even if they beat you.  Playing checkers with an incompetent player whos friends pop in to give them extra game pieces whenever they lose some is frustrating.","June 26, 2014","true","52.0"," 35 of 56 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","35","56","0","0"

Points are usually gained by getting your ironclads through the opponent’s defences and off their side of the screen, but certain scenarios can also include the need to hold fortified positions or destroy certain boss enemies.\n\nWhat makes Ironclad Tactics very different is its unique spin on realtime gameplay. Each card you play from your hand summons a particular unit to the battlefield and as the game ticks over in realtime, those units will then move, attack or perform some other unique action. At first the game can feel overwhelming as you have mere seconds after drawing a new card to decide whether to play it now or wait until your action points increase for the more expensive (not to mention powerful) alternatives already in your hand.\n\nThe game has a very satisfying tactile feel to it and the rate at which you earn new cards (usually by accomplishing bonus challenges during missions) is judged perfectly with plenty of new and exciting additions to make to your deck as the game goes on.\n\nWhere the game really shines is its cooperative mode. Whether online or over LAN, this game doesn’t present any confusing lobbies or account systems; just a very simple click of a button and you’re in and ready to play.\n\nIt’s fast, clean and simple, and the game plays well with two players each taking their own personalized deck into an encounter.\n\nAll in all, I really appreciate this game and I hope that developer Zachtronics hasn’t been perturbed by a few tepid review scores because their effort here is worth a whole lot more than all that.\n\nRead the full retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com]","June 12, 2015","true","25.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

The game features lovely artwork offering charming and funny comic strip style cut scenes. The core gameplay is centered on constricting your deck of 20 cards consisting of various human and machine warriors along with weapons and perks you can apply in combat.  You start the game with three randomly drawn cards and earn more cards upon one full cycle of the brief timer that counts as each turn, upon the completion of the turn you are also awarded an Action Point that you use to activate the cards from your hand. The main objective of each mission is to earn a set number of victory points that are obtained by one of your ironclad warrior robot troops successfully getting from one end of the battlefield to the other.\n\nThe fast paced nature of the game is both what makes the game shine and at the same time is its biggest hindrance, the fact that you have to make decisions so quickly eliminates the ability to really thoroughly strategize and plan out your next move as would a turn based strategy card game would, however this little bit of hectic fast paced chaos is what makes the game different from other card lane strategy games.  Upon completion of the mission you are awarded with a new set of cards that have some unique twist or element that was the featured gimmick of the level.\n\nThe game does offer a fairly steep difficulty curve that can become frustrating at times but adds to the overall length and replay-ability of the game when you have to go back and rework a new deck to try to conquer your highly competent AI foe. The game perfectly combines the good of both a Trading card game and a card lane strategy game; it offers a lovely art style, interesting setting, and a very challenging level of difficulty\n","January 8, 2015","true","2.8"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

The rapid-fire fun of turn-based tactical combat on a short timer.

What you might not suspect, however, is just how beautifully polished this game is, offering singleplayer as well as both co-op and competitive multiplayer in a neatly-presented package.\n\nWith artwork, sound, and interface design, Zachtronics has clearly lavished their game with a great deal of time and attention. When starting a new single player campaign, players will be introduced to the world through a series of stunning comic book-style panels. The artwork is colorful and the characters charming, with a breadth of facial expression rivaling that of some of the better webcomics out there. A similar level of care has been given to the in-battle presentation, with each unit and weapon having its own distinctive feel through a combination of looks, good sound effects, and interesting mechanics. Menus too are slick, with even more beautiful art and smooth animations. The whole experience is then tied-together with great music that had me feeling nostalgic for classic turn-based games like Final Fantasy Tactics.\n\nIf any of this sounds appealing to you then there's no reason to delay - check out the trailer and then have some fun with Ironclad Tactics!","January 6, 2014","true","13.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/226960/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","Ironclad tactics is a fast paced turn-based tactics game based on card deck building. Since this description doesn't help, here is a slightly better one: the player chooses various soldiers and weapons from a consequent number of available ones. A card deck comprises 20 of these picks. Each deck has to be chosen carefully according to the needs of each mission. The battles consist of playing the cards (appearing in a random order) to send troops and give them equipment. They move automatically forward on the lanes they are deployed on, but the tactical possibilities are numerous with the ability to stop a unit, sometimes switch lanes, use weapons that target specific lanes, add a specific customization to a mecha and so on. The game seems like real time to the player, but the actions are conducted by the computer in quick, seamless turns.\n\nThis might seem complicated on paper, but in-game it works very intuitively so that the player can fully focus on choices and tactical decisions. And the fast speed allows for the battles not to drag on, they even trigger a lot of adrenaline as the player has to think fast and is always kept on the edge. The gameplay is really good and works well in these half fast-paced half-slowed down conditions.\n\nHowever, where this game also really shines is in the level design. Usually strategy games can be repetitive as the players figure out their favorite strategy and repeat it to go through every mission. In Ironcland Tactics, each mission is different with the levels having a specific gimmick and the enemy deploying specific troops. While at first it can seem overwhelming if using the deck that was tailored for the previous level, this actually relates more to a puzzle game where the player has to figure out a well suited tactic to win. Card decks thus have to be customized specifically for every mission. So even if some might consider this very challenging when they don't know yet which strategy to use, I find it brilliant. It completely prevents the game from feeling repetitive with a single formula repeated ad nauseam, and keeps me thinking on how to tackle each new battle and makes me feel great for figuring out new strategies. Although, even if I mentioned a puzzle game inspiration, this game is not as static and mind taxing as a puzzle game, it remains very dynamic.\n\nThe story missions are linked through nicely made comics, reinforcing the feeling that overall this game has been carefully crafted. Additionally, the story can be played in online Coop as the players fight together and have to coordinate their strategy (forget it if you are not on voice communication, good communication seems pretty much required to succeed without making stupid mistakes - well these mistakes still happen on voice communication and can be hilarious, such as when one player decides to give a speed boost to a unit from the second player who decided that it should strategically hold position). And if you want to get revenge on your teammate for a mistake, there is always the possibility for 1 vs 1 to settle things non peacefully. Also of note, some missions can add a nice twist to the 1 vs 1 multiplayer such as the possibility for one of the two players to use a boss deck.\n\nThis game bears the "Tactics" subtitle perfectly well. I am very glad I discovered it in my Steam Library during its free week-end and gave it a curious try, otherwise I would never have known that this game is so good and keeps me so entertained while keeping my brain active.","September 22, 2014","true","15.5"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

After a point the game starts to become incredibly RNG-based and spoon-feeds you specific cards to make decks. The game features a deck crafting system,as you may have gathered,but you can only use a maximum of 2 of the 6 factions in crafting. This makes some decks hard to create as the game doesn't like to give enough space to build some interesting decks.The campaign is rather short as well,although the story is interesting and using a comic style to relay the story was a nice feature.

The cutscenes are delivered in a comic-book style format, and the art is well done. The music is sounds are also good and add to the atmosphere of the industrial-age setting.\n\nI found the story to be decent, nothing too spectacular, but still very good. The expansions are also a lot of fun.\n\nThe controls are very simple since you are primarily clicking on your cards to use, however, the learning curve can range from moderate to difficult. You will be at a good advantage if you are already knowledgeable in deck-building/pre-deck trading card games. Understanding the mechanic of "synergy," or making sure that every single card in your deck has a purpose will ensure that you do well. If you are a newcomer, the tutorial is very helpful in giving you a firm grasp on the gameplay, and the extra challenges for each mission (which yield more cards) will also help you better understand how to make effective decks.\n\nYou play the game by using decks of exactly 30 cards, with no more than 4 of each card. During gameplay, you randomly draw any card from your deck and it is put on a conveyor-style menu at the bottom of the screen. You also get 1 action point per turn, and these are used to purchase (and immediately use) your available cards. If your card pool is full, then the last card on the right will be discarded. There is an option to spend 1 AP in order to move the last card to the front of the lineup. There appears to be no draw limit, as you will cycle through your cards repeatedly (don't think you can run out of cards).\n\nCards consist of units (infantry or "ironclads," which are basically steampunk, industrial-era mechs), parts for your ironclads, and tactics. After completing missions, you are rewarded with more cards. There are also different challenges you can complete for each stage to unlock even more cards. New game+ is available, however, it is very challenging if you are not using a solid deck. There are multiple "factions," (ex: army, experimental, etc) and your deck may be composed of a maximum of 2. The variety of cards leads to interesting strategies and surprises. Some cards have the potential for "upgrades," where you can unlock a better version of the card if you complete something (ex: "deploy this ironclad x times," "this ironclad dies 5 times," "deal 30 damage with this infantry unit (cumulative.").\n\nDuring play, you can summon units to move across the map (1 space forward per round, assuming default speed (=1)). You can click your units to have them hold position, and this is useful for camping your infantry on a mortar spot, which will generate 1 victory point for you each turn as long as it is occupied. Ironclads can trample most infantry units, resulting in instant kills. Getting an ironclad to the enemies side of the screen will yield you victory points (minimum 1). If you get the required number of victory points before your opponent, you win!\n\nSince ironclads enter the battle unarmed, you can attach different parts (a head piece and an arm piece) onto them - you are able to exchange parts so long as you have the cards and the AP. Example pieces include a shotgun, which shoots units in a radius in front of the unit; and a cat pilot that increases movement speed (3 spaces forward every round).\n\nTactics cards include: giving an extra attack to your infantry/ironclad (separate cards), allowing your unit to move either one space up or down (lane changing), and bombarding an entire row for 2 damage each.\n\nThe feedback is very useful and informative - you can hover over units at any time to see their attack range, damage, and stats.\n\nIf you enjoy laning and/or card-building games, then give this gem a try, you may spend a lot of time playing this one.\n\nHighly recommend!","July 16, 2014","true","22.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a top down style\ntactical game that relays its story in a comic book fashion.  You gain cards\nby completing missions, challenges, and increasing difficulty.\n\nThe cards are organized a bit haphazardly, making it difficult to build\na deck.  There are filters, but the way they are laid out makes it a\nbit confusing\nas you build your collection.\n\nThe missions aren't too complicated, but the game has increasing\ndifficulty and challenges that promote replayability.

There is a luck element into what kind of enemy will\nappear and in what lane, and what cards you will have availble from your\ncollection.  This randomization may appeal to some players, but the way the\ncards interact does slow the lane defense experience.  In the same vein, those\nwho are used to card games may be disillusioned by the tactical strategy that\nis necessary to the more quicker paced lane defense mechanic.\n\nI can recommend this game, but I strongly recommend that you are aware\nof the hybrid card/lane defense elements so as not to expect all of one element\nor too much of the other.\n\nThis is a summary of what I talk about in the video, I am a YT'er not a Blogger\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","October 19, 2014","true","2.6"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","0"

Following in their footsteps this game should at least be decent, right?\n\nMegaman Battle Network?\nWell yeah, it is decent actually but for some reason they decided to make a hybrid between 'Megaman Battle Network' and 'Plants VS Zombies' so what you end up with is a not very good 'lane' game ala PvZ and a watered down MBN game which just leaves you disoriented. Battle network was good! If you are going to emulate an already good game then try to copy the parts that actually made it good, switching my robots from lane to lane using cards is unnatural in a fast paced game and also i have to click twice to switch lanes and sometimes it just doesn't register that I want it to move out the way.\n\nPlants VS Zombies?\nThe PvZ element is a little overdone in clone games but what do you expect, that game sold very well so I wouldn't mind the hybridization the developer attempted here if they didn't try to make you move robots up & down the lanes/battlefield when most victories are about out spamming your foe in PvZ and thinking on your feet. This game is just too fast paced to be able to keep up with everything that is expected of you.\n\nIronclad Fail?\nUltimately we have a good game here but it is very much NOT for everyone. You can play the story mode with a friend, the art direction is simple but good, the story telling is decent and the depth comes from learning to juggle the megaman aspects against the PvZ aspects, knowing which units are worth your concentration and effort versus which ones to just leave as cannon fodder and the music, the sound it is all really good and I haven't even mentioned the deck building either which lets you create dynamic tactics and builds.\n\nUltimately if you are expecting a tactical game in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics or Tactics Ogre then no, this is NOT that kind of game but if you were a fan of the Megaman Battle Network games or the Plants VS Zombies then this game might be for you.\n\nPersonally I didn't enjoy this game hence why I didn't recommend it but I apprechiate that not only is the game itself well done and polished but also that it was very ambitious to attempt to combine two great franchaises.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","September 19, 2014","false","0.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","10","19","2","0"

There are two phases/modes to the game:  A sort of deck builder lite, where players construct decks to be used during gameplay.  And the actual gameplay phase, where actions and units are played through a card based mechanic in real time (no pausing).  The real time action forces the player to think and act quickly, as flow combat dynamically shifts the player between attack and defense as needed.\n\nWhile the luck of the draw, or the real time play aspect of the game, might turn some off, I found it to be a bit addictive, evoking that "just one more round" type of play progression.\n\nAn added bonus is the comic book like story progression between levels.  I found the artwork and storyline to be quite enjoyable.\n\nWith the base game alone, I would suggest people give it a try.  Single player, new game plus, and multi player modes are available.  I am looking forward to digging into the DLC.\n\nI just need to give that last level in my ng+ one more shot.  Cheers!  =)\n\n*** Touch Based Users ***\nThose with touch screen computers should note that this game played perfectly with the touch screen option enabled in the options menu.  The only minor issue was with naming the decks in the deck builder, but that interfered with the game in no way.\n\n*** Cloud Saves ***\nThis game supports cloud saves.

I've seen alot of negative reviews for the game and to be honest, even though I would recommend this game, I don't think it's as good as some people think it is.\n\nFirst thing first, the good aspects of the game:\n+ Incredible music, I'm still listening to the music and hell even the dlc music are actually better than the main music. Thankfully the soundtrack is free if you google it and is actually from the musician himself.\n+ Artwork, while cartoony, it's pretty great. I enjoy the designs for the characters and landscape and the movement is pretty smooth.\n+ Diversity, the game offers alot of cards and a total of 5 (+3 if you have the 2 dlc) that have different types of weapons, troops and tactics.\nSo those are some of the good aspects, what is it that I don't like?\n-Luck, Despite being a turned based strategy game with cards, the game is 100% dependent on getting luck. There will be times that you will have to reconsider which deck you use but even if you have the right deck, the starting hand, timing and chances your opponent won't try to destroy you early in the match is pretty harsh and can put off alot of people.\n-Story, I don't really hate the story much but to be honest, the characters could have been better. Often times I kinda felt the main character should have been another character, some characters don't feel like we know them too well or changes too quick.\n- Limitation, Knowing this is on pc, the game still feels limited to being a mobile game. You can only have max of 4 decks  and can only have max of 20 cards and 2 factions per deck. This can be very frustrating if you want to get your favorite cards together only to either exceeded the limits. (I know how I felt about not getting my army of native flamethrowing/Drilling/tomahawk army)\n-Challanges (Mission challange), um yea, I'm not gonna be able to beat that one level without breaking the walls........\n\nOverall, why am I recommending the game? 3 reasons: the music is fantastic, it's a alternate historical game that acutally doesn't suck and it's actually makes you feel like you want to really win battles.","October 2, 2014","true","13.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I cannot stress enough how much more satisfying it is to overcome obstacles and challanges with a partner than by yourself and the co-op system in this game is absolutely masterful. My partner and I would frequently take the opportunity to build complimentary decks, taking turns filling specific roles and amplifying each other strengths, or, compensating for each others weaknesses.\n\nThe game features a beautifully executed diffiulty curve, with challenges that constantly demand new decks and new strategies and always feels just slightly harder than you're capable of. So, when you manage to beat that level and all of its challenges, that accomplishment actually means something. Not a lot of games deliver that kind of satisfaction.\n\nThe only real criticism I can give to Ironclad Tactics is that it's short and the multiplayer doesnt hold a lot of interest for me due to its limited versatility. In a 1-on-1 match, there are only so many viable card combinations and with no new cards coming out the game has serious mortality issues. But all good things must come to an end, right?\n\nGreat game, awesome multiplayer, it was well worth the cost.","December 29, 2013","true","18.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Most of the challenge comes from building specialized decks to solve the puzzle that each level presents. Your AI opponent will have the upper hand with some new attack or defense and you’ll have to come up with a counter. Most of the time this results in a tense battle of planning, wits, and fortune. When you tweak a deck combo into working just right it feels great! Each new card opens up lots of tactical options and completing challenges for cards feels rewarding.\n\nThe civil war theme and story are awesome. I love the characters and animated comics that set up you journey across America. The in-game art and animation is beautiful. It’s easy to tell every unit apart and their abilities match the visuals. A robot with a jetpack files, dude with a shotgun has spread attack, and a flame thrower hits multiple targets. .\n\nEach level starts by showing you 5 random cards from your deck of 20, so sometimes it feels like a lucky/unlucky start can make or break a win. If cards come out in just the wrong order it can kill a plan, but managing this problem is also part of the art of deck building. It improved a bit with the release of the first DLC where you can now spend 1 action point to ‘save’ a critical card for later.\n\nThe first DLC uses an army with a completely different and fun style of play. It’s satisfying playing as the boss enemies that were beating you down in the final levels and to understanding the logic behind how their robots transform. It also fills in missing parts of the story with more comics.\n\nNot every ability or tactic is perfectly balanced, but there’s lots of viable strategies to solve each problem. That said, I haven’t played multiplayer which would be a much better gauge of balance. There’s not enough players to support random matchmaking and I don’t feel like it would be that fun against friends (even if they unlocked all the cards). I also haven’t tried the co-op mode, which is supported throughout the entire game but I think it would be pretty fun!\nUPDATE:\nI have bough both of the dlcs before june 20th and really want a refund while keeping the dlcs but I won't be fussy with them because well that's a bit mean. I honestly think this game if put on more consoles would change the market a bit in the world of turn based games.","December 8, 2014","true","269.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

This is done by activating cards at varying cost that you collect as you play the game. Some units are better suited against others and you can get some cards to move units, heal and damage. On paper this sounds quite fun. However, I am not a big fan of these lane games as I find them quite boring. True the cards add a new element but just throwing units at the enemy hoping hey get through whilst they do the same doesn't keep my interest. Also I don't know if I am just crap at this game but I tend to lose quite a few games on a level before I get the win and this seems mainly down to luck. The idea of the American civil war with steam powered Mechs is a cool concept though. Basically if you like lane fighting games, you will like this. If you don't, you will think it is a good example of the genre but still won't like it.","October 11, 2014","false","0.6"," 19 of 39 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","19","39","0","0"

Although it's probably entirely possible to work your way through the game without ever going back to complete the story challenge objectives, you might find it difficult without those extra cards. (Whereas in Spacechem you only have what you're given in each level. You aren't collecting tools along the way.)\n\n2) Beat the clock - although the game is turn-based, you have to keep track of a number of game elements and make your plays in a fairly brief window of time. (Whereas in Spacechem only the boss fights have a time element and that only has to do with execution, not designing your reactors.)\n\n3) Luck of the draw - It's annoying to have a well planned deck fail multiple times, then finally succeed when you get the cards in a reasonable order. I don't mind losing to AI, but losing to the random number generator is irritating. (Whereas in Spacechem the only apparent randomness is in some of the reactor inputs, but the point is your design needs to detect and handle each case appropriately.)\n\nIf the above game design elements don't bother you, then you should give Ironclad a look. It's certainly a more polished work than Spacechem, but unfortunately it doesn't require anything like the intense problem solving that Spacechem does. (But for some people that might be a plus.) I don't regret my purchase since the money went to Zachtronics, but I didn't get nearly as much value out of this game as I did from Spacechem.

The card-based summoning/creation of units appealed to me, and it is a strategy tactical type of game. If you've ever played any flash game with a set number of rows your units have to cross to get to the other side to win, that's this game. The difference between this game and a normal flash game? Better graphics, better sound effects, and a great comic style story telling.\n\nThe game lacked in voice acting, it was mainly the units being summoned/created when voice acting came into play. It also misses a feature I would have loved to see, which is a speed up button. It made the game a little boring sometimes having to wait for the right card or just something else. It would have been a nice feature (1.5 times to 2x would have been perfect).\n\nIronclad Tactics has a multiplayer feature that I have yet to take part in (not a huge MP fan on some games), but it is probably pretty similar to the campaign so it is probably pretty solid.\n\nOverall: 8/10 for a simple, but fun tactical strategy game.\nMy recommendation: Buy it on at a discounted price/on sale.","September 18, 2014","true","15.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/226960/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","I was looking forward to trying this game a while back, although I had no clue it came from Zachtronics, developer of the infamous SpaceChem. I haven't played much of SpaceChem yet. It intimidates me, and I'd like to devote my full attention to it, when the time comes -- soon, I'd say.\n\nSo, when I knew this came from the same people, I wasn't sure if I wanted to play yet. I did anyway.\n\nWell, Ironclad Tactics is a different take on the lane strategy "genre", with the added complexity layer of deck-building.\n\nThis game is really, if you don't know what you're expected to do. This is mostly a deck-building game, as other reviewers have stated. Each level has a different challenge for your to overcome, and you overcome it with a different deck, mostly. Certainly, tactics are also very important, but a good tactic will do very little if you don't have the correct deck.\n\nWhile the concept is interesting, and I did enjoy the game, I can't say that it's perfect. At all. It has several design points that I heartily disagree with, and make it simply a "good" game. Which isn't bad, mind you. Just not quite what I expected after trying SpaceChem.\n\n\nI've completed the game (without the DLC). Done all the optional objectives as well as game plus. It was a challenging task, for sure, but also very rewarding!\n\nEach level has a main objective. There are several different types of levels: there's the common level, in which you try to get victory points by moving your units into the end of the map, there's an "hold position" level, in which you try to survive for x number of turns, and there's the Boss levels. Each of them play very different. Level variation is also pretty good, which is surprising. It seems very limited with the 3-5 lane maps, but there is a surprising number of subtle changes that make all the different.\n\nThen, there are optional objectives. Some are puzzle levels -- these were easy, but really great! Basically, they teach you a certain mechanic with that: limited deck with 3 or 4 cards, and you have to make the best out of it. Unfortunately, there were only 3 or 4 of these levels.\nThen, there are some that make you gain VP by other means than moving units to the end of the lane. There are some that make you play with a completely different deck: don't use Y faction, for example.\n\nAll of these provide interesting challenges.\n\n\nNow, what's wrong with it, exactly?\n\nWell, you unlock cards by completing levels and secondary objectives. However, since this is such a deck-oriented game, you'll often be missing the cards you need for a given deck. And so, you have to push through some challenges, until you can go back and complete the secondary objectives.\nIt has a very awkward pacing, like that. Some game encourage you to play previous levels better, but this one does that weirdly, since you can only play some of the previous levels better, since you're missing cards.\nYou'll have to go back and forth a few times, but it's doable. Just not as elegant as I would have liked.\n\nThen, there's the random elements. Argh, the randomness...!\nSo, you build a deck. Great. Then, you have to hope that you draw the correct cards at the right moments. One bad draw can screw you over and make you restart a level. Oh, but wait: there's no restart button! I'll talk about it later.\nYeah, lots of restarting, until you get the right draws. It's... not to my liking. Maybe it works in multiplayer. It certainly works in most card game. But here, it's just a matter of restarting... Tactics play a lesser role than the actual cards used, and that's why the randomness doesn't work as well.\nAlso, the decks are very limited -- maximum of 2 factions, exactly 20 cards. So, you can't really create as much variety, or even guarantee to get a certain card, since there are at most 4 or 5 of each.\n\nIt's an interesting limitation, and it requires some creativity to beat levels. But then again, the randomness is frustating, since it's a matter of trying over and over until you get the right draws that you envisioned all along.\n\nNow, about the lack of a restart button. I don't know why it is. It makes little sense. Perhaps it's simply a question of the designer saying "create the right deck and you won't have to restart". Maybe...\nThe game came off as a bit too random for that, but I don't know. Just a minor gripe made bigger with the amount of restarting...\n\n\n\nHonestly, this is a very frustrating game, at times. Especially when you first start, not exactly sure how it works, it will be daunting. But if you keep trying, you'll learn how the game works, how the AI works, and how certain levels can be easily beat with the right decks.\nNewGame+ is almost a whole different game, also! Don't just complete the main campaign, thinking that's everything. It's definitely not.\n\nWell, not a perfect game, but certainly a very rewarding experience, if you feel like a challenge!","June 13, 2015","true","18.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

It's fun, to put it simply.The pacing of a match is sufficient where you can plan without being rushed, but you don't have to wait a long time. The variety of cards and factions means that you can focus on different tactics, and have many unique decks without old cards becoming obsolete. And of course, who wouldn't want to command an army of giant robots?\n\nThere were a couple foibles, though. The first cards had an interesting mechanic where completing mini-achievements would unlock new cards (e.g. deploying 30 riflemen--->veteran riflemen). This is really only seen in the first few missions and then not really at all from there on out. A shame, considering that hey, it was a cool idea.\n\nThe basic story was okay; not great, but not terrible. The characters were unique, but not really memorable. I thought one particular character, Joseph Ashdown, should have been in the story a bit more, given that he's the main character's lifelong friend and shares equal billing with him. He kind of gets kicked out of the story early on, and doesn't show up again till near the end. But that's only my opinion.\n\nAll in all, though, I'd still totally recommend Ironclad Tactics. It's a pretty solid choice, with a vibrant, unique art style, a really, really great sort of American-orchestral soundtrack, and quite a lot of post-main-story fun (including a harder version of the campaign and two DLC campaigns), Ironclad Tactics is a stable ride that just needs some polish. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.","March 9, 2014","true","208.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has good strategy, the card game-like feel can be appealing (as with many digital card games), and the story is fun, although it can drag on for too long sometimes.  However, the #1 complaint I have so far is that it's won by a whole freakin' lot of trial and error. By that I mean the only way to get good at it is to try deck after deck until you find one that works, which  can  get annoying sometimes. Also, there are a lot of painful moments when you're just waiting for your AP to build up so you can play a card while your enemy's Ironclad slowly advance towards your end of the board. However, the overall game is fun, as it can be fun to try and figure out what deck combo works best.","September 20, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't usually play these type of games pretty often, so i didn't really get my hopes up that much, after playing it a while i think that this game has a lot of potential. I love the gameplay and the interface looks really cool, i also like how they represent the story in a cool comic styled way.\n\nBasically what i'm trying to say is, if it is still available on steam, or you're looking for a nice indie game for a couple of bucks to pass the time, this game is for you.\n\nThis game looks pretty simplistic but actually after a while you'll see that you need to keep calm and play wisely, the tactics you make can't be used all the time because of limitations like AP and the cards.

The game is a card game in which you need to win a certain amount of victory points by having key units exit the map on the enemies side.. of course the enemy tries to do the same with his  key unit exiting of your side of the map. Next to the units which you summon with the appropiate cards, you have cards that enhance them or allow them to do special moves. Some cards are tied in with a special units.\nYou can design your own deck with the cards so that you can play the game the way you want, although sometimes you are forced to play with a certain deck.. especially when you want to win bonus cards or solve puzzles.\n\nI followed the story mode until I got stuck and discovered that next to the story mode there are other options to win additional cards and units. The end battle I found particular hard to win.\n\nThe game is a kind of a mixed bag. On the one hand it is fun game with a nice visual style and mood. The art design is cartoony which is well chosen as it fits well the mood of the game.  The story mode is told via cartoons, which I found captivating at first, but near to the end I started to click through to get to the battle. The makers made a wise choice not to force players to sit through a story every time they are defeated  and have to replay it again and I think I even gained cards when I was defeated.\n\nThe  other hand, the down side, is that the game remains a random card game and it isn't easy to build a tactic around it.  In addition you get often thrown into a unknown situation with no clue about what you are up against, so that you might find yourself losing because you simple have the wrong cards and units to defeat the challenge. Especially the end battle is heavily dependent on luck.. if you luck out you lose, if you luck holds you win.\n\nIn addition I don't quite understand why the makers chose to split the cards up in groups of which you can only have two at the same time. At least one group has no units and another consists mostly of units that are into sneaking and have no use in a regular fight. Why this limitation has been introduced remains a mystery as you are limited to 20 cards and I can't think of a combination of cards that would make someone invincible.. but maybe you can..\n\nAnyway.. would I recommend it..\nWell, yes.. for a short while.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","September 21, 2014","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fits the theme, and makes me think very much of Penny Arcade in the drawing style, which is a positve.\n\nThen, oh my, the game itself. It's a little... weird. I've never really played these kind of things online, but having been a huge M:TG fan way way back when, it's definately got a good spin on the idea. I dislike the idea of having such a limited pool of cards to play with. I can totally understand limiting the selection of cards so you have to have at least 20, but so far (and I don't know if this changes during the game later on) you're stuck with just twenty, and that's not a positive. We've all these wonderful combinations that we just can't do due to limited deck size. That's one major downside to the deck building aspect, but such is life - and it's not terrible, just would have preferred more wiggle room in that department.\n\nIn terms of strategy, seems quite simple, until you try and achieve some of the challenges - which make luck/rush a bit more of a factor, but they're fun to go for. Although there are times I wish I could freeze my cards from cycling, again, because of rng. But I do enjoy the timed aspects of the turn based system, making it simulataneous makes a huge difference to how it feels, and makes it much more actiony.\n\nI can definately see me letting my boy play this, as he loves Pokemon et all, and this seems a little more grown-up in terms of game, but he's starting to get into them.\n\nCons:- It's random past your deckbuilding. If you're not a player of those type of games, this might frustrate you.\n- Some of the starts you get, where you're outmatched immediately are frustrating, especially with random luck.\n- It's a little simplistic. Doesn't have some of the same depth you may be used to if you're familiar to the format.\n- While I've not played the game to death yet, although I can see myself enjoying this later on, I suspect it will feel very samey aftera while.\n\nPros:- It's cheap and while there's DLC, it doesn't have the spend spend spend attitude of many of the trading card style of games.\n- If you enjoy tcg's, then you'll find the game quite intuitive, apart from the turns flying by if you're a "muller over of things".\n- Graphics are nice, and the story so far seems interesting and for what few words there are, well written.\n- Easy to get into, just from a short play time, I can see myself getting into this a lot more.\n\nSimple, cheap and quite a lot of fun. Can't go wrong with steam powered mecha.","September 24, 2014","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun, to put it simply.The pacing of a match is sufficient where you can plan without being rushed, but you don't have to wait a long time. The variety of cards and factions means that you can focus on different tactics, and have many unique decks without old cards becoming obsolete. And of course, who wouldn't want to command an army of giant robots?\n\nThere were a couple foibles, though. The first cards had an interesting mechanic where completing mini-achievements would unlock new cards (e.g. deploying 30 riflemen--->veteran riflemen). This is really only seen in the first few missions and then not really at all from there on out. A shame, considering that hey, it was a cool idea.\n\nThe basic story was okay; not great, but not terrible. The characters were unique, but not really memorable. I thought one particular character, Joseph Ashdown, should have been in the story a bit more, given that he's the main character's lifelong friend and shares equal billing with him. He kind of gets kicked out of the story early on, and doesn't show up again till near the end. But that's only my opinion.\n\nAll in all, though, I'd still totally recommend Ironclad Tactics. It's a pretty solid choice, with a vibrant, unique art style, a really, really great sort of American-orchestral soundtrack, and quite a lot of post-main-story fun (including a harder version of the campaign and two DLC campaigns), Ironclad Tactics is a stable ride that just needs some polish. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.","March 9, 2014","true","208.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
