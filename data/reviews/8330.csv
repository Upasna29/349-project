Right off the bat this is not a story driven expierence this is a poker game in the style of Poker Night without the popular charecters (excluding one). Essiantly you are The player and youre gonna play a poker match with a Grandma, Ted,Borris and Harry. So how is this classic ? Its quite decent and its quite fun to play. But it has a few quirks as well. Well right off the bat if you want the same expierence as Poker Night just skip this title right off the bat because its not as good as those other games and of course theres no rewards for playing this game. Now for the good. The game is Hilarious. The jokes are sometimes laugh out loud funny and sometimes not so much. Now the game is a simple Texas Hold em game and its fun to play even though there arent more modes to play. Now for the bad. The AI is so stupid you can pretty much win the game going all in. Because the game almost always gives the Ai bad cards and you get the best ones. Graphiclly this game isnt nothing too special but its still a decent game. Theres also a well know bug where the gave will give you better cards than the AI but they wills still win with the lower cards. Overall Telltale Texas Hold Em is a fun poker game even though its nothing too special. Overall this game is worth full price for fans of telltale and fans of poker but if your neither of that just wait for a price drop. I give Telltale Texas Hold 'Em a 7.5/10","August 13, 2014","true","0.7"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

The tutorial pop ups are not that helpful and the full rules are only explained in text in the menu.

I'm not sure if you are a seasoned poker player that it might prove more enjoyable but I don't know how the AI stacks up against real opponents.

In this game you play 4 players entered in The TellTale Poker Tournament. All four characters I really enjoyed in this game over the characters in Poker Night 1. This game is great for Texas Hold 'Em newbies or old pros. In between turns you sometimes get dialouge from the characters who all have unique personalities. Harry is a guy who thinks he is the best because of his poker coach. Borris is a momma's boy who wishes that she'll grant him luck. Ted is a surfer who has some great one liners but seems to be hated by the group. Last, but not least, is Grandma who is just a sweet old lady trying to get some extra cash. Sure it might not have the cool atmosphere Poker Night has, but considering this game is 2 dollars cheaper and is has more enjoyable characters in my opinion, I say go for this one.","January 2, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","1"
