I started playing it, and before i knew it, i was 2 hours into the game already...   You just want that 1 extra star... It's  addicting...  Can't leave this game alone.\nIf you like Qbert, then this is a MUST game to play..\nGo get it NOW!!!","August 8, 2015","true","3.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

It's familiar enough at the start but the puzzle difficulty ramps up pretty quick.  I like the fact that there are a few ways to complete the levels without getting a "perfect" score because it gives me enough reason to go and replay the levels I've already finished.","July 24, 2015","true","0.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

But controls for a 360 controller are horrible and work sporadically.","October 3, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Nice graphics and style, I find it easier to play with the music turned off (seems less distracting for some reason).\n\nI can foresee this game as the new "retro" game that our kids will reminisce about :)","September 1, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"
