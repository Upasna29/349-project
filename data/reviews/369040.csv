Couple this with an editor and a dedicated server, and this game has a TON to offer fans of games like Ring Runner and Subspace.

That was insanely fun, I loved it... Total mayhem sometime, tons of game mod, a lot of fun. In the beginning, I got my ♥♥♥ whooped by way higher rank ship with fancy guns, I thought wow I can't compete but actually the game is well balance and even with a lower ship you still can win. You can be sneaky use bonus and environment at your advantage...\n\nI started this game without knowing what to expect, and that's a very good surprise. It looks like a little retro shoot, but it has more depth than meets the eye.\n\nThe story mode have a tons of very different missions: arena, race, pursuit, puzzle, collect, boss ...By doing missions you earn cash to buy upgrades or a new ship(not quite there yet). You have a huge choice of upgrade. I enjoyed testing new weapons because they each have their own physics... But I only have a few hours of play, I unlocked only few and  still a long way to go, I have barely scratched the surface.\n\nHowever you must train a little before you can easily fly the ship, pass that adjustment period, it's very fun but but hard on few levels; it's no mercy.\nThe physics of the game is nice with details like the gravitational field of planets that attracts you (note XD can destroy them with a big weapon)graphics and lighting effects are very good.\n\nReminds me sort of cross over of a Vectrex's game and Bomberman.\nI enjoy solo mode but can't wait to see more players to test the multi. I think, it has a lot of potential especially online or LAN.\n\nFR:\nmise à jour, online testé: C'est excellent, le ♥♥♥♥♥♥ total à des moments mais super sympa.\n\nJ'ai commencé ce jeu sans savoir à quoi m'attendre, et c'est une très bonne surprise.\nIl ressemble à un petit shoot retro, mais il a plus de profondeur qu'il en a l'air.\n\nLe mode histoire est bourré de missions très diverses: arène, course, poursuite, puzzle, collecte, boss... En faisant les missions on gagne de l'argent pour acheter des améliorations ou un nouveau vaisseau. On a accès à un choix énorme d'améliorations. J'ai beaucoup aimé  tester des nouvelles armes, car elles ont des physiques propres à chacune d'entre elles. Mais Je n'ai que quelques heures de jeu, je n’ai pas encore réussi à toutes les débloquées et j'en suis encore loin, j'ai à peine gratté la surface.\n\nPar contre faut s'entrainer un peu avant de réussir à piloter correctement son vaisseau, passer ce petit temps d'adaptation, c'est super fun mais hard à y des niveaux qui ne pardonnent pas. La physique du jeu sympa avec des petits détails comme le champ de gravité des planètes qui vous attire (note on peut les détruire XD avec une grosse arme) bon graphisme et effets de lumière.\n\nUn bon mix entre un jeu vectrex et bomberman. J'apprécie le mode solo mais j'ai hâte de voir plus de joueur pour tester le multi. Je pense qu'il a beaucoup de potentiel surtout pour le multi en ligne ou en LAN.","August 7, 2015","true","7.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

It's more a twinstick style shooter. Single player sucks pretty hard. There's no real challenge. The game uses an RPG style inventory system and gives you money for doing missions but you can't buy anything meaningful for a very long time. The "story" is told through cutscenes full of cringeworthy voice acting and stock character portraits. Back to playing vanar.io I guess.","November 24, 2015","false","0.5"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tosterx/recommended/369040/","tosterx","TosterX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tosterx/","975 products in account","Yargis is an old styled action space shooter. You meet the world of Yargis in front of the conflict and you're the only one who can sort it out.\n\nGameplayYou start the game as a beginner and learn how to control the ship and guns :) Your main task is to flight from the space and fight with the enemies. Throughout the missions you're challenged with flying through labirynths and completing the objectives in certain missions. It's not always about eliminating enemies, but sometimes you need to collect parts or survive the level. The levels in the Story mode are not very difficult but you need to upgrade your ship by buying new guns or armor from the money earned by completing levels. The offline mode is a little bit more challenging so you need to care about upgrades more than in story mode. It was designed to be the training mode for multiplayer so it's obvious.\n\nControls, Physics & GraphicsI really enjoyed how the ships are controlled. At first I had some troubles with discovering how to brake the ship but the Space button on KB is really helpful. The way how the ships are behaving is really nice and feels realistic. For example if you fly close to planet, your ship is affected by it's gravity. Therefore if the planet grabs your ship, you need to use boost to counter the force of planet's gravity. I was very satisfied with the graphics. The details of space and planets are really fantastic.\n\nMultiplayerHaven't played yet :)\n\nSummaryMy review for Yargis is positive. I really enjoyed the single player and wait to play multiplayer. There are small bugs in the game but it doesn't affect general gameplay. I reported them to the dev with my suggestions so i'm sure they're gonna fix them :)","August 25, 2015","true","12.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Are you nuts? Even the sale price of $2 isn't worth it.\n\nSorry to the devs... but its just not cut out for the public world of video games. Kudos for the work put in, but honestly you should work harder... push your limits further.\n\nThe voice acting is awful, the gameplay is clunky. It's just not there.

It is a top down Space action title.\n\n*I was given this copy for review purposes*\n\nGraphics\n\nThe Graphics in Yargis are Great for the feel of the game.  Brilliant explosions, beautifully drawn planets, and cratered asteroids.  Overall I was impressed with the graphics in Yargis.  8/10\n\nSound\n\nThe music has a nice “space theme” to it.  Explosions, lasers, missiles, all sorts of weaponry sound great and fit the game brilliantly. The sound in Yargis is top notch and it shows the developer has put alot into it.  Overall I was impressed with the sound in Yargis.   8/10\n\nOverall Gaming Experience\n\nYargis missions mode are varied and done well.  Dogfighting being my particular favorite.  Racing not so much.  The controls are a bit hard to get used to as it feels like you are on oil.  The controls make the racing levels a bit harder for me as you bounce off the walls.  The boundaries are a little hard to spot sometimes on some levels.  The Multi player includes Capture the flag, deathmatch, and last man standing to name a few.  There are plenty of multiplayer choices.  However the player base is very low.  Single player however will keep you busy for hours with its varied modes as well.  Overall I was im pressed with Yargis and rate it a 7/10.  Wait for a sale though the price tag is a bit steep.","July 23, 2015","true","6.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

It has both singleplayer and multiplayer options.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You are in control of a spaceship. You have to destroy other spaceships with your weapon, you have to research planets, race against other ships, earn money and spend that money on upgrading your ship.\n\nPros:    This game is really fun to play. There are a lot of missions and they all have a story behind them. This is much better than just flying around and destroying things without a meaning.\nOne of the best things about the story is, in my opinion, the voice acting. The sound quality is not the best, but I like the way characters talk to each other and make a story.\nYou get plenty of money in game and you can spend that money on upgrades. You can buy a getter engine, more armour, better weapons ...\nThe physics are also pretty good. The gravity of the nearby planets affect your spaceship's path for a more realistic flying across the space.\nThe community is great. There are events organised throughout the month and the dev's servers are online 24/7. You can also start your own dedicated server and play with your friends.\nThere is a level editor also included. The maps you create can be then used on your server.\nAchievements, Trading Cards, Steam Cloud and Workshop are supported.\nCons:    Every time I close the game, the data is transferred to Steam Cloud. This would be nothing special, but unlike other games, Yargis needs about 5 minutes to upload the data and you can't play any other games in the meantime.\nThe graphic look could be significantly improved, especially the menus and the upgrade screen.\nNo SteamOS and MacOS support.\nDespite the healthy community, there are not many players playing on multiplayer servers. However, attending the events is the best idea to interact with others and have some good time.\nThe final verdict:This game is very enjoyable in both singleplayer and multiplayer mode. There are missions, upgrades, multiplayer fun and level editing. Despite having some minor problems, this game is a great way to entertain your bored self in the afternoon.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.","August 29, 2015","true","5.6"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

There's also a plethora of upgrade items for your ship as you level it up, stronger and unique weapons, better engines for faster movement, utility items for tighter movement control and longer boost time, faster energy recharge, larger enrgy pool, force shields etc, and armor upgrades that reduce damage taken and increase your HP.\n\nAs stated in other "reviews", there isn't much going with multiplayer right now, but the game was just released a week ago.

I think I'll be back to playing Yargis by the time I wrote this review.","January 30","true","14.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

It is clearly a homemade game.  If only it controlled like Particle Mace or something, and if shooting seemed more refined, perhaps it could be ok.  The only positives is that the dev seems committed to the game, and has clearly put some effort in it, including a campaign of sorts.  I rather like the level selection by flying to it, but that's it.  It is nothing like games similar to the screencaps & videos you see, but not in a way to differentiate.  (1/5 stars, buy it for trading cards)","May 22","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
