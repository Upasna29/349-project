Now if only someone would bust some bubbles with me..\n\nedit: As a note, if you plan to play multiplayer.. Online Tour Mode is locked which forces both players to finish Tour Mode alone just to play it again together. The only online mode available at the start with is Panic Mode.\n\nKind of a bummer.","April 19","true","1.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"

I really captures the spirit of Pang, the sound and graphics are pretty nice but I came up with flaws that ruined the gaming experience for me.  The smallest baloons are still too big which hinders small manouvers and that "saved by hairlenght" factor. Although there are some good levels, the level design might be better. There are very few levels with ladders (as opposed to previous pang iterations) and this is really shame as the level design tends to be a bit boring and unbalanced - you come a cross a very hard level only to be followed by three or four easy levels in a row. The devs included a bunch of weapons that I find a bit overkill and sometimes even useless, on the other hand, dyinamites are used very seldomly. I wish there was a "retro mode" which would give you only the basic weapons like one spear, double spear, grapling hook and the minigun.\n\nControls are tight and get the job done although I couldn't get my home-made arcade stick to work as it wasnt' recognized. I think the devs should fix that as soon as possible. I hate to use Joy2key to get the job done and this is, in my honest opinion the biggest flaw. But I think it can be easily fixed in the next update.\n\nAfter all, the game is very fun to play and it offers multiplayer which I sadly did not managed to play as I figured there are still very few players actually playing this game. But adding people to steam friends that own the game gets the job done , as the game supports friend invite.\n\nI will give this game a Yes because it's a very unique game  and offers tons of fun , especially in co-op.\n","April 19","true","4.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Maybe not a classic one, but this doesn't mean that i can't be a great one.\n\nI was really skeptical about the new elements added in this games but - surprisingly - they works. I started the game like an grumpy, old man, but they're fun and make the game even more challenging than before.\nThere are bubbles that electrify your sting (and kill you), lava bubble, smoke bubble, timed-explosive bubbles and many more. Being careful to which bubbles you're gonna bust gives to the game a completely new feel. There are also new weapons, like the flamethrower, Boss Fights and some occasional bubble-tower that you have to defend to get extra-points.\n\n\nCouch co-op works fine, unfortunately i haven't tried the online.","April 19","true","5.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","1"

I played Adventures for 30 minutes with a nagging feeling that something was wrong, and that was it.\n\nOther than that, I've got nothing but praises. Grabbed a controller, gave the second one to my brother who was visiting that day, and suddenly we were kids again back in my old bedroom playing on my Amiga 500.\n\n12/10, would nostalgia again.","May 19","true","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Εξακολουθεί να είναι ένα απλοϊκό παιχνίδι μεν, διανθισμένο με μπόλικα νέα στοιχεία δε. Την ίδια στιγμή πρόκειται για μία απ’ τις καλύτερες δουλειές της DotEmu, που έχει κατά καιρούς κατηγορηθεί απ’ το κοινό ότι δε “σέβεται” τους τίτλους με τους οποίους καταπιάνεται. Στην τιμή των €8.99 πιστεύω ότι προσφέρεται ακόμη και για full price αγορά.\n\nPang Adventures is a particularly positive surprise. It still is a simplistic game on its core, but it’s embellished with lots of new elements. Definitely one of the best games DotEmu has offered us. Priced at €8.99 it’s worth even a full price purchase.\n\nhttp://ragequit.gr/reviews/item/pang-adventures-pc-review","May 11","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
