Originally developed for iOS systems, this game is a beautiful time kill for a tiresome after work evening when you'd prefer having some gaming time yet do not necessarily want to be heavy on the attention span.\n\nOur story takes place in a fictional Late Medieval - Early Renaissance period, where people start to leave old superstitions aside for the sake of science, logical thinking and societal progress. The death of the kingdom's benevolent king marks an ill omen for the future though: mysterious disappearances among orphaned children; raids on libraries, ateliers, workshops and academies; assaults on scientists, alchemists and philosophers begin. An ominous cult with the motto "ignorance is power" jeopardizes the promise and knowledge of the new age. Within all this chaos, Marla - a street urchin and a young thief - finds her young brother taken by the cult. With the aid of a swash-buckling mentor, Marla will try to stop conspiracies of the cult and find her brother by all means!\n\nI know, I know... HOGs carry a tendency to reinterpret classical tales, movies or successful video games in their own paces. Here, we have a simplified version of the original Thief game, with a tense dynamic between enlightenment and ignorance, plus political power plays on the side. Nope, that sincerely doesn't make Fall of the New Age a bad game at all. There isn't much depth to it surely, but it’s a fun time kill. You just have to be aware of your expectations about it.\n\nArtworks are alright, with suitably fitting medieval atmospheres and beautiful alchemical designs for puzzles. Character models and 3D animations work fine - even though characters themselves are nothing original. It was also a bonus that the game had somewhat decent voice acting. Esthetically, it is a decent game: not horrible, not spectacular either.\n\nThe gameplay is completely different than what we'd be accustomed to as a HOG. The game carries HOG dynamics - like puzzles, item collection, environment interaction etc. - yet without much HOG gameplay actually. There are 4-5 scenes where you'll be expected to find some random symbols from a list for a password or some items scattered around which can be used as a costume for Marla, in her various disguises. It was refreshing to see a dynamic explanation and use for HOG sequences for the story. A cute and welcoming change, indeed.\n\nThere are some reports for the Mac version not working properly - voice acting missing or item graphics not showing up properly - but I encountered no problems while playing this on Windows 7, so I cannot account for other systems. All in all, grab it on sale for a silent afternoon to have a decent time kill.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","February 14","true","4.8"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","36","37","0","3"

Because it looked a bit like one of those find random objects in a pile of random objects games. But it is not like that at all. I was actually really impressed by this game. I haven't completed it yet, but I think I'm about a fifth of the way through judging by the page I'm up in the in game strategy guide.\n\n(I took down my videos on this game because the soundtrack matched 3rd part content =[... sucks because I really thought that this game was. I may publish new videos without the music turned off)\n\nOkay, I did actually come across a random object mini-game in this title. However it was an hour and a half into the game. The game actually has large variety interesting puzzles and mini-games and that was just one of them. I never found this game to be tedious or repetitive. The puzzles are actually pretty good. Most of them are relatively easy such as just finding the next object needed in the area. But there is a constant flow of them. Some of the stuff was cool. For instance in one part I had to disguise my female character as a male fisherman with a mustache which was amusing. That meant finding and gathering objects which I initially thought were random and then actually assembling them into a costume. I was really surprised to find myself doing that all of a sudden. It was really interesting. Also for a point and click adventure puzzle game it has pretty good features. Even though I hadn't found myself getting stuck for long at any time yet, you can request a hint which will highlight the next place you need to investigate and you can skip some puzzles. Use of hints has a cool down, so it doesn't allow you to rely on having the answers fed to you. Also the actual the in game strategy guide is a written document that explains how to complete every puzzle in the game, it even has highlighted screen shots. I thought thought this really thoughtful, in case you get really stuck. By the way there is actually three different difficulty settings to choose from when you begin the game. In harder difficulty you are unable to use hints as often or at all and interactive areas are not highlighted.\n\nLike I said the game looks like one of those random objects game in the screen shots. But as soon I started playing it things looked a lot better than I expected. It actually has a quite a bit of animation which seems to be devoid in certain random object games. I actually really liked the animations. The fact that there are actual animations when you use objects instead of just fading items in and out during scenes is a really nice touch. The scenes themselves look good. I thought the cut-scenes, characters and dialogue were good and interesting. However as usual with my ten second attention span I didn't really catch all of it. I do like story's premise though, a conspiracy by those in power to keep people in the dark ages. I also enjoyed the music.\n\nThere were a lot of things that I enjoyed about this game. I was very surprised by it. I like how it gives a constant feed of mostly small but interesting puzzles. I liked how instead of having to constantly find random objects for no reason every object you found actually had a purpose and was tool to allow you to solve the next puzzle. I can't say for sure, but I think that you could probably get between five to ten hours of game-play out of this.\n\nClick [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SatanovichZ1/videos]here[/url] for more let’s play videos =)","July 25, 2014","true","1.7"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","1"

A lot of the find-object/use-object tasks felt like the game was holding your hand and they didn't require a lot of thought...the hidden-object portions are ridiculously simple, and could be mostly solved with simple random clicking. Lock-picking amounts to finding the right angle, and holding the mouse there for a second, and then doing it again and again and again... not really difficult. Fully completed in roughly 3-4 hours without using any hints and taking my time.\n\nThe final level of the game isn't actually obvious... you have to complete the story up to the final section, and then the game just abruptly stops with no solid conclusion. You go back to the main menu, and in the Extra's tab that's now open, there is an option to play the game, and that will start the final level... I'm not sure why they did this... I'm counting that as one of the game's more challenging puzzles.\n\nThe game has interesting ideas, but it doesn't really challenge you at all beyond a few specific logic/game puzzles that can be beaten in a few attempts... that, or I've just played far too many of these games, and these puzzles all start to seem the same.\n\nFun if you like these kinds of games, but I would wait for a sale... this is more of a rental or tablet/phone game.","July 27, 2014","true","6.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I have to say Happy Birthday to Coupon Dumpster steam Group.\nI got this game though their birthday giveaway and i am very gratful.\n\nNow To review This game.\nThis game is a novel story type of puzzle game.\nThe game play itself is quite easy. Hints are given for free and there is a strategy guide right on your HUD that you can access at any time if you completely stuck.\nThere are 1-2 pretty hard puzzle but everything else is really easy puzzle or find needle in the haystack type of looking for hidden objects.\n\nThe story is quite well written and interesting but nothing too special is involved.\n\nThe graphics is basic but quite cartoon stunning at times. The character Disguise system is pretty cool.\nThere are a lot short animation and cut scenes in this game but nothing Jaw Droping good.\n\nThe music is basic... infact as i am writing this review i cannot remember much about music at all from this game. There are some at times but nothing worth spending my brain cell remembering.\n\nThere are only 38 reviews for this game at the moment and approval rating is about 60% positve and 40% negative.\nThat rating by itself explain perfectly how this game is scored..\n6/10 for me. And recommended for puzzle game lover only. If you like cartoon graphics..

You also get animated cut-scenes! Everybody loves nice cutscenes. I'm surprised this game is so well priced. It's only 10 dollars for hours of play and awesome art. Like seriously, artists/animators did a great job on this game. If you like point and click just get it because it's pretty damn good. You will like it because how can you not? My only critique is that it ends abruptly which made me go wtf but then you have to select "extras" and it gives you one more arc to play with real ending! But I don't even want to complain because a game of this quality is basically a steal for this price.","August 17, 2014","true","8.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","6"

It is similar to so many others out there in that the story is barebones and the main focus is on finding objects to unlock the next puzzle.\n\nThe story does not go into much depth but as far as I could gather, a cult of some sort has taken over the town and you play a heroine out to rescue her brother who was kidnapped. We do not get any information about the beliefs of the cult or how it came about / where it recruited its members from etc, though there is a brief scene with a strange sorceress at a later point. There is basically no back story to any of the characters, you just land in the middle of it all and off you go to solve the mini puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are lovely and the atmosphere is fitting. The medieval scenes are very pretty indeed.\n\nThe music is pleasant enough and there is one piece with almost Gregorian voices, though that one doesn't last for long and we're back to the blander stuff.\n\nVoice work is fair enough, though I laughed at the voice of a small child in a cage above a fire (perhaps in for a roasting?), who sounded so calm, bored and unemotional and not at all relieved that he was about to be rescued. The player's main ally is an incredibly lazy chap who gives all the hard work and running around to the player (a much younger female), while he relaxes with some wood whittling or a map or simply hangs around outside some castle gates to enjoy the night air.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly very easy and the main challenge is wondering where to go next. Scouring for objects necessary and does take a while. Some of the puzzles are ridiculously easy, like the many many times the player has to pick a lock, but others are slightly more challenging, such as a maths puzzle and a cog wheel. Overall there is a decent balance of puzzles.\n\nThere were very few hidden object scenes and they weren't the traditional type. It was a case of matching objects to shadows. This actually came as a relief as I have started to find standard hidden object scenes tedious in games.\n\nSo I enjoyed the game and it took me about 6 hours to complete. There is a choice of 3 settings at the beginning so I guess playing it on its easiest setting would be faster than 6 hours as there would be no searching for the next object but the player would be lead by sparkles.","October 22, 2015","true","5.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

Still, as a casual level adventure, it has an exciting enough story.\n\nLong version:Fall of the New Age– made by upcoming Ukrainian indie developer Shaman Games– is sort of a lightweight version of the Thief series: you play as a burglar who winds up in a conspiracy devised by the evil Cult against the current power structure and their knowledge-based system in favour of a religious dictatorship. With a mandatory kidnapped relative and a swashbuckling mentor just to complete a few clichés.\nStill, the story is sufficiently exciting and has a good pace, the characters are interesting… and for this price range this is a lot more than anyone can want.\n\nAs for gameplay… well, this one is not really a hidden object game. There are a few segments where you look for symbols, and some rummaging for clothes, but no traditional scenes, at all.\nThere is a larger focus on the point ‘n’ click style elements instead, which, for the most part, gives just enough challenge to turn the game into a nice, casual, lazy, one-afternoon relaxation.","June 24, 2015","true","4.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Instead of inventory items, most of the time what appears in your inventory is a generic tool icon, a placeholder for the actual graphic of the item-- you know, the kind of thing that might exist during game development.  And constantly, and I do mean constantly, there are error logs that appear in the top third of the screen.\n\nIf the game ran perfectly, I'd probably rate it around a 5/10.  There's no voice acting in cut scenes where it seems strange that there's not-- almost like it's another game error, but I assume it has more to do with game budget.  And the puzzles are incredibly simple and without any challenge.  There are hidden object type scenes where you need to pick up almost everything in the scene, so you could get 95% of the objects just by clicking around at everything on the screen.  The idea that you're trying to find items to use as part of a disguise is a pretty ingenious one, but the execution of that idea is badly done, and the "hidden object" part of it needs to be much improved.\n\nI would enjoy the game somewhat, despite it's simplicity, simply because I enjoy these types of games-- but the constant (although not game-breaking) bugs just suck all enjoyment out of the game.  The game does have a little character to it, and the backgrounds and environments are beautifully rendered.  But because of the bugs, I lower my score to a 2/10.","January 15, 2015","false","5.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","3"

I don't know why it has mixed reviews.\nAlthough I do not have sophisticated needs for hidden objects games.\nI loved, and still love, Escape Rosecliff Island and other games from that company.\nAnimations sucks, voice acting is terrible to say least, some textures are weird but all in all gameplay is nice.\nAnd do not mind the plot. It's poor. :P","July 12, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They had some nice ideas for the HOG and the disguises are nice, too. But they didn't do it with heart. For the first disguise you had to work with the pieces. All following disguises were just drag and drop. The faces of the characters were like masks and some of the animations were just wrong. The so called "bonus episode" were just a cut of part of the main episiode. :/ The thing that annoyed me the most is, that the hint button didn't work properly. It guided me to other locations or just told me that I couldn't do anything in the location I was in  - but that was wrong. Lucky me - the walkthrough is included in the game interface.","June 5","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As others have said, it's undoubtedly a HOG- or at least a casual adventure game, since actual hidden object sequences are refreshingly few and far between. It doesn't appear to be made with the same engine as many of the other HOGs on steam, making for some nice little changes to the formula. Another plus is that all the art is original- no collections of cobbled-together photo assets here.\n\nIt starts out with a bang, treating you to a bombastic (for the genre) 3D animated cutscene, then deposits you into a prison cell to escape from as your tutorial, like so many other medieval fantasy games. I'm not ashamed to admit, I was reasonably pumped up to begin playing.\n\nAs I proceeded, however, my enthusiasm began to trickle away. The plot, while fairly generic, seemed decent, but I found myself struggling to get a hold on it, since the storytelling was done EXTREMELY poorly. The localiztion is awful as well- almost all the dialogue is phrased awkwardly or incorrectly, and the characters' grasp on the english language seems to get looser as the game progresses. Furthermore, the subtitles often aren't quite the same as what the characters are saying, and the mouth animations match up worse than a kung-fu dub. Voice acting is acceptable in some cases and hilariously bad in others. The 3D cutscenes are reasonably impressive for a game like this, but the animation is often blocky and goofily exaggerated, and some of the character models look pretty bad.\n\nGameplay is alright, although some (not all) of the puzzles were more obnoxious than I'm used to- I skipped a couple of them. I found myself resorting to the hint button more than normal as well, in part because it was often difficult to tell a small 'active' area apart from the scenery. There are several puzzles that actually require you to write down a sequence of weird symbols to enter into a later combination lock. Sometimes these are recorded into your diary, but that takes up the entire screen when you open it and sometimes even resets puzzles, so you may as well just write them all down. There are some other complaints I had about specific puzzles, but most of them can safely be grouped under the general "obnoxious" gripe I mentioned above.\n\nThe game is rife with tiny quasi-bugs, like expository text popping up at the wrong time. For the most part they can be overlooked, although I was briefly stuck at least twice when the hint button pointed me toward a puzzle that the game wouldn't let me solve because I hadn't yet seen the solution key. The game also crashed once.\nThe biggest issue I ran into, however, was at the end of chapter 4, when you rescue your brother. A small cutscene played, and I was abruptly shunted back to the main menu where a popup told me I had completed the game. I was rather incredulous, since the story really hadn't been wrapped up, even though I did technically accomplish my character's original objective. After checking the bonus features to see if there was any extra bits of gameplay, I chalked it up to more of the bad storytelling I mentioned earlier, and headed to the store page to write a review.\nHowever, right as I began to write, I noticed a couple screenshots in the store slideshow that I had never seen during my playthrough. My belief that I had somehow missed the end of the game reaffirmed, I booted it back up(once again being assured that I had completed the game) and tried pressing "play" again, which finally allowed me to play the final chapter.\n\nWhile the game is definitely not overtly bad, and offers some refreshing differences from many other HOGs on steam, there are unfortunately too many rough patches for me to give this a recommendation. I would, however, like to see more from this studio, hopefully with a little more polish.","June 4","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
