Things like "game sucks" with no reason why, the game looked good and i heavily suspected noob rage for all the downvotes.\n\n---Pro's---\nSo on a good note, most of the negative reviews were just noob ragers. Ive played a few MOBAs and was able to figure out the game pretty quickly, won the only 2 games i played.\n\nthe game DOES have tutorials, i saw one reviewer blatantly lie about this\n\nThe item hero set up is unique and interesting\n\nThe map is decent enough, Que times are very short, games are also pretty quick.\n\nPlays just as well with mouse and keyboard as it does with a control pad, thats an impressive feet imo.\n\na ton of potential "IF" the developer makes some key changes(see the 1st con) and works hard towards a more polished product\n\n---Cons---\nSadly the cons are really really bad. First off the game is VERY pay to win. You can buy in game gold with money, then use that gold to buy massively powerful buffs, or insta rez during a match. You can buy the same buffs with in game earned gold, however if you paid for gold you will have enough to spam the buffs and insta rezs constantly as apossed to a few buys here and there.\n\nThe interface is also terrible, partly becuase it was made to be usable by a control pad, however it was poorly done. The main problem with the interface is that its confusing to look at and know where to find what you want.\n\nOnly 2 cons, its a good game. but the 2 cons are really bad ones. if the game wasnt pay to win i would easily vote yes on recomenndation. The pay to win is pretty bad though, a decent player with enough money can nearly outright buy a win.\n\n-----final thoughts-----\nThe devlopers had a gold mine here, its really honestly a good start to a great game. Sadly they got greedy and ruined the entire thing. Ill be sad to uninstall such a promising game, but the devloper trashed it with P2W.

There is no getting around it, it was designed with touch screens and controllers in mind, not for keyboard and mouse and CERTAINLY not for solo mouse!\nIf you dont have (or are unwilling to use) an xbox controller (or similar) then you can stop reading now and walk away from this game. You will not enjoy it at all!\n\nIts shocking really to have a PC port that wasn't designed for PC in the slightest, but look a little deeper and you can figure out why. Cross platform? yup, you know what that means. Mobile-port, the bane of Steam users everywhere.\nNot helping is the fact that the game is a chinese development team so communication with the dev team is just not going to happen.\n\nThat aside however the game is designed from the bottom up to be casual friendly and in doing so it accidently solved many of the flaws that the more hardcore MOBA games have. I have put years into MOBA type games and by design they are meant to obsfucate new players. This means they have to ask others for help or they have to play with friends. That is the design philosophy behind League of Legends and don't take my word for it as a google search shows many people feel the same way and Riot Games themselves have gone on record to say that is how they intended the game to be.\n\nDefense of the Ancients* was a huge success and League of Legends is a huge commercial success and so every other MOBA just copied what they did and like Flappy Birds, we now have a saturated market. Heroes of Soulcraft is just another MOBA in that ocean of MOBA games however if you have never played a MOBA before this one does everything for you. Well, it doesn't explain what it is doing or why but, well, neither does League of Legends.\n\nNow, to the point, because I could talk about LoL all day but you are curious if this game is for you and the answer is, do you like arcade games? Completely by accident and by virtue of doing everything for you, Heroes has boiled down the MOBA experience to its simplist form and believe it or not, its actually quite fun! Well, with a controller.\n\nBased on the negative reviews I'm not going to lie, I expected an absolute train wreck and if you are looking for flaws then trust me, the game has lots of them! The interface is a mess, a few things that are important to us MOBA players IE how much +speed does this item give? vs that item? are just completely missing, leading you to just guess and if you were wondering, buying from the shop is automatic. Before you flip your desk and walk away however this goes back to my earlier comment "its simplist form" because if you can navigate the bizaare in game menus you can actually pre-define what you buy from the shop and what order you buy it in, per hero! There is also nothing stopping you from turning the option off and manually buying items as well or from buying, during a match, by visiting the shop like most MOBA games.\n\nThey had some fantastic ideas, going into this game and I really think a lot of them were accidental and I wish, I really wish, that LoL will look at some of the things Heroes~ is doing.\n\nIf you want to get into MOBA games but LoL was too complicated for you then this is THE game for you bar none, although I hear Heroes of the Storm is casual friendly too*.\n\nIf you like the other MOBA offerings then there is nothing to see here apart from controller support.\n\nIf you don't know what a MOBA is then give this game a try and see if the genre is for you, although I recommend picking up DOTA or LoL if you do infact like the genre.\n\n*Thanks to Nebulous & Tibbers for corrections.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","July 22, 2015","true","4.2"," 52 of 103 people (50%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","50","52","103","14","4"

It is a fun and easy introduction to the (mostly hard to get into) world of MOBA games. If you always wondered about games like Dota2 or League of Legends but getting into each of them seemed intimidating this is a game for you. Also if you wanted to try MOBA games but prefer to game on a controller this is a game for you as well. The support for mouse and keyboards is not that great since this is a cross-platform game with a mobile game but on the positive side, you can always find someone to play with since there is a lot (a lot) of people playing (and loving) this game on Android.\n\nAll in all, casual and fun MOBA, made for controllers, big in the world of mobile games, despised amongst the hardcore MOBA crowds on Steam.","December 3, 2015","true","1.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

It's a pretty straight forward MOBA with the same standard setup: Unique characters that are fun to play and easy to pickup, 2-lane battlefield with turrets and minion waves (I've only ever seen 2),  complete with small jungles scattered, and a core at the end for you to wack and blast until you win. As a long time MOBA fan who has played most if not all of em', I have alot of fun playing this. Sure, it's not littered with secondary objectives like most others in the genre, but what it lacks in meta game, it makes up for in just pure, pick-up-and-play fun. This, along with the fact that the toxicity and trash talk that you experience in other moba's are non-existent,  makes it accessible to even those new to the genre. Also, while I'm perfectly capable of using a keyboard and mouse, It's nice that you're able to use a controller as well! At the end of the day, you have nothing to lose by trying it for yourself no matter what the reviews say... positive or negative.","July 22, 2015","true","30.1"," 6 of 26 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","6","26","0","0"

While there is a lack of content, the game plays extremely well.\n\nCharacter animations aren't flashy, but truly, they don't really need to be.  They look fine in my opinion.  The control of the game is rather good, playing with a controller for once in a moba besides Smite is a GODSEND.  It is amazing.\n\nI will admit, there isn't truly much to the game, the music truly is kind of dull and sometimes I question if there is music at all, but all things aside, most people play their own music anyway when playing such games, though a soundtrack would have been appreciated.\n\nThe characters are rather interesting to look at, though the diversity is well appreciated.  I have to say, they are fun for what they have.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game, not fantastic, but certainly not terrible.\n\nWould I recommend it?

From now on if a moba lets me use my controller that gives it so much more favor for me, yet the only other one I can think of is Smite but its godawful to play on pc with a controller, since it has absolutely zero help with onscreen controls like this game has. The hud lets you know which buttons to press on screen, you'd have to be an idiot not to understand it (With a controller). After playing my first 2 matches with my controller just fine, won both. There are some cons to the game nonetheless that I hope could get patched later on\n\nCons:\n-The button to teleport back home is the same button to use an item that you just bought, resulting in just plain wasting the item if you accidently press the button 4 damn times without thinking Gaahhh >_<\n-Seperate the button configurations for the above problem for the love of god, I really want to like this game.\n-Controls are "customizable" but not to the point where I can just easily fix the above problem.\n-The item shop that requires this "gold" is a little unorthodox. it can use player gold, or current ingame gold you've accumulated during the game. Not sure if this player gold can be bought with real world money. Gold accumulation is a little on the slow side.\nPros:\n-Works with a controller, hands down my favorite way to play a moba ever.\n\nThis is my first review that I'd ever make, I never thought I'd ever need to make a review but since this game is wrongfully getting alot of hate, I figure I'll share my thoughts.\nI'd rate this game a solid 7 out of 10","July 21, 2015","true","1.0"," 13 of 67 people (19%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","19","13","67","7","4"

But I would cuz it still eats quite alot for such thing\nGame have horrible design, no description, no helper and annoying guides. Everything is so huge but still useless.\nNo proper UI.\nI see that this game was ment to be played on tablets, but many things are bad.\n\nOne and only good part is that you can be assigned to already stated game. It acts like a lobby, So you almost always can play without waiting\n----\nEditing review: played it more trying to figure out many other aspects and now i think that game is actiualy much worse than it was for me before.\nPlayers constantly lagging, if your team loses view poits you almost definetly will lose. Playing hight ranked always drops you with some new guys that constantly dying under enemy tower.\nYou can be dropped in game where view seconds left for you to lose... and you still get lose for this, minus huge rank penalty and 0 coins.\nYour rank as player is actiually counted by wins no matter what (you lose - rank penalty, you win - probably a little plus to your rank).\nAll this alse can be for you oponent to. So game becames fully random. It's just random will you win or lose, will you get normal team member or your oponent, will game lag for you or your oponent.\n\nSo now game review is definetly negative!","August 17, 2015","false","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I gotta say, the SoulCraft series was pretty okay, but i never got to play this one on mobile due to registration errors. Watching this game makes me gonna miss Solstice Arena, since Solstice Arena is going to shut down on august and i played it so much on my phone. But back to the topic, I played this game a bit with my gamepad, on gamepad it feels like it does have good potential, meanwhile it's a total train wreck trying to play this on mouse and keyboard. The graphics looks like it can run well on a potato, im not kidding because it runs more than 500 fps for me on my pc and i have not messed around with the graphics at all. The sound effects are very low quality, something you can expect from a mobile game and trust me there are more games like this on mobile that run a very low quality for a good speaker. The multiplayer itself is okay, but not really a fan of MOBA's here but it really makes other MOBA's look bad. It's not really a good game, but it has its potential.","July 22, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was then given an option to either register the game with Steam or MobileBits. Naturally, I chose Steam. I use Steam for everything. It is love, and it is life. Alas, it simply wouldn't allow me to register. I chose my region, "read" the terms and conditions and agreed to them. I was then given an error message saying that the spelling of my username and/or password was incorrect... This game is clearly busted. I saw the very negative reviews and was still willing to give it a try- I like to try any MOBA I come across... Believe me, the negative reviews for this game are not a bunch of hoaxes.","November 25, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are many cons but the biggest one is the move command which is done by holding the right click  like you are using a touchscreen, so if you stop pressing right click you stop moving and what makes things worse is the fact that in order to attack somene you have to face him and press left click or q which is imbossible with the current touchscreen like controls. Finally the hud takes a lot of space and i haven't actually figuered out how to even manually upgrade my skills. If you are looking for a moba with 15-20 minutes long matches just play Heroes of  SoulCraft  the Storm","July 21, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can say that it's supposed to be "casual" but that doesn't excuse horrible game design and a play model that is based around spending 20 hours bashing your face against a wall to unlock 1 hero and you still don't know how the ♥♥♥♥ to do anything. It's like Adventure Time Battle Party except without the fun quirky characters and easy to learn casual play.

In no way or circumstance can one ever know in full what he is doing. it is as if his inputs are meaningless and the game runs itself. Movement is awkward, as if one has to turn it on and off. Fighting makes no sense; what even is in the damn store? I have no clue.\n\nStill, it's so bad that it's almost good.

Actually I first played it on my android tablet (iPEGA-9700), so you can play it anywhere and anytime with a single account.\n+ Matches can be quick. If you don't want to or don't have time for long matches you can play for 5min or 15 min matches.\n+ Nice variety of heroes (not a lot). This can be good so you can find the ones that suits you faster.\n+ Very accessible. If you're new to MOBAs or just want a lighter experience.\n+ Best played with a Xbox360 controller.\n\n- Terrible Mouse/Keyboard controls. Also I couldn't make x360ce work so just use an Xinput controller.\n- Don't look for nice graphics or animations in here.\n- Music and FX are not the best, but are not horrible.\n- Unbalanced matches (sometimes). Sometime you're team will be full of low level players against really high level players making it totally unfair.\n- Lag, sometimes. This is bad because the game doesn't seem to be complex so no idea why there's lag sometimes.\n\nSo for the big letdowns I'd say the terrbile MKB controls (considering this is a PC port), but probably having a proper configuration would be and advantage over the mobile gamers, so maybe that's the reason (or devs were just lazy).\nBut afterall is a nice ligth MOBA for guys like me that don't have too much time for big MOBAs like Dota2 or LOL and just want to kill some time and have a lightweight MOBA experience.\n\nJust remember to USE an Xbox360 controller.","June 6","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
