I think I saw them on Steam one day and thought to myself "hey cool, submarines!". Before that moment I had very little interest in the subject and even less knowlege. To my understanding: a submarine was just a boat that traveled over and under water with a periscope for looking around. I know now that they are so much more than that.\n\nA submarine is a complicated piece of machinery that is designed to stealthily ambush enemy merchant ships. They are no match for destroyers and dive bombers are a constant nightmare. Above water, in daylight, they are sitting ducks. Underwater they are blind as bats, with only sound to guide their eyes. Most of your torpedoes will be duds, and if enemy war ships become aware of your presence your only hope is to submerge and leave the area quickly; and pray that the depth charges don't sink your boat.\n\nThere is a reason why German u-boats were called "iron coffins". It's because they had the highest casualty rate during WW2.\n\nIn Silent Hunter 4 (wolves of the pacific) you get to play on the American side as a submariner in the pacific theater of the war. With the U-boat Missions addon you can play the German side in the same theater. That expansion updates the game to 1.5, so it is required in order to use a lot of the mods for the game. There is one mod in particular that expands the default German campaign into the Atlantic and North Sea areas; definitely a must if you prefer that side of the conflict. Or just get Silent Hunter 2, 3, or 5 (all u-boat games). Silent Hunter 4 is unique because it's the first game since Silent Hunter 1 that lets players command American subs. Unfortunately Japanese subs are not playable, which would have been a huge bonus.\n\nI think the general consensus of this game is: you will either love it or hate it. I've seen people putting the game down either for some annoying bugs (and they are annoying) or simply because they don't prefer the submarine warfare in the Pacific theater. Personally, I like it. The American subs are unique in their own way, but not completely different from the German u-boats. The threat is still there, but the Pacific Ocean is a vast place. You may find yourself traveling around for what seems an eternity before engaging in any type of action. To me, this is the only drawback of the game. Most of the bugs and failings of the game can be improved with mods, however; and there are plenty of them online.\n\nThe entire Silent Hunter series is great, and every game in the list is a good submarine sim. If you are just looking for an arcade experience and want to jump right into the action, then you can do that. However, if you want an ultra-realistic simulator then turn up the realism settings and dive into the plethora of game-changing mods that are available online. This game is a great entry for anyone even remotely interested in the subject. You won't learn everything about submarine life, but you will walk away with a new found appreciation for it!","August 17, 2015","true","97.0"," 44 of 45 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","44","45","3","1"

I was obsessed with it, played it every waking hour. Read up on Submarines. Watched the six-hour cut of Das Boot twice.\n\nI would describe it to non-submarine nerds as a slow-paced stealth game. Very methodical. You can even calculate the trajectories for your torpedoes yourself, in what becomes perhaps the most compelling educational math game of all time. The game is very narrative, and open world in nature, though said world is almost entirely endless sea. I have hounded Japanese ships off the coast of Alaska, hiding in the fog as I used hit-and-run tactics against no fewer than five enemy destroyers, ever wary of their lumbering shadows in the mist. I have stalked convoys for days on end, slowly whittling down their numbers. I have used daring tactics to great success, narrowly avoiding the avalanche of depth charges from the surface. And I have used safe, time-tested strategies only to find myself sliding into a watery grave.\n\nThe game is tight as ♥♥♥♥.","May 10, 2014","true","6.3"," 48 of 52 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","48","52","3","0"

However, the disparity between vessels, I find, to be not as great as it was in 3. While you've got your very fun low end subs like the S-Boats, you don't have the awesome death-incarnate murder machines like the Type XXI. The Balao is great, but what I'm getting at here is that you don't see the same disparity of performance that you saw in Silent Hunter 3. This is a minor gripe, either way.

SH3 had it's bugs, but at least it was playable. SH4 has more bugs than Florida swamps. Don't buy it, you'll only get frustrated. There have allegedly been 3 patches, but to no effect.\n\nWhen your sub gets damaged, team will randomly decide not to repair it. Which will result in you sink to the bottom of shallow Japanese sea. On other ocassion, damage control team will not repair sub based on your list of priorities to fix. For example, you have flooding, they will continue to repair other stuff, which will again result in you being a nice addition to bottom of the sea.\n\nWhen you try to shoot AA gun, in some positions you will not be able to see coming plane, because your view is how you turn your gun, behind metal fence of conning tower. So you aim your AA gun through steel wall, and it's best to leave it to the crew, which is lousy shoot FYI.\n\nFirst mission in American Career, extreme stupidity. You complete main objective (photo recon of Hiroshima port) and game will not let you know if you're done or not? You sink ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of their warships and merchants, still you're not done. You try to exit map, mission failed.\n\nAnd a little thing to mention is that you have to choose sub type on start of career. So you decide to go with sub that has range of 11.000 km, stationed in Pearl Harbour. First mission, do photo recon of Hiroshima port, which is 8.500 km from your home port. In short, you will probably be on very tight schedule with diesel. You think, ok, I'll take it slowly, try to use electric engine even when out on open see and no enemies, but when you start game, you discover, ♥♥♥♥, there's not command to your crew to calculate "range at speed", so ♥♥♥♥, you don't know what is your fuel consumption and will you be able to get to home port at all. Well, it turns out, I could not.\n\nAnother stupid AI mistake. I'm in middle of enemy port, sinking ships. After I sink their largest destroyer, other war ships stay on position waiting me to get in position and sink them. Stupid!\n\nNext issue, again, I'm in middle of enemy port, surrounded by guns on shore. I was using electric engine and being submerget at this point since I don't want to get shot. Batteries fall to 25%, and your crew reports that, but also decides to surface ship without your command (obviously, AI has been programmed to do this), I did not notice what they are doing, since I was busy taking manual data and manouvering sub around port. Who is idiot who thought that I could not order sub to surface to recharge if needed, but I should be able to take manual data for torpedo solutions.\n\nFinal word, I think steam version does not have patches. Which makes this game unplayable. Don't buy unless you are willing to read 6 year old forum posts for help. I must mention that I'm die hard fan of sub sims, but this will not make me less disappointed. Game is ♥♥♥♥.

IF YOU'D KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT, the 'training' isn't usefull at all, they just put you on a mission and except you to know how to do it, for example, if you choose the navigation training, you just spawn in middle of an ocean with a objective, and that's it. They don't introduce you how to control your Sub at all, they just expect you to learn it yourself. Usually learning yourself is the best way, BUT not here, because there's too many things to learn, it's just impossible. It's hard to sink a ship with torpedoes since your Submarine won't want to agree to turn towards the ship, it's always too late to turn since you've already gone past the ship you're supposed to sink. That's about it, this can be a awesome game, IF i knew how to play it, it does look good, there are alot of different ships, many nations. Even Merchant ships. But it just won't work when i can't control my Sub properly. The AA guns on the deck is easy to use tho, the aiming is kinda bad and zooming in doens't help almost at all, but it still is easy to shoot down enemy Planes. This game has pros and cons, but if it had proper tutorial to navigation and other stuff, I'd most likely love this game.","February 22, 2014","false","1.1"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","3"

One thing that bothers me is that Wolves of the Pacific is only patched to 1.4. In order to get the 1.5 patch, Ubisoft makes you buy the U-boat addon. That is just a money grab. If I wanted to play U-boats I would fall back to SH3.\n\nAt first I thought that the stock game had way to many airplane attacks in career mode. Once I got SD radar, the airplanes are a non factor. The TDC behaves differently in US fleet boats than in German U-boats from SH3. This is modeled well in SH4 to reflect the historic differences in subs.\n\nOverall SH4 is as good as SH3 with one major improvement. SH3 saves did not always load while I have had no trouble loading career saves from SH4.  Generally the seas seam to calm too often. 75% of the time the Pacific has only 2 to 3 ffot waves. Also the Deck gun can easily account for 50 plus tons of sunk ships which is way unrealistic. I did some research of the USS-Drum. That sub was 8th all time in tonnage sunk by a US sub during WWII. It suck approximately 85,000 tons of ships over 13 missions. You can do that in one mission in stock SH4 at 100% realism.\n\nNeedless to say I have modded a few things. Namely, reduced shells for most deck guns from 120 to 24. Otherwise the game is so easy it isn't even fun. I also made it more likely to have dud torpedoes early in the war.\n\nBe sure to sheck out the mods available at subsim.","April 26, 2014","true","204.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No, really. Back to the days of commanding a B-17 squadron, but this time, a Submarine for the US Navy in the Pacific. My first encounter did take sometime. One hour to even find anything, but when I did, I wasn't letting him get away. A Japanese Destroyer, I didn't even check what class from the handy ship encyclopedia they give you for ID'ing ship classes and faction ownership.\n\nThere was a problem though... it was faster than me! I wasn't letting it escape, so I surfaced, manned the gun and fired at it like. 'Yeah! You! Come and fight!' Needless to say, they did. Unfortunately for them, I was a lot more accurate. I hit him twice, causing two fires on his outer section. When he came straight for me, I dived and evaded. It was then he made the fatal mistake of turning east. I had escaped to the West and cut my engines. Twenty minutes passed as I kept a low profile, watching it limp around, looking for me in all the wrong places, but then.... *woosh* 'Torpedo in the water.' ....and another... He tried to turn, cut his speed, but it was too late and my shots were true. A massive explosion rocked the aft of the Japanese destroyer, causing it to slump into the Pacific ocean. The second, smashed into the front, at first, apparently causing little damage, however fifteen seconds later, she was submerged and rolled into a watery grave. A massive explosion erupted a large wave into the air several moments after she went under with all hands on board.\n\n\n\nLove it.

I got hooked on sailing the pacific ocean, stalking my enemy before destroying their ships and forcing them to the bottom of the sea.  Learning how to use the crew, their watch schedule and rotation, and watching them get promoted and recieve awards for their actions was the most satisfying part of this game for me.  Each submarine performs differently and the missions you recieve can have very tense moments that had me sweating.\n\nCONS: This game is not very well optimized and using time acceleration can be very dangerous as enemy ships and planes will appear of out no where and sink your ship. Also, after hours of gameplay all of my save files suddenly became corrupt and I am completely unable to play the game now. I would look into what went wrong, but I am playing other games now.\n\nIf the game had been fixed at some point during it's life then I have no doubt it would be one of the best Submarine games on the market.\n\nIf you are interested in this game, buy it when it is on sale and have fun. Just be warned that there are many problems that may make your experience aggravating.","June 22, 2014","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got hooked on sailing the pacific ocean, stalking my enemy before destroying their ships and forcing them to the bottom of the sea.  Learning how to use the crew, their watch schedule and rotation, and watching them get promoted and recieve awards for their actions was the most satisfying part of this game for me.  Each submarine performs differently and the missions you recieve can have very tense moments that had me sweating.\n\nCONS: This game is not very well optimized and using time acceleration can be very dangerous as enemy ships and planes will appear of out no where and sink your ship. Also, after hours of gameplay all of my save files suddenly became corrupt and I am completely unable to play the game now. I would look into what went wrong, but I am playing other games now.\n\nIf the game had been fixed at some point during it's life then I have no doubt it would be one of the best Submarine games on the market.\n\nIf you are interested in this game, buy it when it is on sale and have fun. Just be warned that there are many problems that may make your experience aggravating.","June 22, 2014","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to say communities still rock for Silent Hunter Wolves of the Pacific, there still needs some more "Polishing" mods out there, but with the overhaul called Trigger Maru, it makes it so much more fun than the normal issues lag when huge fleets like 60+ ships appearing and the like.","April 11","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has no waifus, no real impressive graphics (aside from very pretty water even nearly a decade later) and requires mods and its expansion to really provide an immersive experience. But even Vanilla, the game is a blast. It's hard to recreate the tension I get out of this game, especially when you're really into it. It also focuses on an aspect of World War II usually forgotten by the general public in favor of the more flashy and decisive land battles in the European Theater, or the large scale naval engagements in the South Pacific - the devistating and heroic actions of the men of the Silent Service, the USN's Submariners. And even they are left often ignored, the focus on their German counterparts in the Atlantic instead. When this game gets into you, when you get into that mindset of the wolf amongst the waves, it offers an experience I can say no other game has offered me.","April 11","true","54.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
