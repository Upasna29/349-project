Many other indies would've tried to push this for $15!\n","May 4","true","1.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

My original was a "not recommended", but now that the issues have been addressed and I actually got some play-time in.  The game is not that bad, pretty decent game.\n\n\nReview:\n\nThe East new wolrd is a platformer type of game where you go from stage to stage fighting off enemies and earning jewls and gold to upgrade weapons and buy house items.  So the game can get pretty grindy as you replay the levels.\nThis is kinda alleviated by the character design, they have a charm about it and makes it fun to watch them fight.  Also the armor and weapon appearances change as you upgrade and they are cool-looking, kinda makes you want to keep playing and show-off the gear you have.\n\nI don't really have any major gripes with this game except control support, but the dev is still polishing it up and is becoming quite nice to use.\n\nFrom a hours to price ratio, you'll get your money's worth or at least break-even.  The game is not too much and you will get enjoyment out of it.  But for long-term, that really depends if you like to grind for stuff, it'll take a while.\n\nOverall if you have some spare money give this game a try.","April 26","true","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

It's reminiscent of the platformers from the 90's. I wish that the armor's were good for something other than appearances (If they are, I have yet to see the differences amongst them), but other than that minor thing, I highly recommend this!","May 11","true","55.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Meh. The games okay. The battle systems stupid and a lot of the game machanics are not that great, its stil and okay game. Although, its price is a spot to high for what you get, although I cant complain too much. Its okay.","April 29","true","1.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
