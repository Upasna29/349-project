I do not regret my purchase, Demon crystals is a very fun top-down casual shooter.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that like these kind of games, a must have for your library.\n\nGameplay is fairly simple, you have your WASD to move and LMB to shoot, sadly this is it.  There's no dodging, weapon swapping, or any specials to cast.  Which is why I labeled it as "casual".  All you do is run around in a small-medium sized area shooting enemies and trying not to get hit.  But there are a handful of weapon pickups that augment your gun that shoot in different patterns which is nice.  There are also item pickups that give you special abilities.  All of these are limited and don't last the entire stage.\n\nYou have 4 different characters you can choose from.  They each have their own unique weapon that they use.  The weapons look different, but they all shoot the same except in different colors.\n\nThere are 2 modes, arcade and survival.  In arcade you move from stage to stage.  To do so you have to complete challenges.  How it is set up there are a number of hordes, within each horde you have to finish a specific objective in a given time limit.  So far there are only two types of objectives, "defeat X amount of enemies" and "collect X amount of crystals".  Survival mode is straightforward, you pick a stage, and fight off enemies until you lose all your health.\n\nThere is also local co-op, so you can have a fun time with friends and family.\n\nOne gripe I have with this game is the time limit in arcade mode.  I honestly don't like time limits.  After playing a bit of this mode, I really don't see a point in it.  It would've been much better to defeat X number of hordes in a given stage without being timed, toss some in some super enemies within each horde, before we can move on.\n\nThe game is very fun, from a price to hours ratio, you will get your money's worth.  I feel the game is farily priced for what it is and what it has.\n\nI hope this review helps you decide whether to purchase this game or not.","April 22","true","1.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","16","18","2","7"

It has demon’s and well, crystals which you must collect in order to save the world. It’s a very simple yet fun top down shooter.\n\nGraphics:\n\nEven though the game has a top down view, the game looks gorgeous in my opinion. Colors and the art-style really stands out. There’s something about this type of graphics which really appeals to the eyes. I had no problems with performance in this game and I was constantly getting over a 100 FPS throughout the whole time I played the game.\n\nSound:\n\nMusic is okay, it’s nothing great but it’s not bad as well. I’d say it’s your average sound track. I think the music could be better.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay is your average twin stick shooter. You have 4 characters to choose from at the start and can play the game on normal, hard or nightmare mode. Every character has their own unique weapons so you may want to test them all out and choose the one which suits your playstyle best. Gameplay itself is pretty simple, you use WASD to move around the map and right click to shoot. Where ever your cursor is at in the game the player will shoot there. There’s all sorts of enemies which attack you, zombies, evil trees, skeletons, bats, ghosts etc.\n\nYour goal is to collect crystals and as you collect crystals you also level up. Throughout the levels upgrades and other power ups spawn randomly and you can collect these to make your levels easy. Most of your gun pickups give you different patterns and spreads of your bullets. Levels consist of waves (or Hordes as they’re called in-game) of enemies and you must kill them and collect the crystals. Some levels have you kill a certain number of enemies, so the missions vary from level to level.\n\nThere’s also a survival mode where you have to survive as long as possible. The game can also be played with friends so there’s also the co-op factor which can always be fun. A short video of the gameplay can be found below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695898749\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nSound: 6/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nOverall: 8/10\n\nConclusion:\n\nVery fun twin stick shooter. Graphics are beautiful in my opinion and gameplay is pretty fun as well. If you plan on playing this with friends, you will really enjoy it. I think the price to fun ratio is pretty good in this game, you’ll definitely get your money’s worth.\n","June 2","true","5.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The graphics, as you can see from the screenshots & trailer, are nice & colorful and have a great not-overly-serious whimsicailty to them, and the engine runs beautifully and without hitches.  The action is fast and frantic, with enemies closing in on all sides, big bunches of crystals to collect and plenty of colorful and varied powerups to keep things interesting!  Playing local multiplayer is a blast, and the levels and gameplay hold their own in singleplayer equally as well, which is important to me, since I can be more of a singleplayer gamer for the most part. There are four characters to choose from, and they gain experience through the stages for various actions, which means levelling up, which keeps me happy and coming back!  Control is tight and responsive, both for the gamepad (I use an Xbox 360 myself) or keyboard/mouse.  All said, I recommend without hesitation!  Gotta go now, want to get back to it - it's got that 'one more round' quality that we all know and love.  Give it a try!  Well done, developers!  Cheers!     -XT","April 21","true","0.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"
