Basically the game idea is great but it lacks depth. You put big cities on the map but no offence to Podgorica and Ljubljana those are not big cities come on. Game is interesting the first half an hour but after that has no point. I love the genre you have picked but UIG you invest a little more effort in your games you did the same with farming giant I loved it to a point it's like your creativity is limited. This should be an early access game it needs more investment in it. I am not criticing you just advising you put more effort in these games.I need some competion in the game make some patch addon or something or this game will be forgotten soon.Also loading freezes in the game check that.Price is ok I guess.","August 8, 2015","false","3.4"," 50 of 64 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","50","64","3","3"
