When they got back they had killed 9 people, subdued 5 other people and had a full inventory full of materials, food, water, ammo and fuel... Their stress bar didn't move an inch...\n\n10/10 Would fear my own children over an apocalyptic wasteland again.\n\n\n(UPDATE)\n\nWell jokes aside, i'm really enjoying the game more and more with the updates. I feel that this game will leave its brand in the history of Resource Management games and can become much more...\n\nThat being said, i need to point out that the game is far from perfect.\n\nAs it stands at the moment there is an issue with the Shelter raid that can completelly destroy what you worked so hard for or leave a bad taste in your mouth...\n\nExample: This actually happened and caused me to close the game and delete my save file, only so i could start fresh. At a point in the game, i get a message that someone was coming for us... Ok, so what do i do? I open the workbench and see what traps i can make... Wait, no, i cant make anything because i have been using the materials to upgrade vital systems so i can support my increasing population... Ok, then i let the raiders come in and my guys can just slap them around since i had 2 firearms, some ammo and allot of melee weapons...\n\n1 guy comes in and starts banging on the door with a pickaxe... a single guy... I thought well this is gonna be easy, i got 3 people with 15+ STR and the aforementioned weapons...\n\nThe dude breaks the door, everyone else cowers into a fetal position and start begging for their lives while the dude just waltzes in, heads for the room where my little girls are and kills one of them just like that... then he just leaves and everyone else goes about their business...\n\nThis was total BS and left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nTHIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED!!! If we are attacked we need to be able to fend for ourselves with our weapons, not cower in a corner while psycopath just walks in and kills children unchallenged...\n\nFFS, the girl he killed could have easielly rip his face and shoved it up his ♥♥♥ since she had 13 STR.\n\nDon't get me wrong, despite this situation i still love this game and i will still recomend it but beware if you plan to play it before they fix this since it can really ♥♥♥♥ you off.","August 22, 2015","true","29.2"," 266 of 286 people (93%) found this review helpful 326 people found this review funny","93","266","286","326","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/minera/recommended/356040/","minera","Gravelfoot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/minera/","444 products in account","I have updated this review after I tried the release 1.0 version. My verdict is largely the same.\n\nThe game has definitely improved since my impressions from Early Access, and can, if the developers keep improving it here after release 1.0, in time have enough gameplay to make it fun (not quite there yet). At the moment it has some flaws that makes the game unbearable to play for me.\n\n\nNo in-game pause:\nOne big flaw is the fact that this the inability to pause in-game.\n\nThis is a game about survival where you have to manage a lot of things that constantly degrade and break down and the more people you have and the bigger your shelter gets, the more this will require your attention. Sure, it is no problem at the start, but it quickly becomes a problem. Many of the things require attention fast and especially when a lot of things are happening at once does this problem really show itself. Only way to pause is by going to the options menu where you can't see nor interact with anthing. It is unnecessarily stressing and just makes you frustrated in stead of adding anything to the game.\n\nI cannot for the life of me understand why the game doesn't even pause when you are rearranging the furniture in your shelter. Placing an object one pixel left or right can mean the difference between being able to fit one more object beside it. Either pause while I fiddle with this or give me the option to have objects snap to nearly objects. Rearranging your bunker will quickly take 12-in game hours.\n\n\nAutomation:\nThis brings us to another big flaw in the game: Automation that doesn't really work.\n\nRelease version edit: This has not changed enough. Your people still stand around untill something is 60% bad (60% dehydrated / 60% crapping my pants / etc.). One thing that has changed to the better is, that you can now repair items, while they are being used, so when you repair an item has much less impact on the game -- it has essentially been reduced to a breakdown timer you have to rewind.\n\nYes, you can automate your people, but this is a badly implemented solution since it means full automation or no automation. Your people (when not on automation) will stand still next to a full container of water and die of thirst if you don't select them and click the water. This is mobile game level of gameplay (= bad).\n\nWhat this means is that you either let your people do whatever they please (not a very good idea) or you spend most of the game clicking on people and then a bed, shower, toilet, food, water, etc. just to keep them alive and happy. Automation also means they will stand around and do nothing at all until things are nearly broken before even considering fixing anything. They will not maintain equipment which can be a bit annoying because you have to manually repair everything if you need things at peak condition. Even when on automation, they will just stand still in a bunker that is running out of air while alarms are blaring and suffocate. Move 5 metres and live? No, I'll just stand here and die, thank you.\n\nA fix to this would be to make automation much more fine-grained. If I, for example, could tell everyone to sleep if they are tired (20%/40% or more) and there is a free bed, then I would not have to keep doing boring things. Make auto-sleep/drink/poop/etc. an upgrade, if you really think micromanaging is a good thing when you start a new game. The release version has the automation fixed for everything at 60%.\n\n\nInterface:\nLast thing that makes me not like playing the game is the interface.\n\nYou will most likely play zoomed out since that shows you your entire shelter and let's you see and react to everything, that is going on inside it. Zoomed in (default view mode) is like playing with your face smooshed against the screen. So, it is a good thing that you can zoom out.\n\nProblem is, that if you click the expand button on the selected character, it effectively covers up all of the entrance area of the shelter while zoomed out. The expand button shows their needs, so unless you have every single character on auto (which is a bad idea, as I described above) then you will need this info all the time, Since the game does not let you unselect people, you will have to unexpand the info area, then do whatever you need to do and expand it again after. In a game where time keeps running and you are stressed, this goes from being sligtly inconvenient to rageinducingly annoying.\n\nThe inability to unselect also becomes tiring really really fast once two or more characters are stading close to each other. Select is left mouse button, move is also left mouse button. Want to select that character A standing next to character B, who is in the middle of doing something? Oops, selected B. Ok, try again. Oops, just told B to move to where you clicked. Ok, remove that move job from B's job queue. Try again. Oops, once again told B to move.\n\nThere is an option to cycle through characters in the bunker with Q and E, but if you have more than the starting 4 it really is a clunky way to do it.\n\nUnless people are outside, where there is danger, you almost never use the move command. It is almost exclusively used to move people inside. And even that is not something you need to do very often since they move inside automatically after completing tasks outside. Unless you moved them outside manually and left them there doing nothing, So why left mouse button is overloaded with the move command is anyone's guess. I would call it bad interface design.\n\n\nConclusion:\nIf none of the above things seem like big problems to you, then I think you might enjoy the game. It's a really good idea made by a team that seems to want to make a good game, which is also why I kickstarted the game way back when. For me the flaws outweight the pleasure of playing the game.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nGame has promise, but unless some serious flaws get fixed/design choices are changed (pause, automation, and interface are at the top of the list), I would not recommend this game. If these things get fixed and the gameplay get's fleshed out a bit I think this could be a good game.","December 22, 2015","false","25.4"," 497 of 611 people (81%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","81","497","611","23","25"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vgpurist/recommended/356040/","vgpurist","VG Purist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vgpurist/","172 products in account","Sheltered is a fairly easy game to play.  If you were looking for a hardcore survival game in which every turn could be your last; you may want to look elsewhere. This is recommended to those who just want to relax and explore the world while crafting interesting special items from schematics that you could possibly find out in the wasteland.\n\nAlthough this game is easy, you can still find yourself playing and losing all track of time.\n\nNegatives:\n\nThere are still a few bugs in the game.  One current game breaking bug in which I show in my video below, my expedition team sprite is in the base but they are actually exploring and now they cannot return at all and I have lost my people.\n\nOnce you are in your normal routine this game will become quite mundane quickly.\n\nThere's no real need to upgrade everything in the base right away. As long as you have enough people around to fix the durabilities of whatever needs it, you'll be fine.\n\nNo real story to go on.  You're just tasked to keep up your shelter all the while managing who comes in and out.\n\nYou will find that instead of "surviving" that you're just waiting around for the right amount of materials to craft your next item, which for some uncanny reason you won't find for many many days.\n\nFood and water is trivial and many more items seem worthless (like books and records and stuffed bears) after just a couple of weeks game time.\n\nPositives:\n\nThis game does a good job keeping you playing as there is a ton of cool stuff to craft.  Although some of them are absolutely unneccessary it does add fun factor to the game.\n\nYour party gain experience in their base stats and will level up enabling them to perform their functions better.  This gives a good incentive to keep people around who are good and will only become more overpowered over time.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GpYXrtGW0gM\nOverall:\n\nTruthfully there's nothing wrong with this game... it's just painfully easy. The reason why I am not recommending this game is that it's just a "forgettable" game.  This is one of those times in which I wish I could rate this a 5 out of 10.","March 18","false","23.3"," 151 of 211 people (72%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","72","151","211","14","0"

Everyone got food poisoning and generally had a bad time.\n\nIt's no "This War of Mine", being a much simpler game at heart, but this game is more than I expected and has a LOT of potential, so I'm keen to see how it develops through Early Access. :-D\n\nSide note: On my current playthrough I've got a lot of people in my shelter, but I'm struggling to find food for them all.

I am really glad I decided to pre-purchase the game and support the developers.  While I have only played the game for a little more than hour or so I am impressed with what the developers have done so far.  The game while pretty simple does have many of the game mechanics working.\n\nThe game at first might seem a bit confusing.  I did not even bother with the tutorial, someone mentioned on another review that it was lacking anyway, I figured my first game was going to be a disaster so why not have some fun and dive right in.  It did take me about 15 minutes to figure out what the hell was going on and how to start properly manage my family a little better.  The curve seems high at first but is hardly anything to other games I have played in the past.\n\nEDIT\nI did noticed a couple size scaling bugs and some mouse issues but those are pretty minor in my own opinion for a pre-release game.  I just reset and have not had the issue again. I found a couple more bugs.  I realized I could not name my children and some of their physical attributes could not be changed.  Nothing game breaking.\n\nMy first game I played until I ran out of food.  Granted the first 5 days or so were basically a total waste.  I love the concept of this game.  There is a lot of strategy involved with the decisions you make, which increases the replay factor considerably.  Personally I think what make these types of games so great, the uncertainty of the future.  The game presents quantifiable consequences to almost every decision.  You have one gas mask left.  Your family is down to 4 units of food.  You need a piece of rope to create a trap that will provide food your family needs.  You decide on one last expedition.  You pull out your map.  You choose to go….\n\nEDIT\nWell I went south.  Which was not the best decision.  I ended up coming home empty handed to a house full of sick people.  It turns out your generator is connected to your water supply.  I was kind of curious if there was a purpose other than to provide light.  I was able to explore some more and ended up recruiting a couple people with the idea I would keep my family safe on auto pilot while my new minion militia searched for goods, unprotected of course... I will show them to try and unionize... Anyway, they bring back equipment.  I make the shelter better, and then when they die.  I harvest them to eat.  Now I have all the food I could ever dream of having and once I added another water container I was set.  I began sending 4 minions out at a time.  Finished 2 more rooms, upgraded my water, and air to level 2, added some more amenities, but then ran into another issue.  I think I might need to focus a bit more on the leisure items because my family ended up going insane with all the cannibalism i think and the game ended around day 30.  I am raising my initial review to 18 now... for bringing out the hidden Dahmer in me.   Awesome!!!\n\n18/10","August 4, 2015","true","63.4"," 57 of 68 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","57","68","5","0"

At 200+ days now and I just built 5 plant stations and tore them down right away just to get the achievement. Got my shelter maxed out in space and spend my days painting the walls in different colours.\n\nThere are also some balancing problems, I've had my shelter attacked 4 times, twice the attackers backed down before breaching my doors and the two other attacks ended up in the attackers stealing something, I don't know what it was and their attack did not hinder my progression in any way (some items i guess).

Don't be fooled by the simpler design of this game, as it actually adds a lot to its charm. In the beginning you start out confused and lost as you struggle to keep your family alive and well. Every tiny decision you make, even mild, will somehow matter when that one unit of water could have prevented one of your characters from dying.\n\nWhen you play more, the more you actually learn how you are supposed to do things the right way. Generally I really like the fact that the tutorial is ambiguous, this adds to the fear and confusion of what a real apocalypse would feel like. Intelligent players will enjoy the challenge of figuring things out for themselves, while others may find this annoying.\n\nThe pet feature is one of my favorite aspects with the game, as they add a lot of fun, and can prove to be extremely important in the future. I hope to see different pets added in the future, parrots, turtles, rabbits, and even cows could all have their own odd little perks. Skins on certain animals would also be awesome too, having a black cat, or a pug dog could add to the personalization and attachment to the creature.\n\nCons about this game would mainly lie on the lack of dialogue, and affects of recruiting certain people. Dialogue is often repeated and the same from every character, it would definitely be more interesting to see if what some says depending more on the traits you chose prior. Not to mention the fact that I got bored of the exact same diary entries all the time as they were almost all the same. Adding some diversity would really help enhance this.\n\n-spoiler alert (kind of not really)- Time to address the pink elephant, the cannibal that randomly ends up being completely normal. I'm sure a lot of you have come accross this, you accidentally recruited someone who actually seems super suspicious by saying your family sounds delicious. Well it REALLY is irritating when you find out there is literally no repercussions for this, sure they might eventually leave and mess with something if they start dying from lack of supplies, but so does EVERY other survivor you recruit. Proper repercussions from certain actions would avoid strange conflictions like this. -spoiler end-\n\nI also wish there was another way to defend yourbase other than the reinforcing of the door, or traps. Otherwise they come in and everyone, even courageous people, curl up in a ball and let the intruders take everything, even if said intruders actually is only one person. To be honest there are people who would just get too scared to react, but there are a lot of people who would defend themselves and attack the intruders. Maybe I'm just not doing things right, but it would be nice.\n\nThose are the only things that particularily annoy me, but every game has flaws. The fact that even some people lose sanity over time is interesting, and the amount of details and features put into the game are really just amazing. If you enjoy post apocalyptic games with a wonderful soundtrack, and fun gameplay, then this game is definitely worth the cash.","January 26","true","35.6"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","45","53","5","0"

Your family is in a fallout bunker hence sheltered and this is where you can start playing. The idea is to survive but how you do that it's up to yourself.\n\nGameplay\nYou spend your time in the shelter controlling your family and taking care of their needs, this can also be set to auto pilot. When in your shelter people can approach it asking for refuge or wanting to trade. Then you have the scavenging side of the game, you can send parties of 2 into the wasteland to look for loot. When you do this they leave the shelter area and will radio if there is a problem, if there happens to be a problem in the wasteland (pfft its likely :P) You can take control of the situation which will put you were your scavengers are, these can be from people wanting to kill you, join or trade. With your newly scavenged loot there is a crafting side to the game were you can start decorating your shelter and provide a better life for your family.\n\nFinal Conclusion\nThis game is still in early access, with active devs, they just released an update last week or so with some new items and bug fixes. They have planned on having events when your shelter will be attacked and they were talking about redoing the combat. The game captures the feeling of the apocolypse, referring to the title that happened, she's dead...\n\nPersonal Quote\n"I am your Overseer! Now go clean up my dogs poo and go outside without a gas mask on."\n\nI hate leaving long reviews, I try to keep them short but hopefully this was still informative.\nPlease leave a like/dislike or even comment some constructive advice. Til next time, Bye ya'll.\n\nEdit: Updates are frequent so I've added this section to discuss them.\n\nRecent Update\nSo about recent updates, The UI has been greatly improved and looks a lot cleaner now, your shelter can be attacked by others but nothing too serious. They added quests to the game which is sweet but the variaty of them isn't much, all of them are just collect so much of this item and give me it but the reward can be pretty good and hitman jobs to go kill someone (but I'm sure now that quests are in we can see a lot more of them in future updates.) They added new locations to explore and items to build. The one downfall about the update is that they got rid of the fog of war, which means you can instantly see locations around you instead of just exploring and randomly finding it. People may like it but I preferred the way it was.\n\nAnother update adding more quests(called it!) items and a location, I'll edit this update section of the review to include these details when I have put some time into it\n\nUntil then, Bye ^.^","October 13, 2015","true","54.8"," 53 of 66 people (80%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","80","53","66","30","0"

Passion for the project fades, a tragedy of some kind forces a dev to retire, Internal conflict destroys the startup of the endeavour right from the get-go or the money just gets blown on unnecessary hardware.\n\nWell, and then this happened. This Early Access hit me off-guard like a broadside.\n\nLet me start this on the right note: At the moment you're very much investing in development. The Keymapping is suboptimal and pretty much laid-out for consoles (they even still show the button prompts for XBOX), The playable introduction is threadbare and at the moment there is not really much that you can do. You start with an underground hole with only the barest (and I mean BAREST) essentials and then slowly watch your in-game family die of Radiation poisoning and food spoilage in glorious Pixel-art sprites.\n\nI believe this game will go down the same way as THE MASTERPLAN or Prison Architect went. The first Early Access versions to these to MAGNIFICIENT Indie games with interesting, non-mainstream concepts and well-rounded execution were mere tech demos compared to what Shark Punch and Introversion Software have given us; Complex and detailed simulations with fleshed-out consistent features and LOADS of depth. So, go to the Kickstarter https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/29211325/sheltered/description and look what this game will be, and then decide if you're gonna spend money on ambition.\n\nI did, and I'm hoping you'll do the same.","August 5, 2015","true","1.2"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","41","49","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/recommended/356040/","Borba","Borba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/","1717 products in account","TL:DR at the end, scored 5 / 10 as of 16th April 2016\nBorba likes:Genre - A 2D Indie survival simulation game, with elements of strategy and some RPG mechanics, in which you have to build and maintain your nuclear shelter while keeping your family safe. It provides random elements such as the map, encounters and events, and allows a certain degree of character and shelter customization.\n\nGraphics - Gorgeous retro graphics, characters with interesting and complex animations and a good variety of backgrounds for encounters on the world map are a joy to watch. Even simple details such as the weather effects, graphical changes to the items we upgrade, or being allowed to paint our shelter’s walls add a lot the the game’s mood and post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nMusic - From a melancholic, yet soothing melody, to an active bassy combat tune, the game nails it in the music department, as it benefits both the theme and the mood of the game. It doesn’t feel repetitive, despite not having much variety.\n\nSound - The sound effects, especially ambient ones such as wind and rain, are pleasant and absolutely necessary. Interaction and combat sounds are well designed, although Borba feels that all characters lack some sound effects, in and out of combat, since it breaks the immersion a bit. Some gibberish voices like in The Sims and some “Oof...” and “Argh!” would be a nice addition.\n\nPolish - After several hours of playtime, there was no single crash or major bug, which is a plus. There was a minor bug caused by doing a series of events while in the shelter screen and the time is fast forwarding, resulting in being unable to do anything until escape would be pressed, but that’s a minor issue that may be solved in the future.\nBorba dislikes:Replayability - Although the game seems to be thought out for replayability, the lack of story or lore, the shallow interaction with npcs and the repetitive gameplay mechanics botched it for Borba. After getting the first essential upgrades going, survival becomes trivial, since there is little to do other than wait for a specified amount of resources to get the next upgrades, and this can be achieved with little effort simply by doing trades with NPCs. While the map encounters and the shelter attacks could breathe some challenge into the game, they’re just monotonous and far too easy to deal with, and sadly Borba didn’t get any interesting quest or the new “Family Ties” scenario which grants an additional family member and the opportunity to move to a new shelter.\n\nNarrative - The lack of lore or story do this game more harm than good, since there is little motivation to play once a player learns the basics and manages to reach the point in which it’s impossible to lose, which doesn’t take that much time.\n\nGameplay - The gameplay can be summed up as a point and click time and resource management, with some helpful hotkeys added to the mix. The combat is turn based, while the management phase is real time, allowing players to speed up time at the click of an on-screen button or the press of a key ( shift ). Overall, despite it working well for this type of game, the management becomes far too repetitive and tedious without any real way of automating certain tasks, such as repairing equipment, cleaning the shelter, or eating meat instead of canned goods.\n\nInterface - A simple interface is not always a good interface, but it's still better than an overly complex and cluttered one. Borba did find some issues with its simplicity, though, for example needing to go over each repairable or upgradeable structure again and again as the biggest part of gameplay, instead of being able to automate some of it and / or have a toggleable menu or management screen to allow for interaction with all these structures. It ends up becoming a chore. There is also a nagging ( somewhat personal ) issue with the selected character’s portrait and stats covering the shelter’s entrance.\n\nDesign - Borba has two main issues with the game as it is in its post-release state, namely the base management and the lack of depth. The base management quickly becomes a chore, and it is also the biggest part of the game until players are done with building and upgrading, after which all that remains is the click to repair and click to use gameplay. Characters can have an automation feature on for using the structures that provide for their basic needs, but Borba finds that alone to be insufficient, and believes it should’ve been extended to repairs, harvesting, putting out fires and rebuilding ( animal snares ). The game would then almost play by itself, but that would be due to the lack of depth, as there is little motivation to do anything once players are done with the shelter which, depending on luck and effort, could take a couple of hours. Proper world map events other than repetitive generic encounters, or base events other than the black rain, dust storms and raids, that quickly become irrelevant, would go long ways to improve this game’s value. The raid defense merely consists of hiding the characters while hoping a few traps will deal with the attackers, that is, if they can breach the doors, all in all being a dull event that does not make that much sense, since during the game the characters get weapons, kill bears, wolves and cannibals, but cower away if attacked by a single madman, or a couple of them.\nBorba feels like he should recommend the game on a discount, due to the 5 out of 5 score, and that he would very much like to see the game updated to address the flaws he pointed out, as it has the potential of being a must have game for anyone who enjoys survival simulators. As it stands now, it’s an average game that is very enjoyable during its first hours, but all the excitement quickly fades as we realize there’s little motivation to keep playing or to replay the game after reaching a sustainable shelter. It’s a flawed game that looks good and has some interesting ideas, just don’t buy it for its potential, as you might get disappointed in the long run.\n\n5 / 10","April 15","true","24.7"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","43","56","3","0"

I never have fun playing through it so after about 20 minutes I quit.  It's just a pain in the butt to constantly click on the radio to accept transmissions.  YES, check the stupid building.  You don't need me to tell you to check it because I sent you guys on that particular path to begin with.\n\nAnyway...Sheltered is a family management game set in the post apocalypse future.  For several hours, you will do a few tasks:\n\n1. Send out members to collect resources.\n2. Build crap to better facilitate your family.\n3. Fix crap constantly breaking.\n\nThis is pretty much it for the first 2-3 hours.  Once you get established, raiders will attack your shelter.  I haven't really experience this aspect of the game yet because I get so bored doing the first three activities.  You can also accept quests and trade with other NPC's.  You are really never in any danger of running out of water, it's the food you have to worry about.\n\nI also started with the horse and never got the full use out of it because I could never find enough wood to build a barn in the initial hour of the game.  So the horse starved to death.  Food is VERY scarce early on.  In my humble opinion the two most important buildings to scavenge every 5 days are barn's and homes.  You need that leather, nails and food to progress past the first hour.\n\nIn conclusion, avoid unless you absolutely adore sim type games or you liked This War of Mine. I'm hoping the developer adds some quality of life options such as fullscreen windowed mode and the ability to just accept radio transmissions automatically (I'm serious, it gets extremely tedious).","March 15","false","8.5"," 204 of 332 people (61%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","61","204","332","12","8"

And early access games deserve honest reviews in the state they are in.  This review is for the game it is, not the game it wants to be.  Right now, Mad Games Tycoon, Salt and Dig or Die take up most of my time, all Early Access games which I'd highly recommend.\n\nI want to like it.  I really do.  If you look at my library, I basically play nothing but strategy games.  But at this point, I simply can't recommend it.  Perhaps when things get ironed out.  But it's pretty raw and boring at this point.\n\nTime in game\nI've played the game for about four hours.  A couple of people have said that four hours isn't long enough to give an accurate review which I find to be a non-sensical comment.  You either like the game and give it a fair shot or dont.  Four hours is plenty of time to get used to the UI (which is very clunky and non-intuitive in this game), get an idea of the "realism" the game intends to portray and have an idea whether the game is well put together.\n\nPositive Points. Developer\nThe developer is quick to respond to criticism and throw out ideas, which is good.  He seems pretty down to earth and hopefully will make this a good game.  He's already added many suggestions from the community to make it better.\n\nThe game is meant to look the way it does.  Graphics aren't the focus or priority of the game.  But what it does, it does well.  Environments and character movement are very minimalistic but work well with the game.\n\nThe sound matches the graphcis.  Music is eerie and dramatic.  Sounds sometimes can be annoying, but overall are well done.\n\nThe game certainly has the potential to be an addicting game.\n\nI've noticed very few bugs in the game.  The bugs I can recall have either been fixed or only happened on one occasion.\n\nLack of Tutorial\nThe tutorial is fairly useless at this point.  The tutorial as far as I can tell helps you get in the front door and turn on the power, then ends.  This about 10 seconds of gameplay.  Some screens have hints that tell you the obvious but don't lead you anywhere.\n\nControls\nControlling your people is pretty hard to do at this point, and very counter intuitive.  Nothing is easy when it comes to assigning a task, or moving them here and there.  The characters tend to stand in front of each other, or in front of something you want to access and you have to cycle through them to move them away.  While one menu might want you to right click, then left click, the next menu has you do the opposite or something completely different.\n\nYou have limited space, but the apparent lack of room to place something you need, even though there appears to be a good sized gap to do it is both random and frustrating.  Even reorganizing, there are large swaths of space that appear like they could be used but are blocked.  I was able to fit one extra sleeping bag in after reorganizng.\n\nRepetitive Tasks\nMany tasks need to be completed once startied which is rather annoying.  I tried to add on a room, which as far as I know, only one person at a time can do.  It's a long, long time before it's done, and the person you assign cant break away or you have to restart buidling the room from scratch.  Someone mentioned that you can find tools which speed up your tasks.  This is true, but the speed is not significant.  Something that takes 24 in game hours, which feels as long as it sounds for gameplay, might go down to 22 hours.  At one point, I had a 30 percent decrease in task completion due to finding tools, and it made very little difference.  To some, this might be a balance issue, but to me it feels like a choice. Perhaps this will be addressed in an update.\n\nSomewhat tedious, boring gameplay.  Automation of characters result\nThe game right now is pretty boring.  Send people to the bathroom.  Send them to the shower.  Clean the bucket you're using for a bathroom.  Occasionally you'll have people stop by wanting to trade.  If you have enough water, you can go explore the area.  You're able to place your characters on automation, but if you fast forward to anything important such as completion of a task (a room, for example) takes so long that it forces you to ignore vital indicators from your characters which has a large negative influence on your game.  Placing them on automation also means you can't control when they use the restroom, shower or drink water and eat (all which consume valuable water or food).\n\nThe need for water\nUnfortunately, you're at the mercy of the game to provide water.  When it rains, you get water.  If it doesnt, you wait for it to rain.  Sometimes that takes a long while.  In my opinion, this needs to be changed.  Luck should play some part of a strategy game, but it's far too luck based at this point.   You only are able to store 30 (whatever units) of water, and usually an exploration takes half that. Mabye you can expand how much you can hold later in the game.   Drinking takes 5 each time,  times at least four people.  When it doesnt rain for days, you very quickly run out of it.  And then the waiting game begins....\n\n[[Edit: Someone suggested putting in more water cannisters.  I was up to three in the beginning of the game utilizing all my resources.  It didn't rain for six straight days, and after day two or so I was in the same predicament.  Then, somehow they all died of radiation posioning.  My oxygen filter was good.  The doors weren't left open.  No idea why they all died.  Maybe it was my fault, but without a decent tutorial, I'll never have any idea.]]\n\n[[Edit]]  A recent update made the rains come no longer than four days apart.  This helps, but there still needs to be a way to manufacture water.  Also, the update provided more water from explorations.  This bettered the balance for water but didn't solve the problem.  With more updates like this, it should be a more playable game.  That being said, there are still far too many basic issues that need to be solved before I can change it to recommend.]]\n\nRealism issues\nThe developer wants to stick to realism, as he said in a forum message, but how realistic is it to send your young daughter or son out in a radiation suit to fix a water or oxygen filter?  Or send them alone on an exploration.  Or have them repair a generator or craft a gas mask?  On the forums, someone mentioned that in a post-apocolyptic world, you do what you need to get done.   However, this is supposed to be the story of an average family that finds a fallout shelter.  And it's laughable that these kids have the knowledge to fix complicated devices like water and oxygen systems that filter radiation.  It's also laughalbe that your young daughter goes out on exploration with a strength rating higher than the men and beat men with pipes.\n\nSomeone pointed out in a post that it's also very unrealsitc that you have to repair your sleeping bag, water filters, generator (not adding gas, reparing it), oxygen filter, toilet bucket, shower...everything.....every few days.  If the repairs went quick, it wouldn't be an issue.  But the repair can take you up to a full day if you let them get low, which is easy to do considering the lack of resources you have and the time it takes to do everything else.\n\n\nHopefully this games becomes good.  It's not nearly worth the price I paid at this point.","August 4, 2015","false","4.3"," 480 of 802 people (60%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","60","480","802","34","107"

Anti-rad pills and gas masks are really rare whenever i play, and before you tell me that you can craft 'em, the materials to CRAFT such items are rare aswell! My games pretty much turn into "Sacrifice all the adults so that the 2 kids can live simulator".\n\nI can understand the rareness of rad pills and the masks, (pretty sure people haven't started preparing for the apocalypse JUST yet...) But common, everyday household items? Thats kinda stretching it a bit, and also the fact that a perfectly good gas-mask is utterly destroyed when you go out on 1 expedition...\n\nAgain, I REALLY enjoy the game, i just think these things could be worked on better, Like mabye by making items more common but increasing the amount of items required to craft new shelter items (The showers and such) and mabye making gasmasks last for 2 trips instead of 1, but thats just my opinion.\n\nAnd should the creator of this lovely game read this (Which i doubt) If you make any sort of hanges as listed above, PLEASE don't input them onto the crafting bench upgrades.

Since it's a pre-alpha thing, I hope they add some more features to he game and to improve the tutorial.\n.\n.\nWhen I first started the tutorial, it was helpful, but then after a couple steps you play the real game without any more help. I didn't like that at first, but I learned a lot by myself. What I like a lot abou this game is that there's a lot of things to learn and places to explore on your own and you need to prepare for it.Strategize!  At first glance, I found myself juggling between the 4 family members on who needs water, who's sleep deprived, who needs anti-ratiation medicine, is the dog bowl filled, both kids are starving...all of this hits you at the beginning of your first week of survival and it's really hard to catch up at times, but once you pick yourelf back up, it leads to a lot of productivity to expand your shelter.\n.\nTo add to this game, I would say an Easy/Normal/Hard game mode would be better since the timing of the gameplay actions feel very rushed. The timing of everything is a bit overwhelming at first but you get used to it.\n\nThere's a lot about this game that I like, such as the artwork, exploration, underground expansions, and even recuiting more people to your cause.

Sheltered is a very emotionally involving game.  In many games (if not most) I could care less if my character dies.  Dying is an inconvenience at least and an annoyance at most.  In Sheltered, on the other hand, I really care about what happens to my characters.  They are tough cookies!  At first I thought they would all be dead around Day 6 (they lived until Day 18) but I found the items I was looking for just in time and continued on.  Later in the game my first character died, one of my recruits, in a fight against someone in an area being explored in the Wastelands (the name given to the areas outside the shelter).  I tried running away repeatedly without success and even though I "disarmed" the attacked, he picked up his knife immediately on the next turn, and stabbed my character with it until he died from his injuries.\n\nIn terms of game mechanics, Sheltered is one of very few "crafting" games that I was able to just pick-up and play.  The crafting system is very well covered in the game without any tutorials, although I believe there was a tutorial option that I played through.  Hovering you mouse above any item, even "grayed-out" uncraftable (based on current ability) items reveals what is required to craft the item.  Best of all, the game starts you off with enough items to get crafting some basics right away.  I won't give away any spoilers in my review as 1) it is fun to learn as you go along and 2) you will learn from your experience playing this game.  My very first playthrough lasted 2 hours and was made much better by the in-game "automation" feature you can use for your characters.  Automation makes them automatically do what they need to do (i.e. eat, sleep, drink) without you constantly watching over them.  While occaisionally harsh in terms of how it punishes you for bad decisions, Sheltered is nevertheless one of my favorite "apocalyptic survival management" games.  Recommended if you like challenging yourself occaisionally to see how long you can "make it" in a game situation.  I am pleasantly surprised by the quality and playability of this game.  Recommended.  4/5","November 27, 2015","true","22.3"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/356040/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","Sheltered is a 2D post-apocalyptic survival game in which your objective is to survive for as long as possible. Manage your own shelter and family as they face resource scarcity, diseases, moral dilemmas, stress and trauma. Your family has established themselves in an old bunker and it’s here where you’ll spend your last days on Earth.\n\nGameplay overview:\nBefore going into the game, you get a chance to give your own personal touch to your family, which is constituted by 4 members, 2 adults and 2 children. You can customize their appearance, as well as choose a different trait and set of stats for each. You can also choose to have a pet such as, a snake, a cat or a dog, each one having their own pros and cons. Despite initially choosing a set of stats for your family members, these can be improved by fighting or talking your way out with strangers. You’re also able to recruit more people to your shelter but these will start out by acting automatically in your shelter, you’ll only be able to order them around and send them on expeditions when their loyalty is high enough.\n\nYour initial shelter is pretty basic and lacks most essentials so you’ll need to get your hands to work from the get go. It is vital that you keep an eye on your shelter systems conditions and repair them so that they don’t go bad. Things like the water filter and air filter should always be in good shape in order to prevent disasters. The water filter is particularly important because it allows you to gather water when it rains. However, if it starts raining “black rain”, you have to watch out because your water will get poisoned. There are also other events that might take place on your base, such as dust storms, raids or being approached by traders and people who’re looking for a roof above their heads.\n\nThat said, there are other ways for you to gather water and resources necessary to crafting, upgrading and expanding your shelter. You can send a maximum of 2 of your people away on expeditions by using a radio. There is however two things you must, or should, have when preparing these, enough water to endure the trip (otherwise the game won’t let you) and gas maks to protect yourself from radiation poisoning. On the world map, you’ll be able to set a series of waypoints for your party to go through and you’ll also be able to see various different buildings that you can search, each with certain types of items and resources. Still, you can’t just hoard everything you find because your characters have an inventory limit (as does your shelter), so you should know what you’re looking for and craft bags in order to carry more items.\n\nThe game is divided into two different styles of play. Combat is turn-based and the management part is in real-time, with the option to speed up time. Combat is pretty simple and it plays like most turn-based RPGs out there, attack, defend or try some other special move on the enemy, rinse and repeat. As for the management side, it plays pretty much like a point and click game, select a character and click what you want to interact with. You’ll need to be able to keep up with your shelter needs early on, which include, cleaning, repairing, fueling the generator, and keep your family needs satisfied. This involves a great deal of micromanagement, so depending on your tastes, you’re either going to find it really addictive or really repetitive.\n\nPros:Gorgeous pixel art style\nGreat atmosphere\nHighly replayable\nGreat mix of RPG and management elements\nCons:Journal entries and conversations can get repetitive\nNo storyline\nOverall Sheltered has been a rather amusing and fun experience. From dealing with people trying to force their way into my shelter, to bullying grown ups with my kids, the game has it all. You can even eat your dead family members! Still, I feel like the game could’ve been much more if it focused just a little on story or character interactions. Your family members feel like they’re just part of a big machine and it seems they share no love between them.\n\nIt is the different take on a post-apocalyptic scenario by mixing RPG and real-time management elements that make this game worth checking out.","April 30","true","6.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","1"

If they will add features to the combat system and include factions or organized gangs, this would be close to 10/10 in my books.\n\nReview:\n\nThe premise is a post-apocalyptic world where resources are scarce and the surface is more or less hostile to human life. The art style is pixelated which I personally quite like.\n\nYou start by creating a family of four persons: two parents and two kids. You stumble across a shelter that has some basic equipment in it like a radio, crafting table and a life support system (water and oxygen filter). You can occasionally send an expedition team of max. two persons at a time to explore the surroundings for resources like food, water, crafting materials, weapons etc. You will also need to keep the place clean, because rats will start to appear and they will eat your food. Medicating your survivors in case of radiation poisoning or infection is also vital.\n\nYou can upgrade your shelter with the crafting table and even upgrade the crafting table itself to allow yourself to manufacture more advanced items.\n\nResource management is important, since your survivors need to eat, drink, sleep, shower and go to the toilet every once in a while. Showering and going to the toilet consumes water so the game requires you to plan carefully. Expeditions also require water, the further you want to explore, the more water you will need. You can upgrade the maximum capacity of your water storage by building more reserves. You will also need a pantry to store all the food, the bigger the better.\n\nYou will meet other people in the wasteland. Some will knock on the shelter door, looking to either trade or join your shelter, and some will appear when you are out on an expedition. Recruiting other people can be useful but I wouldn't recommend getting additional people if the shelter supplies are running low. Trading systems doesn't use any kind of currency (like bottlecaps) which is ok for me. Instead items have a certain value (Nail=1, Sand=2, Shotgun=200) and you can trade something in equal of value.\n\nThe combat system is pretty basic, but I wasn't bothered by it too much. My only wish is that the developers would implement some kind of percentage system in the combat. In many situations I wasn't sure if I should stay and fight or just flee. It would be nice to get some odds on my chance to hit or counter an attack. You can improve your character's combat stats (Agility and Strenght) by making a punching bag.\n\nAlso it would be pretty awesome (in my opinion) if the game had gangs or other factions or if you could form a faction of your own.\n\nI'm looking forward to the final version!\n","August 16, 2015","true","10.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","13","13","3","0"

You end up with what should be a post-apocalyptic party survival sim, but instead it becomes a time management game about doing your chores (repairing a number of permanently damaged machines that break down every single day of your life) while trying not to commit a whole bunch of poorly communicated mistakes the game wants you to do. And no content, because Sims games without DLC don't have any.\n\n\nLike Terraria, Sheltered is a game that very much wants you to rely on out of game information to grasp the basic gameplay systems (like the completely unexplained character traits and the very counter-intuitive role that character stats play). In a system of Intelligence-Charisma-Perception-Dexterity-Strength in the context of a post-apocalyptic handyman simulator, you'd expect intelligence and perception plus maybe dexterity to play roles in how well and how swiftly your craftsman repairs the power generator, while charisma might be relevant to keep your survivors surviving sanely as a group (seeing how there's also an Optimism trait). However,\n\nIntelligence = Used in "recruitment" attempts. The higher the number the better the chance you have of recruiting them.\nCharisma = Used in "trade" attempts. The higher the number the better the chance of getting "good" trades with NPCs.\n\nJust why. Why.\n(Because Sheltered has the design complexity of a phone game and we can't have multiple stats interact with each other, nor can we have stats actually do anything meaningful beyond a die roll, that's why.)\n\n\nOtherwise, this game has the most inconsistent control scheme you'll ever see so far. Some menus and screen you exit via the right mouse button, some with escape, some have a close button, some have a close button but it doesn't actually work, and finally some require you to press space and when you instead press escape the game stops accepting further input and you need to reload your save or restart.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a Chore Game, Visceral Cleanup is great (and coop), Papers Please is emotionally powerful, and probably even the cleaning lady sim Sunset has more appeal.\nOn the people management front, the early builds of Prison Architect provided substantially more engaging gameplay than Sheltered can offer, while Rimworld is so much better than all of the competition put together it's not funny.","August 8, 2015","false","2.4"," 114 of 199 people (57%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","57","114","199","19","1"

At the start of the game you start with an oxygen filter, water filter, 1 water storage container, a geiger counter (to see how much radioactivity is in the bunker? just a guess), a radio/map for organizing scavenging/raiding parties and hazmat suits for leaving the bunker to repair the filters and set traps for wildlife as well as a generator and 2 storage containers for food and other resources.\n\nPlayers can use the workbench (also provided at the start) to rearrange the various items around the bunker instantly as well as craft new items (which include everything from gasmasks to toilets;traps for wildlife;showers and beds to name a few) Interaction with the outside world is done in 'expeditions', where players get an overview of the outside world. from this they assign 'waypoints' that survivors travel between, searching for new locations (such as bodies of water, houses or hospitals) to search through as well as finding new survivors to trade with, attack or recruit to join your bunker.\n\nPLEASE NOTE that while I HIGHLY recommend this title, there are a few minor bugs/balance issues that need to be addressed. The largest one i've noticed being that residents seem to get food poisoning EXTREMELY often, Even if you're constantly cleaning. Once that is addressed, I would openly encourage anyone and everyone to try out this title.","August 5, 2015","true","13.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

For example, the value of a satchel is worth less than the nylon and leather required to make it.\n\n2. It would be helpful to see the attributes of characters displayed in the window while setting up an expedition.\n\n3. It seems odd that executing epeditions relies so much on the rain. If you don't have any water you just have to wait around in the shelter. Need more rain or other ways to get water.

Almost all of the interactions happen in your shelter, but you have to send out family members on expeditions to search for useful items.  All family members have various status bars, for hunger, thirst, sleepiness, needing to use the bathroom, and hygiene. They also have status bars for stress and one for trauma.  It's important to balance the needs of the family with the risk of going out and gathering supplies.\n\nThe only time you actually see anything outside your shelter walls is when an expedition encounters any other people while out and about.  Those encounters can result in trading, recruiting new people to your base, or fights.  Fighting is very simplistic - not a lot of nuance, it's mostly choosing to hit the enemy and hopefully kill them before they kill you.\n\nSheltered is an enjoyable addition to the survival game genre, though a little steep in price for the content.\n\nSince I've seen a lot of reviewers do personal scales, and it's helped me a lot to decide what to buy, I put my own here.  I give Sheltered a 3.  Additionally, I usually only give a thumbs up if I got at least two hours of enjoyment out of it for every dollar I spent, and this game did that.  (It wouldn't have if I hadn't bought it on discount, however.)\n\n5: Amazing game, easily worth the full price.\n4: Good game, solid addition to the genre, might want to wait for a discount.\n3: Pretty entertaining game, but some issues.  Buy at a discount unless you love the genre.\n2: More cons than pros, a lot of issues.  Only buy with a strong discount, and only if the game truly sounds like something you'd enjoy.\n1: Don't get this game unless it's free.  Even then, consider spending your time playing something decent.\n\nFor more specific pros and cons, read on.\n\nPros:\nAbility to customize your family is great, especially being able to have same-gender parents, and there are a wide range of skin colors.  It's still rare enough to encounter that in games that I was pleasantly surprised.\nGetting to choose a specific pet with its own unique benefits was also great.\nThe game starts off with the right blend of desperate food/water/fuel searching and trying to find items to upgrade.\nCrafting was well-done - slowly getting the supplies to replace crappy versions of items with better ones.\nThough there are a lot of stock phrases, I like that there are different types of people you run in to/that come visit you.\nI really enjoyed that the kids aren't any worse at doing tasks than the adults.  That made them useful members of the shelter instead of a drain on food.\nI know some people will dislike it, but I enjoyed hunting down the blueprints for the best crafted items.\nThe ability to change the random weakness into a positive (and have the positive change in to a negative if enough bad things happen) was really awesome - I enjoyed the puzzle of figuring out how to change them.  (Never figured it out for my pessimist, though.)\nCons:\nThe graphics.  They'll be a turn-off for a number of people.  Some things are fine - the backgrounds are great, for instance.  But the people and some of the items are so incredibly hard to look at and figure out what they are.  My cat is an orange blob, for instance.  I've played a lot of pixel art games, and this is pretty bad.\nThe difficulty curve starts off great - tough on your first playthrough/your first few days, then gets a bit easier as you get more supplies.  The problem, however, is once you get your base set up and you have a ton of supplies, food, fuel, water.  Almost all survival games have a point where survival itself becomes trivial.  The good ones have something new at that point, someplace new to explore, new fights (or bosses) to take on, new quests.  Sheltered doesn't, really.  You can move on with your family and join a distant relation in a new area, but that doesn't add much.  You start off with tons of supplies you bring with you, and at that point, surviving with 5 people isn't that much worse than surviving with 4, and as far as I could tell, there was no actual difference in the new region versus the old one.\nThe only puzzle in the game with some unique loot is hidden behind a locked door that you can only open if you happened to choose the right pet at the start of the game.  There's no way to change your pet - your only option is to start your game over.  This was incredibly annoying and disappointing - I hate it when game things are locked behind early game choices, especially when there's absolutely no indication this will happen.\nOne of the fighting options, subduing your enemy, is either bugged or just ridiculously difficult to pull off.  There's an achievement for it, so I spent literal hours trying to do it.  Nothing.  This means your only real choice is to kill them or run away.\nI disliked the fact that your family could keep on working even with their sleep bar filled up to the max.  It made the game too easy once I discovered this - aside from a couple of very minor things (training to raise stats), sleepiness affected nothing, unless at least one other bar was also near the max.  (This increases stress, which was negligible with the pet cat.)  I really wish there had been some penalty here - I had one person stay up for 20 days straight.  Additionally, I think being able to send people out on expeditions when they have any bars near max is a bad idea - if it was changed, it would encourage people to switch out teams and make sure they take care of their family.  (Though it'd have to be balanced with people starving and needing to forage for supplies, I suppose.)\nI did enjoy the game.  It was definitely entertaining, especially at the beginning.  I hope they continue to update it and I can come back in a year and be amazed at all the positive changes.","May 1","true","38.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

From the point at which you create your cast, assigning them names and traits, to when they pass away and you have to make the difficult decision of whether to harvest their body just to keep your other members alive… you’ll feel the emotion of the household, and guilt at knowing you perhaps could have done better by them.\n\nSheltered’s downside is that it becomes a little repetitive after a few hours. It’s possible to have your expedition party automatically take care of any encounters out in the wilderness and to semi-automate some actions back in the bunker; but reducing your level of control in this way could result in some unwanted outcomes. I also like to have an end objective and it wasn’t entirely clear whether there was something I should be working towards, or if it was just a case of surviving as long as I possibly could.\n\nSaying that however, this is an addictive title despite still being in early access. I ended up playing for three hours after planning to only spend an hour with Sheltered on my first go, and managed to survive for a total of twenty-four days before I called it quits for the evening. It's just a shame we had to eat the cat.\n\nFull details can be found here:\nhttp://1001up.com/2015/10/16/preview-sheltered/","October 16, 2015","true","3.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's a lot more basic than This War Of Mine, but in some ways I see it as a benefit because the strategy for survival wasn't as difficult in this game. In my opinion, the price is a bit steep for something still in early access, but I honestly don't regret buying it at all.

If you could queue than two actions at a time this problem wouldn't be so bad.\n\nOther than that it's a nice little survival sim so far.","January 29","true","2.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I feel obliged to write one because this really is a great game that deserves support from the community.\n\nIf you're like me, then this is the game you've been waiting for. It's a family-sized vault survival game, similar to FTL in micromanagement and Fallout Shelter iOS app in gameplay. You go out and search for supplies, encountering friendly and dangerous NPCs along the way, all to scavenge stuff to help your family back at the fallout shelter survive. when you have encounters outside the vault, the setting changes to that encounter, which may result in combat, or not, depending on you. I think this is really cool.\n\nYou expand the shelter as you go, building and upgrading new useful things, whilst mainly worrying about food and water. Expansion of the shelter is one of the coolest features, as you get to decide in what order your family's survival priorites are.\n\nThis game is not for babyshit survivalists. This will adequately simulate the hopelessness, desperation, and satisfaction of fallout shelter life. You will get radiation poisoning. You will get food poisoning. You will experience dehydration, starvation, desperation, and elation as you find that little bit of food or water or whatever that will keep your family going for a few more days.\n\nA few features of the game do need a little tweaking at the moment, but that's fine because THE DEVS ARE LISTENING! I know this for a fact because I've personally seen it. The alpha has been released for the best possible reason - to improve an already great game.\n\nOverall, for 15 bucks, this is a great buy. Even in early access, the game is very playable, with no gamebreaking bugs of any kind that I've found. If you enjoy basically anything post-apocalyptic, the novel The Road, or, specifically, the Fallout Shelter iOS app, this game is for you.","August 6, 2015","true","56.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

My son and I go out looking for something... anything\nMy son is attacked by a bandit, and requires medical attention. I kill the bandit.\n\nDay 4: My son dies from Radiation Poisoning, apparently it wasn't a good idea to send him up to fix the Air Filter after all\n\nDay 5: Soon realise his corpse is going nowhere... it stinks in here, the wife is going crazy - my daughter is using up the last of the water in the damn shower. Things are getting a bit crazy.\n\nDay 6: Food is all gone... I wonder what human flesh tastes like...\n\nDay 8: RAIN! We have rain.\n\nDay 10: My wife and daughter are off in search of supplies. Someone is at the bunker door, Lisa is her name. She's joining us... despite the fact we have no food and very little water - even Jasper the cat is about dead.\n\nDay 12: Everyone died.\n\nI don't actually know what happened, I was skipping through time in fast mode and then it said something along the lines of "Everyone's dead, time survived: 12 days". I think this is a bug, as we were mostly still alive.\n\nThis game has promise, I look forward to see it progress in development!\n","August 5, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","6","7","7","0"

For the past year or so (Been a while) I've been waiting for the release of this game since it was announced on kickstarter. This was the first game I ever donated to as far as crowd funding goes and to be quite honest I didn't expect this game to get made. It took a very very long time for this game to reach its goals and I even became afraid it wouldn't. Luckily it surpassed the goal slightly. Now for a game with a budget of $30,000 it turned out quite well. Now was it worth the wait? Sadly I don't think so. Is it an amazing game? Yes, yes it is. Quite honestly I had even forgot I have contributed to the kickstarter untill I heard the announcment of this game (Oh and when it was on greenlight, Which was also my first time using steam greenlight). But Im glad I contributed to this game. I love its simplicity, and its complexity. Its not some easy game that you can pick up and go. In fact its quite dificult, and I like that. Now its time for the moment of truth...\n\nSummary:\nIs this game worth Getting at its current $15 Price point? No\nSadly as Much as I enjoy this game, its just not enough for me to tell people to put this kind of money on it. Now yes it is an early access game but wait till its finished. However, There hasn't been any bugs besides 1 or 2 interface issues from what I have seen\nWho is this game for? This game is for people who have time to sit down for hours and play, and who also enjoy post apoctalyptic survival games.\nWhy no? Because this game is lacking many features that were promised back in June of Last year, Such as Intro story, More in depth character interactions, and even more essential RPG elements. For more info as what I am reffering to just look at the Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/29211325/sheltered/description\nMy Rating (1 - 10):\nIf my cat doesn't stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in my shelter im going to eat it....\nThats my rating, take it as you wish.","August 12, 2015","false","12.5"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","0"

I would not recommend buying this right now. I'm hoping down the road in development the devs will clean it all up. But as of Update 3, it's about as much of a "survival game" as playing dice in a back alley. Except if you are the kind of person that really loves back alley dice, I'd recommend sticking to them.\n\nThere's just silly frustrations like, I have hatchets equipped on a scavenging party of 2 men, I am in DESPERATE need of lumber back at the base, I find a shack that is clearly made of wood, loot it, and come up with zero wood. And this goes on for 30 shacks and houses and then you all finally starve to death. Or how, if a family member dies, you can eat them to survive and everyone loses their mind over it, but if you kill someone in the wastes you just leave the corpse and go home and starve? Like, why can't I chop up every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that attacks me to make dog kibble at the very least? My dog gives zero ♥♥♥♥♥ if he's eating human meat or elk.\n\nThe list goes on and on.

I attribute Sheltered's Early Access performance to its simplistic design but complex mechanics. It has a very indie feel which I dig. There is a LOT of potential that I am looking forward to as the game continues its development.\n\nThe Good\nThe game is a lot of fun. This survival shelter genre will probably be the new hot thing that a lot of devs are going to start to copy. Lets just hope that Sheltered remains top-notch. I really like the pixelized art, the gameplay is suprisingly complex and varied, and there are some tense and hilarious moments throughout the game. I recommend Youtubing the gameplay to see if you like it because a reading a review doesn't do games any justice.\n\nThe Bad\nAs of right now the game is a bit too difficult. The "needs" meter go up too fast and the rate of finding the items you need for your family is too low. I found a few bugs but nothing that couldn't be fixed. The controls can't be changed as of yet so it can be a bit awkward and difficult to micro your units. It was kinda fun figuring out how to do stuff because the tutorial was very lacking. Many people died during my exploration of trying to figure out what I could do and what I couldn't. Don't worry, they were harvested for later.\n\nYour doing great Unicube!

If you are in to the premise, I say buy it -- but not at full price.  Here's why:\n\nSheltered's strength lies in its base premise and the early game execution.  The early game is decent fun, and the tension is right there with real trade-offs: Do you use your supplies to make a mask, or risk radiation?  Do you use your water for a supply run, or hold off?  Which priority do you build first?  Do you let the new person join, knowing they may eventually pay off, or wait until your supplies are better?  There are some frustrations in execution, but overall, these questions feel right for the theme, and Sheltered has you considering them early in the game.  This is probably all the first two to four hours of gameplay.\n\nUnfortunately, it gets weaker from there.  By mid-game, your trade-offs are more tedious, more a question of "what should I build next?" than any real survival concern.  By the late-game (sometime between Day 50 and Day 100), these tedious trade-offs give way to a simple question: "Where the heck do I find ______ to build ______ (that I don't really need)?"  By this point, scarcity of basic needs is not even a thing.  Day in, day out, repeating the same supply runs to the same places.\n\nCertain types of players will still feel some sense of achievement at this point.  There are a few more things to build, you finally get the camper driving, maybe you find some special end-game content.  A prettier shelter, perhaps?  Sadly, most of us will wonder why we persisted past those early, more challenging but more promising times.\n\nIt was hope, I guess.  Somewhat fitting given the theme -- hope of something more kept me going far after Sheltered had any more fun to offer.  It's that same hope that one might imagine kept the Sheltered family going, even after survival became mundane and mechanical.","April 13","true","27.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

First game i got raided pretty early so i thought i would be prepared for that in the next game, altho that happened very late. So i'm guessing those encounters are random from game to game, as to when and how often they happen. And i've only been raided twice, first round they didn't enter, just bashed a bit on the door then left. 2nd time they broke down the doors but got killed by traps and my survivors that was armed.\n\nI've pretty much upgraded everything, might need a single upgrade which i need switches for (hint: if you find switches, SAVE them ;-) That includes finding a lot of blueprints that makes things easier, propably not all the blueprints, but things like the auto pantry that creates food automaticly (1 per 24 hours, per station).\n\nAt this point (170 days survived), i got nothing to achive but find a way to get into the mysterious hatch, which theres a code for, which i can't get as i have a pet cat, and not a goldfish (search this for info, if u wish to unlock the mysterious hatch). My survivors take care of them selfs, i repair, fill up the generator and make feed the cat and clean up once in a while... That's it.\n\nThe difficulty currently, is too easy, i feel like i need a challenge at this point. To start with, i had problems with water, rations and so on, now... not so much...\nFor instance more frequent attacks and perhaps them being better armed could be something that should be implemented.\nAlso the factions i've come across should be harder and hostile, one of them wanted to trade, without me being able to attack or eliminate them, and the area of which they appear in, doesn't change or grow (from my experience).\n\nIt's small things you notice that makes the difference, altho the above mentioned things aren't exactly positive feedback, i still have invested 46 hours into the game at this point, and will invest more. It's not a bad game, it just needs some tweaks here and there :)\n\nSo ofcourse i'll recommend it, but would also hope, that future updates bring more challenge to the game.","May 1","true","82.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Yeah, I'd like to play that for a few hours."\n\nOver 60 hours later, I can tell you, Sheltered is fun. A heck of a lot more than it should be, I guess.\n\nFun, after all, is subjective. I'm not sure how a person would even quantify a game like Sheltered. It is easy, I suppose, to compare Sheltered to other games. But, doing so would be a disservice to Sheltered and the player themself.\n\nSheltered offers the player a lot of fun in various ways seemingly dumbed down by its simplistic graphical form. That is the allure of Sheltered. And, once you're sucked in, well.... You had better Shelter your family.\n\nI have wondered about the design decision to use 16-8k graphics but, now, after playing the game, I see that it fits the game perfectly. This is not some grim experience about some hollowed out basement in which the survivors eat rats and die. hoping for an end to some war that they had no control over. Sheltered is about family that sticks together inspite of all odds. War or not, the Sheltered family prevails. Unless they don't. That is the draw.\n\nUpon the start of a new game, the player will encounter various situtations where they must choose what to do to protect their family. The family is only as important as the player sees them to be, yet, if the player's entire family dies, the game is over.\n\nMost players will decide to protect their family at all costs. This can lead to some strange and heart-breaking choices. A player might ask themself: Who do I most identify with? Who shall I send out to starve, and who shall I save?\n\nAnother reason I enjoy this game is due to what I call the "Memory Aspect". The player must, at least in some part, memorize what materials they are bringing back to the shelter. If the player forgets or overlooks certain needed parts and prioritizes the wrong things, the game can become punishing and unforgiving.\n\nSome might see this as a down-side of Sheltered. I see it as an interesting design choice and conducive to the experience.\n\nWhile there are still many ways in which Sheltered could become better and more refined, I would rate it at no less than 8/10.

You can expand your community by recruiting new members and build a bigger shelter. You weapons will also advance from sticks and pipes, to crowbars and knives, and eventually gun. At some point your characters may die, and it may create emotional impact on you, but there is no time to mourn but harvest the body and put the meat in the fridge.\n\nAlso, enemies can raid your base, and this is the part where I really dislike the game. You can't arm your members with weapons when you get raided so the fights are quite one sided. You can arm traps that are built inside your base, but you can only start arming when the raid started. Aside from that, the shelter is already cramped with all the other items so traps are just gonna make the shelter even more disorangized. Also, there was no instructions on how to arm traps and I spent 10 mins watching my shelter get rekt wondering when I can't arm a shotgun trap when I have ammo (Turns out I need to craft a trip wire too in order to arm the trap).\n\nIt is still a good game though, ate 15 hours straight from me and I am likely to replay it again. This time rushing for police stations and getting all the guns so I can start murdering survivors.\n\nPros:\n-Simple gameplay, low complexity but high depth.\n-Customized characters that you grow attach to.\n-Crafting, with a large amount of items and materials to fiddle with\n-Low graphic entry.\n-Base building.\n\nCons:\n-Half-♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial, quite misleading at late game.\n\nOverall:\nA total recommend from me. Though I do find it dull when you start rushing the speed up button to get your survivors finish scavenging, it does get fun when you add some narrative in there by doing some role playing.","June 2","true","15.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You're going to have to really scavenge and prioritize and use time management properly.  You start out with a tiny shelter with limited supplies, and it becomes apparent very quickly that you're going to need to remedy your water and food issue rather fast, and fuel as well, because if your generator goes down, everything living in your shelter soon will as well.\n\nThe game offers a basic tutorial at the start which is enough to familiarize yourself with the game and controls, after that, it's all up to you.  You can allow new recruits to join, some will become loyal, others will take off and may sabotage your air or water filtration system (bad personal experience in-game lol).  I always enjoy a well-made survival game, and this one is really up there for me for really offering what I need in a survival game, and that's an actual challenge with longevity.","May 11","true","13.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I had found this game a long time ago on Kickstarter and I've been following it ever since, hoping for the day that it'd come out. As of now, I can say I'm glad I was hoping for this.\n\nThe game itself is just what they've been promising a roguelike base and resource manager with the human element and crafting. Being in EA, there's bits and pieces that aren't around, obviously, but currently there's the framework, and it's a pretty good one at that.\n\nThat said, I do currently have some problems with it. The main two that annoy me the most are these. 1, people are doggedly persistant in doing the -first- thing you tell them to, and nothing else. So if you accidently click on the surface, well guess what, the darling idiot you told to do that won't stop for anything (even putting on a radiation suit) until you open the doors and let them up there, and get horribly poisoned in the process. 2, they just don't have any minds to their own, you have to literally control every aspect of what they do. I'd kinda wish they were smart enough to eat or drink when you have the stuff available, instead of standing there and whining.\n\nThis all said, however, the developers seem like good people who listen and take in feedback, and this game literally came out on Steam like a day ago as of writing this. I'm going to give this a good review, because it's good right now, and can only really get better.","August 5, 2015","true","8.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Most important is that the developers are very active and have heads full of new ideas. The game is basically something between FTL and good old Fallout, but it's really *so much more*. Great ambient music, great atmosphere, realistic setting and great features. You really feel like your family is on the verge of "death by wasteland". Survival is the key here, water, oxygen, fuel - you need to carefully maintain all of your shelter's resources.

The raiders that attack your shelter just stop before getting through the front door if you upgrade it and the encounters that happen outside rarely have combat that kills you. All you need to do is make sure you keep enough of the building resources like metal stocked high and upgrade your workshop  instead of upgrading things like the water filter. As soon as you get a good backpack you can gather food to last you for days since you never seem to run out of water becuse it rains too much.\n\nThe game needs to become unforgiving and make resources rarer. If you are used to playing This War of Mine this game should be easier in comparison but both games have a small learning curve to the tricks to getting a self sustaining base.\n\n","March 9","true","18.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was not ready to leave Early Access.  It is not ready to play, and it is absolutely not the "deep and emotional survival management game" it is marketed to be.\n\nIt's not deep.  The challenge still comes down to three tasks - getting a water supply, getting a food supply, and upgrading your expedition gear to maximize equipment income.  Once those are done, the rest of the 'risks' aren't challenges at all; the game boils down to building whatever you can make from your spare supplies, while everyone mills around at home.  Every so often, you'll upgrade your Workbench and get a burst of fun as you discover dozens of new things to build, but you'll only get three workbench upgrades during the whole game.\n\nIt's not emotional.  Your characters seldom interact; they only reply to whatever event just occured, never to each other.  None of the varied personalities you choose from in character creation do anything but form baseline stats - and since you can train rapidly once you have the first workbench upgrade in play, they're effectively identical.  To Sheltered's credit, however, it does offer a large amount of pixellated facial hair.\n\nIt's not about survival - at least, not in the sense that you get to actively make a choice to survive.  Originally, you built a series of Home Alone-esque traps to defend your house, and these attacks came in increasing frequency, adding a sense of urgency and a desire for redundancy for when your home got sacked.  Now, the attacks come months apart - if that.  And you still can't fight back, so it's not about having to do things you don't want to to survive, it's about hoping the RNG doesn't hose you down.\n\nIt's not about management, weirdly enough.

And when you send family members topside to do necessary repairs, each and every command is followed by an immediate wander back inside.  The only automation you get is "yes" or "no", with no prioritization or even distinction between different characters - but since characters don't differ at all, maybe "yes" or "no" is all the distinction we need.  Things will break down, and your family members won't fix them; instead, they'll mill around idly.

It's not that trauma will do terribly much - the satirical game 60 Seconds handles trauma better, and that's a game where you throw cats down a flight of stairs to start.\n\nIf this is Team 17's idea of a deep, complete game, maybe wait on their first patches from here on out before deciding to buy a Team17 game.

Also don't judge this game because it's pixely like because this game is very challanging and the mechanics are in depth. At this stage this game can last you about between 5-15 hours depending on your style of play but if you spent beyond those approximant hours playing then it would be repetitive due to the lack in elements as well as this is an unfinished game. Despite this is an early access game, its definitely worth your money to be immersed in this apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nMessage to developers: An interesting feature to be added to the game is to ruin other people's life, this can be done by starting out with a huge fallout bunker and you have to alter the interactive things inside and the goal is to try to get everybody killed (just like hitman). For instant you deactivate the generater in the bunker to let contaminated air to pollute the bunker as well as stopping water from comming in. Everytime the situation will be different to prevent repetition.","October 3, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Mirroring games such as This War of Mine and even in the more distant past, the Oregon Trail series, Sheltered puts you in the position of moving your family into an underground bunker to toil through the days following the nuclear apocalypse. Even though in Early Access, this game offers a lot already and should hopefully prove to be even more promising as time goes on. Here's a quick run-down:\n\nPROS\n- A whole slew of resources to gather and use toward crafting and survival\n- Many customization options, including expanding your shelter, placing many different craft stations, all the way down to painting the walls and adding some decor\n- Frequent recruitment opportunities to turn your small family group into a formidable fighting force\n- A few quests to enjoy - mainly gathering resources for desperate people or fighting off thugs who try to extort from you\n- A fairly large map to explore\n- An automation feature that lets your shelter dwellers go about their business and take care of their needs so you can pay attention to more important things\n- Many aspects of your shelter to micromanage and tweak (great for the business/management gamers)\n- A leveling system for your characters to increase their stats and become more invaluable to you\n- Decent, turn-based fighting scenarios when your party encounters hostiles\n- Active devs and frequent updates\n- OK price at $15.00\n\nCONS\n- Some bugs, none of which are game breaking from what I've encountered, though annoying\n- Not enough trading opportunities\n- Questionable continuity or end game (as of now, you play forever without a conclusion)\n- The camper van, which you painstakingly have to find parts for to make functional, will disappoint you by how inefficient it is to take on supply runs (guzzles more gas than it's worth)\n- The stats "Trauma" and "Stress" are thus far vague and hard to understand what triggers them and how to reduce these negative stats\n- Somehow, everyone knows how to fix and build anything in your shelter, even the kids. Negative points on realism (but how great would it be if we were all that mechanical - we'd all get some serious s**t done in our lives)\n- Things in your shelter need fixed all the time - perhaps way more often than they should. This should be nerfed a little so it isn't a constant chore\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n- Add more quests or a main campaign storyline to make the game more compelling\n- Have the camper van not chug so much gas to make it worth fixing\n- Trade stations or more trading caravans coming to visit your shelter\n- Shelter defense: How about having your group fend off occasional raids or adding in traps to keep your bunker safe?\n- Additional maps\n- More items to craft and even greater customization\n- Automated shelter doors, so you don't have to always let your group members in manually\n- Include bios, a backstory, and greater stats customization of characters\n\nThus far, the game has been strangely addictive and I look forward to more additions and polishing from the devs at Unicube and Team 17\n\nGrade: 8/10","October 27, 2015","true","45.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Instead of fixing an issue that is keeping people who have bought the game from even playing it, at all, they've added more content that we cant play. Yay! Now they're is even more game I cant access. Would really love if my ability to use my hardware was a priority, but apparently I'm expected to buy a ♥♥♥♥ing gamepad so I can play this game I bought, since unlike every other friggin computer game, EVER, it cant use any other controls. Wish I could get a refund on this. I'd rather buy two packs of smokes then waste my money on this ♥♥♥♥. And I dont smoke. I'm demanding a refund on this game. I feel like I was sold an empty monopoly box, at least then I could've shaken the box to see if anything was in it. Here I was sold a start page with no game.\n\nIf your looking for a similar game, I highly reccommend Life In Bunker. That game is actually playable and I've had no issues with it myself. Sheltered? Havnt even played it yet after a month of trying and 4 months of the dev's not responding to a problem that prevents such action. Clearly they care more about the players they have yet to get, then the ones that have already bought the game.","March 4","false","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reyan62/recommended/356040/","reyan62","Reyan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reyan62/","247 products in account","While this game looks lovely, and the first hour or three were quite enjoyable, the game suffers from some serious balance issues, a lack of depth and/or sufficient content, as well as a lot of minor usability annoyances that add up to spending a lot of time on busy work.  However, I found it was a bit addicting in a bad way; I felt like I just wanted to "win" it, but although every task was easy, it took a ton of real life time, which I regret spending.\n\nDifficulty/Balance:  The game is just way too easy.  During the first few hours of the game, while I was still learning it, I ran out of food once (I remember yelling "I don't want my cat to die!!"), had one family member die of infection due to combat injuries, and had some close calls on water - and then I got a toe hold and figured out what I was doing, and the rest of the game was cakewalk.  I'm finding so much food on my explorations that I'm always out of inventory space.  As soon as I got a couple weapons I can basically one hit kill everything in the game.  By the time I can build the advanced upgrades, I don't need them at all.\n\nContent:  To me, the game feels like it originally had a larger scope, and then got cut back.  For example, there is a "quest" system in the game, but so far (12 hrs, almost fully upgraded) I have only encountered 2 quests, one to kill off a gang that was threatening me (that one was neato), and then one where I just gave a guy some parts, and I guess in return got some different parts, which was super random and not flavorful at all.  There's lots of dialog with NPCs in the game, but it's always basically (1) NPC says something, (2) You pick whether to trade, recruit, or bully them.  Also, there are lots of locations in the game that you can travel to, but you never get to actually see the locations, and each location is little more than an inventory that you can loot.  If this were an early access game, I'd say it looks very promising, but as is the world is monotonous and static.  I'd love to see more quests, more NPC dialog, fewer locations with more variety between them, and just more of a living world.\n\nUsability: While there's no single issue that's a dealbreaker, overall the game is clunky and takes a lot of scrolling and clicking and cross referencing in order to perform all the basic tasks of playing the game, with the end result of having washed out, time consuming game play.  For example, setting up an expedition - one of the most regularly executed tasks in the game - requires filling out basically a many-paged form, in a prescribed order, all in one go, without referencing anything else.  This means if you need to check some piece of info that isn't presented to you on the screen currently, you'll need to abandon the whole thing, check, and then start over.  At a guess, I'd say I have to abandon and start over an average of 3 or 4 times every time I set up an expedition.  Similar issues happen with traders, where once you open the trade window, you cannot close it to check anything, as the trader will then leave, and not all of the information you need is available to you in the window (such as how many of a certain item you have, or what materials you need to upgrade your generator).  Then there's the fact that most events (such as meeting an NPC or trader) just take a reeeeeally long time, doing things like fading in, watching text pop up slowly, waiting for buttons to fade in, clicking through dialog with no choices, etc.  And finally, the UI is just clunky to use.  Scrolling is buggy and laggy feeling and very slow, so scrolling through your massive inventory late game is just exasperating.","May 12","false","12.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"Things go slower without lights." okay...\nDay 5: how many runs do i need for a single lightbulb? i cant keep wasting water.\nDay 6: TRADER WITH A SINGLE LIGHTBULB. and some plastic and wool. more gas masks. sweet.\n\nThis game is early access, 2.5D, and... quiant? the graphics dont feel right somehow. and I've played Lisa, the original mario, and LoZ. they do indeed work and protray what they need to, but they dont feel good.\n\n-This is a survival game, youre always going to need to hunt food, luckily this game includes Snare traps for hunting bunnies and deer who pass by.\n-the best weapon i've found are pipes, (even though someone i recruited had a crowbar and it magically disappeared.)\n-youre always going to need water, luckily you can find bottles, and collect rain water from your filter system, and store in waterbutts.\n-youre going to need more rooms to build ♥♥♥♥. the game does tell you how to make Cement, will occasionally let you find premade cement, and only needs 2 per room. which is fine until you realize you need lightbulbs to make building of items, expansion, and doing things (like showering or pooping) faster.\n-The generator can be temporarily replaced by an Incenerator, which can run off of coal and the tears of your hungry children so you can squeeze out another day of petrol (Remember to turn off the generator while you use the incenerator.) but im sitting on 25 cans of petrol... with 3 cans of food left, no snare traps, plenty of water and 5 hungry people...\n-Places respawn new items after a day or so, due to people moving in and making a base (persumably leaving after i raid them.)\n- Bullies who say "Im here to kick ♥♥♥ and chew bubblegum, luckily im full of chewing gum" and flee with their wife when i decide to kill them.\n- Trader who says "I've got too much stuff and its slowing me down from running from mutants." and then takes a lot more, much heavier items away while i take all of his wires, circuts, and his single, god-given lightbulb.\n","August 11, 2015","true","18.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'll probably play more when it's released.\n\nHere are some ways I think the game could be altered to make it more enjoyable to a gamer like me:\n\nMy biggest complaint and the main reason I've stopped playing is the way items respawn at locations. Why take away from the realism. Respawn water after it rains, but no other items, unless it's to be implied that other survivors are leaving them there after your previous visit.\n\nWhat is supposed to be the logic behind the inability to redirect my expeditions mid-journey? I can tell them to come home go home but nowhere else?\n\nIf the developers haven't played Neo Scavenger I recommend they do so. The same to anyone who likes the idea of this game. I specifically enjoy it's inventory system. Every item has a size, shape, and weight. Some may find it tedious and less appealing to casual gamers, but the realism it adds is worth it in my opinion. Unfortunatly it's loot respawning seems almost as unrealistic as this game's.\n\nThe ability to pause while managing survivors might provide more incentive to build a community. Sometimes  I turn down recruits because my hands are full directing my current population. The resource cost of additional survivors isn't worth it if I have no time to manage them.\n\nI recruit a guy with a baseball bat and somehow he loses it on his way to the shelter? Was he also not carrying any food or water?\n\n(Spoiler)\nI stopped playing after 9 hours mainly because I didn't like the respawing loot system, and secondly because the major limiting factor for extended survival seemed to be making sure I could find enough ingredients to make gas masks (mainly plastic), which became boring. I'm not sure I approve of making gas masks being one time use. (How are gas masks so effective at preventing radiation poisoning anyway?) My strategy became the following: 1)Max out my water capacity (I got it up to 90 with 10 survivors). 2) Send a party of 2 carrying 80 water on a do-or-die mission to return with 2 gas masks or their equivalent in ingredients to allow for a future scavenging mission. They didn't make it. I decided to try to let them handle an encounter without my intervention, which apparently was a bad idea; One was killed. The second escaped, but soon suffered the same fate despite my guidance. In retrospect I guess I could have gone about things differently and been more successful, but I've lost interest in trying again.\n\nEnjoyed the game. Worth the money. Make the loot respawning system more realistic or get rid of it entirely and I may play more.","September 16, 2015","true","22.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But right now it's a click-farm. Keep clicking, get resources, and buy upgrades that let you click more.\n\nIt's fast-developing, and the devs are listening to people - which is normally good. I'm certainly going to check back in again in a few weeks to see how it changes. What I think is going wrong at the moment is that they have taken away some things that the community said were frustrating. In the version I first played, my bunker-family spent ages waiting for rain, and when they were on their last legs it finally rained, but it was poison rain, so they had to wait for it to be slowly filtered while their health was creeping down. Drinking it would have risked radiation poisoning and using up virtually irreplacable meds. The parts to make gas masks were also so rare that I'd be left with choices like everyone can die of hunger, or we could dismantle the water supply so that somebody can make a mask and leave the bunker and find some food. Or maybe recruit somebody else that we can send on a suicide mission into the wasteland without a mask.\n\nBut since the last update, it rains all the time. I think I read that it rains at least once every 4 days. This predictability lets you gamble all the water on long foraging missions. Gas mask parts were a daft limiting factor (IRL you would only need to replace the filters not the whole mask), but now that they are more common it's like there is 1 limiting factor too few. Life is sustainable with the starting furniture, and it gets progressively easier.\n\nI had a similar gripe with Fallout 3. Like in that game once you can recover health and reliably access uncontaminated water and food, half the thrill goes out of it.\n\nEveryone always has an angle on what to do about stuff like this in early access games. They might add gangs or mutants to wear you down from outside, or they might change it round so you start with the good furniture and the game gradually wears it down, or they could give you bigger resource stockpiles and lower usage rates but make the replenishment very unpredictable, or they could put in a loyalty system so that when you add another person to the bunker they can forage for you, but they might also murder you in your bed. They could add in Sims-like interaction between the bunker people so that arguments and fights create some risk. Or they could make it that foraging gradually becomes harder as time passes after the initial fallout and food supplies decay, offset with the radiation/dust lessening.\n\nA unique and odd aspect was you can customise the family. I like a lot of people based them on me, my wife and our kids. But I found that it made me want to not turn the game on if I knew they were all doing okay! It was like "bunker family are okay, let's leave them be rather than logging on and risk watching them starve to death or having to eat the dog".\n\nClicking on people five times a day so they can drink, sleep, eat, wash, poop and mend something is a tedium I haven't experienced since Tamigotchi. I'd have preferred to be able to *stop* them doing things to conserve resources... Water running low? Family meeting. Dog's drinking too much. Bye-bye dog. That sort of thing.\n\nKeep an eye on this game. Wait a bit and see what happens as they are changing it all the time. I'm not sorry I supported it, it is just that as of right now it could still easily follow the community feedback into a route of having tons of new weapons and enemies and other periphera, but still be a click-farm underneath it all.\n","August 21, 2015","true","27.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is one of those games that sounds like such a cool idea on paper, but the way it's done here doesn't really bring it to life.\n\nThe basic premise is good. Imagine FTL, but you're trying to stay alive in a bomb shelter. That should be amazing, right? The catch is that the game should be difficult, and Sheltered is not a difficult game by any stretch. In FTL, you have a goal you need to build up for: the flagship. That game would be substantially less interesting if A: the random encounters were all easy, and B: there was no flagship.\n\nIn the beginning, there are certain things you have to build for your shelter, mostly for storage, but once you've got those down, the game becomes too easy. Supplies are simply too plentiful, and they replenish in the places you scavenge, so as long as you can hold everything you've found, you're golden. In all my playthroughs, I never ran out of food, and once I learned to build a lot of water storage, I never ran out of water.\n\nYou could up the difficulty by getting all the shelter upgrades and then putting 14 people in your shelter, but you don't need them. I didn't need the 7 or 8 that I had as it was, because just keeping up with maintenance and construction only requires 2 or 3 at absolute maximum. The fact that the children you start with can help out so well is kinda broken; basically, just give them a welding torch, and they can fix your water filter.\n\nYou would think that going into the post-apocalyptic wasteland would be a dangerous proposition, but it's not. The very hardest encounters will feature people with guns, but for most of the game, the people you fight are a cinch to beat. Frequently, they're unarmed. Here's how: 2 people with 7+ strength, each with handaxes, and kevlar if you feel like being careful. You'll find kevlar and axes all the time, and what you'll get is a two-man death squad that chews up the worst the wasteland can throw at you, and spit it back out like a paper spitball. Then, on top of that, there are guns and grenades. Basically, if you do a bit of scavenging, and then bother to arm your people, you've got it locked down.\n\nFor a while, maxing out your shelter will be kinda fun, and there is some satisfaction in getting the best stuff, but the difficulty scales so minimally that it doesn't actually matter. The shelter raids were a source of complaint a while back because your people can't fight back (yes, that death squad I mentioned above can only fight if they're out in the wasteland, not if they're defending their children from murder cultists), so all you could do is set traps. But that was useful at least in presenting a threat to players, something you had to prepare for.\n\nAbove all, there's no real end game. You can try and survive as long as you want, but that gets to be boring after about day 10 because it's never actually difficult to begin with, and if you're bothering to get upgrades, nothing you find will set you back.","April 8","false","24.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

First of all, in order to get anything out of your raids, you HAVE to, get this, HAVE to, answer the radio calls. If you do not, they won't bring ANYTHING back. Now, it seems to me as if it wouldn't be a big deal to put in a randomizer that picks out some stuff based on your current needs, so why haven't they done that? The tutorial in itself is laughably bad and tells you almost nothing. And they only sometimes warn you when a radio transmission is incoming, otherwise you have no choice but to pay close attention to the radio.\n\nSecondly, my big strong survivor, who with his trusty dog and axe had taken down many a bear, sat down with his arms around his head and just rocked back and forth crying please don't hurt us, when two women raided my shelter! In what world does that compute? The fact that you aren't given the option to defend your precious possesions just because you're inside the shelter, when there are plenty of weapons lying around, is just ludicrious. Will it make traps obsolete, myeh, pretty much, but there are better ways of balancing things than to make them completely illogical.\n\nFix those issues and this'll turn into a thumbs up.","February 1","false","16.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

One more hour, and two more games later, and I'm in love. I still suck at surviving, though.\n\nSheltered is a $14.99(As of release) post apocalyptic game where you choose four members of a family (2 parents which can be the same sex, and two siblings, which of course, can be of the same sex) and make a go at surviving difficulties such as sparse food, contaminated water, fallout, and yes, even other survivors. Do not fear too much, though. Most survivors you come upon are friendly, and you can even recruit outsiders to work alongside you in your shelter! But don't get so eager. Food is hard to find. Food keeps your survivors energized. They NEED it. They WILL die without it, along with water. You must make every decision carefully as one wrong click can turn a good day into the worst. "Should I talk to these strangers or try to sneak away? They may have good stuff, and I may want to get into that house to scavenge, what do I do!?"\n\nOverall, I say this game has a great price tag, I would probably pay $35, maybe even $40 for it, and it's not even finished!

Its not terrible, but its just not good enough to be considered complete. The raider attacks are currently poorly implemented with your people somehow unable to kick their butts like they do in the wild. Instead they panic, flee and hide behind walls and traps hoping to god they don't get caught while only 5 minutes ago they killed whole groups of people without so much of a scratch. Its a violent shift that breaks any immersion I may have had in my group of hardened survivors. This game needed a few more months, so unfortunately I can't recommend it unless its 50% off for a few hours of fun.","March 20","false","24.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Oh if only this were true! FTL is a true gem of a game, with balanced gameplay and eliciting a constant feeling of imminent peril. It is perhaps the best game ever created.\n\nSheltered is a micromange-heavy grindfest entirely lacking balance. If you can survive the first week or two (which is essentially just a case of storing enough water, and not doing anything really stupid like walking outside without a hazmat suit) it quickly becomes a case of grinding for items without any sense of danger. Admittedly this may not be the case if you select more-balanced attributes for your family, unfortunately I seem to have stumbled upon the over-powered traits almost immediately.\n\nBut there remains hope. There are the makings of a good game here. With just a little work (better balance, more varied content) Sheltered could become a good game. Implementing some sort of long-term effect for the morality choices made by the player could also be very interesting. But as it is, Sheltered does not feel ready for release.\n\nKey critical issues appear below.\n\nMicromanagement:Most of your time is spent micro-managing your survivors: every task except stat restoration must be manually initiated - repairs, training, crafting, tending plants, etc. Even taking medicine or using bandages requires user input. (I have lost count of the number of times an ill or injured family member has died simply because I did not see their negative status, given this mechanic). With small numbers of survivors this microing gets tedious; with larger numbers I expect it becomes impossible. This could be fixed either by improving the automate mechanic to automate these tasks as well, or by allowing the player to instruct a survivor to continually perform a certain type of task whenever they do not have needs to take care of.\n\nAnother big time-sink is inventory management, trying to maximise the items you bring home or purchase in a trade due to limited storage space. This could be improved by adding a colour-coding scheme for inventory management, e.g. colouring the background of an object green if it will take an empty inventory slot, yellow if it will be added to an inventory slot already containing other objects of the same type, and red if there will be no space in the inventory.\n\nGrinding:With strong characters (easily achievable - see balance below) exploring the world is just a case of grinding without thinking: search every location, fight every encounter (at least, those the game lets you - I want the option to kill traders and would-be recruits - in fact anybody!), with no risk to your survivors.\n\nCombat balance:With strong characters, the different options available in combat are rarely required; simply melee each enemy in turn, or empty your clip into them once you have firearms. Steal, subdue, defend all seem underpowered. The early game may require a little caution (just in case you end up outnumbered) and the late game may be very different - I have no idea, I got bored of the grindy mid-game.\n\nAs for getting strong characters, this is also far too easy: simply select Courageous and Troubled for any character you wish to send on expeditions and send them out in pairs, as this will give them two guaranteed (and a third very likely) high-power hits each - none shall stand against this.\n\nInvasions?:In about 32 hours of gameplay and reaching somewhere around day 150, I only suffered one attempted invasion so I cannot even judge this part of the game. However, I did find that the attacker failed to even make it past my two un-upgraded doors...","March 21","false","32.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game did not disappoint.\n\nIt is not as slow as it would seem. You move from problem to problem without relent. There is always something that needs done, and these issues require well-thought-out solutions. You are running low on food and water. Do you send out an expedition in hopes of finding food? Do you expend that water for the chance? Do you got to a place that you looted a while ago in hopes that passing people have left things in the house for less water or do you use a lot of water to search new areas and have a chance of finding a lot or nothing at all? This is not even the tip of the iceburg. It is a much deeper experience than one would think if you put thought into your gameplay.\n\nHow long can you last?

Oh if only this were true! FTL is a true gem of a game, with balanced gameplay and eliciting a constant feeling of imminent peril. It is perhaps the best game ever created.\n\nSheltered is a micromange-heavy grindfest entirely lacking balance. If you can survive the first week or two (which is essentially just a case of storing enough water, and not doing anything really stupid like walking outside without a hazmat suit) it quickly becomes a case of grinding for items without any sense of danger. Admittedly this may not be the case if you select more-balanced attributes for your family, unfortunately I seem to have stumbled upon the over-powered traits almost immediately.\n\nBut there remains hope. There are the makings of a good game here. With just a little work (better balance, more varied content) Sheltered could become a good game. Implementing some sort of long-term effect for the morality choices made by the player could also be very interesting. But as it is, Sheltered does not feel ready for release.\n\nKey critical issues appear below.\n\nMicromanagement:Most of your time is spent micro-managing your survivors: every task except stat restoration must be manually initiated - repairs, training, crafting, tending plants, etc. Even taking medicine or using bandages requires user input. (I have lost count of the number of times an ill or injured family member has died simply because I did not see their negative status, given this mechanic). With small numbers of survivors this microing gets tedious; with larger numbers I expect it becomes impossible. This could be fixed either by improving the automate mechanic to automate these tasks as well, or by allowing the player to instruct a survivor to continually perform a certain type of task whenever they do not have needs to take care of.\n\nAnother big time-sink is inventory management, trying to maximise the items you bring home or purchase in a trade due to limited storage space. This could be improved by adding a colour-coding scheme for inventory management, e.g. colouring the background of an object green if it will take an empty inventory slot, yellow if it will be added to an inventory slot already containing other objects of the same type, and red if there will be no space in the inventory.\n\nGrinding:With strong characters (easily achievable - see balance below) exploring the world is just a case of grinding without thinking: search every location, fight every encounter (at least, those the game lets you - I want the option to kill traders and would-be recruits - in fact anybody!), with no risk to your survivors.\n\nCombat balance:With strong characters, the different options available in combat are rarely required; simply melee each enemy in turn, or empty your clip into them once you have firearms. Steal, subdue, defend all seem underpowered. The early game may require a little caution (just in case you end up outnumbered) and the late game may be very different - I have no idea, I got bored of the grindy mid-game.\n\nAs for getting strong characters, this is also far too easy: simply select Courageous and Troubled for any character you wish to send on expeditions and send them out in pairs, as this will give them two guaranteed (and a third very likely) high-power hits each - none shall stand against this.\n\nInvasions?:In about 32 hours of gameplay and reaching somewhere around day 150, I only suffered one attempted invasion so I cannot even judge this part of the game. However, I did find that the attacker failed to even make it past my two un-upgraded doors...","March 21","false","32.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

What is completely unforgiveable however is the fact that every single attempt I've tried to make to get this game working or to contact them has been met with complete failure.  It took them five days to respond to my original email, with what amounted to a form answer "Did you unplug your controller?"  "Did you verify your steam cache?"\n\nOf course, if they'd actually read my original email they'd know that I DIDNT HAVE a controller plugged in.\n\nSo when I replied to that form letter saying that there was no controler and the steam verification didn't help I got to wait another EIGHT DAYS for a response saying essentially that since my problem wasn't something being experienced by many people, they'd get back to me when they figured it out.\n\nThat was a month ago.  Do you think I've heard a response from them in the last month?\n\nNope.\n\nThe company is s**t.

This isn't much of an issue except... You can't change the keybinds at all. While this isn't a huge issue it is a bit inconvenient.\n\nMoving on to character creation:\nIt's alright nothing special, nothing worth mentioning. I really do not like the fact that you CANNOT set your own stats instead you have to use presets which are mostly heavily one sided towards a specific skill.\n\nGameplay:\n\nTutorial- the tutorial really needs a big overhaul to cover the controls, objectives, how to feed and shower your characters and pretty much anything you would need to know to play.\n\nGoals and Direction- The game while not linear in any way does a very poor job in guiding you to do anything at all, it's a lot of micromanagment and a lot of unexplained stuff that you have to just guess at. Playing this for the first hour may leave you frustrated.\n\nOverall- Overall excluding all the issues the gameplay is pretty straight forward. Your goal is to survive that is it so good luck.\n\nConclusion:\nI didn't enjoy this game at all and unfortunately I think this game will need a lot of work to be worth the price. Yes it's only $15 but I've seen a lot of other games that may warrant your $15 more so than this. This is only my opinion though and maybe I'm being a bit hard on this game, but the issues I'm posing are still real issues that need addressing and I believe the developer should consider overhauling a large portion of the game and make it easier for the player to actually interact with and explore the world.

Exploring the map looks like a lot of fun. However, there are some major issues that keep me from recommending it.\n\nBiggest flaw is the user experience. Controlling the characters is a pain. If you have characters with the same hair color, it's very confusing to tell who is currently selected because everyone more or less looks the same in the portrait. You can click to move the person to that location, but if you want to move them again you have to cancel their current action in their queue. I mis-clicked so many times just trying to figure out this system. I felt out of control over characters that needed CONSTANT MICROMANAGING. Thankfully, there is an auto feature that lets residents take care of their needs, but just selecting someone was such a pain. But if I need to be selecting these people a lot, selecting them should be much, much easier.\n\nOne of the central challenges of the game is that your equipment breaks down over time, and quickly. But none of it repairs quickly. So most of your time is spent repairing things, which is to say, you have someone stand there for hours. No challenge to it, it's just annoying. I spent more time watching a loading bar fill than worrying about food or water. Not how a survival game should be.\n\nIt has great art, a good premise, clearly a lot of love and time went into it. I did enjoy my playthrough, I just can't see myself ever playing it more.","September 26, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I've been able to plough through hours on end simply because the game never leaves you without an urgent task to perform, and it is extremely well balanced.\n\nMy favourite aspect is probably the fact that you don't need the same survivors that you start the game with to continue playing, because providing there are still survivors (even if they're relatively new) the story continues with them.\n\nStrongly, strongly reccomend if you enjoy indie games, survival games, management games, retro games, simulation games...

I've been able to plough through hours on end simply because the game never leaves you without an urgent task to perform, and it is extremely well balanced.\n\nMy favourite aspect is probably the fact that you don't need the same survivors that you start the game with to continue playing, because providing there are still survivors (even if they're relatively new) the story continues with them.\n\nStrongly, strongly reccomend if you enjoy indie games, survival games, management games, retro games, simulation games...

I still am excited about this game but in it's current state I cannot reccomend it. There is a ton of promise but right now there are too many things that need to be fixed. Still, this is an alpha release so hopefully, with some community feedback, all of these problems will be addressed for the final release. I'll of course update this review as the game is updated.\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful astetics and pixel art\n\nCons:\n- Tutorial does not teach the game. The learning curve is far too steep making the game frustrating and confusing to play\n- Unintuitive controls. This is a mouse driven game... but the mouse does different things in different menus? Sometimes you need to right click, sometimes left click and it's seldom clear what is what...\n- Bugs. There are bugs especially if you run the game full screen. The click boxes on the menu screen does not scale with resolution.\n- Boring gameplay. It may be due to lack of features but the gameplay right now is rather boring and repetitive.\n- Hidden Mechanics. It is very hard to determine the mechanics of the game so strategic playing is not possible. For instance, if you don't run the generator your water isn't filtered. That makes sense but there's no indication in the game that water and power are linked. I had to determine that through trial and error.\n- Features are missing. Some things  promised in the Kickstarter (or shown in the Kickstarter) have not et been added and it's unknown if they will be added in the future.","August 5, 2015","false","5.2"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

Don't have a pair of strong combatants? At some point while scavaging you will be killed. Don't have the resources to upgrade your shelter? You'll run out of food/air/water very quickly.\n\nTheres just alot of balence issue that make the game more of a grind then a challenge. While I don't mind challenging, having to wait for it to rain and hope its not 'black rain' to get a reliable water source is not fun. Nore is needing to don a hazmat suit every time I need to go topside to repair the air or water filter and build snare traps for food.\n\nThe game tries to be realistic, but fails on balence of events and fun. My first attempt my survivours got radition poisoning on their first scavenge, while those that stayed home got food poisoning.\n\nAs it stands right now, its only really worth it if you buy while on sale and enjoy the survival game genre.

Sheltered has all of those things. I am a big fan of "This War of Mine" and, of course, the mobile game "Fallout Shelter", which this game strongly reminds me of - in a good way. It's not like a rip-off, but more like a strongly improved version with its own features and art style. Speaking of that, the art style, of course, is rather "special" and I was required to get used to it first, because I don't like minecraftish pixel graphics. But within the first 15 minutes of the game I already began to like it.\n\nNow, the first and most important feature about this game (besides the fact that it's pretty much the only one of its kind), is its realism. The building feels realistic (there are tons of different lootable resources which are required for the several in-game structures), the people's needs are realistic (water, food, rest, toilet, psychical and physical health), the loot isn't completely random, but based on locations (such as scrap yards having lots of metal or gas staions having lots of fuel)...\n\nThe second great feature is the difficulty. I restarted at least 10 times until I finally understood what I need to do, which structures are the most important ones, how I keep everyone alive... there is radiation, there are fights during your scavenge runs, there are raids and fires and, the scariest thing of them all: there is hunger. And it's really challenging to handle all this at once. In fact, there are already so many features, that some developers would have already sold it as a finished product. But this is Early Access. And the devs keep us updated and even answer in the forums. I can only imagine what great things are going to be added yet.\n\nThe only not-so-good thing is the fact, that the endgame is quite limited yet. The shelter is limited to 3 floors and you can't keep more than 14 people at once (otherwise the oxygen level will be not sufficient), and once you have built everything, it will become a little uninteresting. It took me 16 hours to get to this point. But the good thing is, that all locations are randomized every time, so you could just start a new game.\n\nIn short: this game is a very great and unique post-apocalyptic shelter management game with a high focus on realism and tons of potential. I'd say that this game in it's current state is already easily worth the price they ask for, and once they have added all planned features, this is going to be totally awesome.","January 2","true","17.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

I got 4 shotgun traps, all armed. I hid my kid behind a fake wall (WHERE SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE!). Raiders broke through the doors, guess what happened:\n\n1. my kid (who was hidden a floor down) got into a fight with raiders BEFORE the passed the traps, alone. She killed one but the second one she couldn't handle. Worst of all, the raiders were invisible so I could not see what weapon they had. You cannot run from these fights, you can only defend or attack, until you die. If you happen to kill 1 raider, you will have to battle the next and so on. You also CANNOT choose who they battle.\n\n2. Someone else from my team then had to fight, in these fights you cannot run and you have to fight. Even if you win that fight, you have to battle the next and the next until you're dead. Another one killed by an invisible raider.\n\n3. Then dad had to fight. What was pretty strange, CAUSE HE WAS OUT ON AN EXPEDITION MILES AWAY!!!\n\n4. Ok, killed the raiders so I'm done now? NO!

This means you will always have to send your primary adult (first character) on a mission first otherwise you cant send anyone. Then after that it goes down the oldest character list for who goes next. Additionally your 'party size' will ALWAYS be 1, because there is no means to add a second person into the party. By the way, just because you completed a mission doesnt mean your loot will stay. When you transfer it you run the risk of it being deposited into some unaccessable infinite void instead of your storage.\n\nI fail to understand how Steam keeps 'Green Lighting' games that are far beyond even pre-alpha stage and flooding the marketplace with game content that is little more than a title screen and deceptive trailer.","August 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","5"

Exploring in the early stages can be rough but is something you must do to stay alive.

Sometimes it wouldn't even scroll the view at all! I found myself wrestling with the camera more often than actually getting things done.

Prepare to start over quite a few times through circumstances you can't avoid.\n\nYou need to be lucky enough to find the right material in the right amounts, while hoping that nothing bad happens to anyone.\n\nRain can be very unpredicatble. Some times you can wait days and only receive enough to fill 20 or 30 water even with an upgraded filter. This can leave you unable to leave your shelter to continue to collect other items leading to a spiral of defeat.\n\nSometimes you get random people that join you beyond your starting family of 4. These people will do absolutely nothing but consume resources for at least 20-30 minutes of real time. After an eternity of waiting on them to eat and drink their bloody fill, they'll finally go on expeditions. Once you run out of gas masks, and if they get radiation sickness, then you have 2 options. Use the pills or let them die. If you kick them out of the shelter before they die, they get angry and ruin your buildings.\n\nYou can get attacked by bandits and at the point of this writing, you cannot do anything except hide from them.\n\nYou can build Hiding Spots.

Unfortunately, in Sheltered as opposed to TWOM you have to micromanage your characters to a ridiculous point (like the Sims). It's still in development and there is a lot to say about what it could become but it is very difficult to become to get into it when I have to manually tell characters when to using the 'bathroom' or take a sip of water. This becomes worse when the hunger/sleep/bathroom/shower trackers fill quickly. (The shower meter is full after 2 days. I don't think people are TOO worried about showers in the apocalypse, or at least not for quite awhile) Basically right now there are these character micromanagement details that are distracting me from actually managing the bunker/larger character choices.","December 28, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Was not a matter of surival or anything, 4 ppl doing nothing on the shelter,65 rations on storage, and the cat died of hunger.

It gives you a true suvival experience where food and water is always an issue. People will die, you will eat them.\n\nIt seems similar to fallout shelter at first glance, but really is not like it. Fallout Shelter is all about constant progression, its not a challenging game just a fun one. This game proves to be difficult and remain that way. You will make many morale decisions and is not for the lighthearted. The main thing I liked about this game was you ARE constantly progressing and unlocking things, but basic survival always remains an issue, it doesnt get to the point where you have a massive stock and its never a concern (at least not for a while)\n\nPros:\n- Challenging, and remains that way.\n- Very dark, it feels realistic for a survival game\n- Somewhat detailed\n\nCons:\n- Interaction between characters is mostly nonexistent, people don't argue or fall in love or question your morale decisions\n- Combat is stale, random events seem to end roughly the same. Run, recuit, or trade. Ive never died from combat and I've seeked it out frequently\n- Other than food/water your base is safe. No random attacks or traders trying to trick you\n- People you recuit ACT like they might try to return and raid your vault, but they never attempt to decieve you\n- Managing people can be annoying when you have a lot, telling them to do EVERY basic action from sleeping to using the bathroom. I understand letting them do it freely could waste resources, but a feature could be added to mark toilets to "free use" or something where people auto use them whent he bar fills up\n\n\nOverall, the survival aspects are very solid. Other than some slightly clunyky controls, the biggest drawback is the lack of ionteraction between players. It would be nice to have to analyze what people say and determine if they are trustworthy, or ever just interaction between your vault members. Such as the morale implications of eating a dead child causing certain people to leave, etc. With not having to focus on that, and most people being the same, the experience can seem stale at times.\n\n\nAnother idea: raiding other shelters could be fun and rewarding.","August 13, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would really like to see more things that you could build, because after playing for nine hours, the many shelters that I made look pretty much the same. Maybe in the future there could be more decorative things to build? Like something to make the shelter feel more like a home, and some furniture such as a sofa or maybe a painting you could make. Maybe the pet could have more use? Like you could take the pet with you when you explore, and maybe craft items for the dog or cat like a gas mask. I LOVE how the game looks, however I did encounter a few bugs. For example, one time I sent one of the kids out so I opened ONE of the doors and she walked past the other door, even though it was closed. Also one more thing that I think should be in this game, when one of my people die "accidentally", when I "take care of their body" I don't have a stove but their remains are cooked? Maybe the people could get food poisoning from raw food? And maybe there could be a selection screen where you could pick the food that is actually cooked? I do recommend this game to anyone just wanting to get a game to pass the time and I do think the game is worth the 15 bucks, it just needs a little more content and then it would be perfect.","August 15, 2015","true","41.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am very excited to see it develop over time (and hope it will).\n\nThe atmosphere and mechanics are great, permadeath deletes your save slot, the genre is a combination of the sims and cannibalism in 2d. You craft the familiar crop of gear, furniture and traps for your family's survival, alongside some cool machinery for your fort like a recycling plant and an indoor plant nursery. People offer to join your fort or attack you in the wilderness, and you can choose to confront or try to escape tough situations.\n\nBONUS 1: the wood and pipe resources are also weapons\nBONUS 2: family members drag bodies outside and bury them\n\nThe obvious things to expect in terms of improvements in the coming versions are probably the RPG and encounter depth, the combat system and maybe tweaks to control of the survivors' daily life. It seems like the gear is well balanced, except for the fuel system. There's too much fuel in the game, the generator uses very little, and the unit price is high. This tiny flaw along with the high price of records, bears and tools, makes the money aspect of trading less interesting. Instead, the availability of goods dictates the progress in certain stages, which is interesting in itself.\n\nThere is an immense amount of micromanagement in the game, especially when the fort becomes more populated, and that is sometimes great and sometimes a little tedious. Sometimes I would have four people in grave conditions idling about and one more available for work, but you can only queue two chores at a time and automode makes the survivors do dumb things like drink the last of the water tank when others are in more need, or eat from the spacious pantry instead of the maxed out freezer. Trauma right now is barely noticable even as you dig graves and bury your family members.\n\nSo all in all great game that holds a promise, I hope that similar to games like Prison Architect, The Long Dark and Rebuild 3 it would continue to grow and develop over time even after v1.0.\n\nI would love it more if it had:\n====================\n\n1. More uses for attributes (INT, STR etc) indoors and outdoors and more rpg depth in the encounters, with more than one scene per encounter\n2. Global control menu - I want to be able to tweak the automatic behavior of the fort globally - switch on / off the toilet when there's no water for instance, guide survivors to eat meat.\n3. Moar Traits - I don't want to say steal a feature, but in the game Pixel Pirate some actions can be learned and trigger automatically as a charecter levels up. In Sheltered I'm thinking pooping automatically, learning to clean up after yourself, wanting to fix stuff when you're idle, healing survivors, reading books.\n4. Characters interacting in game - If you've played This War of Mine, there's a lot of emphasis there about the tolls of hiding in. Contradictory traits leading to arguments and fights, cabin fever and trauma can play a part in the simulation and add a lot to the atmosphere and gameplay.\n5. Cooperation - if we have sims mechanics, charecters should also be able to do things with and for each other:  cook for several people, high INT help traumatized or dress wounds, digging a new room together.\n6. Names - more diverse name generator in the game, I had three Lindas at one point :)\n7. A queue of three or five actions at a time, and survivors can wait for someone to finish using the toilet (maybe get some stress)\n\nThat's it.

A tip a well though, as the tutorial requires work, the Home button makes characters automatically do what they need to; eat, sleep, drink, etc. And as of now, its a bit of a tedious venture to be honest. I'm hopeful though, that with time and effort the developers can produce more and more that you can do within the confines of what is left of the civilized world.\n\nOne more problem.

You will need to manage your precious resources, expand your shelter, build what few comforts you can, explore your surroundings, trade, recruit, and kill to survive as long as possible.\n\nCurrently the game is still in Early Access but you will quickly see that the dev team is very involved and regularly adding in new updates. So if there is a mechanic you hate, or one you would like to see implemented its not too late to bring it up. Also having bought into many an Early Access title I too have been burned more than once by a dev team that got in over their heads or decided to cut and run. I don't get that impression from these guys, so if your hesitant about buying into a game that is still in Early Access out of fear of getting an unfinished game that will never get completed, don't worry about it with Sheltered. Its pretty clear that these folks have every intention of finishing what they have started.\n\nNow yes there are a few bugs and minor issues. nothing that is game breaking that I've encountered so far. Just some things that won't close when you click on them so you have to hit esc. Things like that. And considering they just did an update this morning, I can see they are still adding in content and fixing bugs. And new content is always fun.\n\nAll in all yes I recommend this. Its fun, and addictive. The team appears to be very dedicated. There is a small learning curve and the tutorial needs some work. But after you play around with things for you first couple families, you'll have it down and will be expanding from a family into a post-apocalyptic, underground, community.","August 11, 2015","true","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good on you devs.\n\n=============================================================\n\nSame as the other negative reviews. The game has potential. But it's filled with small, annoying and sometimes game ruining instances of developer oversight. Some examples.\n\nWater being wasted on expeditions when they SUCCESFULLY END. Such as  the expidition getting good loot on its first location. So you recall. And lose 90% of the water.\n\nIrreplacable pets. Really? There are no stray dogs/cats/wild horses left in the world?\n\nNumerous others.\n\nToo much micro managment. The inablity to set up routines of any kind for anyone. After a while it gets stupidly tiresome going though the day to day repairs, when I should just be able to have "daily maintence" as a chore. But instead I have to navigate the nonexistant UI to acomplish anything.\n\nMy ♥♥♥♥ing battle hardened serial killers that I unleashed upon the surface and that have literally killed ♥♥♥♥ing hundreds COWER IN FEAR AS TWO PEOPLE IN ♥♥♥♥ING KHAKIS INVADED MY HOME AND KILLED THEM WITH PICKAXES.\n\nI'm more impressed that this is even possible.

Prepare to start over quite a few times through circumstances you can't avoid.\n\nYou need to be lucky enough to find the right material in the right amounts, while hoping that nothing bad happens to anyone.\n\nRain can be very unpredicatble. Some times you can wait days and only receive enough to fill 20 or 30 water even with an upgraded filter. This can leave you unable to leave your shelter to continue to collect other items leading to a spiral of defeat.\n\nSometimes you get random people that join you beyond your starting family of 4. These people will do absolutely nothing but consume resources for at least 20-30 minutes of real time. After an eternity of waiting on them to eat and drink their bloody fill, they'll finally go on expeditions. Once you run out of gas masks, and if they get radiation sickness, then you have 2 options. Use the pills or let them die. If you kick them out of the shelter before they die, they get angry and ruin your buildings.\n\nYou can get attacked by bandits and at the point of this writing, you cannot do anything except hide from them.\n\nYou can build Hiding Spots. It can be difficult to find enough hinges for every person you have.\n\nAll the items you need to be more efficient come at workbench level 3 and 4 and it can be quite tough to get to that point.\n\nIn this, you're relying on a lot of RNG, and not all that much strategy.","January 31","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"Feed me, NOW humans."\n\nGiven it's an early access game bugs are being expected. Hope the dev team could fix the glitch that if you have a  member build a 3rd floor basement room BESIDE a workbench for some reason the construction will get "stuck". The member will finish building the ladder but never start to dig through the room. Nor can other member resume the unfinished room.\n\nOther than that the game runs perfectly and is pretty addictive I played 10 hours in a row.\n\nA few  suggestions that makes lazy players even happier: Give players other options to fight off intruders other than making traps.\nGive a toggle option like "Search all loations you stumbled across, without contacting base"\nGive option to dispose corpes directly so they don't have to go into the freezer first...\nHave a "quick access menu" on the side like "feed the pet" some times the pet bowl is kind of hard to select since it's tiny and my base is pretty dark and stuffed","February 1","true","37.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If a character has a courageous trait, they should be able to stand up and fight, instead of huddling in the corner.

I have created, lost and (sometimes) purposefully destroyed several families and innocent passer-bys in relentless pursuit of MORE STUFF!  No house, school or farm is safe from my raiding parties (sometimes a lone child...!).  The replayability is great and I love how the world is generated at every new game.

The developers are very quick and efficient at getting back to you on any bug reports you make. So far I've seen fast fixes and lots of interraction with the community, definitely a positive sign of whats to come.\n\nOf course right now there are some minor issues to be ironed out, but overall it's certainly playable. Any bugs experienced can be reported and members have found ways to "fix" some of the bugs whilst ingame so you can still continue to play. I definitely believe it's worth the price of $16.99 as it stands. It's exciting to see updates to improve the game and anticipating new features.\n\nIt's very difficult to begin with and you're likely to have some failed run throughs. Just go with the flow and test things out, let yourself make mistakes and it'll help you improve your next game. Its very addictive to go through family after family mixing and matching traits and personalities, seeing what suits you best.\n\nEveryone has their own way of managing their shelter, some wipe out the innocent children while others protect them at all costs. Water and Food are important components and you need to be thoughtful of every action you do, some can have terrible consequences. Its far too easy to become attached to one of the family members just to have them die. Dad Daderson will never be forgotten. He was a true hero who sacrificed himself to let the kids survive because I forgot to add fuel to the generator and radiation seeped in.\n\nSo far I've made it past Day 100 with all four family members and their cat intact and very much alive. They have even welcomed one stranger into their home. The household is still going stong and it will be heartbreaking when one of them finally does die. I've spent way too many hours playing this and many other games. Its a challenge for yourself to see how many days you can last. I've set the challenge to keep all my family members intact. I did plan to kill off the kids once but I couldn't face sending little Timmy out into the world without his gas mask.\n\n10/10 would buy this game again.","August 8, 2015","true","42.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, the time to go to the toilet is a bit stupid, like half a day, same with showering. When you only have room for one of each and all your family is desperate to use the toilet this can be a major issue. This is the same with sleeping, it isn't easy to get more room for the sheltered and sleeping bags take up a lot of room.\n\nAlso I don't understand why people can go on expidtions with oinly a gas mask, but if they want to do work up top above the shelter they must wear a full hazmat suit.\n\nAnyway whatch my video for a better look at the current game:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVNMy6jeq50","August 8, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And now Im here to give my opinion and suggestions. First of all finding food is WAY too easy, I mean please by day 30 I had over 100 food lower the food-finding chances, please. Not being a cry-baby but please lower the chances. Second, raids tell me how many raids did any of you guys have? Well i got raided ONCE in 150 days. In my opinion the raid chances should be higher so the game is more challenging. Third, the maximum times you can expand your base is too little in my opinion one of these days you’ll need extra room for storage or gadgets you find while exploring the wasteland. Fourth, beginning “Small Pantries” and “Small Water Butt” uhh, please enable a deconstruct option for those. Fifth, backpacks/satchels when I send survivors out into the evil, wicked wasteland i keep running out of space i suggest adding a bigger backpack (like a tier 5 or something like that).

I'll explain that later.\n\nBut first lets look at the game itself. You live in a shelter set in a post-apocalyptic area that is, of course, irradiated. You can get rad poisoning, food poisoning, basically any kind of poisoning. (including cookie poisoning... not really.) You explore (go on expeditions) this area and get supplies from the many question marks on your map. They can be houses and caves and such. But you can also meet others in the wastes, and depending on where you are they can be friendly or hostile. In these human encounters you can recruit, trade, bully (essentially fight), or flee. Trading is pretty-self explanatory, just click on the things you want, and then give them something that has the same amount of value points as the other item does. Bullying is basically just killing the person for what you want. Fleeing is also self-explanatory. Recruiting is pretty easy to do as often times the people you meet are desperate.\n\nNow onto the mechanics.\n\nSince it is a post-apocalyptic wasteland you need food and water. Water is obtained through rain and expeditions. Food is obtained through expeditions and traps that you can set outside. You will also need gasoline to fuel your shelter. Yes, you have lights and things. You can build more rooms in your shelter to expand room for more buildings. You build, build, build, build, build, build, until you can build no more. You can get quests from people and give them things.\n\nBut that's about it. Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but I didn't get that much playtime out of it. I am stuck at a point where I can do about anything because I have such a large water supply, and enough resources to get food from animals. Again, I do not think this game is bad, but I just don't know what else to do.\n\n\n","March 26","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is very good at making you feel like you are trying to survive something. Finding the basic resources needed to prevent starvation is challenging. Food can be caught but the traps are consumable items. You have to scavenge the wastelands fairly often to survive properly.  You have to micromanage every need your characters have including stress reduction and trauma recovery.  And everything you use practically is falling apart with every use so you have to repair it.

I'm past day 150, have gone everywhere, built everything and have never been in any real danger. There is not much challenge, it just takes a long time to scavenge enough resources to buy good equipment and furniture. I expected choices like "should we eat John to survive or risk sending him out to steal food?" and not like "should I use these pipes to craft a prettier shower or a prettier toilet?". I've heard that your shelter can be targeted by a raid, but this hasn't happened to me yet. It hasn't caught fire either.\n\nThat being said, I like the game design and got quite attached to my group of survivors. The game is charming and somewhat addictive. If you enjoy base building and scavenging games, you might like it once you get the hang of the mechanics. There is great potential, and I'm looking forward to seeing how the game develops. I'm giving it a No plus. It would have been a Yes minus if they didn't call this version 1.0, signalling a finished game.\n\nSome pros:\n- The expedition and radio mechanics are nice.\n- Many objects can be recycled to useful resources or burned as fuel.\n- Psychopaths offer an element of surprise!\n- Charming elements like pets, paint, the jukebox and food poisoning puke.\n\nSome of the things that should be worked on:\n- Some system upgrades are too expensive and give you almost nothing in return (like durability upgrades).\n- Manning the radio is a full-time job of pressing buttons when you have several expeditions going. If you have set a waypoint at a farm, then yes, you want that farm to be looted and don't have to be asked.\n- We need more keyboard shortcuts, e.g. for the dialog boxes (Y/N or Enter/Esc) and answering the intercom.\n- Perhaps more automation should be allowed, assigning each character specific repeat jobs (fix all furniture, fill pet food, water the planters, etc.).\n- The boxing bag and bookshelf works too well. Especially the bookshelf, which many people can use at the same time. All my survivors are rocket scientists by now.\n- The "special" furniture obtained by blueprints is just ridiculous. If you have something exciting and new to put there, please do, but drop the magical furniture.\n- Stress: Is is ever not zero? (I've got the cat pet, though.) I've seen trauma go up when people die, but that calms down pretty fast anyway.\n- Endgame: The game doesn't need an ending, but it should be harder and harder to survive as months go by (less available food, more black rain, more violent factions, etc.).\n- Replay value: Starting a new game is unthinkable as I would do exactly the same things again, except choosing a different pet.","March 27","false","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've put over 100 hours into it since I got it on tuesday. As a big fan of This War of Mine, I was looking for something similar and yet different. I was not disappointed in the slightest, like the twisted love child of This War of Mine and Fallout, I enjoyed every step of the way.\n\nI have seen several reviews citing a lack of autonomy with the automatic players, or that the radio goes off too many times. My response to them is to not use automatic, and if you cannot keep up with the radio (simply by presing R you lazy twits), then don't send out so many search parties at once. Automatic play is nearly pointless, but I never use it on games like this anyway. It can get to be a busy game as your shelter expands, but that's the whole point! Would you rather just sit there, occasionally glancing up to see if you're being attacked? How boring!\n\nMy only complaint is content! Not that the game lacks it, I just crave more! This game has some serious potential to be an amazing game! It already is to me, but give me one or two heavy expansions or some workshop content to expand on a base game that is already fantastic! I would like more variations in questing as well. Variations in creatures as well would be great, we see them discussing mutants and the like but all I've ever run into is bears, wolves, and people.\n\nAlso, why aren't you able to brew alcohol or grow marijuana?

This game is very good at making you feel like you are trying to survive something. Finding the basic resources needed to prevent starvation is challenging. Food can be caught but the traps are consumable items. You have to scavenge the wastelands fairly often to survive properly.  You have to micromanage every need your characters have including stress reduction and trauma recovery.  And everything you use practically is falling apart with every use so you have to repair it.  It is suitably hard.  I found also that the glitches I experienced during play were resolved with updates in a timely manner.

I am very excited to see it develop over time (and hope it will).\n\nThe atmosphere and mechanics are great, permadeath deletes your save slot, the genre is a combination of the sims and cannibalism in 2d. You craft the familiar crop of gear, furniture and traps for your family's survival, alongside some cool machinery for your fort like a recycling plant and an indoor plant nursery. People offer to join your fort or attack you in the wilderness, and you can choose to confront or try to escape tough situations.\n\nBONUS 1: the wood and pipe resources are also weapons\nBONUS 2: family members drag bodies outside and bury them\n\nThe obvious things to expect in terms of improvements in the coming versions are probably the RPG and encounter depth, the combat system and maybe tweaks to control of the survivors' daily life. It seems like the gear is well balanced, except for the fuel system. There's too much fuel in the game, the generator uses very little, and the unit price is high. This tiny flaw along with the high price of records, bears and tools, makes the money aspect of trading less interesting. Instead, the availability of goods dictates the progress in certain stages, which is interesting in itself.\n\nThere is an immense amount of micromanagement in the game, especially when the fort becomes more populated, and that is sometimes great and sometimes a little tedious. Sometimes I would have four people in grave conditions idling about and one more available for work, but you can only queue two chores at a time and automode makes the survivors do dumb things like drink the last of the water tank when others are in more need, or eat from the spacious pantry instead of the maxed out freezer. Trauma right now is barely noticable even as you dig graves and bury your family members.\n\nSo all in all great game that holds a promise, I hope that similar to games like Prison Architect, The Long Dark and Rebuild 3 it would continue to grow and develop over time even after v1.0.\n\nI would love it more if it had:\n====================\n\n1. More uses for attributes (INT, STR etc) indoors and outdoors and more rpg depth in the encounters, with more than one scene per encounter\n2. Global control menu - I want to be able to tweak the automatic behavior of the fort globally - switch on / off the toilet when there's no water for instance, guide survivors to eat meat.\n3. Moar Traits - I don't want to say steal a feature, but in the game Pixel Pirate some actions can be learned and trigger automatically as a charecter levels up. In Sheltered I'm thinking pooping automatically, learning to clean up after yourself, wanting to fix stuff when you're idle, healing survivors, reading books.\n4. Characters interacting in game - If you've played This War of Mine, there's a lot of emphasis there about the tolls of hiding in. Contradictory traits leading to arguments and fights, cabin fever and trauma can play a part in the simulation and add a lot to the atmosphere and gameplay.\n5. Cooperation - if we have sims mechanics, charecters should also be able to do things with and for each other:  cook for several people, high INT help traumatized or dress wounds, digging a new room together.\n6. Names - more diverse name generator in the game, I had three Lindas at one point :)\n7. A queue of three or five actions at a time, and survivors can wait for someone to finish using the toilet (maybe get some stress)\n\nThat's it. Nice to see Team17 again.","May 1","true","32.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The former prefers to make generalized decisions and allow the specific details to be handled within the ai.   The latter prefers to manage every detail of the process,  and their gameplay is a collection of their smaller choices aggregated.  Macromanagers for instance leave free will on when playing THE SIMS whereas micromanagers turn it off or override it often.  SHELTERED is a game for the micromanagers.  I am not one of those.\n\nWhile the premise and depth is great and I can tell the execution here is good,  the biggest flaw I found was a lack of AI in the family members.  They won't do any task unless commanded.   Mom will happily stand outside dying of radiation poisoning while standing next to the damaged air filter with no hazmat suit on,  and will make no effort at all to put on said rad suit and fix the filter unless specifically commanded.  This is true of everyonr;  you must issue commands to get people to do anything,  and they won't grab a gas mask or rad suit unless you walk them through the steps of doing so each time they go outaide.   This sort of play got old with me quickly,  but a micromanager would likely love it.    6/10 but not for all gamers.","April 12","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So for now, I have to recommend against buying the game until it's had a bunch more work to make it complete. I'll be keeping an eye on the release updates to see when to come back to it.\n\nIn amongst the pretty solid (but a little grindy) shelter building gameplay, there's a bunch of UI annoyances and busy-work. The fun of exploring, of building up the base and keeping everyone alive is counterweighed by the tedium of constantly maintaining things, or finding things for the "Sims" to do in the shelter. Otherwise they just stand around.\n\nAnd there's some pretty rough UI issues too. The biggest one is that you can't move the info panels in the shelter view, which means you can't see your front door, and often the generator is obscured. The bottom of the screen is almost always empty - why aren't the info panels there?\n\nI've had many of my team fall dead some time after coming back from an expedition and I'm not entirely sure why! I think some of them might have been in a fight, but then other times I check on people who've been in a fight (to bleeding) and when they get back they don't need any particular attention...\n\nThere's also some real oddities like not being able to move around (or destroy in the case of the first storage box) some of the early game objects. Can't move the cat's feed bowl... or the stuff near the door when you're making defences.\n\nThen there's that weird "confirm" dialog "option" you always have to click on in encounters. It doesn't do anything, but you have to click on that word anyway.","June 4","false","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's almost everything I'd like in an apocalypse sort of setting. If you liked Oregon Trail then you'll probably like this game. It has a very similar feel. I only have a few complaints in that I wish you could save families so when mine dies horribly I wouldn't have to meticulously recreate them every new save. I also kinda wish there were more character interactions both in and out of the shelter and I wish I could take a more hands on approach when it came to searching for items in expeditions.","June 3","true","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mechanics are fine, some of them you won't know until it's too late  like the fact that it's required to upgrade the air filter before recruiting a certain amount of people, which will suffocate everyone inside the shelter, kill some people and make others to raid and sabotage it, and that some recruits are psychopaths and will kill your family( there's no way to find it out before it's too late). Be warned. , it will make you spend several hours without feeling it and the OST gives a quite dark feeling .Combat is turn based and can be avoided most times\n\nTL;DR: Game is addicting, good/great OST, will make you quest your morals and make you think twice before taking decisions and trusting people.","June 5","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, please enjoy\ntl:dr at bottom\n\nAfter 9 nonstop hours of playing this game and getting to day 300ish, I feel like I have pretty good grounds to review this game.\n\nWell to start off you will constantly be learning on how to play the game, be that from the informative albeit small ten minute learning curve that you first get when you start up a game or when you first find out that this game suffers from an extreme repetition problem along with some serious RNG (random number generator). Don't get me wrong, this game is the ♥♥♥♥, but the majority if not all of your gameplay will be following a pattern not because it is the only thing you can do, but because its pretty much the most feasible way to play. For example, encounters;\n\nWhen you explore the wasteland you will encounter people or animals that will cause your characters to react in a certain way which in turn levels them up a certain way. You can use upgrades like camo clothing to negate these encounters, but I have found no benefit in doing so. When you encounter said... encounters, you will pretty much do the following;\n\n1. You meet a stranger in the wilderness. Before you say anything he offers to trade. He has only garbage, you reject, he gets offended and you part ways.\n2. You meet a stranger who starts saying how futile life is and insults you. You will beat his stinky hobo ♥♥♥ into the ground, take his cement and batteries and move on.\n3. You meet a stranger offering to join. Since this is the first stranger that offers to join, you accept him into your shelter only to find that he is garbage in everything but charisma and has the heavy eater perk.\n4. You meet a stranger offering to join. Since this is not your first time a stranger has offered to join, you reject him on the spot and manage to save both you and your children's life from water contamination when you eventually kick him out for being worthless.\n5. You meet a stranger and before she can say anything you kill him for his/her cement and batteries and move on.\n6. You encounter a bear and ♥♥♥♥ing die on the first turn (unless you have doggo).\n\nAfter you return home from your wasteland adventures, you will find your house in ruin. Your water and oxygen filters have broken, your toilet is broken and there is dog ♥♥♥♥ everywhere. After a brief cleaning and fixing period, you can set your supplies to good use. This is where that pattern problem comes in again. You will build as many new bunker segments as you can because you are essentially in a cubicle when you first start and have no room to put the bucket your wife and children have been ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in. Then you will focus purely on bags to allow you to bring more cement and batteries home for the cement and battery hoard. Then, you will repair your things again as the integrity system in this game is broken af. For the remainder of the time you will be getting your stats down so you can immediately go back into the burning wasteland of death to find more useless garbage you can't actually store at home but are just to lazy to not bring with you.\n\nDuring this entire process you are going to have tens of thousands of people trying to dump their ♥♥♥♥ on you or live with you but you will have to turn down because of the ravenous appetite of your dog. The best ways to fight these guys off is to imagine they are all thieves and cannibals trying to get into your shelter and steal your cement and batteries and you won't feel as bad as you normally would when you send a person to death in the scorching desert.\n\nYou will repeat this process for almost ten hours until you start hearing this really upbeat music that sounds like it came out of the B list of Undertale. You will then find a person, 75 percent a woman, breaking down the door with a pickaxe. Since you spent all of your supplies on new bunker segments and not traps, you are going to do the next best logical thing. You put your kids in the basement and your adults up the top to fend off this one probably weak from starvation and dehydration woman. After you realize you can't fight back both of the parents will die like ♥♥♥♥♥es even though they have killed hundreds of people out in the wasteland with little trauma to boot. Some of your stuff will be taken, and you will continue along with the game. In most games losing two party members is essentially a death threat, but it just turns Sheltered into a really ♥♥♥♥ed up Home Alone movie. You will repeat the previous steps everyday and when you get the achievement for you 100 days alive you will start to wonder if you even needed parents in the first place.\n\n\ntl:dr\n\nSo overall I had a lot of fun with this game and I really recommend it to anyone who likes games like This War of Mine because it looks like this game is just a pixelated heavily expanded upon version of it. The game was really hard until I found that if you click on the portraits you can automate the characters needs and that really takes away a lot of the frustration of micromanaging your people.\n\n8/10 IGN Not Enough Water","June 5","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
