Something in my brain tells me that from a literary standpoint this saccharine monologue told within the dreams of a terminal cancer patient on her death-bed is shallow and driven primarily by the player’s emotions. But what I’ve come to find more and more lately as I’ve begun to take steps to break myself out of depression and hopefully come out the other side a happier person, is…I don’t care what that part of me says anymore.\n\nLabyrinthine Dreams’ may lack nuance and come accompanied by some dreadful artwork (those facial expressions are the stuff of nightmares), but its sincerity and earnestness meant so much more to me than what questionable character designs or clichéd plot points could take away.\n\nPerhaps it’s a tired tale; an expected narrative being directed at people like myself who see themselves so easily in the mundane lives of struggling artists forced to give up on their creative dreams under the weight of a socioeconomic machine. Maybe I’m just looking for reassurance that I’m not throwing my life away by not pursuing a more marketable degree and Labyrinthine Dreams is the relatable, consoling voice I’ve been longing to hear. But then, is that such a bad thing to want? Even if it’s at times trite, does that diminish Labyrinthine Dreams’ message of hope to those in need of it?\n\nThis isn’t a review. You’ve likely realized that by now. It’s not a critical interpretation of a work or even a basic bullet-pointed list of pros and cons. It is almost nothing, but in what few words I’ve found to describe my feelings toward Labyrinthine Dreams, I hope it’s clear that it connected to me in a very personal way. It wasn’t deep; I can’t describe it in thousands of words dripping in analogical prose and life stories; I find myself struggling to even write enough to feel as if it could serve as a legitimate recommendation.\n\nAll I can say is that Labyrinthine Dreams is honest. Honest about what it is, in its characters, even in its fantasies. It’s solemn and optimistic, that no matter how badly it could go wrong and how much everyone tells you you’re living in a dream, your life is worth more than a paycheck and losing the chance to do what you love. A few years ago I’d have rolled my eyes. Now, this simple positivity has come to mean something deeper to me, and I’m thankful every day that there are people who understand that sometimes all anyone needs is encouragement.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","August 12, 2015","true","2.8"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","54","58","3","0"

First Serena, then Cahors Sunset, and now Labyrinthine Dreams... This is starting to become a habit. I wouldn't like to seem like a tragedy junkie. I just wished to play an RPG maker game, and look what it has done to me: all teary eyed and big with the decision on Carpe Diem!\n\nIn Labyrinthine Dreams, our protagonist is Beth; a young woman who is crippled with anxiety, due to the timeless death of her father. In many ways, she is terrified that she may end up just like him. She is trying to deal with judgement, apathy and depression while recounting the events of her life from a dreamlike perspective. She travels within many dream fragments that symbolize both important moments of her life and her hopes, dreams and fears: namely her inner world. Within those dreams, she constantly tries to escapes from a monster, a dark creature that comes after her. For every step that Beth takes, the monster can take two. Is she doomed to end up in the grasp of her inner demon despite whatever she tries?\n\nThe gameplay is the marriage of a visual novel and a refreshing selection of movement puzzles. Puzzles are decent, and takes some time to figure all if you were not to use a guide. I'd like to add that, every detail that you come across, alongside with the nature of puzzles you solve, the game world is genuinely symbolic. You shouldn't expect a straight forward story consistency. The story works around the linear concept that you expect from an RPG maker game. For example: for the first puzzle that you come across - The Forest - you are not allowed to make left turns. It gave me the sense that Beth is forced to abide by the expectations of society: one way only. There should be millions of other paths that she could take to finish the labyrinth, but she is forced to use a single one. Beautifully thought!\n\nThere isn't much free will, but Beth's tale is so ordinary, so real and everyday; I found no problem on emphasizing myself with the character. The game asks the same question that we ask ourselves everyday: Will I make it? Will it be okay? Am I taking the right decision? Is it foolish to chase a dream? We all are afraid if we do not abide by the rules of the society, and work on a course of 'guaranteed future', we could end up wasting our life after a dream that we shall miss in the end. We all are a 'Beth' when a new day begins.\n\nThis is a very short game that you should spare the time to take a look at. At the end, I promise you, you'll feel better about whatever your life may hold for you. I know I feel better, and every Beth is a hero.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 11, 2015","true","2.8"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","6"

Labyrinthine Dreams tells the tale of Beth, a young woman struggling to find her place in the world while dealing with her ever-present anxieties. Beth comes face to face with a serious illness which forces her to look deep within and find what is truly meaningful in life.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around a series of puzzles, each unique and challenging and brought to life with lush mapping, atmospheric effects, and a dazzling soundtrack. These puzzles are difficult, but figuring them out is immensly satisfying and their ever changing nature always keeps you on your toes.\n\nThe most impressive thing about this game is the seamless cohesion between the puzzles and Beth's story. Each puzzle has a discernable symbolic relationship with a critical period in Beth's life and her battles with her inner demon are among the games finest moments.\n\nThis is an extremely unique game which is definitely worth a purchase. It isn't very long but the journey is well worth an hour or two of your day. While the player learns the specifics of Beth's illness, but her story is universal and can be appreciated by anybody dealing with any sort of oppresive force in their life. Give this game a shot, you won't be disappointed.","May 23, 2014","true","1.6"," 53 of 77 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","53","77","0","5"

Decent artwork.\nI personally didn't buy this game but won it in an auction for a 1000 gems and it's worth every single one of them.\nI was just aiming at the badge, I didn't even expect to enjoy this game, all I knew about it was that it's an RPG-maker visual novel which I was sure sealed the deal that it's poorly made right there, and boy am I glad I was proven wrong.\n\nI won't lie, some of the puzzles were outright frustrating, but once I was done with them I felt somewhat accomplished which is something I didn't find in other puzzle games of similar prices and even a couple $20 titles. I think a lot of it came from a need to win it, that I must overcome this challenge. The biggest downside is that the game felt like a compilation of little flash games, but the low price justifies it and I personally prefer a lot of little games over one repetitive go of a single one.\n\nWell worth the price for 2 hours of gameplay given you're witty enough to ease through the puzzles.\nYou will enjoy this game if you know what you're getting yourself into.\n\nNot many things make me cry, but this game did.\n\n\n★★★★☆ - you may lose some dignity after washing your face","December 16, 2014","true","2.8"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","1"

In spite of its length, character development of the protagonist was really well-done as I was able to emotionally relate to her deeply. The important and positive message that the game conveys is worth a lot more than just watching typical Hollywood flicks in my opinion.\n\n.

The story is quite simple and sadly somewhat marred by a narrative that lacks finesse in dealing with its subject matter, you can expect some pretty obvious lines dealing with depression or being stuck in life. The gameplay is decent with mazes you must navigate with limitations on your movement (e.g. can't turn left), other places where you must clear all tiles touching them only once or have to outmaneuver a monster that follows certain movesets.\n\nIf you like these kind of puzzles and are ok with its simple story then Labyrinthine Dreams is a decent choice considering it's fairly priced for what it does even when not on sale.","November 28, 2015","true","2.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

And having just completed it, I'd strongly urge you to pick this up before the sale ends.\n\nActual review portion:\n\nFor an RPG Maker game, Labyrinthine Dreams is incredibly beautiful. On top of uniquely crafted environments, Labyrinthine Dreams features several RPG style cutscenes, with fully voiced lines, which gradually unveil how the protagonist came to enter this between-worlds state.\n\nThe story is very human and touching, though I can't say much more without spoiling it.\n\nNow as for the gameplay itsself, I quite enjoyed nearly every second of the tile-movement puzzles, and though, admittedly, I rarely play games from this genre, I had never experienced most of the puzzle mechanics which constitute the majority of Labyrinthine Dreams's play time. Some of the puzzles are quite tricky, but I strongly encourage you to figure each of them out on your own, as all are quite do-able.\n\nHopefully that made some coherent sense. But anyway, I do strongly urge you to buy this game. For $2.99 (or even the full $4.99) it's well worth your money.","May 26, 2014","true","2.1"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","0"

Cutscenes which are done in an anime style with fully voiced dialogue.\n\nRoughly said there are four types of puzzles in this game, all with their unique move sets and rules. Each "level" is beautifully rendered, and has a score fitting the scene.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is simple yet beautiful, and the  voiced parts are done by  good voice actors.\nAll the dialog is subtitled as well and the voice can be skipped, not that I felt the need to do so even once.\n\nThe big minus point is that this is an RPGMaker game, and therefore suffers from the engine limitations.\nThe game has absolutely no resolution control: you either have to play fullscreen, or in a tiny window, and then use something like Windows' Magnifier to blow up the window.\nThe game can also be very short. Once you learn the trick behind the puzzles you can probably beat it in no time.\n\nThe big question then, is it worth €5? My answer is an absolute "yes".

As you move on through other puzzles you get to hear a little bit more about the main character and her life struggles. You see how she goes to aim for happiness and also how she conquers her fear. Really touching story.\n\n-However, this game is not repetetive; you will most likely just play it one time (Unless you didn't quite understand the story).\n\n-The voice acting was okay, i don't feel like too much emotion was put on the most drastic dialouges; felt like the same tone.\n\n-Art is great! The images fully went on with the story and were just so full with tranquility.\n\n-Music was right on! Perfect melody at the right spots! Though, the enemy's theme was somewhat spooky lol. I literally just wanted to clear the puzzle as soon as possible when i had to escape.\n\n-Puzzles tend to be rather quite easy once you have figure out the kind of pattern that is being used in specific puzzles, there is only one way to the exit, can't take any other road but the one assigned for you.\n\n\nI really wanted to know more about her, but it seemed that the only way was by completing puzzles and getting the dialouges , if you interact with objects though she will tell you something about the past. This does not happen frequently though, as they aren't alot of objects to interact with anyways.\n\n\nFurthemore really touching story, worth $5? i believe so Yes! Especially for people using RPG Maker, this can be a quite good example of how to create a game, or even get ideas. I myself have RPG Maker and i'm currently playing games done with RPG to simply learn more about it.

I just wish I had had a few more puzzles to solve, but I guess they were just in the right numbers to not alienate me from the plot.\nAnd about that... I liked the story. A lot. It left me with a lightened heart, and just for that it deserves a cherised place in my game's library from now on. It's difficult to find games that really reach to the player's feeling through their story. I sincerely believe that that's what Labyrinthine Dreams has been able to do in my case.\nBeeing a puzzle game, the soothing music has helped me to concentrate when needed, but it also helps to build the melancholic feelings of the story. I'd say the soundtrack contributes heavily in the pleasure of playing this game.\nThank you a lot for a beautiful experience, Solest Games.","September 11, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Challenging if you don't pay attention to the rules, however, so no skipping dialogue and zipping ahead!  Well, still a challenge in places, but in a fun way, not a "zomg, I've headbutted a hole in my wall!" kind of way, like if you ignore the rules instructions.\n\nThis is a short but enjoyable maze-puzzle game with trading cards and 7 semi-easy achievements.  It needs at least 2 playthroughs, with the first to map mazes with resets, and 1 playthrough for the no-resets cheevo... or just stare at the pictures-provided guides right here on Steam to do it all in 1 playthrough  =^_^= (found the guide after mapping several mazes  T_T  ).\n\nIf you like maze-puzzles, want a good game for trading cards, or just another game to 100%, this is your game right here!\nThis game is also good from a story view point, as it chronicles key points in the main character's (Beth's) life.\nWARNING: If you cry easily, make sure to have a box of tissues nearby, because the story is definitely sad (if you couldn't guess from the "About" section of the store page).\n\nLastly, a small sidenote: Usually I don't buy game soundtracks on Steam, but am considering it for this game:  The music in this game is simple, but hauntingly good, and enhances the sob potential in the storyline (at least for me).  No tinny 8-bit music or rock & roll, but soft, haunting (yes, I know I already used that word, but it IS!) melodies that have a noticeably decent quality unusual for most cheap games.\n\nI saw the news post on Labyrinthine Dreams' price reduction from whatever it was before (I think $4.99?) to encourage people to not abuse Steam's refund policy, but I would have paid that and then some just for the music, the mazes/gameplay, or the story alone (even better, Steam Trading Cards for Badges!).  All 3, combined with beautiful artwork, makes for a masterpiece equal to or maybe better in some areas than many big-name SNES games (and we know how much money THOSE were, even back in the day!).  I remember paying much more than that for Myst for my PC when it first came out, and accidentally beat THAT game in less than 10 minutes!  As a kid!\n\nThis game is definitely a wonderful addition to any game library, especially for the (imo way too low) current price tag, and if you normally play games on mute, you'll want to unmute your computer for this game.","May 21","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a short puzzle-adventure game in which you play as a girl struggling with her inner doubts and thoughts, which have manifested into a literal demon that constantly drives her away from her goals and the people she loves. Ludically, this boils down to some traversal puzzles coupled with stages where you outrun a demon in a turn-based maze. Again, not much to it, but it comes together quite well and serves the story.\n\nThis is also one of the rare moments where a developer knows the advantages of video games as a medium. At the end (SPOILERS), you are running from the demon down a long hallway, which you can't possibly win (becuase the demon moves twice as fast as you). Then, as Beth comes to terms with her past, you can outrun the demon at last (3 spaces per turn to the demon's 2). You can defeat your demon, but you have to keep moving.\n\nThese are the kinds of things, though a little blatantly obvious here, that you can't really convey in any other medium. The game and story aren't seperate, and so you couldn't tell this story any other way. I really hope Solest Games move on from RPGmaker in favor of something that gives a little more freedom, because these guys could actually push the medium forward.","November 28, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitalhead/recommended/278570/","digitalhead","Digitalhead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitalhead/","315 products in account","It's a nice little game. There are only a couple drawbacks that come to mind for this:\n\nFirst, I think it might be a little too short. You can potentially beat the game with all achievements in about half an hour. Since it's such a straightforward game, there's not a whole lot of replay value. That means leaving it idle to get the card drops. Having the player make choices throughout the game that change how the story plays out could add to replay value and give an opportunity to flesh out the story some.\n\nSecond, the game engine is great for 16bit RPGs, but I think this game would have been better suited with something else. A different engine, even something like GameMaker Studio or GDevelop (which is free, open source, and easy to use), would allow more versatillity with the graphics, controls, layout, interface, and also easily port to other platforms, even mobile. This game doesn't use the biggest advantages that RPGMaker has over other engines, which would be inventory, battle system, character stats, etc.\n\nThese drawbacks don't mean it's not worth getting though. It's definitely worth a play. The graphics and visuals are rather good for the engine. It has a great story with meaning to it, even though it leaves some stuff to the imagination, which can be good in a case like this. Also, the voice acting is top notch for a game that's telling a story.\n\nThe mazes are rather creative. They look really simple, but the machanics of how each one gives it a challenge. It's nice to see mazes that are actually puzzles... or would it be puzzles that are actually mazes?\n\nAt any rate, definitely give this game a try if you like story driven puzzle games. It's short, but also cheap.","October 27, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The writing was incredibly smart, filled with emotion, much like in other short games like To the Moon, but the voice acting gave so much life to the game. The music made the journey so much more mystical. When I was doing the mazes at first, I feared it would be one 3 tracks, but the music changed with the themes of the stages/levels. It filled the game, when there were no words to be spoken, with such emotion, elevating the experience.

Half off its already low price. Steam coupon. Cheaply enough that I figured if it turned out to be a waste of my time, I wouldn't be out a lot of money.\n\nYou'll notice that my time played on the game is quite short. How about that.\n\nI like puzzles. I play a lot of games with ACTUAL puzzles. But mazes aren't puzzles as far as I'm concerned; there is no brain involved. Here, they've tried to add a little brain by making each set of mazes have a different rule which they don't tell you. Or maybe they try to tell you. I THINK the game was trying to tell me the "rule" of the forest maze, but did so in such bad English that it took me three screens to realize the actual rule: In the forest, you can't turn left or back up. That's it.\n\nSo then I went and looked at some walkthroughs and realized the rest of the game was just more mazes, with a rule change every four maps or so, plus a story which, frankly, seems pretty obvious just from the first few panels of dialogue and the unsubtle clues in the maps (really, IV stands scattered all over the woods, that's the best you can do?). Yeah, yeah, dying, hallucinating, in the hospital, replaying life, trying to figure out whether to go on, monsters from the brain - I've seen that before, seen it done better.\n\nOh, well. That's why I buy 'em cheap.\n\nIf you're really dying to see how this story comes out (ha, ha) go watch a walkthrough.

That being said, about an hour later I felt that I had wasted those few cents. Essentially a marketed "RPG Maker XP" game. The story, while tragic, was a forced kind of tragic. The gameplay was a mixture of puzzles, that were equal in quality and complexity to the gyms in Pokemon (and I'm not kidding, the puzzles were replicas of ones features in those (yes, I know Pokemon didn't come up with them first)). Having a main character that whines about their tragic plight the entire time is not one that a player can connect with easily, I ended up hating the main character and towards the end found ways to make her lose. The acting is flat. It reminds of sitting through a mediocre high school drama performance, let's just leave it at that. At the end of the day, I do not weep for my own wallet... but for the wallets of the backers when I learned that this was a successful Kickstarter.\nFinal Verdict: 2/10","December 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mash5a/recommended/278570/","mash5a","Tinkle Tinkle Hoy, Bitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mash5a/","261 products in account","The game is enjoyable, the puzzles are a bit textbook but still well designed. The story has a good message despite being fairly predictable. Although, it does have trouble meshing gameplay and storytelling. It works with cutscenes in between puzzles for story and while the puzzles do act as symbolism, you could get the same effect by watching a playthrough. For example, the protagonist is confused while trying to figure out her problems, so the games puts you into a maze with her inner monologue. Neat! But also could have been achieved if the game was a short film. There is one moment at the end where it makes good use of mechanics for the purpose of storytelling, otherwise it's not too impressive with it's storytelling.\n\nThe actual story itself isn't very remarkable either, although, It does set the scene for the puzzles nicely. In fact the story does little more than provide a scene for these puzzles to exist. That said, the best part of the game is probably going around and enjoying the environment as you play. Yes, even though it's a tile based game it still looks pretty good. It's impressive considering the game also does this with mostly default RPGmaker assets. That said, the puzzles themselves are pretty fun, interesting, and generally feel good.\n\nThat brings us to voice acting and let me tell you, WOW, I hated it. I forgot that the game supports autosaving so I stuck with it simply because I felt I got too far to just restart. Still, I feel the mood would have been way better in silence. Even if you got better actors, better direction, or better writing, the absence of voice would make the words more powerful. It also helps that the players can insert their own voice as well. The only problem with this is that it may be hard to tell who's speaking in certain parts of the game (The maze part switches between speakers).\n\nOverall, it's a pleasant experience. The game's lackluster features are easily forgiven since it's fairly short and for 2$ it's worth the price of admission. Plus, you're probably going to get it for a dollar during a sale sometime eventually. At worst, you'll probably just find it OK.","July 15, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty much the only good thing about this game is the aesthetic, and one can purchase the soundtrack separately, which I'd recommend more than the game itself.","April 16","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a bit frustrating at times, but all in all, it is pretty good. The story is interesting although somewhat abrupt. If you have nothing better to do, give it a shot.\n","April 8","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A nice story with feels. So nice I bought it twice. If you wanna kill an hour or two or are wondering what to play next, go no further. Had a few interesting puzzle mechanics that I really enjoyed.","April 11","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a puzzle game, so prepare to be mind boggled. But the fact is, this is a very beautiful and it has a very excellent story within this game aside from it's proper voice acting. I expected nothing at first, but after going through this game from start to finish, I can feel how artists feel and I can enjoy this game to it's fullest because I was inspired and was smiling all the way as I understood the characters and was wanting more even after the whole game ended.\n\nIn the end, I gave it a 10/10, if only this game was longer, I would've sat down even if it's another hours just to enjoy this game.","April 9","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
