We were all a bit ambivalent about IF this game would be fun. Disparaging comments were made about the graphics. We even argued about the merits of buying from Steam or directly from the game creator.\n\nSo some time in the morning of Jan 1, we booted up the game and muddled our way through getting a server up. We didn't bother with the manual (a few of us did while we tried to figure out how to get our main screen turn on) since things appeared fairly straighforward. We settled down to our command stations, and since I didn't scramble for a specific station I was pegged as the captain. We set the game on the lowest difficulty settings and said "It's only 6 bucks. Not too much of a loss."\n\nWe finished that map in 15 minutes. We were clamouring for more, so we made the sector a bit busier, and the enemies tougher. What followed was over an hour of organized yelling, hasty planning and tense staring at our screens as we fought to save the space stations, guide errant freighters away from black holes and deal with angry space life. We all had our moments: Weapons lofted a pair of nukes and blotted out an entire fighter strike. Engineering somehow kept us intact and powered even though we barely managed to keep him ahead of our flailing. Comms got a trio of enemy ships to surrender in quick succession. Our helmsman suckered an invincible alien life form through a minefield to its death. Sensors ID'd targets and made damn certian we knew everything around us and made each beam shot count.\n\nSo our opinion after 80 minutes of fast and furious play? We all agreed on one thing. AGAIN.\n\nWho got which seat, on the other hand...","January 6, 2014","true","11.9"," 285 of 288 people (99%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","99","285","288","29","2"

I'm running the game without Steam, so it does not reflect my actual play time.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to correct a common misunderstanding. You do not require 6 people to play. Each ship has 6 roles that can be filled with "up to 6 people". Having one person take care of one thing makes it really comfortable and this is the way, this game is meant to be played. But it is perfectly possible for 3 people to have the responsibility of 2 stations, and fly the ship with its full potential (in a single instance of game client). I have 4 friends that got comfortable with the game, and now we're running comparatively easier set games with 2 separate ships (3 and 2 people per ship). Sometimes I like playing the game solo, even though it's hard to do so and possible only under lower difficulty settings. I'd say having 5-6 people per ship is ideal, but with 3+ people the game is absolutely playable.\n\nSecond false information all over the place. You do not need a separate pc with its own copy of the game to be the server. Go in the Steam/Steamapps/Common/Artemis and run artemis.exe. First window should be set to server mode. Now run it again, and make the second window the client. I personally connect my huge TV to my laptop and become the server, use the TV for the server screen (which is also the outside view of the ship), and use my laptop screen for the client screen (which is the screen of whatever role I'm filling). Entering 'localhost' will connect to the server running on the same machine.\n\nI realize that this is more like a troubleshoot, instead of being a review. But in the process of deciding to buy the game, I immediately recognized how awesome this game is. The questions I had were the ones I just described. You don't need this review to know that this game is awesome, it's already all over the place. What you need to know is that the most frightening part of the game (6 people minimum thing), is actually incorrect. Also; it is possible for up to 8 ships to play Co-Op or PvP modes. Talk about awesome.","October 21, 2014","true","2.1"," 216 of 219 people (99%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","99","216","219","4","12"

It's very much unlike any other space sim I've ever played. The game has you play a starship bridge officer, responsible for controlling one of the ship's systems. Pretty cool and all, but there's a twist. In most space sims, a player is responsible for running the whole ship. He controls the weapons, he directs the ship to its destination, and so on. Artemis is different in that each of the ship's systems are run by other players. The bridge crew is entirely composed of humans, not AI.\n\nThere are five stations to man in Artemis: Helm, Engineering, Weapons, Science and Comms. Helm controls the ship's movement. Engineering deals with repairs and modifying the power levels of each system in the ship. Weapons handles, well, weapons and shields. Science has control over the sensors, scanning targets for information on its systems and crew. Comms handles communication with other vessels, both friend and foe.\n\nThis 5-man setup provides a lot of depth to the game, but it is not difficult to learn by any means. The actual mechanics behind the workings of each system are surprisingly simple to learn. The genius of Artemis is how the mechanics of all these systems work together to form a complete, compelling experience for everyone involved. All crew members need to have good synergy if they want to complete the mission. As long as you keep up a friendly attitude, pay attention to your fellow crewmates and do your part to keep the ship running, you will have a high chance of success.\n\nOriginally, the game could only be purchased through the developer's website. It could only be played through LAN, and it cost 40 bucks, because that version came with extra copies to be played on other computers for a full LAN party. LAN play is fun as hell, but that alone doesn't make for much mass appeal. Fortunately, the developers have realized this and have added online play. The Steam version of the game costs a mere 8 bucks, because it's only one copy. A dirt cheap price for what could be an endless amount of fun with friends? That's a steal.\n\nIf you're going to play online, you'll need to get a program called Teamspeak to communicate with other players. There is a teamspeak server that is decently populated for most of the day. IPs for servers can be found there. Its address is {LINK REMOVED}artemis.teamspeak3.com and its password is Artemis1. The community is very friendly, supportive, and a whole lot of fun to play with.\n\nGive Artemis a shot. This game deserves a lot more attention. It really is unlike any other space sim on the market. It's about as close to being in Star Trek as you can get. I'll see you in Starfleet.","September 23, 2013","true","6.1"," 80 of 84 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","80","84","0","0"

Maybe I shouldn't expect much from game that takes up a quarter of a gig, but a couple of planets and moons wouldn't go amiss.\n\nOverall, it's a great party game for those who love sci-fi.

I have played a few times and most of the time I am running the EXE outside of Steam. I probably have several hours of game time now.\n\nThis game is a little buggy, a little uneven, and does not feel like it's yet been fully realized. Having said that, I can still fully and wholeheartedly recommend it, but with  a few caveats that I will get to later. The bottom line is: this game is so much fun! Seriously, if you are into, or were ever into Star Trek then you owe it to yourself to get it. Artemis is a simulation of what it might be like to be part of the bridge crew on a starship like the Enterprise.\n\nHere's how it works: You run one instance of the game as a server and then each player (up to six for a full bridge crew) runs another instance and those clients connect to the server. Each player picks one or more stations to manage (captain, helm, tactical, engineering, science, and communications) and each station gets its own interface needed to perform its functions to run the ship. So the helm gets a control layout to be able to fly the ship, engineering gets controls to manage power to various systems and mitigate damage, and the tactical officer gets to fire the weapons. The captain ties it all together, making decisions and issuing orders to other crew members. The captain has his own view which is a map with some basic information, or s/he can simply use the main view screen which is provided by the server.\n\nThe developer clearly intended originally that this game would be played by people all in the same room and the simulation lends itself well to LARPing and role-playing. An ideal setup would be all six players in the same room using their own machines and whichever machine is running the server (any one of the machines could run the server and one of the clients--you DO NOT need a separate machine and/or copy of the game to play) would be connected to a big screen tv to show the main screen. Thankfully, the latest version of the game allows for playing over the internet. My gaming group uses Skype for voice chat since the game provides no native voice chat. It works fine for us.\n\nThe server is what runs the actual simulation and it allows for setting up various scenarios in the game and tweaking all sorts of parameters to increase or decrease difficulty. The are various sorts of ally and enemy ships to encounter and bases to dock with and defend. The game has modes for multiple ships with their own crews that can go head-to-head or do missions cooperatively. One server can support up to 36 players (six bridges with each having their own crews of up to 6 players).\n\nEach role has different things to do to keep the ship running smoothly. Admittedly, some stations are more fun to play than others. Also, some stations feel very heavy on the micro-managing and others feel like there's not much to do; many people complain about the communications station for being sort of thin in this area. I actually don't mind playing Communications Officer You can hail friendly or enemy ships, monitor distress calls from friendly bases or ships being attacked, demand that enemy ships surrender, taunt enemy ships into attacking, direct friendly ships away from deadly areas of space, order friendly ships to attack, prepare bases for docking to improve refuel and rearm performance. And most importantly, you have the button to set off the red alert klaxon. As Communications Officer, you may also get side quests from friendly forces which usually take the form of, "Dock with this base to download this data, then take it to this friendly ship and then come back and dock with use to get more energy/coolant/weapons/etc."\n\nSo once again, I do recommend this game if you have at least two friends to play with. You DO NOT need six people to play this game. At the very least, you need helm, tactical, and engineering, but personally, I like playing with five or six people. Also, as I said before, the game has no native voice chat if you are going to playing over the internet. Something else to be aware of is that the game does nothing for you in terms of matchmaking or anything like that. You'll need to have each player connect to the server via IP address and you'll need to set up port forwarding on TCP 2010 to be able to have any of the clients be able to connect. One other gotcha to to be aware that when you play over the internet, you won't be able to use the IP address of the server that is reported in the game. That IP will only work when playing over a LAN. You'll need your internet-facing IP address to hand out to the players for connecting to the server.\n\nI bought the six pack and gave the five other copies to my gaming group. I've had fun playing this game over the internet as well as all in the same room. It's a lot of fun especially if you have a madcap gang to play with like I do.\n\nI just hope the developer continues to work on this game. It's good already but it feels like it could go a lot farther.","November 19, 2014","true","3.0"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","42","44","0","0"

In short, as someone else already put it, it's the Star Trek game you've all been waiting for.\n\nNow, I'm just gonna get you riled up - I'm more of a Star Wars guy. I also friggin' loved this game to bits. Now, let's go over the important stuff.\n\nWhat is readily apparent is that the game is a social game. You essentially roleplay a Star Trek style crew, so it's gonna take people. With a bit of creativity you can run it remotely but the game really comes into its own over LAN. Each player gets a specific role on the bridge, and they damn well better do it well. This is pretty much the core of it.\n\nNow, it takes some effort to enjoy it properly. It takes setting up a bridge, and it's indeed ultimate nerdery if you can set up a whole faux spaceship bridge (which some people do). The game's more than just the software, and you always need to remember. The game is also your crew. A lot of it is when you raise a glass to the finest crew in Starfleet. A lot of it is when the engineer cuts power to the engines because the drunken helm officer is zipping around to blindside enemies. The visuals are not spectacular and the sound is a little tacky.\n\nWhich is sort of part of its charm - this is not an AAA title where you're a one-man army. Oh, your ship does most of the heavy lifting, but it's the crew that counts. You need to communicate for maximum efficiency. The imperfections of presentation actually make sense, as they give a nice retro feel to everything. And it's not exactly an excuse. That feel does evoke Star Trek, which is precisely the point of the game. It's not taxing on the hardware but it's precisely the point, as it naturally requires you to use multiple devices. Unless you are tech savvy enough to cheat around that (and considering you're a huge nerd, not saying it's bad, as you're eyeing it, you actually might be), but that defeats the point, as it's a true multiplayer game.\n\nMake your stories, make your legend. You may not be Commander Shepard, you may not be Captain Kirk or Captain Jean-Luc Picard. But in this game you'll soon be boldly coming at them with your crew by your side and your pha... beams hot.","December 22, 2014","true","7.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

The setup was epic: 1 TV, 6 monitors, 5 guys and 1 spaceship we were all in charge of! There certainly were some high expectations going into the simulation.\n\nThe problems started right at the beginning. We started the game and had absolutely no idea how everything worked. There were no tutorials and no hints. Everything seemed alien to us and even downloading the game manual didn't help, because it was made for an earlier version of  the game.\n\nDetermined not to give up, we started googling for help. Luckily, some guy had made a 30 minutes long "short tutorial" to Artemis. Our captain watched the whole thing and each of crew members watched their own section. This was by far the easiest way to get to know the controls of the game. Once they were explained to you in youtube, it was not so complicated after all.\n\nSpirits were high when we finally launched a random scenario and were able to defeat it. It was fun playing as a team and there were even some very nerdy roleplaying going on with our captain walking around with a coffee mug in hand giving orders.\n\nHowever, the random scenarios were all kind of the same. You have to defend your bases and eliminate the enemies, that's pretty much it. We were hungry for some exploration and plot, so we tried to launch some of the custom scenarios.\n\nThe custom scenarios are a very nice idea - they allow people to create scenarios with plots and twists and turns for your delight. However, much of the scenarios were made for game version 2.0 and we had the newest version from steam (2.1.1) and I guess this is why all the scenarios had severe problems - game simply stopped running etc. Even after much trying, we couldn't get the custom scenarios to work.\n\nNow I realize Artemis is a single-man project and it's awesome how awesome it is, even now. But you should be aware it is not really a finished game with good support. It's a single-man coding project with a small community that has made a handful of scenarios.\n\nRight now Artemis is more of a simulator and less of a game - though it could change in the future. It's unique, however, and if you are really into space and stuff and have a couple of friends living close by who feels the same way, I definitely say it's worth your money to try it together (just don't expect everything to be perfect)!","July 29, 2014","true","7.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

Game runs fully self contained in its folder - and system requirements are conservative enough it runs on intel express hardware using software directx emulation.  Good design, allowed me to use an old laptop to drive the view screen (plasma tv) then two other pcs in the lounge to drive stations, helm/coms/weapons/science/engineering etc\n\nHelm top right controls your viewscreen display too.\n\nStill lacks a bit of depth - playfield is small, 2d, not a lot going on even in siege etc modes - and enemies are quite easy to dispatch if even 2 players are half competant.  In one mission i just asked an escort to defend a base and it won me the scenario.    Have not been able to locate scanable anomalies - so not sure if that is a bug or not.\nIt can work over the internet - but more fun in the same room. You can have multiple machines acting as viewscreen tho, so you could sorta video conference the other players I suppose with fast internet.\n\nEngineering in particular could easily play remotely.. scotty get those shields up..\nGuys what are you doing up there, stuff is blowing up all over the place!\n\nIf you can spare 35 minutes and 2 or 3 computers its worth it just for a laugh.","October 19, 2014","true","7.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I was sitting in the Captain's chair, and had nothing to work myself, but I was just as involved and necessary as weapons, or comms, engineering, or helm.\n\nOur crew had to dance together to stay alive.

But the small game didn't made for much else exept lan and direct IP co-op. It feels cumbersome to start a game, since it doesn't really tell you how to set it up. All of the actions, as hosting or joining demands you to add an IP adress. Sometimes you just need a member of the comunity to walk you trough it.\n\nsetting up controllers is impossible through the game, my guess that it is done through manipulating some game files. Again this forces you to look for the comunity members that know how to do that, so they'll walk you through.\n\nThe game is limited in the amount scenarios to simply defending a sector with several space stations from randomly appearing enemy ships, which can be enough at first, but cannot really simulate the reality of war. It is possible that the community members will be able to create something different, but the systems limitations will be a constant bother.\n\nMy guess is that both the game, and it's engine don't have provisions for much more than it is, so I think it will have hard time evolving.\n\nStill, with all these short comings, if you want too play a co-op bridge simulator, there's no tother game quite like it.

If you have enough for two crews, you can do a pvp match or co-op.\nThe Stations:\nCaptain: Tells everyone what to do\nHelsman: Essentially the chauffeur of the ship.\nWeapons: need I say more?\n(The minimum you need for a bridge is captain, helms, and weapons.)\nEngineering: Diverts power and coolant to give systems a boost and also prevent the ship from exploding\nScience: Scanning enemy vessels for weaknesses and scanning space for potential threats\nComms: The secretary of the ship. This is the station you give your girlfriend because you want her to help, but you don't want to give her anything important. Even though I say that, it does come in quite useful- it's really boring to play, however.\nThat being said, I highly recommend this game for Star Trek fans and non-trekkies alike, but only if you have a group of friends that you can do it with.\n","April 30, 2015","true","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

The game master messaging system will crash everyone who has a window capable of receiving the message in game. There's no way to turn down the incredibly loud music but after a few minutes, it just disappears completely. The pace of all the missions were completely random, as in sometimes it'll be your ship kiting 30 enemies in a circle and sometimes, it will be the enemy battleship destroying your objective faster you can possibly have made it there. The comms officer position is utterly devoid of use and fun. Your top of the line dreadnought requires 10% of its entire power reserve to do a 180 degree turn.\nTargetting becomes broken when enemies go in and out of visibility in a purple cloud, which by the way destroy your engines if you even graze them even with shields on when your objectives clearly tell you to explore them.\n\nThose are all from just half an hour of wasting my time and that of 5 of my friends...\nIf you could fix all these things and improve the pace of the game a little, this would be boatloads of fun but as of now, I don't see how this game can be sold on steam.","November 2, 2013","false","2.4"," 30 of 82 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","30","82","0","10"

It is a team-based game, requiring 6 people to play at maximum effectiveness, though you can do it with 2.  The 6 stations are: Captain, Helm, Weapons, Engineering, Comms, and Science.  Each of these stations must work together to defeat any enemies encountered.\n\nYou and your friends are in command of a spaceship, usually dubbed "Artemis," and are out to defeat the alien hordes.  There are several game modes, with version 2.1 adding 3 additional modes.  You can also create custom scenarios.\n\nThe big thing I dislike about it (not nearly enough for a no-go) is the strategy is very simple.  EMP a group of targets, then nuke them.  When you're out of nukes, head back for more.  Rinse and repeat.  Other than that, this game is a blast, especially when you can get 2 or 3 ships working together to accomplish the goal.","June 18, 2014","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are a little dated but that in no way takes from the enjoyment of the game, also the game play tends to be more 2d than I would like to see in a starship game.\nOne point that needs to be noted, you only need 1 full version of this game, to run as the server. The Artemis homepage has free installs for the subsidiary stations needed to play.\nArtemis ports over to tablet play very well, and for some stations the touch screen works better than mouse control.

I have last random thing. last time we played we had some anomalies turned on and found a very funny one. one of the anomalies was invincible and very powerful. so after 2 hours of what seemed to be a rogue starfleet ship (us) roaming in Cardassian space somehow tearing apart every ship we saw with the greatest of ease we decided to go investigate the anomaly. it hurt us a lot and we tried to warp away but it followed us at warp speeds. we accidently went through a group of 3 enemy ships and the anomaly (crystalline entity?) stopped and completely destroyed them. so we decided to try that again. overcharge the warp engines and the rear shield and grab the attention of the anomaly and run the the biggest group of bad guys so he can do our job. worked like a charm. so that is just a highlight of some of the random unscripted fun you can have with a group of people.","April 6, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your in the right place....\n\nArtemis is a bridge simluator where friends can get together and become the crew of a starship.  Although the game was designed for all members to be in the same room, running this with something like Teamspeak will allow you the same feel over the internet.\n\nOne person starts the server.  Then others connect to that server and choose what stations they want to control on the ship.  You can choose multiple stations on one computer, but these are all active stations and can get too complicated if you choose the wrong combo to work.\nYou can control Helm, Weapons, Engineering, Science, Comms, or Captain the ship.  Each station has it's own screen and working in conjunction with the other players you make the ship function.  There are strange occurences, enemies, space monsters, etc out there to explore and find.  The world is also customizable, so you can set difficulty levels and overall content to suit your crew's abilities.\n\nThe person who starts the server CAN play at the same time.  All you need to do is copy the shortcut from your library to your desktop and launch the server off that.  Then launch the game through steam as a client and you can connect and play a role.\nNote that as the server, the game will give you the IP addy of your PC for others to connect to.  If you work through a router you need to open port forwarding to 2010 and the IP the router gives you.  Then give your crew your actual IP that you should be able to get in your router properties.  There are some guides on this in the forums if you need help.\n\nOverall, it's a blast to play with a crew.  We played with only 4, doubling up captain and science/comms, and the game was great fun.   If you ever wanted to get on the bridge of a starship, this game is worth it.  Just remember it's not designed for single player.   You need at least 3 to play smoothly, though you could probably do with just 2, but would be difficult to fight on higher skill levels.\n\n","April 3, 2014","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would highly recommend this game for LAN parties.  Instead of battling each other, you are working together to win the game.  Also, it encourages you to talk and be social.  You have to communicate amongst yourselves if you want to do well.  It's a great game for parties, and it even runs on my netbook.  We enjoy because we get a chance to role play, and we are all physically in the same room (except for one of our friends who just moved and wanted to connect via internet).  With that being said, I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but this will appeal to anyone who is a fan.  Some of the roles are not as much fun as others, but you could play to everyone's strengths and interests.  It's very simple to learn and play.","February 2, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a team-based game, requiring 6 people to play at maximum effectiveness, though you can do it with 2.  The 6 stations are: Captain, Helm, Weapons, Engineering, Comms, and Science.  Each of these stations must work together to defeat any enemies encountered.\n\nYou and your friends are in command of a spaceship, usually dubbed "Artemis," and are out to defeat the alien hordes.  There are several game modes, with version 2.1 adding 3 additional modes.  You can also create custom scenarios.\n\nThe big thing I dislike about it (not nearly enough for a no-go) is the strategy is very simple.  EMP a group of targets, then nuke them.  When you're out of nukes, head back for more.  Rinse and repeat.  Other than that, this game is a blast, especially when you can get 2 or 3 ships working together to accomplish the goal.","June 18, 2014","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Teamspeak 3 helps immensely, but even there if you don't want to preschedule when you play, you really need to hope that there are others on the server. I recommend using extreme caution if you do not have friends to play this with. Don't expect this to be like most games that you can play at your leisure.\n\nWith that out of the way, the game is fun in much the same way a TTRPG is fun: it provides a memorable experience of a shared adventure (though at this stage, it seems more often akin to "battle"). I have not had the opportunity to try engineering or captaining as I write this, but of all the others I found that in order of easiest first to hardest, it goes:\n\n1. Weapons\n2. Communications\n3. Science (for the most part)\n4. Helm\n\nThough to be fair, all of the stations I have tried so far are rather easy. The trick of the game has more to do with efficient communication. Everyone has something to contribute, but it all needs to be managed (generally by the captain) in a way where all the relevent information is being communicated in the right order at the right time. The interface/game element is actually extremely easy, though captaining appears to take more skill (in terms of identifying what the immidiate threats are and taking the proper course of action).\n\nWeapons: Generally this is extremely straightforward. Leave beams on automatic (some prefer manual, haven't figured out why yet), listen to what to load and when to load it, time your firing properly, it is generally straightforward in terms of the game itself. Just click fire and load at the right times, have the right ammo loaded and set the beams to the correct frequency. From a communication perspective, it seems the important thing is to have good timing. Have an idea of what the captain means by "about 3 seconds." Make sure the captain has an idea how much ammunition you have, and it might be a good idea to remind the captain at times that you can convert energy to and from torpedos.\n\nCommunications: Probably the most difficult part is sifting through the relevant an irrelevant com chatter. I haven't yet figured out if there is a way to tell if the ships are trying to communicate with you directly, because messages not intended for your ship will show up too (I think). This ties in nicely with the communication element. The captain probably doesn't want to hear that a friendly ship is requesting permission to dock at a friendly base miles away. If two enemy ships are taunting each other and looks like they might fight or one is offering surrender, that would be very useful for the captain to know.\n\nScience: The first game I played I doubled as science and communications. I had no idea that the frequencies are displayed as bars. The right frequency to use doesn't just appear as a letter. My teammates were also kind enough to tell me right off the bat that you will likely have to scan multiple times. Getting used to it I found much harder than getting used to any other position so far. Once you are used to it, though, you spend most of your time sitting around scanning stuff, and making the captain aware of what is going on long-range. You are effectively the eyes, more specifically the peripheral vision, of the ship. Don't let the others get caught up in fighting one ship and not realize that there is an ambush en route.\n\nHelm: Definately the most tricky in terms of actual game elements. It uses what I will call, for lack of a better word, continuous steering which many find tricky to use. I mean this as a contrast to car steering or joysticks where you push it one way and it returns to a straight path. Steering here means that the ship will continue turning in the same direction as you first set it. This can frustrate many, but I was already familiar with that control scheme from other games. The most important element of communication to stress here is that it has the most urgent communication needs. You need your captain to tell you when to drop out of warp as you can't see that far out, but you also need to inform the captain of any difficulties you encounter immidiately after you encounter them, you can't wait. This seems to be a position that I would expect to challenge and perhaps frustrate introverted people that struggle to speak up. You must speak up without hesitation, and react quickly when given instructions for maximum efficiency. And then, of course, there is the means of steering to get used to.\n\nAltogether, this is a fun game if you either have friends that you can organize a session with, or if you don't mind only being able to play occasionally. TS3 is a must if you are not playing with others in the room. I say TS3 because that is where you will find others online looking for games as well. The fun in all roles except maybe captaining come more from communication and hanging out than from the game itself. Will hopefully update with more information soon.\n","January 14, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's only a X and Z axis, there is no Y axis (UP/DOWN flying). It's not hard to fly together with just two crewmembers if you know how to micromanage.

I think you need at least three players to make it doable, four is better, five is probably really, really good and six is optimal (seven's even doable for one ship with a captain).

You get a crew together and take command of a starship to valiantly defend USFP resources and interests. Ideally, you'll end up with a captain and five officers for the helm, weapons, engineering, science and comms stations. If you're short a player or two, fret not: you're able to man multiple stations if need be.\n\nThe Graphics & SoundSimply put, they're not top-notch; the game looks and sounds both aged and basic even in light of its release date. That being said, its UI is thematic and fairly consistent throughout. Furthermore, it's still able to provide that awe-inspiring scenery where you look out into the vast expanse of space and just let your mind float adrift among the stars... and enemy debris, but mostly stars! The sound sticks right to the classical ol' space beeps, boops and bweens. The music's actually fairly good, limited though it may be.\n\nThe UIAs stated above, the UI is thematic and consistent. It's easy enough to navigate around it, though the controls themselves need plenty of explaining and/or pressing-stuff-to-see-what-it-does. I do highly recommend reading the manual and digging up the control configuration file.\n\nThe GameplayLet's start with game modes: Solo (single ship, can still have multiple players), PVP (ship vs ship), Co-op (multiple player-controlled ships), and Scripted. To hone in on that last one, the premade scenarios can be lightly compared to challenges or quests. Players can make their own scenarios as well, in which a seventh player would typically take the position of GM and spawn in enemies and environmental hazards for the players to deal with. Whichever mode you choose, it's also worth noting that you can customize a lot of the settings from enemy and player ship stats to what kind of ships and environments will appear in what quantities. This customization, combined with the ability to setup your own encounters, allows you to effectively tighten down to the perfect mixture of difficulty and enjoyment. Speaking of enjoyment...\n\nThe game's always more fun with friends. Always. There's the issue of role assignment that makes role-based teamwork difficult at times, but once you're past that each position can provide a challenge. Yes, a captain gives orders for the crew to follow, but a good captain listens to input here and there while always ensuring that the crew has direction so they don't lose focus, get bored or feel useless. The helm officer goes where the captain instructs, but a good one is already coming about to bear on the next objective. Each role has room for improvement... even Comms has hidden levels of skill to strive for.\n\nIf you step back and think about the way the game plays, it doesn't seem like it should be so interesting: you fly around, kill some baddies, resupply then rinse and repeat until victory. Then... you consider the sense of tension and urgency created by that group environment. The captain spins their plan and tells the crew what they want, helm focuses intently on maintaining firing arcs while avoiding those of the enemy ships, weapons carefully targets the opposition's weapons systems with beams while loading and firing torpedo tubes, engineering constantly shifts power levels up and down to provide better performance without overloading systems, science keeps an eye on ship statuses and positions while providing beam frequencies for weapons to fire on, comms keeps an eye on station supply levels while directing allied ships and demanding the enemy's surrender. During this, each player is providing vital information to the other stations. Depending on your crew this can mean a loud mess, a constant stream of curt statements in a rotation, or the one thing feared most by all captains: total and utter silence from the stations. Autonomy's good, but silence rarely is.\n\nI'll leave gameplay on this final and important detail: there are no offical dedicated servers. The community hosts either with their computers or through servers they run maintain/pay for themselves. In most cases this means you'll need to know about port fowarding and/or setting up LAN environments in order to play with other people. It's a sharp disappointment since the game is geared so heavily towards group play.\n\nThe Final ProductIt's a blast if you're up to the task of organizing and operating a match. I've converted eleven people IRL to the cause so far; we LAN party it up just about every weekend. Get some friends, get to a guide on how to setup an Artemis server, and get to defending the galaxy from Kralien scum.\n\nNote: I have many more hours played than on record; my group often launches it sans-Steam.","October 9, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely need at least three people to really play this effectively, preferably in the same room. Also, game is rather bad at explaining how to get stuff to work. Took me and my buddies at least one round of being clueless and a couple of internet guides before we were able to play effectively.\n\n\nThat said, once we started up, we had a blast traveling across space fighting alien ships, defending space stations, discovering anamolies, managing our resources, and working together. The game has about 4 different play modes with the ability everything from overall difficulty to how frequently anamolies appear. If you have a group of friends who you see regularly, this is essentially the perfect game for those gatherings. If you simply can round up your friends for one night of fun, still worth the price of admission.\n\n(quick note, have not tried playing it online)","July 18, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With various worlds and starship configurations, Artemis includes a range of missions and scenarios to test your skills. As a die hard Trekkie and Star Wars fan, you can imagine how much I wanted to try this out - and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nIn Artemis, you take the role of a starship bridge officer controlling spaceship functions relevant to your station - that is, if you take the role of a weapons officer, you control the weapon systems of the ship and nothing else. This means that the game requires you and your team have good communication and co-operation skills. So, if you don't always get on with your mates in tight situations, you might not be very effective at completing the missions. This also means that you can't play the game single player (unless you fancy trying your luck with controlling multiple PCs in front of you at once). However, you can stack systems on fewer PCs, so a party of two can - possibly with some difficulty - control all the necessary starship systems from just two PCs.\n\nWhat lets the game down are the graphics; edges that should be smooth are pointy and it is reminiscent of a first generation 3D game for the PlayStation One. In addition to this, it does require that you and your friends purchase separate copies of the game, including one for the main viewscreen (or the server). It was all very complicated to set up. Between me and my friend (in a party of two) we had to purchase the game three times on three seperate Steam accounts, as we could not find any better way to play the game. That said, three purchases (currently) amount to around £15 - an average price for a game on Steam nowadays - so it didn't trouble us greatly.\n\nI also found that missions lasted only a short time, with nothing more than simply searching the map for enemies to blow up as an aim, and consequently I don't think this title has a very high replayability. Meaning, once you've played it and the novelty has worn off, you'll find the long setup times and the hassle of organising large LAN parties isn't really worth it.\n\nVerdict:\nThis was a difficult one, to be honest. Many of the benefits greatly outweigh the shortcomings, and this game should be highly recommended to anyone who has ever wished to fly the Enterprise or the Galactica. However, with a complex setup and hassle to get everything organised, is Artemis worth it? In my opinion, for once in a while, it's a great opportunity to take a break from other multiplayer games and do something different - and that's what this game is: different. It all comes down to your personal taste and what is important to you in a game.\n\n+ Unique experience with an original idea\n+ Lots of fun in a large party\n+ Range of worlds and ship configurations\n+ Cheaper than some multiplayer options\n\n- Outdated graphics and UI design needs renovation\n- Long, outdated documentation\n- Complex setup, which requires some networking knowledge and patience\n\nSo, for those who want to try a new experience with a large (or small) group of friends in a much different setting than other multiplayer games, buy Artemis. You won't regret it, and it won't leave a massive hole in your pocket either.","July 8, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
