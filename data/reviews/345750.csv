"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbydonprime/recommended/345750/","abbydonprime","AbbydonPrime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbydonprime/","515 products in account","Please read completely before making full judgment. The TL;DR is at the bottom.\n\nBefore I purchased this game, I saw that the top reviews were negative ones. However, I liked the screenshots and description, and I am fairly open-minded with low expectations, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I think one of the biggest problems is that people are going into this expecting more than what it is. The popular tags really should include "Casual".\n\nOverall, I liked it. It is a God game, but on a Casual scale. It does not reach the grandiosity of many other God games. I can understand how there are so many negative reviews, especially the ones made on release day at a higher price point. Considering Pocket Games planned to, and did release, an iOS version after PC, I think the design was targeting mobile from the beginning. This game is limited in scope, scale, depth, etc. I will go into it more later.\n\nI have played the game to full completion, including all achievements. It took around 5 hours to complete, and then another 5 or so to grind the "Tree Expert" achievement. So, it is a short game. Does that make it bad? Not really. I like being able to complete games. It's perfect for people like me that don't have much free time due to work and family. I completed it over 3 nights.\n\nMy Detailed Opinions\nThe characters have a unique design to them. They are charming, but they are also fun to set on fire or strike down with lightning. They make noises and exclamations, but it's nothing complex.\n\nThe terrain design is well done. There aren't a large number of textures, but they fit the overall feel. The islands themselves include little scenic bits that might go unnoticed, such as a variety of flowers, ferns and other undergrowth. Being able to alter it is also nice. It's not as detailed of alterations as something like From Dust, which I played on Xbox 360, but it's still there.\n\nThe game is not that difficult. Due to the limited size of the playing field, there is only so much that can be done. During the campaign, there are caps on the number of each type of Furling other than Warrior. Only the sandbox allows more.\n\nEach campaign "level" is just a variation of another. Since there are only 5 types of Furlings and just a handful of God powers, the only thing that makes each different is the island configuration, starting buildings on each side, and so forth. Also, I swear the AI starts cheating more. On the final level, it was like the end of days for my side. I was spending quite a bit of time putting out fires, fixing the terrain and creating replacement Furlings. I don't see how the AI was able to throw so many meteors when I had the same number of Priests and couldn't do the same.\n\nThe controls take some getting used to. However, once you've used them a few times, it's not so bad. Also, some of the things mentioned in older reviews have been addressed. Check out the discussions to see what the developer has said.\n\nThe key features are very deceptive. Here's a breakdown:\nPlay God... : It sounds like they can be commanded. They can't. The description counters with "your people will live their own lives". Even the Warriors go all willy nilly when they get near the enemy. In almost all war strategy games I've played, if I put a target, my troops go after it. These guys use the Totem as more of a compass marker than a destination.\nShape a beautiful... : Yes, I like the land. But, calling it a "world" makes it sound massive. So does the "take over the world" wording in the main description. In reality, each mission is a relatively small island or pair of islands (enemy on one side, you on the other). The only way to make it any bigger is to keep leveling it out into the water. But in no way is it global domination like it sounds.\nFeel the power... : Sorry, it's not "massive" natural disasters. They are fairly weak. Even the volcanoes can be countered. They are short-lived and have a short projectile range. Just flatten them and use Rain. Anything destroyed can be quickly rebuilt. Earthquake can only take out buildings in a close range. It's not as destructive as a real one. A well-targeted meteor might take out a building and set some on fire, but it doesn't cause a massive crater or such.\nPlay the game... : There really isn't multiple strategies other than mixing up which disasters you use and when/where Warriors are sent. But, with the limited scope, there isn't any real replayability like bigger RTS games.\nIn the description, it says this:\n\nlearn skills to eventually forming an immense fighting force that you can unleash upon your enemy’s population to wipe them out\nThey don't learn anything as they are just created as one of 5 types (and only 1 is a fighter), "immense" is not an appropriate term for a standing army of 10-20 warriors, and the enemy's population is just as limited as yours. Wiping them out isn't that difficult.\n\nThe Quick Review\n+ Pleasant, but not overly done, graphics\n+ Terrain design and control\n+ Charming characters\n+ Not too difficult, not too long (it's Casual)\n\n~ The Furlings sometimes set up shop in strange places. Even when there is room near a resource, they sometimes build too far away.\n~ Caps on the types of Furlings during campaign.\n~ AI that seems to cheat.\n\n- That stupid "Tree Expert" achievement. It's so out of place compared to the others. It's so annoying that I made a guide for it.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658881594\n- Even with a GPU that exceeds the "Recommended" (higher end) requirement, I had to leave it on the medium setting to run smoothly.\n- Game gets laggy on sandbox once there are a lot of Furlings and trees. Loading my Tree Expert save would even cause it to go Not Responding for a while.\n\nFinal Say\nEven with the questionable and negative points, I still liked it, and I do recommend it for the Casual audience that wants something a little more than an Alawar strategy game. If you are looking for a world-scale God game with plenty of complexity, turn back now! The price is questionable. If Casual is your primary thing, then $4.99, about $1/hr, isn't too bad. I got it on sale for $1.24, and I highly recommend it at that price.\n\n---\n\nFor more... My Reviews || My casual gaming...

It just has too many handicaps that prevent it from being enjoyable, first is the Scrolling the menus and the way the camera moves is very clunky making the game frustrating at some points. The enemy AI will never use his god powers to really disrupt your expansion making you feel pretty much unchallenged at almost every point.\n\nNow if your still kind of on the fence because it is one of the few god games on the market and you have played Populous and Black & White to death and you just really want another God Game. Well there is some hope here for you, why it is certianly not the best game it does have some features that I do like, First of all the ability to Morph the landscape is awesome despite the wierd looking aninmation of it doing so. It does have an interesting "Desciple" System for your followers. After a few levels you do get some apocalyptic powers which do help make the game feel like you are more useful than just a tool to the bloody demanding furlings.\n\nI would really like to see if they make a second Idol Hands, the concept is good it just needed a lot more polish in the Developement oven.\n\nFor a hands on Impression Feel free to check the link below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWNY9hKnchQ\n","April 27, 2015","false","1.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

With all the hype over at GMG, i was expecting something huge, something they failed to deliver on.  Its not bad, don't get me wrong, its just not Black and White 2 great.  Those are some big shoes to fill, i get that, but the developer could have tried a wee bit harder.  After reading some of the negative comments, they all share the same gripes, which are also mine.\n\nPostive:\nits a god game, with volcanoes\nyou can Smite them rats into oblivion\nterrain control( it is a god game, right?)\n\nNegative:\ncamera control, you have none really.  No rotation, no zoom/unzoom, just overhead and action. another reviewer says the right mouse button rotates, tried it, it didnt work for me.\nLength, its short, and a good portion of the game is spent in the tutorial that you cannot bypass\nits just not grand.  you get 50 population, with that you have to figure out how to divide them into 5 catagories.\nno way to speed up the action\nyou start with a set score and it counts down when you start, no way to recoup the score ( so far the only reason to replay, to beat the score)\n\nBottom line:\n\nI miss watching your monster change according to his actions, i miss the way LionHead made you feel playing  B&W, its scope, the ability to help your villages, the good/evil dynamic.  This is what made B&W great, what made it epic.  Idol hands cant deliver on that premise, maybe with a well tuned expansion it can, but now...no.  After the hype at GMG i felt they were trying to make promises they failed to deliver on.  As the 1st venture for Greenman loaded, they need to learn that people will only pay for a short, flawed game if the story and the game dynamics pick up the slack.  IH doesnt get there at its current cost.  It is fun, it is simple to learn, and if they continue to develope the game, it can be what its trying to be, so i recommend it for a sale or a coupon purchase as a casual game.\n\n7/10\nkids 5+","February 18, 2015","true","4.4"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","17","28","2","2"

I'm aware the devs are active on the steam forums and are planning (during March 2015 - less than a month after release), a path to fix some issues people have reported (some being feature requests). To me, it already looks good and has great potential. Idol Hands is a God-like game where- belief auto-collects, you can raise/lower AND smooth land, you can set earthquakes, rain clouds and lighting bolts, there are 5 "professions" you can set your followers (woodcutter, farmer, blacksmith, priest, warrior) who will help gather resources to kill the opposition, there are (IIRC a quote) about 11 "worlds" each consisting of multiple (smallish) levels (you can only have 10 of each profession except warrior which has 20 IIRC). Game has story line/tutorial, is "complete" and is undergoing quite a bit of work (looking at forum threads), graphics are medium quality (some things like earthquakes and raising/lowering land do look a little "janky").","February 26, 2015","true","5.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It's also only $5 as opposed to $20.  Changing my review from negative to positive.\n\n---\n\nFeb 2015\n\nOh, how I wanted to recommend it.  On the plus side, it’s a god game that lets you reshape the land so that your furlings can construct their own structures as well as cast powers like earthquakes and volcanoes (similar to Populous).  On the surface, this sounds great!  On the other, there are some really odd things about this game that make me scratch my head in wonder as to what the developers were thinking.  There are no time controls, no WASD or arrow key camera movement, no zooming (there is a fixed bird’s eye view), holding in right mouse click and moving the mouse up and down (not left or right oddly) rotates the camera, no HP bars above buildings, your score decreases as you play (rushing you into beating it more quickly), and more.  As far as I can tell, there are eight levels on the campaign menu and no skirmish modes.  The inclusion of the latter would have given the game some replay value and could have made it worth $20 despite these short-sided gameplay mechanics.  As it stands, it just doesn't do enough to justify that price tag (in my opinion).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXcB6bsCg","February 18, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"

When you compare it to classics such as Populous and Black & White. it doesn’t match up in terms of depth or challenge. It’s a nice little way to pass some time if you’ve only got an hour to spare and don’t want to get involved with a video game that’s too absorbing, but if you’re looking for the next big thing in the genre unfortunately you’re not likely to find it here.\n\nHowever, it seems as if the developers are quite active when it comes to managing both their first release and the community. Perhaps if they continue adding features and manage to release a multiplayer mode, the mixed reception the game has received so far will improve there may be some life in Idol Hands yet. But at the moment it still has a way to go: they may be better off reducing the £14.99 price-tag and marketing it as a casual game, rather than Populous’ successor.\n\nA full review of Idol Hands can be found here: http://1001up.com/2015/04/09/review-idol-hands/","April 9, 2015","false","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You'll need to use these powers to level land so that you're farmers can cultivate crops and feed your population so that you can produce more workers (wood/metal/priests) and warriors to protect your village. As you level the land around you, the border of your colony will slowly grow larger as your workers build new buildings automatically.\n\nAnother plus that I really enjoyed but doesn't really change much of the game was clicking on the minimap and zooming out super far and you are presented with a landscape that is very reminiscent of the view enjoyed in Act Raiser. Again, not the biggest thing but I really liked it.\n\nThe big negatives that I have for the game is the SUPER long mandatory tutorial sections (1+ hour(s)) and the inability to speed up the game. Everything in the game runs at 1x speed, always. So the early part of the game is rather boring because you don't even have all of your spells yet.\n\nOverall though, the game is very charming and family friendly.\n\nRecommended","February 18, 2015","true","1.3"," 60 of 119 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","60","119","5","7"

Sorry, but this is a mobile game.\n\nMy brief experience with this game was like this:\n- Select highest resolution, start game.\n- Graphics are not bad, but not great either.\n- Tutorial 1 is fine, similar to other god games, but your focus is always on the middle of the screen, not on your mouse cursor. Bizarre, but ok.\n- Begin tutorial 2; lowered terrain and, by doing that, accidentally destroyed one of my farms.\n- Started getting this annoying message saying my villagers didn't have enough to eat.\n- Tried to level lots of terrain around the villagers, so that they could build another farm (they're supposed to do that on their own). Didn't work.\n- Created a couple of farmers to see if *they* would create a farm. Didn't work.\n- Leveled more terrain, created more farmers, create some woodcutters and waited.\n- Nothing... only that stupid message saying I didn't have enough farms.\n- During this whole time since the beggining of the tutorial, I was watching my points DECREASE by the second. It works like a timer, trying to force you to persue your goals. Hated it.\n- Hate it so much I stopped playing and came here to tell you this. I won't open this game ever again.\n- Paid R$ 19,00 (about USD 5,00). Didn't hurt, but could have bought a better game.\n\nSorry guys, I didn't like it. I won't ask for a refund - I wanted to find out how this game was and I guess I did... But I don't feel like playing it again. I'm better off playing Dungeons 2: it's not really a god game, but it gives you the feeling you are actually the sh*t. In Idol Hands I feel I'm more of an observer who can raise terrain. Pretty lame, IMHO.","November 10, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Volcanos do not beat rain, rain is the most powerful force on Earth.\n\nDespite this poor design choice the game is very fun.... for a couple of hours and then you realize how repeatitive the campaign is.

You begin to realize how shallow exactly the game is in design.\n\nThe campaign is really long, but eventually you will be wondering when will it end as you face the same enemy and same objective over and over and over and over.\n\nI bought this game because I grew up with Populous and was a huge fan of Baldies.  But this game doesn't have enough diverse options for play.  The population caps on various classes mean you will max out every single class and work towards playing in one manner.","February 19, 2015","false","8.0"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","43","6","14","8","0"

The way it shapes the land was very well done and thought out.\nThe one thing that stands out as of now to me, with just a little over an hour of game play, is I find myself wanting a little more.

As the tutorial walks you through your new powers, I was feeling like this would have a fun level of complexity to it.\nHowever, the game quickly becomes repetative and tedious with the end game of each level taking an inordinately long time to finish.\nThe game strategy is basically choosing what order to build your 5 types of units in, most with a hard cap on the total amount you can have, and managing when to use your mana, as in using a cheap power now, or saving for a more powerful attack.  You have no control over the placement of your buildings or actions of your workers and very limited control over your soldiers.\nThe game is also fairly short, I beat it in about 5 hours, maybe less.  About a third of this time was spent more or less just waiting for my soldiers to finish taking out the enemy's town with virtually no resistance.\nThere is a sandbox mode once you are finished, but other than using my earthmoving powers to draw a few funny shapes into the dirt, it got boring very quickly.\nThis is not a bad game, but I would not recommend buying it.","February 20, 2015","false","6.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

This game isn't horrible but it's a very basic game. It doesnt have much to it. It's a pretty simple style RTS game. I do like the concept of it. Being a God of a little tribe and being able to shape the lands to make it easier for the tribes to grow... However the AI is a bit slow reacted and bland. The game doesnt exactly have a story either. It's more or less other tribes are on islands and you need to grow and invade them. Like i said the AI takes some time to respond to attack orders but the game needs a lot of work. This game has alot of potential if the developers took their time and added more to it.\n\nNow as i look the developers are taking feed back to the game. In March 2015 they're going to update it and add features to make it a bit better.\n\nI personally would like to see a bit more difficulty, more macro sets, more builds of characters, more tech. (catapults, etc) Maybe even being able to shift all your mana and making a mighty hero to serve.\n\nAgain as i previously stated the game needs work, but it's not horrible. If the developers stick to their game like the update says and even continues to add future updates then this game would be great.

Some may be game enhancements (camera, zoom, speed settings), but extra content such as new lands and spells will most likely be DLC. So this is more of a "nuetral" variable, not necessarily a "pro."\n\nCONS\n\nlimited "God actions."  You can raise, lower, flatten land. You can call in a few powers such as earthquake, lightening, meteor, etc. But that's about it. These powers don't seem all that powerful in game. Easy mode = build up decent population with 5 priests, spam earthquake in enemy village (you can destroy 2-3 each time). It's the only strategy needed to beat the AI it seems.\n5 classes (farmer, woodcutter, miner, warrior, priest).  And you have no control over them w/ the exception of a totem you put down for the warrior. No upgrades or enhancements, no strategic planning or placement.\nYou dion't decide where to build. You create a minion, and they take over from there. You have NO part in their life after creation.\nLimited camera control - either sky high overview, or on above ground. No in between zoom or close ups.\nBattles seem so underwhelming. There is a heart icon over minions that represent their health, but the battles seem rather long (no way to increase damage. And attacking the villages? Get the snacks and driniks...you'll be there for a while. There's no health meter over any building so you have no idea how damaged the building is. Destroying villages, even if you have an overwhelming army just takes forever.\nNo game speed options...which due to the above is really, really bad. You play at normal speed only. This game BEGS for a speed increase for the long battles and traveling and building times.\nThe campaign is really just a tutorial. Having a tutorial is a good thing, but to have it BE the campagin is questionable IMO.\nOnce you create a minion (Furling) you cannot destroy him or train him to be something else. So if you create a lot of woodcutters in the beginning but don't need them later...you are stuck with them. As I said, once you create your minions that's it...you have no control over them afterwards.\nAI is very, very bad IMO.  The enemy god will do silly things while his village is being attacked, such as water farms or continue to send his soldiers to my village while I have 2:1 or 3:1 ratio of warriors attacking his own + using powers to destroy his buildings.  In addition, my own, uncontrollable warriors just attack things randomly. Instead of attacking the enemy base, they will attack things that aren't relevant, such as the standby enemy minions who aren't assigned to any task.\nI don't feel like God with this game in its current state. It's extremely limited in what can be done. Your playstyle and options are extremely limited. This is a very, very casual game. It lacks what almost every other rts or previous God game has in terms of variety, actions, features, etc.\n\nIf you are expecting depth and strategy, lots of things to do, you'll be disappointed. If you are expecting just a simple, casual, easy game to play to pass the time, you'll have fun with it.\n\nI highly recommend watching let's play videos before purchasing.  I don't see the value of the game w/ the current asking price. Compared to other indie games on Steam, this seems more like a $10 game, at best for what you get out of it.\n\nYou will finish campaign in less than 3 hours. There just isn't much to do in the game.  There's no variety. It feels like it is still early access w/ such a lack of content. It's like they tried to compensate for the lack of content by creating a tutorial/campaign. I'd much rather have a shorter campaign and have more stuff to do.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nHold off for now and see how the game develops. It has potential, but hasn't reached it yet and it there just isn't any way of telling if it ever well atm.","February 19, 2015","false","2.9"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","3"
