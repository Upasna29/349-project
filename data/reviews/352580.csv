Not much in the way of hidden objects, more items required to find for puzzles. Lot of ways feels myst-like with a completely different theme and story. Some 'jumpscares' but nothing that should turn you away.\nGood performance, fitting soundtrack and some great voice work overall.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MvGC1HCXsw\nIf you would like to know more, just ask. :)\n\nUpdate:\nFinished game, does end abruptly but still enjoyed it. Hope part 2 isn't far away.\nPlaythrough should take around 4-6hours, maybe less for veteran adventurers.","August 7, 2015","true","6.6"," 28 of 44 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","28","44","3","0"

And please note: THIS IS A TRUE POINT AND CLICK GAME! You use the mouse to move, not WASD. The only time you use the keyboard is to open inventory/check goals. Thought I'd add this right at the top as a lot of people dislike the old-school P&C style games where you can't "free roam" with your keyboard.\n\nOkay, so onto the review~\n\nPROS:\n\n* Interesting storyline and characters (love the archaelogical expedition theme)\n* Lovely voice acting (English audio)\n* Fun environments to explore (little creepy too!)\n* Puzzles aren't crazy-difficult and make sense within the game (i.e, don't feel out of place/pointless/random)\n* Audio ties in well with the atmosphere\n\nCONS\n\n* The lip syncing is hilariously bad, I couldn't stop laughing at Petrov and his facial movements, which isn't a good thing when this is a Super Serious game\n* No subtitles, although developers have said they are coming in the next patch in multiple languages [EDIT AUGUST 12TH 2015: THE GAME NOW HAS SUBTITLES]\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable game and I would absolutely recommend it to other P&C adventure gamers.","August 8, 2015","true","7.3"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","21","32","2","0"

Expect no more than 4 hours, even if you end up stuck on the puzzles for some time.\n\nWithout a doubt, I'd say that this is a great start to a point and click adventure. The voice acting and graphics are good quality, there are some interesting puzzles and the 'creepy' factor is well pitched. You see the beginnings of a well throught out supernatural horror story with enough detail to make you want to know more and well pitched tensio leading to some properly 'jump out of your seat moments'.\n\nThe problem is the game is over before you feel it has begun. The story is set up but hasn't developed at all. If this had been marketed as an episode 1 of a longer story and priced as such then I would not complain. But it is shorter than a single episode of many other games and at least twice the price.","September 7, 2015","false","5.9"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

There are some optional puzzles that are partially very hard, and extra stuff that you can do but don't have to do is something I already liked alot in The Night of the Rabbit.\n\nI'm looking forward to the other part of the game and fully recomend this one if you are into this niche games.","August 15, 2015","true","8.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

While it's not hard, and it won't hold your hand (unless you ask it to), it has some stumping puzzles that can make the game drag a little at times. That's not bad, though, since this actually half a game. All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone that likes lovecraftian adventures and adventure fans in general, and I look forward to playing the sequel.","August 11, 2015","true","8.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The atmosphere is totally immersive, everything is complementary: the esthetics, the lighting use, the music, the objects overfilling in the case of some scenarios, or their absence in others. Anyway, the story accomplish its goal, Lovecraft (would be) grateful.\nPuzzles represent a changing difficulty, which seemed great to me, because it allowed me to warm up.\nTo me, to be honest, the game took around 10 hours. Some enigmas made me think and think, and in fact, I still didn´t get all the achievements.\nRelated to price, it may seem a little expensive, but honestly in my country a movie ticket costs u$s 8 and it only takes 2 or 3 hours of my time.\nThis game is a successful genre specimen. I´m eager for its sequel!\n\nEl juego me gustó mucho. La atmósfera es totalmente inmersiva, todos los elementos se complementan: la estética, el uso de las luces, la música, el abarrotamiento de objetos en algunos de los escenarios, o su ausencia en otros. Asimismo, la historia cumple su objetivo, Lovecraft agradecido.\nLos puzzles presentan una dificultad que varía, lo que me pareció buenísimo, porque me permitió ir entrando en calor.\nA mí, la verdad, el juego me llevó unas 10 horas. Hubo algunos enigmas que me hicieron pensar y pensar, y de hecho, todavía no conseguí todos los extras.\nEn relación con el precio, puede parecer un poco caro, pero sinceramente en mi país una entrada de cine cuesta u$s 8 y solo ocupa 2 o 3 horas de mi tiempo.\nEl juego es un exitoso espécimen del género. ¡Espero ansiosa su continuación!\n\n\n","September 22, 2015","true","14.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

MOst of the fun comes from exploring and finding all of the journals and whatnot that tell the story. The puzzles are logical and fun to figure out, the presentation is solid, etc. It might be a bit expensive considering it doesn't conclude the story, but it's still a darn good game nonetheless.","August 14, 2015","true","4.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"
