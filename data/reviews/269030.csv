It feels like a demo, or the introduction to a larger game. The entire game plays out like the character creation for a game that never happens. You spend six weeks making decisions that shape and define your character, each one including a small flavor text choice that lets you deepen your character choices, and then, when it feels like the game should be starting for real, all you do is pick a profession and see how good your character is at that profession.\n\nI wanted to be a part of this world, I wanted to take my character out, to play a game with them. Who doesn't want that? This game is maybe worth a dollar. I wont say that I feel cheated, because I truly savor and enjoy the narrative, and the very novelty of a cooperative choose your own adventure experience was just enough to make me feel like at least I had gotten something interesting and beautiful, if lacking, but I would not recommend this for every gamer.\n\nBe very aware, this game is extremely content light, and there is no campaign. Once your character is created after six weeks of character creation choices, that's the end of it. I really crave more, and am very disappointed in how little is here.","March 2, 2014","false","2.5"," 167 of 201 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","167","201","0","5"

It is very, very good, but also a brief experience. With a few friends the tales you weave will cause fits of raucous laughter, but they will be short-lived. A play-through takes around 10-30 minutes, and the end phase offers no real-resolution.\n\nA folk music style soundtrack interweaves the basic, but charming presentation of the game. Both are lovely, and compliment one another well.\n\nThe Yawhg puts me in a tough place because I really enjoyed it, but I question its worth at $10. I don't usually draw comparisons between price and longevity, but if I paid $10 I can't help thinking I would feel a little let down. There are multiple play-throughs here, but even by the second play you will be seeing the same situations again.\n\nBuy it if you are looking for a fun, memorable experience to play with your friends, and don't mind the longevity issues.","February 22, 2014","true","3.7"," 208 of 269 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","208","269","0","3"

I really enjoyed what time I was playing the game.\n\nI can't say you should buy this game for only one reason, and that is that the game is too short for the few bucks you'll be spending on it.\n\nExactly what is this game? The choose your own adventure game has about 100-200 encounters, (and yes I looked in the game files for this number range) However being that you can hit about 20 per character it's not extremely hard to start seeing repeats in playthrough two. Along with that though I give the game credit where it's due, the game has a very open file system where you can modify... the whole game. Not only can you modify it, but so can anyone else, if you look on the discussions I'm sure you can find a player made extension or a whole 'nother story, which is great! that looks to be more play time added on to this game. Final note on the game itself, it is a LOCAL Co-Op/single player game, however me and my friend used Teamviewer (http://www.teamviewer.com a free screen sharer, that's easy to use) and we played the game as if we were both in the same room.\n\n;-; #forever alone  #Screw that I don't want people in my house.\n\nOverall yeah you should get this game if you can nab it on sale or if you can get it in a bundle, I can personally only recommend playing this with a friend, so be sure to grab 2 (or a DRM free copy)\n.... not saying that there are any maybe in the humble bundle...\n\n\nSo now the standard game rating:Story: 10/10 (Enjoyable, Fun, Ridiculous, everything a good sit-down-and-play game should be)\nGameplay: 3/10 (I can't give good marks here for a game that uses only U/D/L/R/Enter, but it passes by my personal standards.)\nPresentation: 9/10 (The game has a nice art style and feel about it.)\nSoundtrack: 7/10 (I'M SORRY WHAT WAS THAT?! I had to turn mine down to 4% just to hear my friend, no in game slider, and doesnt save sound settings after closing. Other than that it's fine, fitting music.)\nReplayability: 10/10 (I'm just waiting for that free content DLC that was mentioned in a thread somewhere, that or I'll go and download someone elses.)","November 5, 2014","true","3.8"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","51","57","8","0"

It's short. I have, what, nearly three hours of playtime on record? I think I've played 20 or so games in that time. You have 2-4 characters, there are six turns, and for every turn, you decide what stats your character will improve. At the end of the six turns, every character picks a profession and then you see if you managed to rebuild or not after the Yawhg leaves.\n\nPros:\n- Absolutely beautiful\n- Great music\n- Two male characters, two female characters, always a plus\n- Great for when you have a little time to kill\n- Most weeks you'll have an "event" happen to you, anything from deciding whether to pick up a rusted dagger to dancing with a dryad to giving sex tips to the king. These were cool (at least, the first few times...).\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive. The events that pop up during the week are the same thing over and over and over and OVER and unless you happen to have the exact right stats, the results of whatever you choose don't realy differ.\n- Only three endings. The good, the bad, the ambiguous.\n- Absoutely not even remotely worth $10. It's worth like $1.\n- There's just not much gameplay or variation, and that means there's not much reason to play this beyond a few hours time total.","July 3, 2015","false","3.2"," 48 of 62 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","48","62","2","0"

Even $1 seems like a high asking price. The game has beautiful art, relaxing music, and the writing is amusing or even heartwarming at times. The way the game maintains continuity over a single playthrough is nothing new for video games, but in a "board game" it might lend it a small air of novelty.\n\nBut, frankly, there's almost no gameplay. It's pretty much a very short, interactive, multiplayer visual novel. A match will last around 8-10 minutes per player. There are 6 turns, and they amount to picking one of eight locations, then making two binary choices at each of these locations to somewhat randomly gain or lose stat points. These points will affect how successful you are at succeeding the second binary choice each turn, depending on what, precisely, the choice is. With a very small number of art assets and almost no gameplay, the game survives entirely on its writing. At a maximum of 40 minutes per game and low variety per playthrough, you are unfortunately likely to get more value out of riffing on a movie with friends than The Yawhg.\n\nI really want to recommend this game, but its brevity and shallowness just keep me from being able to justify saying anyone should spend money on it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seorin/recommended/269030/","seorin","seorin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seorin/","1085 products in account","This is a visual novel in the same style as Monster Loves You. The game involves choosing where to go each turn, then responding to the randomized event that happens there. The event and your response to it will have positive or negative effects on one or more of your character's stats, which in turn influence later events and the end of the game. It's sort of like a dating sim, except instead of trying to get the girl, you're trying to survive the apocalypse.\n\nThe music and the writing are top notch, which makes the game a joy to play through several times over. Events are randomized to give the game more replay value, but they also interconnect with each other in surprising and delightful ways, so you're likely to see something new even on your tenth time through the game. Each run only takes about ten minutes, so finishing it multiple times is more fun than frustrating.\n\nThough enjoyable as a solitary experience, the game really shines when used as a party game. Grab a few friends and try to stave off The Yawhg together - or don't, and see if your character can fare better than the others after the apocalypse.","February 27, 2014","true","0.2"," 58 of 84 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","58","84","0","0"

It's all pretty straight-forward: you and/or your friends each choose a character (you can also choose characters yourself and play the game on your own) and choose a location you wish to go to. Each location has a couple of options on actions you can perform, such as cutting wood, tending to patients, and yes, even getting drunk! But beware: each choice you make might positively or negatively affect your stats. After a couple of turns, the mysterious Yawhg happens and each person will have to choose a role which fits their character's stats best (or you can do the opposite, and watch the outcome!), after which you'll get to know whether your town survived, and -more importantly- how your characters pick up their life again afterwards.\n\nThe Yawhg is a funny little game which you can play with friends. The graphics are all really fitting and nice, the music is simple, yet suits the game and the absolute highlight of the game is the amount of choices you can make, and the randomnized events you'll encounter. However, the game is VERY short. Almost too short. And that, in my humble opinion, is the only thing where it falls short, for me personally. However, the replay value is very big.\n\nGet it during a sale, or if you like experimental choice-heavy little games like this one.\n\nAll in all, 7/10","June 26, 2014","true","0.9"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","31","39","0","1"

I liked her comics and so bought the game, but was honestly disappointed.  The 'game' is nothing more than a collection of Carroll's stories told in a branching narrative fashion.  The game functions by having you choose what each character is doing each week but results are unpredictable and seem arbitrary.  Each game of The Yawhg is very short, not allowing for any sense of attachment to develop with the characters you're controlling.  Ultimately, you're just clicking around to see what pops out next.   While I love the artwork and scenarios that occured, I can't help but feel this really should have just been a series of webcomics rather than a video game.

There is art (and I like the art) and music (and I like the music), but ultimately, it's about the choices you make.\n\n2) The game is very short. It is completed in 6 turns. However, there are a variety of options  to choose from. There are different endings, so choose wisely.\n\n3) If you are looking for a more typical "rpg" experience, this is not for you. If you are looking for something fun, rather light, and enjoyable with friends, this is a good game to pick.\n\n4) I recommend purchasing the game on sale. It is just a little too pricey at it's original price in my opinion, but nabbing it on sale is generally a good idea. I got it at a slight discount.\n\n5) The game is turn-by-turn and is certainly not going to eat any significant amount of your time.

Four people go about their lives for 6 weeks, visiting up to 8 locations and choosing one of two actions at the location they choose.  Each choice will provide a bonus to the character's stats, and there will be a secondary event.  After 6 weeks, the town will be destroyed and you choose a role in order to help rebuild.\n\nThat is the gameplay in its entirety.  The genius of the game comes from the varied events, how those events can lead to other events, and the beautiful resolution as you're told what your character does with his/her life.  Also, the music is well-thought out.  I think there's only three separate songs for the six weeks, and they all use the same theme with an increase in tension as The Yawhg approaches.  The final song, however, is amazing and I don't think I'll ever grow tired of hearing it.  Whether it's $5 or $10, I insist that you pick this up, sit down with some friends, and live life inside of The Yahwg.","June 29, 2014","true","4.5"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

Saying that, you can end up with vastly different characterizations even using the same two people over and over again. The game supports up to 4 characters working in the world at once, and can in fact even be treated as a hotseat multiplayer game.\n\nThe choices and tasks you do in the game have deep and lasting effects, completely changing which avenues are open to you while keeping all avenues of adventure open. The Yawhg presents a rich and satisfying game, beautiful in looks and story. Filled with melancholy and whimsy the Yawhg is suitable for anyone looking for a good time.","November 17, 2014","true","1.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

That's just too steep a price for something so short, and so indefinable.\n\nThe slightly longer:\n\nThe game is fun to play. It's odd and quirky with an interesting visual style and often bizarre narrative. Without spoiling anything I'll just say that no matter how many times you play it you'll likely never really feel as if you know what in the hell is actually going on. That in itself doesn't bother me in the least, but the main reason I have to come down on the side of "not recommended" is the price, plain and simple. The game does offer replayability, and in fact sort of encourages it, being a point-and-click with a somewhat variable storyline and outcomes.\n\nAnd maybe you and a group of drunken friends will get some laughs, or be moved to have deep philisophical discussions of the kind that only drunken friends can have, but when all's said and done (which will take very little actual time), your experience with the game may well resemble the experience you'll have the next morning. You'll have a slight headache, and some dim recollection that something meaningful may have happened, and then you'll try to forget the whole thing and get on with your day.\n\nIf it drops to half price, sure, give it a whirl, but for 10 bucks you can sit this one out and, if you're so inclined, learn everything that can possibly be learned about it by watching a 5 minute video on Youtube, because that's about how much entertainment you'll get in a typical playthroughl anyway.","March 14","false","2.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

The straight lack of variety is what kills this title for me.\nSadly my ♥♥♥♥♥ doesn't end there, as being a lazy console port also throat-punched my inner child. You really couldn't remove the "press A" prompts? I really have to hold a button down to exit? Come on, give us a proper menu. Finally: Multiplayer - or lack thereof. Who in Robocop's name plays local multiplayer on PC?

Playing by yourself you'll likely have encountered every possible scenario, or at least have a good idea of what you need to do to get whichever ending you want, after a couple quick playthroughs.  That's where friends come in.  Friends add a layer of challenge to the game, because you can be assured that friends will be the ones to trample all your hopes and dreams of getting a good ending.  Sometimes you can get everyone to work together and other times there'll be that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friend who just wants to do everything in their power to try and make sure everything goes down in flames.  Friends are the random variables that make The Yawhg fun and increase the play time of the game.\nA single playthrough normally doesn't take too long, but again that all depends on how much time you spend talking over the decisions you need to make and laughing (or crying) over the results you reap from said decisions.\nOverall for a $10 game it has a lot of playability (if you play with friends).

It's a really simple concept: something bad's going to happen in six weeks, but you're not going to worry about that, there's hunting to do in the forest, patients to tend at the hospital, and malicious hedges to confront!\nYou play a minimum of two characters (up to four) playing with friends is as easy as passing the keyboard (or controller) back and forth. Gameplay is simple, you choose an area of the city that you want to spend your week at, and then you choose what you want to do at that location. For instance, at the palace, you can choose to do administration work or attend a ball. Each activity will raise different stats (physique, finesse, charm, mind, magic, wealth). Random events at each location will also raise or lower certain stats, often, you will be asked to make a choice during these events. Whether you pass or fail seems to depend on stats some of the time and on random rolls other times. The game mixes comedy and horror in a way that reminds me of Welcome to Night Vale with a pinch of Princess Maker 2 and the art style of Don't Starve or a Roald Dahl book. It's funny, dark, and at times very disturbing, and it frequently flip flops between funny and horrifying moments in the space of seconds (the endings are particularly prone to this).\nYes, The Yawhg is pretty short, a single playthrough can take anywhere from ten to twenty minutes (or longer if you're playing with friends) and you will be seeing repeat events quite often, but the game has a ton of different endings, and each playthrough tells a different story.\nIn short, if you like interactive fiction, a bit of comedy with your horror, or maybe you're just looking for something unique, The Yawhg is well worth the full price.","February 28, 2014","true","1.3"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

It's beautiful and it has a great core idea, but it's awfully short and unfulfilling.\n\nThe "unique story" is far from unique and it gets repetitive on the second play-through. It is also pretty shallow and the fate of the characters often seems to ignore their background and your efforts (for example, a werewolf that killed a lot of people can kind of live happily ever after, but a person who had a normal life and became the leader of the survivors may go insane and drink him/herself to oblivion; not to mention a hunter dying of hunger in the woods or a person who spent all the time tending sick people at the hospital not being able to act as a doctor after the Yawhg). And just when you think that you're going to have any real impact on the story, it turns out that the game is over and you can only start from the beginning, hoping to come along a line of text that you haven't yet seen.\n\nFurthermore, the characters don't meet each other and not all of their actions result in changes to the whole town that can be experienced by the rest of the protagonists. I played the game alone and I really can't imagine it being more fun with more people, because you just don't interact with them in any way. You can have some laughs about the choices each of you makes, but there's no actual co-op play - you do what you want with your character and you hope that his or her skills will be useful in the end.\n\nFinally, I don't see any improvements and/or fixes coming to The Yawhg. There are no game options whatsoever, so you can't change the resolution, or sound, or anything; alt-tabbing and window mode workarounds bug the game. Besides the local co-op, there is no option to play with someone else, because, according to the developer, "online multiplayer would be silly and underwhelming". There was a word of a "MASSIVE free expansion", but nothing has been heard about it since 2014. The game could've at least had some achievements to keep me interested for a bit longer, but it seems like it was too "silly" to include such things. The final nail in the coffin is the ridiculously high price for a game that's completed in 10 minutes and only pretends to offer a high replay value.","January 23","false","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In the end, I decided on a no because, while it is in equal measures unique, fun, and visually appealing, The Yawhg is, quite frankly, not worth the asking price.\n\nOn on hand, I really want other people to experience the Yawhg's interactive story. The art is a delight to look at, the writing, although brief, is clever, and most importantly, It's fun, especially if you sit at a computer with a couple friends and play it as a co-op.\n\nOn the other hand, the game is too short. And I say this as someone who will happily shell out money for short, high-quality games. A playthrough of The Yawhg will last 10-15 minutes at best. You could argue that this is because The Yawhg is meant to be played multiple times, but after five playthroughs, which only took me an hour, I felt like I had seen everything there was to see.\n\nThe "randomized" events are not randomized enough (for example, --mild spoiler-- if you go to the hospital at a certain point in time, your event will always, always be the patient with the sores, which leads into the same chain of events that last the rest of the game). In an even bigger flaw for a game trying to accomplish what The Yawhg is, there also aren't nearly enough events, which is why I felt like I had seen at least 90% of them by the fifth playthrough.\n\nMore of a subjective complaint, and another mild spoiler, but I found the ending to be a letdown. Not just in the "wait... that's it? The game is already over??" sense, but also because I felt like the narrative leading to the ending didn't fit what happened at the end. I do realize that it was intentionally misleading, but just because it was intentional doesn't mean it was carried out well.\n\nI love games as a storytelling medium, and I'm so on board with what The Yawhg was trying to do, but it fell short in almost every area. If it had significantly more content, or if it cost $5 instead of $10, I'd be badgering everyone I know to buy it. As it stands, I'd save your money and wait for someone else to come along with a better execution of this very cool concept.","April 4, 2014","false","2.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I don't think I'm equipped to choose as a person living in this world would. It's not roleplaying, because I don't know which role I'm playing. Consequences to these choices are often bizarre and do not create what I'd call a coherent consistent world that's reacting to my actions - simple hunting trip may leave you a crazed mass murderer, while pushing a nobleman does nothing but reward you.\nIt's possible these play out differently based on your stats, but the game is simply too short to learn any kind of consistent expectation pattern.\nIn the end, it's all just random and it doesn't matter what you pick, you just do. I didn't feel needed, like the game could just go on for the few minutes and show me the results just the same.\nI couldn't care less about the people of the town, if they rebuild after the storm or anything else - there's no time and no plot that would make me attached to anything.\n\nThe visuals are nice, the music is pleasant. The controls and UI are TERRIBLE! (no options and I can't use the mouse?! What.)\nI don't even feel like spending another five minutes on another playthrough, it's just...not worth it.

The problem is that after you've played it a couple of times, the random events begin to repeat, and you get the sinking feeling that you've already seen all that there is to see.

I must issue an apology to Gone Home, for it is not the most overrated game of 2013.  That title belongs to The Yawhg.\n\nI'll try and start by saying some nice things about it.  The art is lovely, and the music is appropriate and enjoyable.  Oh, and it doesn't overstay it's welcome.  It took me all of 12 minutes to finish my first playthrough.\n\nAnd it's a good thing my following playthroughs also lasted 12 minutes each, because that allowed me to better understand just how mechanically shallow this game is.  You (and maybe some freinds) take control of two to four characters living in a villiage that's six full weeks away from being sacked by the titular Yawhg.  You spend each week engaged in one of 16 different activities at one of eight different locations.  These activities will reward the character with stat upgrades, followed by a Visual Novel style scenario with two choices that can either grant additional stat points or take points away.  The scenarios themselves vary from day, but aren't very deep or engaging.\n\nSadly, no matter what you do, the Yawhg will level your hometown, forcing the survivors to rebuild.  This is where your pre-Yawhg stat-building comes into effect.  Each player character now has to take a role in rebuilding the town, and their performance in the choosen role is dependant their stats and other pre-Yawhg actions.  A character who built up a large magic stat will perform wonderfully as a conjuror, while someone with an abundance of charm will make a natural leader.  After a brief epilogue, the game ends.\n\nAnd that's it.  That is all 12 minutes.  The game justifies it's existance by billing itself as some sort of multiplayer party game, with four players taking turns at the hotseat.  There's some replayability to be had, since certain events are dependant on the outcomes of other player actions, but these rarely effect the outcome.  In fact, barely anything affects the outcome.  The Yawhg smashes things up no matter what you do, and all your efforts amount to is how soundly the rebuilding effort goes.  The Yawhg is a Multiplayer Visual Novel that lacks both the gameplay mechanics for a deep multiplayer experience and the emotionally charged story of a good Visual Novel.\n\n2/10","September 26, 2014","false","2.5"," 30 of 56 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","30","56","0","4"

Putting the game into windowed mode also breaks the game.\n\n- This means you can not adjust the sound for the game as tabbing out of the game at all breaks it and even if you set the volume then reset the game to fix the game from breaking due to you tabbing out to adjust the volume in the sound mixer, the sound levels keep resetting themselfs every time.\n\n- No resolution options.\n\n- No replayability.\n\n- You should in theory be able to play the game over Skype with your friends as the game is simply choice based but due to the bugs the game has, this is simply not possable which is really disapointing.

It's also an easy game to share with friends or partners that don't normally play games (but you may wonna screen it a few times before you play it with younger children, there is some darker content there). It has funny and bleak moments, good writing, cute images, beautiful music, and it's good at what it sets out to do: It crates an interesting scaffold for player driven stories, and plays DM at the decision making moments. Which also means that most of the enjoyment comes from what you put into it.\n\nBecause your characters start off as completely blank canvases, the fun will be very short-lived if you are just trying to "win". Instead pick a backstory or at least an archetype for them, and invest them with some motivations. This further serves to make the (moderate) amount of content feel much more expansive. There are frequent skill checks dictating the outcome of choices and events, but the developers have managed to allow for some entertaining "arbitrary" results, where the game succesfully imitates a sometimes benevolent and sometimes evil DM punishing or rewarding the players and pushing the game in different directions.\n\nAnd yes, there are many branching and converging paths with fun (or horrid) unexpected results down the line, but even within an hour of playing you will start running into repetitions. Which matters little if you are playing with friends and roleplaying different characters, but will probably become boring fast for one person playing alone.\n\nIn short, if you're with a friend trying to decide what to do for the evening, and if you like a bit of roleplaying, this is a good (and much cheaper) alternative to going out for a movie. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, and plan to invite more friends to accidentally poison the town's water system with mutating substances, teach the king how to satisfy the queen and become addicted to strength poisons, all before the Yawhg arrives.","May 7, 2015","true","1.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

My statement to them is that they are probably monotonous in their play style.  If you play this game trying to maximize your character, it turns into a boring game quickly.  This is a game for adventurousness and sometimes crazy play styles will actually make a much more successful and interesting ending.  Those who played the game through 3 times are judging a game almost by the tutorial.

The Yawhg is a very short game, but there are many different options and choices that allow this game to be pretty long. You have the choices of your characters, places you visit, and decisions you make. With all of these options, you can continue to keep playing this game over and over again and get many different endings. I have played 0.2 hours, and already completed two of the endings. So, yes, this game can be short, but if you keep playing it to find the alternate endings, it can end up being a pretty long game. I recommend this game, if you like short gameplay with many alternate endings.

You can finish a session in under 5 minutes. For the price, I would heavily recommend watching someone else play it.\n\nThere is also very little gameplay to speak of. Your character accrue Attributes for each choice you make. Each location gives you a fixed Attribute boost and then a choice to expand upon it (there is usually a positive gain). At the end of the game, you will have to make a choice - the outcome of which depends on the choices you made. This means that, from a gameplay perspective, it is incredibly shallow - since every location gives you a fixed benefit at the start, simply maximising it will let you power through to "win the game". I, in fact, could list what locations to visit to win the game right now but that would be exceedingly heartless. But I could and that fact should display how shallow it is.\n\nStory-wise, there is some continuity from one day to another but in general, there is not much connectivity. This is to be expected between characters, the point of the story is to display days lived out in the lives of these arbitrary characters in this city. However, the fact that there is very little connectivity within the events of any individual storyline basicly renders most of the events as stand-alone vignettes that could have happened to any other character and NOT the character you chose. In other words, unless you get one of the continuity-based events (which still only really leak into the next week's event), your character does not have a developing personal storyline, just a sequence of events that happened to happen to him/her.\n\nA final point on the gameplay as it relates to the story is that you don't know the effects of your actions beforehand. So, for at least the first time you see an event, there is an element of guesswork where you have to guess whether or not the thing you intended to happen will happen. Luckily, the game's events are very simple and there isn't a lot (if any) complexity to the story. It also happens to repeat itself a lot. In fact, on my third or fourth playthrough I happened to have already seen most of the events that were offered to me.\n\nA positive point is that the game's narration between weeks is atmospheric. Another positive point is that it has very good and fitting music (in my opinion).\n\nFor these reasons, I would suggest NOT BUYING THIS GAME. Instead, watch someone else play it - you will get the same experience. Watch a run-through if you think that's an exaggeration. Stay away from purchasing game. Look at it, note what it attempts to do and then move on. It is nowhere remotely worth the money (except for the music, which as I said before, is pretty good in my opinion).","February 28, 2014","false","1.0"," 43 of 83 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","43","83","0","0"

Are they kidding? What on EARTH makes them think a random game with little gameplay involved is going to be worth 10 dollars?\n\nHere's the game. You pick anywhere from 1-4 characters. You send them to a random location, get a random stat increase, which, considering there is no battle system whatsoever, is merely to decide how successful you are at future random stat increases... then 6 turns later, you choose a profession for your character(s), and the game decides if you were lucky enough to merit a happy or sad ending. Pretty lame, huh? Control wise? If you alt tab out of the game to lower the volume because the music gets really dull after awhile, the game crashes. And there is no option to mute in game. In fact, no option menu at ALL! You can play it, or play something else. This game doesn't WANT to be muted or windowed or any of that. That is frankly, an insult to gamers. I should be able to reduce the loud volume of your game. That's just standard practice, you terrible programmers you.\n\nLook, for further reasons not to get this game? Zoe Quinn is listed in their thank you section when you complete the game. If that isn't a reason to run far the hell away from this game, I don't know what is. Don't even bother to wait for a sale, no amount of money makes this worth a look. Even at a 90% discount, you're still looking at a buck for this, and a buck is like 99 cents too expensive for a 10 minute reading exercise. It's not even worth the trading cards.

The Yawhg isn't a bad game, in fact the ideas behind the game and the execution are very sound. The problem is that this really shouldn't be a paid product. The Yawhg feels and plays like a free flash game, and ironicly is no where near as good as other Flash games of this type.\n\nUnlike the interactive fiction games you find on Kongrigate The Yawhg isn't really a single player game, rather is basicly a digital Cards vs. Humanity type experience (i hope that makes sense). The Yawhg is turnbased, with each turn repersenting a week Players take turns selecting what they will do on any given week, after 7 weeks a great disaster (the titualr Yawhg) will befall the city and using the skills you've learned throughout the last 7 weeks will try to repair the town in the best way you can. the idea being that the event's pre-Yawhg will be so wacky that players will be able to laugh and have a good time and all the post-Yawhg stuff will be really sad and dramatic. In practice though it's horibly broken, the way the game is structured with it's stat system means that after about one playthrough you'll have no problem easily maxing out a stat to win at the end. This would be fine if the random events at the core of the game kept you guessing, but they don't. Not because there bad or anything but because there are so few of them. I bet that if you played the game with four players one you would see everything this game had to offer. So in other words the game has no replay value what so ever and in the end for a game that costs $10 that's unacceptable.\n\nIt may sound like The Yawhg is the worst thing ever but it's not. It clear that the developers put a lot more heart and soul into it then... other games *cough* Call of Duty *cough* and i would love to see a game like this with a lot more random events. But The Yawhg just feels unfinished, both as a regular video game and as the party based experience it WANT'S to be. Meaning i can't recomend playing 10 or even 1 dollers on The Yawhg, becing as it clearly shouldn't be a paid product.\n\nNice art though.","July 23, 2014","false","1.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Graphics?  This game is entirely un-animated and the still images consist completely of low-res cartoons.  Gameplay?  You pick options off a menu.  Music?  One guitar.  Story?  You will finish it in less than a half hour.\n\nAnd yet The Yawhg is probably worth twice its $10 asking price.  In a market saturated with "gameplay advancements," "4K resolution," "roleplaying elements," and hundred-hour lengths, very few game developers stop to ask themselves whether they are using these tools to do something worth doing.  The Yawhg does something worth doing and does not need any of these tools to do it.\n\nTo nitpick the game's description, The Yawhg is not a "Choose Your Own Adventure."  Choose Your Own Adventure books very rarely had multiple main characters or stats to track.  The Yawhg is a /Gamebook,/ and while these were great fun in the 80s before we had real branching-path video games, today this is the best possible format for the medium.  The Yawhg is a perfect example of the synergy of right tools and right task, and it is worth the time of anyone who enjoys a good interactive story.  I suppose you might call this a visual novel -- I don't know, really, I feel like genre has become largely irrelevant in describing video games.\n\nThe story of The Yawhg is different every time you play it, so I can't comment on its quality universally, but if you find yourself telling a story you don't care for, it will only last for 20 more minutes.  Suck it up and then start a new one.  I still recommend you finish the playthrough, however, because what comes to pass may surprise you.\n\nMore like this, please, industry.

I finished four (4) complete playthroughs in under an hour and saw many repeats.\n\nMore detailed review (based on the singleplayer experience):\n\nThe Yawhg is not so much a choose-your-own-adventure story (there is very little narrative, and your characters are gamepieces - not people) as it is a short opportunity to build up a couple of characters' stats in a short time to fulfill the game's hidden requirements.  There are four characters from whom to choose, but the only difference among them seems to be the appearance - I didn't notice any difference in events or stats.  As a single player, the game will ask you to choose two to four characters to play, and your goal is to raise their stats (there are six stats: physique, finesse, etc.).\n\nFor each turn, you will send each character to a place on the map to do a task.  There are eight locations and two possible tasks at each, so sixteen tasks in total from which to choose each turn, but two characters cannot be at the same location at the same time.  Each task will raise or lower one or more of your stats, but the only way to know what a task will affect is through trial and error.  Most tasks will also trigger a short text-based "event," which may allow you to choose your character's response and further affect their stat gain/loss.  To be clear, as a fan of both visual novels and choose-your-own-adventure-type games, the game's systems are *not* the reason I am not recommending it.\n\nThe problem comes from the fact that the game only consists of six weeks (each turn is a whole week).  This means that you only have six opportunities to raise each character's stats before the Yawhg appears (off-screen) and wrecks the town (again, off-screen).  At that point, you are given a choice of roles for each character to take in the rebuilding process; again, there are no explanations or listed stat requirements, so you just kind of guess.  Finally, the game checks to see if your character's stats are high enough to meet its invisible requirements, and you get a couple of epilogue slides reflecting your characters' success/failure and their fates afterwards.\n\nThat's it.  Six turns, a guess, and an epilogue.  So, each playthrough is EXTREMELY short to begin with, and then there is the fact that although the game supposedly has something like 100-200 unique events (I'm not arguing that it doesn't), you will see a lot of repeats in each playthrough, so subsequent playthroughs are not as exciting.  When I first played the game, I did 3 full playthroughs: the first using 2 characters, the second using all 4, and the third using 3 just to be thorough.  All 3 playthroughs took me a combined *32 minutes*.  Thinking that maybe I missed something or was in a bad mood that day, I waited some time, then played it once more before posting this review.  Again, maybe 10 minutes, and I'm pretty sure that all but one of the events and the two ending cards were repeats.\n\nTo finish, I hate to post a negative review for anything, but I just can't recommend this game at its $10 asking price given the dirth of content.  If you can get it for <$5 and plan on playing with friends, by all means go ahead: the art is unique and interesting, the music is nice, and I like the general concept -- there's simply not enough here to keep a person busy for even a single hour (and again, this is from someone who enjoys text- and menu-based games).

It can be played by just one person, you then control 2 to 4 characters for each of the weeks, or up to 4 people can control an individual character.\n\nIn essence, you select a character and send them to a location each 'week'. There you will get a random event with two choices, which will have a certain effect on the character that can increase or decrease stats.\nAt the end of the game, the last choice you make is weighed against the stats to see what happens.\n\nWhere this game shines however is in how everything interacts. The choices are fairy-tale like whimsical, and as you play it you realise everything interconnects, so you are actually building a short but internally coherent story, that can be different every time.\n\nThe game also has a really beautiful and fitting soundtrack. It is not offered on Steam alas, but you can find it on Bandcamp. I definitely recommend picking it up, too.\n\nHOWEVER, and it's potentially big problem for the full price -- the game is short. You will have seen almost all it has to offer in four or five ten-minute playthroughs. At the current discounted price of 50% I can recommend it, but it just falls short of a recommendation at the full cost.","July 2, 2014","true","0.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Each job comes with stat upgrades and varying events that are at their best when they relate to each other: something that happens to one character can have an effect on what happens to another character later. Generally, the outcome of an event depends on whether you made a choice that your current stats will support: physique, finesse, mind, charm, magic, and wealth. Then the Yawgh comes, then there's another round that determines if the group has won or lost the game, and then each character gets their own ending. The writing is really nice, surprising at times, and the music supports it well.\n\nYou can easily play this game on the couch with up to 4 players, just pass the controller/keyboard around (or connect more controllers), but of course you can also control all of the characters yourself. We did three quite enjoyable couch play-throughs on another account, and they took about half an hour each.\n\nIt is not difficult to win this game. We wanted to play it more than once because one time is clearly not enough to see all the different things that can happen, and to reach all of the endings would take many more. Events start to repeat at some point, noticably so on our third game, but since there are choices and stats involved, many consequences of known events are still unknown.\n\nThis is a good game.\n\nThis game runs on my old Windows XP computer. Since texts are short and only move forward when you push a button, it is suited for learners of English if they have someone to explain the vocabulary ("leeches", "lutes" and "cantrips" aren't exactly basic vocabulary).","February 2","true","0.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The art is great, the music is divine, and the sheer novelty of experiencing an interactive story with friends is endearing. I definitely recommend this game, but keep in mind that it might not be for everyone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Futurato/recommended/269030/","Futurato","Futura&!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Futurato/","610 products in account","Damian Sommer and Emily Carroll’s The Yawhg is easily the most beautiful piece of choose-your-own-adventure fiction ever published. Carroll’s indie comics superstardom is immensely deserved and her work here depicts a wonderfully colorful world with a sensitive fairy tale look, defined not only by the setting, but by the flourish of the visual interface and of her distinctive hand lettering. Sommer and Carroll’s writing is whimsical, amusing, and mysterious, all in good measure. Ryan Roth’s shifting soundtrack feels perfectly of this world without being overbearing. As a production, The Yawhg is an aesthetic triumph.\n\nAs a game, its success is tempered. The Yawhg tells a story that would have benefitted from more prose. Completing one cycle in the coming and going of the apocalyptic Yawhg event takes only a few minutes. The random events are interesting but never deep, always dropping a choice in your lap before you know it. Every encounter is succinct to a fault, eschewing any sort of satisfying narrative exploration for an exceedingly quick presentation. Some choices and events will affect future encounters for other members of your party in different areas of the world, which is quite impressive. Still, the number of possible events is not astoundingly numerous, and given the short length of each “run,” events may repeat themselves as early as the second playthrough, before they’ve even vacated your short-term memory.\n\nPlaying the game with other people does somewhat alleviate the problems I’ve mentioned. It’s a joy to actually play a choose-your-own-adventure that actually allows for multiple people. Seeing the consequences of certain events weave between characters controlled by different people leads to some wonderful reactions. Chatter will do a lot to lengthen each go-around. As a social game, it’s quite nice. However, hosting or attending the right party that wants to kill an hour playing something like The Yawhg is an uncommon occurrence at best. And when it comes down to it, I prefer to immerse myself in the twists and turns of a good narrative and the beauty of great visuals all by my lonesome.\n\nFor me, the pleasures of The Yawhg are few – too few for me to heartily recommend. It is not a bad game, but it is a game that caters to a group of people who often play games and experience art together. It’s just not a game for someone like me.","December 30, 2014","false","1.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The game requires minimal resources, playing out much like a "choose your own adventure" story, with up to four characters engaging in stat-building activities over the course of six turns.  After the sixth turn, the calamity known as the Yawhg strikes the town, and the characters take on roles in the rebuilding, choosing roles that rely on their strengths.  The game takes about fifteen minutes, making it ideal as a quick party game.\n\nEach turn allows your character to spend time engaged in a stat-building activity that grants first a static bonus (for example, practicing alchemy always adds +2 to your character's Magic and +1 to your character's Mind), and then gives a random encounter to which you choose how your character reacts.  The results of this choice may be surprising, and choices you make can come back to effect things for you... or other characters... in future random encounters.\n\nAs well as an overall ending for the city -- based on how suited each character was to the roles they filled -- each character has an individual ending story that is affected by numerous factors, including where they spent time and what their choices were.

The gameplay in The Yawhg is incredibly minimal, with the only real player input being what actions the characters take during the six week ingame cycle. The game instead focuses heavily on the story and world interactions your choices create.\nThe in depth details in The Yawhg are astounding with many in-game events big and small, hidden in obscure event pathways, based entirely on the skills you have bult up for your characters.\nBut because of skill and day limitations it may become extremely tiresome for many players to try and see some of the Yawhgs more inner secrets, as they may accidentally trigger a event to occur earlier than they wished, or even a different event than what is wished for to occur.\nThe main thing to keep in mind though when purchasing this game is this: Do you have any friends who live near you?\nIf yes then The Yawhg is a great game to play as its couch co-op focus can make for a fun and eventful time. If not and you also have no means of streaming events to friends and playing that way, you will find yourself playing a game for four on your ownsome, and as fun as the game can be, playing it by yourself can be a very tiresome experience.\nBasically buy this game if you like fun storytelling and have friends.","April 6, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a rather simple game, on it's face- you have between two and four characters. They have stats. You take them places to do stuff. Stuff raises or lowers their stats. There are eight locations to visit, and two things to do at each location. There are also scripted(but randomly chosen) events that may or may not happen at each place. For example, if you play Mr. Moss and go to the Arena and fight, you may encounter an ex-girlfriend who is dating one of the new fighters. If you handle the situation well, you get a boost in mind and charm. Every event is written impressively well (with a few minor typos here and there) and illustrated really well.\n\nIt's very easy to want to just dive in, play all four characters, and experience everything in a single run. I've done that twice nown and each time I feel like I missed out something. I recommend if you truly want to experience this game, play two characters at a time and really take your time with it. Contemplate your decisions, from both stat-centric and a roleplay-centric points of view.\n\nIn general, I highly recommend it. It's rare to me that a game shines in every aspect- concept, design, execution. 9.5/10. would buy again.","January 7, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The Yawhg is basically a game were up to 4 people (locally)pick a character and go to a location where you choose an action you would like to do for example pickpocketing. When you do the action some of your stats will increase. As well as you doing the action and getting stats for that you will also have a random encounter for example finding some lost townsfolk. These random encounters can decrease or increase your stats. After you choosing six locations in turns (one for every week) the Yawhg will come. After the Yawhg comes and the town is destroyed you have to choose a role such as builder how well you perform these roles will be affected by your stats. After everyone in the game has picked there role and told how well they did at it you will be told if you saved the town and shouldnt have any more issues with the Yawhg(good ending),survived(neutral ending) or if the town stays in ruin's(bad ending). Surprisingly in my opinion the more unique cool ending's(for your character) come if you get the bad ending for the town.\n\nAll in all The Yawhg is a fun game to play with friends. It has a unique art style and its replay value is very big because of the countless endings and random encounters. I think it is well worth its price especially if it is in a sale.","October 11, 2014","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I reccomend it to anyone if the price range is maybe $4-6 or if it ever adds more content.\n\nSo the Yawhg is a fantasy/fairy tale game where 2-4 players play as one of 4 color themed characters. In each round of the game every player takes a turn before control passes to the next player. In each player's turn there is a particular order or structure to the turn. First the player picks a place to go and picks from one of two pre-set actions for that location. For example the player can go to the "alchemy tower" and "brew potion" or "clean lab".  (They are limited by only being able to choose where no one else has gone yet on that turn.) The game then rewards you a stat bonus for your action (usually +2 to one stat and +1 to another) and then generates a particular scenario based on that selection. You are given a choice during that scenario and the game will tell you how your choice went. The outcome of this choice is frequently dependent on your stats. For example, brewing potions give you +2 magic and +1 mind. After that the game says that the other wizards are thowing a cantrip party (cantrips are low-level easily-cast spells). After hearing what some other people do you can decide to do a "simple trick" or "complex trick". If you don't have high enough of a magic stat and choose "complex trick", you end up hurting and embarrassing yourself in the process which then causes a -2 in charm. However successfully completing the complex trick may have given you rank among your peers in the form of +2 charm. Additionally, these scenarios are interlinked and frequently someone may do something in thier turn that causes another scenario to occur in another players turn. This is seen in the demon baby excerpts from the gameplay demo above. After several round of this "the yawhg" arrives. Without going into too much detail, your stats and one final choice determine the outcome of the town in this trying time. The town's fate is delegated to one of 3 options, the best of which is easily obtainable. Then the game gives each player a personal ending which is dependent on the town's ending, the player's stats, thier last choice, how they spent their time, and what scenarios happened to them. For example if you get the good town ending and spent a lot of time doctoring there are at least two specific doctor endings. But if you also happened to encounter a supernatural creature at some point, then you may get an ending where you try to wrap up loose end involving that encounter.\n\nIn the end, the number of outcomes and scenarios are limited and if you enjoyed the game you are left wishing there was more content to the game. (I particularly want an update or DLC). However, even after 7.5 hours on record playing this game, a new event occurred last time and a new ending. And we have yet to explore any of the towns subpar endings. This is a great game to buy on sale and then whip out to play with family or friends. It has easy intuitive menu and allows for any combination of controllers or keyboards. Players can assign both of thier characters to the same device and then pass the controller between them.","November 17, 2015","true","7.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The "Narrative" you make with other people you play with can shapes how the city looks at the end of the game, and how the characters you played as are affecteds after "The Yawhhg" descends upon the city. There are also slightly smaller "story-archs" that can occur during play that can effect what happens to other players before "The Yawhg" actually appears, such as the baby and  the bard in the gameplay demo. A small problem with this game however is that it isn't playable online exsactly, it's only local co-op where a single controller is used and is handed from one player to the next, but I've seen people play this on Twitch so that their freinds can play with them and see what's happening in game. Overall it's a great game that has lots of re-playabiliy, because it's events are randomly genereated from a list of things that can happen depending on shere you spend your week, and would give anyone that has freinds that come over something to play for hours at a time.","November 25, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Yawhg is basically a game were up to 4 people (locally)pick a character and go to a location where you choose an action you would like to do for example pickpocketing. When you do the action some of your stats will increase. As well as you doing the action and getting stats for that you will also have a random encounter for example finding some lost townsfolk. These random encounters can decrease or increase your stats. After you choosing six locations in turns (one for every week) the Yawhg will come. After the Yawhg comes and the town is destroyed you have to choose a role such as builder how well you perform these roles will be affected by your stats. After everyone in the game has picked there role and told how well they did at it you will be told if you saved the town and shouldnt have any more issues with the Yawhg(good ending),survived(neutral ending) or if the town stays in ruin's(bad ending). Surprisingly in my opinion the more unique cool ending's(for your character) come if you get the bad ending for the town.\n\nAll in all The Yawhg is a fun game to play with friends. It has a unique art style and its replay value is very big because of the countless endings and random encounters. I think it is well worth its price especially if it is in a sale.","October 11, 2014","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I reccomend it to anyone if the price range is maybe $4-6 or if it ever adds more content.\n\nSo the Yawhg is a fantasy/fairy tale game where 2-4 players play as one of 4 color themed characters. In each round of the game every player takes a turn before control passes to the next player. In each player's turn there is a particular order or structure to the turn. First the player picks a place to go and picks from one of two pre-set actions for that location. For example the player can go to the "alchemy tower" and "brew potion" or "clean lab".  (They are limited by only being able to choose where no one else has gone yet on that turn.) The game then rewards you a stat bonus for your action (usually +2 to one stat and +1 to another) and then generates a particular scenario based on that selection. You are given a choice during that scenario and the game will tell you how your choice went. The outcome of this choice is frequently dependent on your stats. For example, brewing potions give you +2 magic and +1 mind. After that the game says that the other wizards are thowing a cantrip party (cantrips are low-level easily-cast spells). After hearing what some other people do you can decide to do a "simple trick" or "complex trick". If you don't have high enough of a magic stat and choose "complex trick", you end up hurting and embarrassing yourself in the process which then causes a -2 in charm. However successfully completing the complex trick may have given you rank among your peers in the form of +2 charm. Additionally, these scenarios are interlinked and frequently someone may do something in thier turn that causes another scenario to occur in another players turn. This is seen in the demon baby excerpts from the gameplay demo above. After several round of this "the yawhg" arrives. Without going into too much detail, your stats and one final choice determine the outcome of the town in this trying time. The town's fate is delegated to one of 3 options, the best of which is easily obtainable. Then the game gives each player a personal ending which is dependent on the town's ending, the player's stats, thier last choice, how they spent their time, and what scenarios happened to them. For example if you get the good town ending and spent a lot of time doctoring there are at least two specific doctor endings. But if you also happened to encounter a supernatural creature at some point, then you may get an ending where you try to wrap up loose end involving that encounter.\n\nIn the end, the number of outcomes and scenarios are limited and if you enjoyed the game you are left wishing there was more content to the game. (I particularly want an update or DLC). However, even after 7.5 hours on record playing this game, a new event occurred last time and a new ending. And we have yet to explore any of the towns subpar endings. This is a great game to buy on sale and then whip out to play with family or friends. It has easy intuitive menu and allows for any combination of controllers or keyboards. Players can assign both of thier characters to the same device and then pass the controller between them.","November 17, 2015","true","7.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I won't say what the story is, but I will tell you it can be very powerful. The "Narrative" you make with other people you play with can shapes how the city looks at the end of the game, and how the characters you played as are affecteds after "The Yawhhg" descends upon the city. There are also slightly smaller "story-archs" that can occur during play that can effect what happens to other players before "The Yawhg" actually appears, such as the baby and  the bard in the gameplay demo. A small problem with this game however is that it isn't playable online exsactly, it's only local co-op where a single controller is used and is handed from one player to the next, but I've seen people play this on Twitch so that their freinds can play with them and see what's happening in game. Overall it's a great game that has lots of re-playabiliy, because it's events are randomly genereated from a list of things that can happen depending on shere you spend your week, and would give anyone that has freinds that come over something to play for hours at a time.","November 25, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First, let's discuss it's strengths.\n\nThe Yawhg is beautiful. The artwork is all fantastic and fits the theme of the game perfectly. The music and soundtrack of the game is haunting and wonderful. The gameplay is interesting and, at first, exciting. The story is enjoyable and satisfying.\n\nAnd now, the negative sides of the game. It's short. Not such a bad thing, but when coupled with the retail price, the sense of worth is a little low. I got 80 minutes of gameplay out of the game, which I did enjoy, though the price is a little high for my taste.  Next up, again, the gameplay. After one or two playthroughs of the game, the mechanics are no longer exciting as you can kind of see what's happening quite easily, meaning completion of the game can be easily "gamed" (if you know what I mean). The game also lacks achievements. Woah woah wait, that's not a bad thing right? Actually, I think in this case, it is. Achievements mean nothing, it's true, but I think, had The Yawhg had achievements, it would have added a heck of a lot more replayability as the achievements could direct your play, asking you to complete sub-stories, professions, and multiple side ideas which, after completion, many will not revisit.\n\nEither way, a really charming and lovely game.

On the one hand, it has about 100 minutes of gameplay, tops. On the other hand, it is an interesting and cohesive use of the medium to convey a specific idea. It uses a "choose your own adventure" style to allow each character you play to conduct different activities over the course of 6 turns. These activites grant or remove stats, and the stats you have determine how your character responds to different random events. At the end of the game, the stats help determine various outcomes for your character. It's a very, very simple and limited interface. However, the game is less interested in providing a compelling story than it is in demonstrating how the choices we make in life accumulate and ultimately create a story for us that makes sense only in retrospect. The relative meaninglessness of the stats in the game reflects the meaninglessness of our "stats" in our lives. At the end of the day, our lives are equally defined by choices and events beyond our control, and these both with have impacts on our lives and also the life of the community we inhabit. In conveying this idea, the gameplay and themes of this game are in perfect harmony and it makes for a memorable experience.","July 9, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

For some it's not worth the 9.99 USD, for me, it distills the very core of my interests: game narrative and mechanics.\n\nEven if you are unsure about it's short playthrough (and possible repetitiveness), try to get it on sales, and enjoy what The Yawhg has to offer.","September 17, 2014","true","0.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I played this with my SO and we had a great time, although the game is rather short (it took us about 15-30 minutes for each play-through). However, the length does add a little to the replay value, since more time went into the different branching paths. That being said, it's easy to start up and get into and each session is different than the last. The game does have controller support and the option to play with up to four people locally.\n\nI reccommend buying the game on sale to play with a friend.","November 3, 2015","true","16.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

This one is in the vein of choose your own adventure, ah my childhood, and does a great job at mixing up your choices and making the consequences matter. It hard to say too much about the game is its so short, spoiling how it plays out seems unfair.   You basically can play 1 to 4 people, though you can play any of that amount also by yourself.  You have 8 days to choose what to do. There's 8 to 10 locations in the town and each has 1 of 2 activities.  These don't change but the outcome are highly random and you will have to make choices during each daily action that has a stat effect then and one on the overall outcome of the game.\n\nIts brillant, and the music is hauntingly beautiful with it as some of the heart wrenching, funny outcomes.  The fact that i played though it twice in 30 minutes shouldn't disuade you from playing it.  I had a 75% off coupon which is why i bought it today but i think i could still recommend it whole heartedly at much closer to its actually asking price.  The fact that you can replay it many times over and might be a cool "game" to play with non-gamer friends or family is kinda a vaulable thing.\n\nLike all good games with choices it has sweet epilogues for each characters as well.","August 6, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Instead of yet another game that showers you with blocks of preformatted lines, this is an adventure, two of them. This has an enchantingly human story. The player chooses the course of two lives, how they build, how they grow or how they fail. It's not another high-budget super-graphical story like any of a thousand roleplay games, instead it feels much more like a choose-your-own-adventure story. The music is heartfelt, and the storylines feel involving, despite this being a relatively short game. The closest similarity I could find is with the Stanley Parable, but that does The Yawhg a disservice - the choices for the lives of the characters really do matter and they affect what ultimately happens at the story's end.

The Yawhg is an interactive story with an amazing soundtrack even if it only features a couple of songs. It provides a huge variety of random events so that each playthrough is a fresh new experience. Each game is pretty short with only 6 turns to the arrival of the titular Yawhg after which your choices will reflect the outcome in the aftermath of the Yawhg's destruction. You may play up to four characters at a time, with friends or alone. My only disappointment in this is that the 'multiplayer' option is only local not online.","April 5, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Don't you dare be put off by the low price or the people saying it's too short. This is a game that one can simply stop playing.\n\nIt has a fun, comedy board game style that will make you nostalgic and feel happy. The music is beautiful, and to top all that off there's the one unique point of this game that is done so well:\n\nIt's not about getting to the end, it's about enjoying what you have whilst you still have it. That, my friends, is a fantastic message about life. You're playing a fable! You simply don't lose the game.\n\nNow, people will play it for different reasons. At first, you play it to make sure there's a good ending. Overtime, you get this idea that actually it's not about that. You make moral choices, you choose your fate. What your character becomes is a reflection of how you play it, and trust me, there's some really great twists and turns to the game.\n\nMy favourite part is that what one player does directly influences what happens to the other, thus making it a team game. Play with your friends, play with yourself, it's fun both ways for different reasons. Top game of the season, game of the year so far for me.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?

It reminds me of FTL in that manner, but much more stripped down.\n\nDespite its replayability, it still could be considered a very short lived experience.\n\nIt requires a couple of things I'd hope to see in a patch.\n\nFirst, Online Co-Op, though I'm sure they are aware of that.\nSecond, being a Visual Novel at heart, it could really use a 'skip seen text' button, like most include.\nThird, Achievements. In-game challenges and rewards would be ideal, something like FTL has, but even just some steam achievements would really make this game. Usually they're just slapped on and add nothing, but this game could really use something to drive you to see more content. It's really easy to just play a few games, and then lose all the initiative to keep going. A few Goals so that you're not just meandering around town would be really nice.\nRight now I'm trying to destroy as many places in a single game as I can.\n\nEven just % content seen counter would add a lot.\n\nSo, to truly recommend it needs just a slight patch.

Bring a friend or 2 and you can be the dude and them the 2 chicks and you can just party for 6 weeks in the pub!\n\nUltimately this game is about knowing the apocalypse will come and choosing how you spend your remaining days; Effectively changing the end of your character, not so much the town or people in it.\n\nI'm sure I'm incredibly bias because Emily Carroll is my favorite artist/writer combo, but her signature style is very present in the... grimmer parts of the story, and I never thought there'd be music that compliments it all so well. Anyway, it's very offbeat yet classic fantasy, but well designed and like all of Emily's work, short-lived but worth going back to later.\n\nSo if you want a short, beautiful, uncomplicated experience you can get through while you're waiting for your hair to dry, or for your favourite show to download, or dinner to cook, then look no further.","June 22, 2014","true","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You really need at least one other player for the game to truly take off, and it works best with a full set.  The joy comes out of everyone's choices and motivations and goals bouncing off everyone else's and providing contrast - puppetmastering everyone for some kind of optimal result just isn't that interesting.  Shame it's local multiplayer only, then, but given how complex netcode can be, it's understandable.\n\nIn short, get this game if you can drag at least one friend in to play with you in real life.

You can control the outcome, but sometimes you have to take a chance, do something different, and see what happens.\n\nWARNING: This game will either draw you in or make you hate it.

The game is essentially for 1-4 players, each taking their turn of where to go during the week, what to do at said location, and how you respond to a random event. This process lasts for several weeks, around 6 or 8 I believe, before the "Yawhg" comes. After the Yawhg comes, the game sums up your ending randomly. While fun, witty, and comedic, the "adventure" that players go through is drastically short and is merely based on week to week events rather than the accumulative story. For $9.99 I would say the game is extremely short (lasting around 5-15 minutes depending on how fast you can read) and I would recommend it as a nice steam summer sale pick up. Other positive notes include pretty artwork, interesting scenarios, and a short-lived entertaining adventure game. I would give it a 5 out of 10.","February 28, 2014","true","0.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I've had a rich socialite who cares for nobody but himself spiral into a depression after seeing the horrors that the Yawhg results in.

"This game doesn't run on my PC." "This game breaks when I alt-tab." "This game crashes sometimes for no reason." "This game doesn't work with my monitor and cuts off the edges hurting playability." "Local co-op only is terrible for PC."\n\nHow could I recommend a game where all of the above can be true depending on your system and beliefs?\n\nI even encounter some of these problems and I still play A LOT of this game.\n\nBecause...the game is very very good. Seriously. Yes it only takes 10-20 minutes to run through the game, but the game is setup to be played many times. It is amazing the amount of depth they have managed to achieve with such simple design. This game is an art piece. When it works, it works very well. It is beautiful visually with excellent art choices for the still images. The soundtrack is fantastic with the same song managing to convey both happiness in the good endings and sadness in the bad endings and even horror in a rare combination of events. The mechanics are simple, intuitive, and very effective.\n\nThe crashes are frustrating, but I'd say they only happen 7% of the time. At least in my case. My family has recieved more enjoyment out of this $10 purchase then they would in a far more expensive movie purchase. I'd say if you are willing to risk the possibility of the problems I listed at the start don't hesitate; pick this up immediately. The developer is active as well and many of the issues may be resolved soon if they are not already.","March 12, 2014","true","11.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

First off, no online co op mode, which is weird to want but this would have been perfect for my friends and I to play over skype. The game gives you four characters to choose from, all very unique and different. You have six weeks before this "Yawhg" decends onto the world. Each turn you get to choose where your character decides to spend their week. Once you make a choice you then choose between two paths and two paths again, you get text for what your character does within these branching paths but this is the formula it sticks with. You gain (or lose) stats depending on your decisions. Once the six weeks are up the Yawhg appears and you have some choices after it does appear. At this point your characters stats and your own choice determine whether the characters and towns fate is positive or negative.\n\nFor the price I can't complain, I really need to try some of the other paths. It's definitely unique and something you won't get all too often.","March 1, 2014","true","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

On the surface it's a clever, succinct and skilfully woven series of actions, reactions and consequences. The art style is whimsical enough to temper the sometimes brooding prose and the music treads the line between contemplative and melancholic. It's funny and twisted and thoughtful, often all at the same time. For so brief a game, it really pulls you in.\n\nUpon nearing the finish you grow acutely aware of the weight of your actions, and the impact your decisions have had on the characters you’ve encountered. The desire to change the outcomes of your latest play-through will compel you to keep coming back. It’s a beautifully made and artfully executed “what if?” trap. For those still looking for the perfect outcome, something tells me there’s no such thing in The Yawhg. But then again, I guess that’s kind of the point?","March 1, 2014","true","1.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/visibleducts/recommended/269030/","visibleducts","VisibleDucts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/visibleducts/","1417 products in account","A beautiful game in all regards. A simple concept - you make choices for characters that have various effects and determine the outcome of the game. A concept that could easily be poorly done, boring, uninspiring. But The Yawhg is none of those things. Each game session is short - about ten minutes - a length that feels right, yet also leaves you (me) wanting more. So I play it again, this time making different decisions. And then again. And again.\nWere I to classify this game, it would be interactive fiction, or rather, interactive storytelling. Storytelling, to me, isn't as detached as 'fiction.' A storyteller is there, talking to you, weaving a story, involving you in a different way than fiction (and I mean reading fiction when I say fiction). Both inspire your imagination and involve you in the story, but one - to me - is more personal, one makes you feel more like you helped tell the story. Thus why I think interactive storytelling is more fitting.\nThe gameplay is sort of like ... simulation games that involve making a choice of what you do that week from various tasks, each one of them raising certaain stats . Princess Maker 2, Long Live the Queen, Spirited Heart -- games that have similar gameplay in that regard - but The Yawhg is not like any of those games in other respects. Just the mechanic of picking an activity that raises (or lowers sometimes) stats.\nAt the end of the game, depending on the events that happened, you find out what your choices ultilmately lead to. What consequences or benefits they had. And you're told about the effects on the individual characters as well.\n\nThat's a pretty rough descripton of the The Yawhg. Not because I described it poorly, but no decritption can convey the experience of this  game. I loved the art style and find it very fitting for the themes and story. I loved he writing, which this focusing on story telling, that's a good thing to love. Every aspect is equal in quality and the quality is outstanding. I'm stating this so it's clear I am not intending to say anyone is more responsible for The Yawhg being the work of art that it is. I love music. Music is key for me when it comes to developing atmosphere and evoking emotions. So with that in mind, the music of The Yawhg is so well done. I loved everything about the score (and the game, like I said, I'm music oriented, so think of this is being for all those people who thrive off music. I know people who thrive off writing in the same way I thrive off music,  and I can tell you every aspect of this game is in harmony and I hope if the deveopers were to read this, that it wouldn't come across as me downplaying all the oher aspects of the game. Super important to me, obviously, which is why I keep restating it.)\nThe song that plays during the end sequence is ... I can't imagine a song that would sound more fitting. It's a beautiful song and ...\n\nAll I can say is, if you like storytelling and interactive fiction/storytelling, and can enjoy a game that is short (but has a lot of replayability), I recommend this game with every recommending bone (it's a thing..) in my body. It's a work of art and everyone who worked on this -- I thank you for making this and giving it (releasing) to the world to experience and enjoy and  if all of you decide to colloborate again - I'll buy whatever you make. And I'll be watching out for projects in general that involve any of the developers/etc that worked on this game.\n\nIN SHORT, I give this the highest recommendation I can.","March 1, 2014","true","1.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Still fun, still cool, still recommend it! its just not as ground breaking as I was lead to believe.\n","July 1, 2014","true","2.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's a mix of light, cheerful art; joyful and dark story progression and survival. Beat the Yahwg by building up your characters into people able to take on anything!

This doesn't mean it's bad - it's quite good - but know what you're getting into when you buy it.  Basically it's a smart visual novel game for parties.\n\nTwo to four characters make choices, lead lives, and prepare as a strange threat - the Yawhg - approaches.  Doing things raises character stats and affects other elements of the game.  A magical experiment, a won gladiatorial event, an undifused bomb, all affect other characters.  When the disaster does happen, characters then choose their path after, which affects the end of the game.\n\nGameplay is pretty short - the game is meant to be replayed.  Graphics are decent, and the storybook look really works.  Music is great.\n\nSo the question on buying it is "do you want an experimental multiplayer story game."  If you do, this is for you.  Otherwise, its not for you - but I consider it a good game.","September 20, 2014","true","1.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's a short game, a regular playthrough might take you about 15 minutes or less, but it has one of the highest replay values I've ever seen in a game. It's one of those games where your decisions matter but it's more like a "Choose your own adventure" book turned into a game. Depending on what you do you will get different endings, but getting a good ending for your town doesn't necesarily mean that the characters you use will get a good ending and viceversa. But even when your characters get a good ending there might be something bittersweet about it.\n\nThe art style is beautiful and the soundtrack is great.

The process is entertaining and the open-ended gameplay offers a unique experience every playthrough though, after a few rounds, the consequences of your decisions become predictable.\n\nThough it's possible to play solo, The Yawhg really comes alive when playing with others. With a lack of traditional failure conditions - rather, the ending is pretty passive and always influenced by your decisions during the game - it's not overly competitive which is appropriate for the style of a game like The Yawhg.\n\nHowever, though there's ammo for a handful of unique playthroughs, The Yawhg doesn't offer the same playtime as other games in it's price range. Nonetheless, if you have a soft spot for a beautifully-crafted art style portraying a charming co-operative narrative, you'll probably love The Yawhg.\n\n[NOTE] If you decide against picking up The Yawhg for yourself, be sure to check out The Yogscast's playthrough!

It is sort of a multiplayer choose-your-own-adventure game. Each person chooses a character and then chooses where they want to spend one of their 6 weeks before the Yawhg arrives. The beuty lies in the amount of variation you can get therein. Will you stay at the bar and get drunk all week? Will you go to the palace and dance the nights away? Will you don a mask and fight crime in the back alleys for the slums? All these options are available to you.\n\nAfter choosing what you will be doing that week, a small story is told to you for that week, maybe while fighting crime you meet someone who turns you into a vampire! Maybe during your work at the hospital hundreds of leeches break free! While they are limited, the story elements of each location are different from each other and highly entertaining. During the story part, your stats will change (Physique, Mind, Magic, Finesse, etc). These will be important after the Yawhg arrives.\n\nThe most interesting thing about the story elements is that they have a chance of crossing over to other areas. If the aformentioned leeches break free from the hospital, they may spill over into the slums! Or maybe even the lake! The dryad you met in the woods may show up in the arena! The combinations are truely interesting and make the game even more fun to explore.\n\nAfter the Yawhg arrives, you are tasked to rebuild by taking on one of many important (or not so important) roles around the town. Will you band the remaning townsfolk together and lead? Will you try to use your might to build? Will you use your magical aptitued to brew potions? Beware, though, because if you do not have the proper stats (gained from the story parts of the game) you will fail in your attempt to help, and you will hinder the rebuilding.\n\nAfter everyone has chosen a role they are given their last story segment and you are told if the town will press on after the Yawhg or if it will ultimately fall to ruin.\n\nI would like to see more stories added or mod support so that the community could add their own stories.\n\nThe game is overall fun for a group of friends, and trying to get the best ending can be challanging and a true team effort. I would highly reccomend this game with 2 or 3 friends that are will to experiment in gameplay and work together.","July 26, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Averything happen in turns and random events, shaping your character's evolution and leading to their sucess or failure at the conclusion.\n\nThings to keep in mind if you want to buy this game:\n\n1- It's really short. Really, really short. Takes about 7 turns to finish one gameplay.Then you get the conclusion and can start again. Since events are random, you'll probably find new things when playing for the second (and third, fourth, etc) time, but things start to repeat soon.\n\n2- It's best if played with friends. Not online, but at your side, using the same computer. You can have up to four players and I could only have real fun with The Yawhg after I invited others to play with me. Like I said before, very similar to a board game.\n\nWith that in mind, chances are you won't be surprised and will end up having fun. The visuals and songs are really well done too. It's not worth a lot of money and I think would be best as a Ipad game, but it's a nice idea. Not for everyone, though. Makes me wish they would release an expansion, with more events, locations, etc. As it is now, I fear is way too short and might get repetitive too soon. Still, I had fun, and that's what counts.","July 2, 2014","true","3.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's a short game, a regular playthrough might take you about 15 minutes or less, but it has one of the highest replay values I've ever seen in a game. It's one of those games where your decisions matter but it's more like a "Choose your own adventure" book turned into a game. Depending on what you do you will get different endings, but getting a good ending for your town doesn't necesarily mean that the characters you use will get a good ending and viceversa. But even when your characters get a good ending there might be something bittersweet about it.\n\nThe art style is beautiful and the soundtrack is great.

This would make the game very boring, if that were actually relevant, which it isn't.\n\nThis is where the game's brilliant aspects come in. The random events through the game provide witty, at times completely unexpected (and being genuinely surprised is something I very rarely experience in games) and simply hilarious moments. You will find yourself just playing through the game (which takes less than 30 minutes in single player) time and time again trying to discover new random events, possible outcomes and resulting consequences.\nAnd then there is the ending. All your choices tying together to decide the fate of the village, followed by (perhaps more importantly) the conclusion of each character's own story based on the chosen tasks and random events, once more providing several outcomes to be discovered.\nIn this regard this game, with it's "choose your own adventure" feeling despite the preset timeline, is exactly what alot of the bigger RPG titles are lacking realized on a smaller stage.\nExpecially the multiplayer (which is limited to hot seat, but quite frankly a online multiplayer wouldn't make sense anyway) adds even more excitement and laughter to the game. If you have the option it is very rewarding.\n\nAll this combined with a lovely animation and very soothing soundtrack in my opinion make this game most definetely worth the time and money.","May 13, 2014","true","4.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It is sort of a multiplayer choose-your-own-adventure game. Each person chooses a character and then chooses where they want to spend one of their 6 weeks before the Yawhg arrives. The beuty lies in the amount of variation you can get therein. Will you stay at the bar and get drunk all week? Will you go to the palace and dance the nights away? Will you don a mask and fight crime in the back alleys for the slums? All these options are available to you.\n\nAfter choosing what you will be doing that week, a small story is told to you for that week, maybe while fighting crime you meet someone who turns you into a vampire! Maybe during your work at the hospital hundreds of leeches break free! While they are limited, the story elements of each location are different from each other and highly entertaining. During the story part, your stats will change (Physique, Mind, Magic, Finesse, etc). These will be important after the Yawhg arrives.\n\nThe most interesting thing about the story elements is that they have a chance of crossing over to other areas. If the aformentioned leeches break free from the hospital, they may spill over into the slums! Or maybe even the lake! The dryad you met in the woods may show up in the arena! The combinations are truely interesting and make the game even more fun to explore.\n\nAfter the Yawhg arrives, you are tasked to rebuild by taking on one of many important (or not so important) roles around the town. Will you band the remaning townsfolk together and lead? Will you try to use your might to build? Will you use your magical aptitued to brew potions? Beware, though, because if you do not have the proper stats (gained from the story parts of the game) you will fail in your attempt to help, and you will hinder the rebuilding.\n\nAfter everyone has chosen a role they are given their last story segment and you are told if the town will press on after the Yawhg or if it will ultimately fall to ruin.\n\nI would like to see more stories added or mod support so that the community could add their own stories.\n\nThe game is overall fun for a group of friends, and trying to get the best ending can be challanging and a true team effort. I would highly reccomend this game with 2 or 3 friends that are will to experiment in gameplay and work together.","July 26, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

But, The Yawhg is without a doubt a visual storytelling experience that anyone who enjoys 'choose your own adventure' novels or games will love. The gameplay is minimal, you choose two to four characters (best suited for multiplayer, maybe) and choose where they will spend their single week of six. In these six weeks, the Yawhg, a mythical beast who never shows it's face to the player, will attack the town and destroy everything you've become familiar with. Because the actual weeks pass by in maybe 15 minutes, multiple playthoughs are a must. And hard to resist. You can choose to spread out your experience, attacking everything to do, or you can grind out your magic, charm, mind, and so forth at one location six weeks in a row. However, the multiple endings find a way to beat your system faster than you learned to cheat theirs. Spending time bartending for charm, you end up an alcoholic, dead from your own love. Grinding out magic at the alchemist tower leaves you alone, without love, and left to create potions to satisfy your only happiness. This is where the Yawhg becomes a "beautiful" experience. Albeit depressing, the levels of endings you can receive give you a feeling that you did what needed to be done. There is no need for guides, builds, playing a game the way you don't usually play just so you can have a completionist ending or a successful character stat build. This is a game that is relentless in experience that you learn on your own, and that you can only experience if you treat it like a real week by week lifestyle. This is your story to create, and it's a doozy.","July 3, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's actually a very short raising sim where you have six turns to beef up your characters (don't stress about which characters to pick - they're functionally identical, *ONLY* their art is different) before a mysterious disaster affects the city. Before playing, I somehow had the idea that the Yawhg disaster was different every playthrough. It's not! It's always the same, you can't protect anyone from it, and (despite all the other weird magic stuff in the game) it's actually really boring. After the disaster is over, you choose your new post-Yawhg career and succeed or fail (to varying degrees) based on your stat points and sometimes the special events you experienced. (Note that the careers don't actually have stat requirements to be selected, because programming in a "Given that you have literally zero Charm, the other survivors laugh at your suggestion that you should be the leader" message would have been too much work).\n\nA single playthrough lasts about 10-15 minutes.

I'm a great fan of miss Carroll's work and rushed to buy this as soon as it was out. Not only the art is gorgeous, but the writing and music are fantastic! Sure, it feels a bit short, but even that makes me reward The Yawhg with some longing. The story left my heart aching, yearning to know more about these characters who aren't named - but feel fully fledged in Carroll's art. It's amazing how the varying drawings give them a sense of self despite the way you might choose how to play them. Still, I understand how it serves the purpose of the storytelling here not to give a deep insight into their lives "prior" the Yawhg... Which doesn't make me stop wanting to read more stories into this world. It's fascinating how this short game made me feel so many things - I'd kill for Emily Carroll to draw or write more about this, even in form of comics!\n\nFor those who complain about the price, yes, it's a short game, but it's a short game that manages to pack much more meaning in 10 minutes of gameplay than some do in 42h+","February 27, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

While the game can be played alone controlling multiple characters, it is best with friends. There  are some very creative stories within this, that I definitely do not want to spoil. A wonderful soundtrack and gorgeous art complement the 'choose your own adventure' gameplay.\n\nThe biggest question for you will be is it worth the price? I have played the game four times now (roughly 30 minutes per playthrough) and have seen some repeated stories (but not always the same outcome!) but have enjoyed every time. The Steam release makes me want to play it again. For such a memborable experience, I say it's definitely worth the price.

With some pictures.\n\nWhile I have no qualms with "playing" visual novels, or other game mediums where interactivity is minimal, those experiences at least make up with a very large amount of narration, music or other aesthetic devices. The Yawhg is not like those things. The Yawhg is closest to a board game, not a visual novel, but as a board game it offers no real interactivity. Your choices are reduced to spending time in a small amount of locations, for a small amount of turns. What you do can only affect others through accidental results, so there's no strategy involved. Your choices only affect a small slide of endings, which are a very small range from totally failing to fix a town, to... fixing a town completely.\n\nAfter your second or third playthrough, you'll realize there's no game to speak of. You tally small amounts of arbitrary points and once you know which location benefits which points, you've figured out all there is to the game. Whether you repair the town or not depends entirely on the whims of individual players, as players can't affect the choices of others in any planned way. At the end, all those arbitrary stat points are "added" in an effective or ineffective way, and if the points cross a certain threshold, you get a specific ending.\n\nAnd... that's it. Even tic-tac-toe or checkers offers more interactivity.\n\nThis is not a multiplayer game. The basic aspect of strategic reasoning is that the choices of others affect yours. This does not happen here, at least not on account of a player's agency. There is no reason to return to The Yawhg once you figure out how it works. And I believe even small children can figure that out in less than an hour.\n\nAvoid this "game". It's not even worth playing it for free. It's a completely shallow experience. It's only grace is that it serves as a great example of something that -looks- like a game, but is not. In that, it's a great lesson in game design: what -not- to do.","May 18","false","0.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Half the time was spent choosing the worst possible options only to find us flourishing after the Yawhg. The game can be very unpredictable. Sometimes you try to play it smart and end up drinking yourself to death in the end. Either way awesome game. Definitely worth the $8 spent.

Get a couple stat points that don't seem to do anything, then just see if you get a good ending. There is no story. You never see that yawhg, or even interact with it. It goes from "The yawhg is coming" straight into "The yawhg left" without any input from you. You would get more for $10 by buying some TF2 hat.

If you wish to play with multiple people, have them sit in front of the screen alongside you.\n2. If you wish to use controllers, plug them in now. If you plug a controller in after you've already started the game, it will not work.\n3. If it is currently light outside, wait until it is dark out. If you live close to a polar region, this may take a while, depending on the time of year.\n4. If you're currently waiting for it to be dark out, and have friends with you, pass the time in complete silence.\n5. Turn off all the lights.\n6. Light six black candles in a circle around the players. If you do not have the necessary equipment (six black candles, a lighter, flint & steel, etc.), go out to the store to buy some. If you waited for it to be dark out, and now all the stores are closed, wait outside the store until it is open. If it is light by the time you get home, go back to step 3.\n7.

It is very simple to follow and good way to get people in a good mood or distracted from their bad mood.\n\nI personally love the game because I like to watch my friends interact in the this unique world set in a pre-apocolyptic short adventure while I narrate and voice the various characters.\n\nThe game itself is basically the backstory for your character that effects the various character traits (charisma, mind, wealth, ect.) that help play your roll after the Yawhg arrives, a all-destroying natural disaster in which you and few others survive. the end of the games tells you how you fair after the distruction settles. Good or bad, it is painted on a canvas with light-heartedness that kind makes you say "well alrighty then."\n\nIt's a small game great for passing time with friends but its not a 7-hour-plus rpg. games last between 5-20 mins.

Screensharing was not an option at that moment in time, as some of them were using their phones, but that did not take away from the fun and... odd enjoyment that we recieved whilst playing it.\n\nThis game has fantastic music, which I fell in love with, and an art style which is hard not to instantly adore. Yes, this is a story based game with still images of what happens.. but this is NOT a bad thing.\n\nFor seven pounds, I am finding so much content in this small gem of a game. If you have seven pounds lying around, then get this game. Do not hesitate in the slightest.\n\nIf (or when) you decide to buy this game, do not forget that Emily Carrol has not written infinite possibilities of what could happen during a playthrough. Often, you'll come across an instance that you rememeber from your first playthrough, or your fifth, or tenth. However, this does not take away from the charm that this game has to offer.\n\nAfter two play throughs with a group of friends, they unleashed killer rats, deadly leeches and poisoned the towns water supply, all having effects throughout the week.\n\nA game like this should be enjoyed thoroughly, but in small doses. If you are fine with repeating occurances, then good on you, play this to your hearts content and find enjoyment in remebering the good and bad that WILL happen to you.\nHowever, if you are like myself, then it will be best to play this game once or twice every few weeks.\n\nI will never regret buying this game, even if I can memorise every occurance in every location.. SImply because of the feelings of satisfaction this game gave me.\n\n9.5/10 - Could be longer, but a definite worthwhile investment for anyone who wants something.. uniquely different and genuinely beautiful.","April 29, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each play through is relatively short and yes you do get a certain amount of repetition in the endings. However, the writing is amusing and engaging and honestly, so long as you go in looking for a bit of fun you can get hours of playthrough from this. I quite enjoyed that even if you try as hard as you can to get yourself a great ending, something might pop up and ruin everything. Some people might be annoyed that chance plays a factor like this but I think it just adds to the fun.\n\nIt's great on your own, it's better with friend(s).

I honestly never found a game focused on the story that had a level this high of rejogability and story based games are my favorite ones! I played this game dozens and dozens and dozens of times with my auntie, my cousin and my sister - sometimes other guests but mostly them - and I saw dozens and dozens and dozens of variations of events and endings to the point of thinking ocasionally that I finally had found everything that had to be found there but I always had the pleasant surprise of discovering that I was very mistaken. To this day, I still don't doubt that there things I didn't saw in that game even though I played it A LOT(my hours may indicate that).\n\nThe Yawgh is a mostly story based game but its drawings have a beautiful style with lovely colours and together with its soundtrack, they create the perfect atmosphere for the tale of the seven days of some townies before the Yawgh comes to destroy it.\n\nBtw, there's NOTHING you can to stop the Yaghw of coming. This is one of the points in which the story starts to differ of the classical RPGs we all know. Your objective is to obtain points in certain habilities by going to places with random events during every week until everything is destroyed and you can finally put your talents in a good use(or not, there's a bad and a medium ending after all!).\n\nEach event is written very well and there's A LOT of them and EVEN MORE variations of it according to not only your habilities but also some events that might happened during others players turns! The random events of this game sometimes get connections and form a little story line, which is freaking awesome. If you poisoned the water in week 02, there's a great chance that you and your friends will see some consequences of it in different locations during the rest of the game. In some cases, the random events can even affect directly your ending!\n\nAnother wonderful, AWESOME thing about this game is the fact that there's not only the "Town's ending" - that can be great, medium or bad - but there's also a individual ending to each player based on their actions during the game, how they contributed to the rebuilding of the town and also how much the city recovered. If you get a great town ending, you may get a happy and amazing ending! If you don't, believe me, things can get a extremely dark turn.\n\nThe only thing that is sad is the fact that we can't play it in online multiplayer mode but oh well. This is a great game to play alone and with local friends!\n\nThis is one of the best games that I ever played and I still hold it in my heart(and play everytime I meet someone who doesn't know it).\n\n10/10!","September 6, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Screensharing was not an option at that moment in time, as some of them were using their phones, but that did not take away from the fun and... odd enjoyment that we recieved whilst playing it.\n\nThis game has fantastic music, which I fell in love with, and an art style which is hard not to instantly adore. Yes, this is a story based game with still images of what happens.. but this is NOT a bad thing.\n\nFor seven pounds, I am finding so much content in this small gem of a game. If you have seven pounds lying around, then get this game. Do not hesitate in the slightest.\n\nIf (or when) you decide to buy this game, do not forget that Emily Carrol has not written infinite possibilities of what could happen during a playthrough. Often, you'll come across an instance that you rememeber from your first playthrough, or your fifth, or tenth. However, this does not take away from the charm that this game has to offer.\n\nAfter two play throughs with a group of friends, they unleashed killer rats, deadly leeches and poisoned the towns water supply, all having effects throughout the week.\n\nA game like this should be enjoyed thoroughly, but in small doses. If you are fine with repeating occurances, then good on you, play this to your hearts content and find enjoyment in remebering the good and bad that WILL happen to you.\nHowever, if you are like myself, then it will be best to play this game once or twice every few weeks.\n\nI will never regret buying this game, even if I can memorise every occurance in every location.. SImply because of the feelings of satisfaction this game gave me.\n\n9.5/10 - Could be longer, but a definite worthwhile investment for anyone who wants something.. uniquely different and genuinely beautiful.","April 29, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every step has many different options.  If you only play is once, you're missing out!   The best way to play this game is to embrace the probability that things will not work out like you expected.  And then just have fun.\n\n","July 4, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a great game The art is beautiful, and the writing is very picturesque, this game has great storytelling.

This game is more rather a test of mental resolve as RNG events decide your fate but you choose the outcome. The minimum amount of people required to play is two ( or you can use two characters if you are alone but it is nowhere as fun), and a maximum of four players. This game is always a must play whenever my friends come over, even if it is for one game.","April 5","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of the most intense experiences out there, and it achieves this by- well, I don't want to ruin the surprise.\n\nSecodnly, don't expect to play this alone, you will need people.\n\nThirdly, the game will get repetitive fast if you play it too much, especially with the same people. Mix it up, keep it interesting, change your tactics- this includes moral viewpoints- and most of all introduce newcomers to it constantly. Trust me.\n\nAnd now you know everyting you need to know about one of the best party games ever. Have fun.","April 4","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Art and music is great, although the latter is a bit repetitive, the dialogue can be funny sometimes, but can also be dark due to some of the choices you make. The price could be a bit lower, even with the replay value, though I kind of got tired playing it alone due to witnessing all of the events that could happen.","June 5","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
