"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/395900/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Backgammon Blitz is a simple online version of Backgammon with two game modes along with single player, online versus and local versus.\n\nGeneral Gameplay\nI’ve always been a fan of Backgammon, it’s something I look back on fondly as I used to play it a lot with my family when I was younger so I was pleasantly surprised to see a Steam version. It’s everything I expected, traditional Backgammon that i’m able to play against an AI on various difficulties or a friend locally as though we had a board.\n\nIt’s been a few years since I’d played last so I went through the interactive tutorial which does a great job of explaining everything you need to know about playing. This means that people who aren’t familiar with the rules can play comfortably without prior knowledge of any of the game.\nYou can play Backgammon Blitz in two modes, the first being your run-of-the-mill backgammon. The second mode is Blitz and this mode allows you to use the various power-ups in the game. There are things like the Joker which will automatically bring one of your pieces back from the bar and into play, or Switch which will allow you to switch the place of one of your nips with your opponent. These add a little more replayability to the game as playing the same thing over and over can get boring just like it would with a physical copy.\nThere are also five rules to choose from in regards to the doubling cube (explained in game) ranging from the Beaver rule to the Crawford rule. If you’re a seasoned player you’ll know what most if not all of these mean but if not there is an explanation for each of these when you create a game.\n\nSound & Graphics\nI like the music in Backgammon Blitz a lot but what I really appreciate is the ability for me to pick which music I want to hear whilst playing. There are four playlists (Classical, Jazz, Upbeat and Smooth) and you can choose which you’d like to listen to. I personally have only Classical and Smooth enabled for full relaxation.\nThe graphics are also very nice with the added effect of them feeling like you’re playing at an actual board. There are multiple different boards you can pick from so you’ll find something that suits your fancy no matter what your tastes are. It’s nice there are different sound effects for each board also, such as a metallic clank on the workshop board and the soft thud on the wooden boards.\n\nCons\nThe ingame currency ‘Bullion’ is really slow to earn meaning it can take a very long time to unlock the power-ups. I feel this feature was added so there was some form of progression but it’s not needed nor does it do anything to enhance the game. I don’t feel that in a game like backgammon I should have to grind for 12 games to unlock a power-up especially since I can only use three per game anyway. The only other downside is the multiplayer. There just aren’t enough players online so finding a game is near-on impossible.\n\nSummary\nIf you can grab it on sale and are content with only single player and local matches then it’s a great buy but if you’re looking for something multiplayer then this might not be the game for you. Backgammon Blitz fills my backgammon needs perfectly and is a great buy for any of you who enjoy digital board games.","May 22","true","4.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","1"

First, there is no means to undo a move.  There should be an option to allow you to ask your opponent's permission to undo a bad move and if your opponent is okay with it, then you can do it.  Also, trying to find someone online to play with is almost impossible unless you find a friend on Steam who plays and you make arrangements to play in advance.  That is probably the most disappointing part of this game and it almost caused me not to recommend the game.  However, with a little tweaking this could be a winner.  It needs an undo and it needs to make finding other players easier.  Also, when I finally did find someone to play with online, the servers were not that good.  I expect these issues to be resolved.","December 29, 2015","true","4.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Backgammon Blitz is a healthy dose of nostalgia for ports from the card & board game generation like myself.\n\nGameplay:\nLoading the game is quick & easy. You have a variety of options for personalizing your experience with game boards & music. My favorite game board is the stone version of course, because it just looks neat! But, unlike many games, here you are also allowed to tick & untick the boxes for music style. You can choose all of them or just one or two if you like, and music will play randomly from those categories. You have a variety of gameplay options as well, & can choose whether to play with your pieces on either side.\n\nA full set of tutorials are provided so that you can play in just minutes, even if you’ve never played backgammon before. The rules are really quite simple. But, there are a variety of special game rules that can be chosen to enhance the gameplay as well. The sound effects make the game more satisfying because it has the old familiar clink of pieces on a game board. The achievements are simple & easily achieved.\n\nMy favorite part was the local 2-player mode. You are able to play with friends beside you, just like with the old game boards. I didn’t try the multiplayer online option, but that should be fun for people who are looking for that feature.\n\nArt & Graphics:\nThe game boards are pleasing scenes with coffee mugs to the side, and other personalization features that contribute to the nostalgia of board game simulations. The card art includes backgrounds with the various game boards as well. The game loads easily, & plays smoothly. There were instances where the game crashed for no reason. But, other than that it was a very good gaming experience. I did notice that the crashing tended to happen only in longer games, & usually right before the end. So, I just sped it up and played faster to prevent crashing.\n\nBackgammon Blitz will provide hours & hours of fun. I recommend it for those who love board game simulations.","May 15","true","12.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

Top 3 examples:\n\n1.  A backgammon game with on Offline mode should at least offer challenging gameplay and decent AI.  This doesn't, even on Master mode it makes very elemental mistakes and bad decisions.  Never at any time did I even feel remotely threatened of losing a game using the most challenging settings.  Just go for the doubling cube right out of the gate since you are pretty much assured a win.\n\n2.  A backgammon game with on Online mode should at least be able to connect to a server...but this game only very occasionally is able to connect. most of the time it simply fails (as reported by many other reviewers).  All my other Steam multiplayer apps work just fine.\n\n3.  Lastly, any computer-based backgammon game should at least offer an "Undo" feature to allow for mistakes or unintended moves which can easily be made due to shortcomings and learning curves with the user interface. And the user interface in this game is far from intuitive, it's clunky really, and ends up taking away from a smooth gameplay experience... so the lack of an Undo button in this game becomes even more noticeable due to the heightened ablity to click on something incorrectly.  On the bright side, the authors may have figured it wouldn't matter much since you can make plenty of mistakes and still win due to the over-agressive and poor AI.\n\nAnd after finally trying "Blitz mode".... makes an arcade game out of backgammon with powerups and a Gameshow-themed announcer.   Won against AI using no powerups while it threw everything it had at me,  If you like slugfests with tons of pieces going on the bar I guess it's entertaining.\n\nPros:  Gameboard graphics are very nice.  Two player local mode, human-vs-human would offer a good experience probably but at that point why not just get the real board out from the closet?\n\nIf you are a new backgammon player and looking for something fairly easy to win and maybe different in an arcadeish way this could be something to try out, but you also may not end up learning much from the AI.","November 27, 2015","false","2.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

Because i admired how the devs let you choose between music genres, you can keep all the genres mixed, or you can choose just one.\nThere aren't many of them to choose from, but who would be that harsh to complain about this?\n\nAtmosphere overall goes along perfectly with the pace of the game, and even with the visuals as every element in this game has the tag 'Classy' glued to his back.\n\nThe Devs\nI am not sure if i should have this section in my review, but to be honest, i believe we should acknowledge when devs do care about their games, and their community.\nIn this case, i noticed how the devs are involved on the Steam forums, they are active in the game by providing updates.\n\nThese devs seem to be friendly, and they seem to care alot, so, keep that in mind.\nLooking forward to play 'Pure Pool' aswell.\n\nProsVery beautiful, aesthetically speaking.\nHas local multiplayer\nHas some variety so it won't get boring after some time (You can change between music genres, and between tables, which, also changes the game sounds)\nConsIf you want to play online via Quickmatch-ing, you have to wait some.\nFrom time to time, selecting/moving pieces might not feel so smooth.\nPerhaps, the difference between difficulty levels is too big.\nFinal score: 85/100","May 15","true","3.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

If you know how to play you will be playing in two button clicks, but if you're a newbie Backgammon Blitz's tutorial will get the job done very well.\n\nI'd especially like to point out that matches are amazingly customizable-I'd never even heard of the Raccoon rule or Jacoby rule, for example, but I know about them now! This game unfortunately does not appear to be particularly popular, since finding an online match seems to be a pain.\n\nThere is room for improvement. The biggest problem is that the automatic bearing off of checkers is broken when there are enemy checkers in your home board: the computer will expose you to capture instead of the correct play of moving the checker to another point further down.  Also turning on automatic dice rolling removes your ability to use the doubling cube.\n\nI also like that the developers added in keyboard shortcuts, which are welcome for those of us who enjoy the opportunity to play quickly. It's too bad there isn't a similar way to move chekcers without using the mouse, which can be temperamental.\n\nOne final suggestion: it would be a relief to have an option that greatly speeds up or entirely removes the dice rolling and checker movement animations. This would greatly speed up and enhance play!\n\nEDIT:\n\nI finally played a match online with my brother, and I have to say the clunky interface is especially painful in multiplayer. You will end up waiting what seems like a very long time for the other person even to cast dice. Sometimes a minute or longer will pass until you realize that actually he's been waiting for you to roll. Part of the problem is that the interface's display of the Roll Dice action is the only indication that it is your turn.\n\nThe extremely finnicky checker selection and movement is even worse in multiplayer because of a slight delay after each checker movement, as if the game were waiting to confirm each movement with the server. Playing multiplayer convinces me that the controls are fundamentally flawed, and I think this game would do well to take cues from the open-source GNU Backgammon and implement a less frustrating way to move checkers. In GNU, clicking once on a checker will move it intelligently, and it also has an Undo feature which is lacking in Blitz.\n\nWhile we're comparing Blitz to GNU, it must also be said that the AI in Blitz is atrocious in every possible way. If you're not familiar with GNU Backgammon, it is meant for serious players and comes with a world-class AI. But Blitz doesn't play competently even on Master level, exposing checkers in its own home board and capturing the player's checkers with no rhyme or reason. On the other hand, a single screenshot will be enough to tell you that GNU does not hold a candle to Blitz's graphics or sound.\n\nIt's a shame to say it, but at this point I'd say the only thing bringing me back to Blitz are the gorgeous graphics and sound and the ability to play over Steam with my noob brother. The program is really ideal for drawing in new players with its interactive tutorial mode and fantastic presentation. But after about an hour or so or play, you will realize that the AI just doesn't cut it and online multiplayer is nerve-wracking. Get it when it goes on sale again to satisfy your curiosity, but if you've been playing backgammon somewhere else and thinking about Blitz, you will not be satisfied with the package at the full price tag.","December 2, 2015","true","5.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Backgammon Blitz let me try it out against an AI opponent and gave me the rules, which turned out to be pretty simple. Unlike the board game, Backgammon Blitz shows you what the possible moves are, which almost makes it too easy. Sometimes the AI seems to be cheating in order to speed up the final stage of the game after the outcome is obvious. Multiplayer matches are simple to set up and provide straightforward entertainment. Even in multiplayer, there is a nagging suspicion that dice rolls are not entirely random, but it's all good fun. The presentation is really slick and the jazzy soundtrack is very nice.

Well now it will be right in front of you, on your screen! What a blast, it’s Backgammon Blitz!\n\nBackgammon Blitz is a simulation / strategy of one of the most-played board games in the world. My first introduction of the game was when I was just a spring chicken; oops, I should say spring frog by my grand-father, the “Grand Frogster”!  What great memories!\n\nWhat you have to do in a game of Backgammon is to move all your checkers onto your own home board and then bear them off (take them off the board), and if you can do that before your opponent bears off all his/her checkers you will win 2 points (instead of 1) by “gammon”! You will be able to do that in the beginner level but it will be a little harder to achieve when you play on the master level. If it’s your first attempt at playing the game, do not worry as the tutorial is absolutely excellent and easy to follow.\n\nYou can play this game solo player, with a friend locally or online. I lost several games, but not because I was not looking at what the AI was doing with its checkers. No, none of that! Instead I was grooving to the sensational soundtrack and even found myself dancing in the middle of the room like . . .  well, let’s say it was a distraction!\n\nYou can make the game harder by enabling different rules when setting up a game. If you want to experience a new twist in backgammon, try the “Blitz” where you use up to three power-ups against your opponent and vice versa? It’s fun!\nBeautifully designed boards and the game is very simple. With 2 clicks you make a move.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Stunningly designed boards\n-	Very good tutorial\n-	Blitz mode / use power-ups against the opponent\n-	Fabulous soundtrack (Jazz and Smooth are my favourites)\n-	Achievements & Trading\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Could have been more challenging\n\nThis is a very good interpretation /simulation of the backgammon game.\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

As much as I love the way the game runs (when it doesn't crash) and the graphics for it, I still think it's got a long ways to go before it can be sold for $9.99 when not on sale.","February 6","false","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The jump in difficulty from "beginner" to "intermediate" is astounding.  It is nearly impossible to beat.  For any good computer Backgammon game there should be at least 5 difficulty settings.  The jump in difficulty between settings is insane.  I can win every game against "beginner" but I don't have a prayer against "intermediate".  They should have gradually increased the difficutly, I am very displeased with the extreme jump in difficulty.  Another thing is that there is no option to make it so that you cannot see your legal moves.  I like to calculate my own legal moves, but when the computer tells you your legal moves, it's basically playing half the game for you.  Another thing is that they should have allowed the option for manual dice rolls, just to make sure the computer isn't cheating.  If you are looking for a good Backgammon game, download "Backgammon Free" for Android, they probably have it for Apple too.  It is such a better game.  The only thing that Backgammon Blitz has going for it is the good graphics.  I get my ♥♥♥ kicked so fast by the computer on "intermediate" that I don't even learn anything.  If they would have had 5 difficulty settings, the ♥♥♥ kicking would have been so gradual that I would actually learn something from my defeats.  I do not recommend this game.  I recommend "Backgammon Free" for android.","March 30","false","6.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The AI is a little bit easy to beat, but it's still fun to play.\nThe game is very good-looking and polished, but it could use some automated functionality, as it gets a little tiring having to select a piece and then select its destination when there's only one place it might go. How 'bout a double click?\n\nAt any rate, if you like the game of backgammon, you'll enjoy this.","December 21, 2015","true","5.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Unfortunately it is just like every other game like this that I have ever played. They start out with reasonble dice throws then BAM! You fell like the game cheats. Say you have a piece on the post and need a 3,4 or six to get in. THe game will roll all other numbers for at least three or more turns. Conversely if you have a pice of his on the post and all put one number covered guess what?!? yea it rolls that number.\n\nI give up. Wish I could get a refund but probably too late.\n\nSadness....\n\nUPDATE: 3/1/2016\n\nOk forget it this game just simply sucks!\nI gave it every opportunity but it is just not worth it. DO NOT BUY!\nWish I could get my money back it is that bad.\n\nExample, it ALWAYS hits you because it ALWAYS gets the roll it need to hit you.\nNext you RARELY get the roll you need to do, I don't know.... ANYTHING!\nSave your money, pay the game like for real and not on any platform, call a friend or enemy for that matter and play the game for real. I have not in 20 years found a program or AI to play according to the roll of the dice. Can't even simulate the rolls they get.
