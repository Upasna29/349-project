Wine is health in this game.\n\nIt has a really interesting story.\nYou are trying to regain contact with your significant other.\n\nThe game is split up into two kinds of modes.\nYou spend some of your time on really small worlds.\nThis is where the platforming and combat take place.\nThere are many different types of worlds.\nSo far I have found Tree/Forest worlds and Ice planets.\n\nThe other side of the game is spent in the universe.\nYou explore this in your very steampunk styled ship.\nYou can mine asteroids and find loot as well as travel between different planets and ships.\n\nYour main goal in this game seems to be collecting keys and maps.\nWhen you find a map a new world or ship location will be revealed on the universe map.\nKeys unlock chests which usually contain items and coins.\nThere are traders on ships who will sell you items and more maps.\nThe main story line seems to continue when you go to new ships and speak to people.\n\nIt's definately worth checking out.\nThe controls felt a little loose on the jumping side of things.\nYou get used to this pretty quickly.\nIt may just be more an issue with my ability at platforming than a problem with the game itself.\n\nIf you want to see some gameplay you can check out my video below.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=671793308","April 23","true","1.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","7","9","3","0"

Although with an early access game there are going to bug, but this has little effect on the game play.\n\nFirstly I am going to talk about the character it's self. The character is obviously French, and not to mention that you need to drink wine to heal, which is also a big giveaway as to where the character is from, and if it wasn't enough the first cut scene is set in a somewhat of a look a like to Paris.\n\nSecondly I would like to talk about "Minion" the little character who follows you about as your travel to other planets/worlds. In my opinion in a game like this it is always good to have a character who follows you about. I'm going to use another game as an example to also describe this. So, for example take Portal 2 where you have the side character "Wheatley" following you about for most of the start of the game, until he takes control of GLaDOS body. Anyways getting back to this game, Minion is a really fun, but sometimes annoying side character. Although, and this is a big factor of the game. Minion is a loveable a character, but I need to get used to him as a character.\n\nThridly there is bad things about this game, but these aren't major problems, and will be fixed easily. The main one is the controls always reset everytime you go into to check them, and hopefully this will be fixed by the next update. Yes, the game is in early alpha, but apart from the one problem the game is perfect right now.\n\nNow we're getting to the gameplay, and firstly the world revolve is amazing. By this I mean as you walk the world will spin round, and I really enjoy this aspect. I also enjoy the flight to each different planets, and the world designs are amazing themselves, but the ship is greatly detailed. Although the graphics are kinda similar to "Don't starve", but let's not get into that. The dev's have done amazing work to the game, and that shouldn't be taken away from them.\n\nFinally as a whole I would recommend you go out, and buy this game. Before it goes off sale, and the game is also pretty easy to get achievements on, and the game also get's harder as you progress through the game, and it deserves a lot of support from the steam community.","April 25","true","0.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PlanetTerra/recommended/448110/","PlanetTerra","Sir Pugsalot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PlanetTerra/","139 products in account","Product received for free\n\nSo Long Earth feels like the strange, slightly twisted distant cousin of 'Don't Starve'\nWith a really nice bleak and washed art style(In a good way) and super immersive musical score, that at times, sounds like it could have been recorded by an actual orchestra.  So Long Earth creates a sort of weird, tense and dark atmosphere from the very start of the game.\n\nI wasn't 100% sure that the protagonist was French, then I discovered that he must drink wine to heal. Case closed.\n\nA really interesting, dark and mysterious game. If you like games that aren't the norm, check out So Long Earth.","May 23","true","1.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

Watch my gameplay!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVEbiwKGBXk\n\nSo Long Earth is a beautiful adventure game about a guy named Dominique traveling across the universe alongside his alien pal who I've named Timmy. The first thing you'll see is his girlfriend dumping him and throwing him a bottle of wine because he'll surely "need" it. Turns out that you do need the wine because it'll numb the pain away - I mean, it's like your healing potion.\n\nYou'll get to ride an awesome spaceship in which you could also use to rub against (or mine) asteroids. In this game, you collect coins to buy more maps to progress. You could also buy wine and other things. It also includes some puzzles, which is always fun to figure out.\n\nWhile you travel from map to map, you'll encounter some enemies so prepare to kick butt before they kick yours!\n\nThe game art is similar to Don't Starve and Don't Starve together, which is what the developer was going for. I've read (on his twitter) that the game art is inspired by those games.\n\nNonetheless, this game is fun to play and is definitely worth trying it out.","April 25","true","4.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
