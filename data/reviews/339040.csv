However, the negative things about this game is that there are a few issues with it that are quite annoying.\n\nNegatives:\n-No Fullscreen mode, game is perma-bound to windowed.\n-Only 4 pre-set resolutions with the max being 1280x1024.\n-No Steam overlay.\n-No graphics options.\n-Mouse cursor stays in-game no matter what. I strongly reccomend using a controller to play if you want to avoid this.\n\nPositives:\n+Extremely fun game, especially for those that played it as a kid, like I did.\n+Fully rebindable keyboard keys, (You can even use the mouse, which was uncommon for games as old as this.), and fully rebindable controller buttons.\n+Nice sound design, all voices, sounds, and music are clear and crisp.\n+Nice level design, very intricate and full of secrets!\n\nAll in all, I do reccomend this game. It gives you that nice, nostalgic feel. For this price, it's a really good deal, and you are sure to get hours of fun from it.","February 26, 2015","true","2.0"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","34","37","0","11"

This game is the game that drove me to start swearing at games, this and the AVGN did. This game always ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, especially the parts of the Goosey Chase and such, as I remember I would always screw up on them and yell at the screen while having a tantrum, trying to break the controller. Good memories...\n\nOtherwise, don't listen to the negative report since it's a stupid reason to dislike, a simple error he only pointed out and it's easy to fix. Yeah, it's not a perfect port, but it works. No game is perfect.\n\nGet this game if you had it in your childhood, it's sure nostalgic.","February 28, 2015","true","4.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

Mein Kampf is a great read too, though I don't mean that in a Nazi way. Reading it showed me how insane it was that, nowadays, people don't even know why Nazis disliked Jews. Mein Kampf is 95% against Communists, and Jews are hated mainly, if not only, because they're thought to be behind Communism. Nowadays, nobody highlights that fact, preferring to dehumanise Germans by assuming they were just "racists", as if that explains anything and ends the conversation. Definitely worth a read. The New Ford translation is the best (I personally sent some proofreading to the publishers, for free, so now it's even better). Beware of translations that were intended to make Hitler sound like a nut. Poorly translating German, or any language, will do that, but Hitler wasn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and was, in fact, well-spoken and well-read. Just don't expect much about races and Jews. There's literally one or two mentions of Africans, and a chapter about Jews, but most of it is about nationalism, the fight against communism, and how to structure a fascist power structure.","February 6","true","3.1"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","67","20","30","18","4"
