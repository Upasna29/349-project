Its biggest sin is squandering the great premise of using the dream world and photographic memory to solve cases: it's just not used enough and, when it is, it basically just highlights objects and clues that other games leave to your reasoning. The various minigames are also dull when not downright frustrating and add nothing to its gameplay: most of the time they actually lower your fun factor with their bad design.\n\nIn the end I can't recommend it, it's just a very forgettable and somewhat awkward entry in a genre where many games have done things way better.","September 14, 2015","false","2.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

However the soundtrack and the plot were very original. Controlling the main character was not always working smooth or at least on my computer, although that I doubt the issue was from my pc. Anyway if the game developers decide to continue and release a second part it would be a pleasure to see how the plot continues. I would leave the gamers decide whether to buy this game or not. If you like old detective stories with old fashioned clothes and nice jazz music, you may find the game very intriguing. Do not expect to spend more than 10 hours at most playing this game - you will end it up a lot earlier without using walkthrough.

This game is a winner!\n\nIt's a fully voiced Point and Click adventure with an emphasis on the story as opposed to puzzles or finding tons of objects. The story is quite entertaining and the graphics and cut-scenes are really well done! I can't believe more people haven't played this title! Campaign completed in a little under 4 hours; but i'm slow.\n\nYou are Charlie, a wealthy, amateur detective who recently cracked his first case. By transitioning to a dream state you are able to question your subconscious and analyze the crime scenes for perfect recall! Needless to say this game has given me much more than I expected! Great Ending!\n\nWorth the $10; but I'd grab on sale! Overall, this is a pretty high quality point and click game which I was pleased to stumble upon. I would buy the sequel!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

This game has some pretty cool puzzles which are really fun and slightly challenging. This game appears to be relatively simple at first but gets a little harder the further your progress into it. A really great game overall, I would recommend getting this game. I would rate it about 9/10.","September 25, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think it's a good concept that was left to dry out in the sun. Don't recommend it.","December 4, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However the soundtrack and the plot were extremely unique. Controlling the principle character was not continually living up to expectations smooth or possibly on my PC, in spite of the fact that that I question the issue was from my pc. Anyway if the game engineers choose to proceed with and discharge a second part it would be a joy to perceive how the plot proceeds. I would leave the gamers choose whether to purchase this game or not. On the off chance that you like old investigator stories with obsolete garments and decent jazz music, you may locate the game exceptionally interesting. Try not to hope to spend over 10 hours at most playing this game - you will end it up a ton prior without utilizing walkthrough.

It is mostly a charming and harmless Noir style point and click.  I'm not really a fan of inept heroes that are not specifically funny, just weak on intellect, but it definitely didn't annoy me as much as say... Whispered World.  I was plugging along just fine and more or less enjoying it, when towards the end the slealth mini game stood in the way of an otherwise fun experience.  Most people play adventure games to get away from the hair pulling, button mashing, anxiety fest of games designed for err...no one.  You have a bar on the right side which has to be not too high or too low as you mash or hold the mouse to maintain equalibrium.  At the same time your character has to go faster or slower, avoiding dozens of guards with circles representing their visibility while following just close enough to the woman you are following, but not too close.  I watched a walkthrough where it took at least ten minutes of repeatedly getting caught to finish.  I might just watch the rest of the walkthrough and forget finishing the game.","February 16","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
