Why? Because it does everything right. From the controls, to the chunky pixelated and colorful graphics, to the awesome soundtrack and amazing replayability and challenge level, this game does everything right.\n\nMutant Mudds Deluxe is a port of the 3DS title of the same name (minus the Deluxe part) and it does it right: It brings the fun to the bigger screen and puts more into the mix to make it even better.\n\nThe controls are simple: you jump and shoot - but you can also hover in the air for more precision (and sometimes you'll need to hover to reach some platforms as well); The graphics are like they should be for a game like this: colorful, full of life and original. They claim it to be "12-bits", but you know what? I don't think so few bits can accomodate the amount of fun you will have playing this game. It's pretty large as well with plenty of areas to conquer (plus some really difficult secret ones) and you will have so much fun that it will be pretty difficult to put it down after you start playing it.\n\nThis game is a serious love-letter to those early platforming titles from the late 80's and early 90's, packed with everything that made some titles from the era classics.\n\nDo you really need a score after everything I said? Sure, here you go: 9/10. Why 9/10 if you praised the game with every single line you wrote, you may ask. Simply because it doesn't have exploding Spaceships and Flamethrowers, because if it did, this game would be so good that you would need to change your pants after every single section. Buy this game right now! - Actually, buy 2 copies, so you can keep one sealed. - Wait, that's not how it works anymore?

It’s why we keep going back to them, and why their design influences the cutting edge games coming out in the modern age. Mutant Mudds Deluxe– a Wii U port of a 2012 3DS eShop game– may seem like an anachronism, as it doesn’t appear to be any sort of recent game at all. It looks, plays, feels, and sounds just like a title at least 20 years older. However, it holds the retro gameplay and aesthetics up as its foundation, and is a great modern game.\n\nIf you’re familiar with the original Nintendo 3DS version of Mutant Mudds, then you know what’s up. Evil mutant mud monsters have come to Earth, and its up to Max to save the day. Armed with a water gun, a jetpack, and the ever-watchful eye of his Grannie, Max has to platform through many levels to stop the muddy menace. Mutant Mudds Deluxe keeps every bit of the nail-biting platform goodness intact from the 3DS version, with some notable additions and changes.\n\nSo, what’s Mutant Mudds Deluxe got that the 3DS version doesn’t? This version of the game adds an entirely new mirror world, with darker versions of the game’s main 20 levels. These worlds feature ghost enemies that are unkillable (without the aid of a special gun that has limited shots) and must be dodged. It adds yet another layer of difficulty to the already tricky terrain featured in Mutant Mudds, and augments the main game a good bit. The special levels featuring Grannie from the DLC of the 3DS game are also available in the package (they are stupidly difficult). All in all, there’s about 80 levels to conquer, an impressive amount of content.\n\nOne little thing that also makes a big difference in Mutant Mudds Deluxe is the addition of checkpoints to the levels. Mutant Mudds is an often brutally hard game, and the original release made you restart the entire level over if you met an untimely death. The checkpoints in the PC version really helps ease frustration. But if you are the masochistic type, you can always turn them off from the main menu.\n\nBut some improvements in Mutant Mudds Deluxe aren’t in the actual content; it’s all in the delivery. Deluxe enjoys the inherent benefits of being on a PC, such as improved control inputs and better visuals. The pixel worlds have flawless detail with the high definition. This also allows the visible game display to be much larger than the 3DS screen could offer, so you can see much farther around your character, which makes some of the challenges a lot more manageable.\n\nNow, if you’re not already a platforming fan, Mutant Mudds Deluxe probably won’t change your mind. But if you just want some good old-fashioned jumping challenges, this is a great game to play. It can indeed become repetitive when you get stuck, but the compelling gameplay wins out in the end. Going for the 100% level completion doesn’t feel like a chore at all, and Mutant Mudds consistently raises the bar in terms of difficulty as you advance. If I had to nitpick one thing, I’d ask for a run button. Sometimes Max feels like he’s walking terribly slow, and there is a time limit on the levels.\n\nFor new players of Mutant Mudds, I would wholeheartedly recommend Deluxe. However, if you already have it for 3DS or Wii U you have to ask yourself if the addition of checkpoints and the extra ghost levels is worth buying the game again. Either way, PC has gained an excellent and unabashedly retro platformer in the form of Mutant Mudds Deluxe.","December 14, 2015","true","7.5"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","0"

That's the story I guess. Nothing else is shown for the rest of the game about what exactly these puddings are, or why you are murdering these puddings.\n\nLevel Design: They're either super straight forward, hop from platform to platform no danger involved, oh sorry try again if you fall, or, mass spammed with enemies that just slow down the hopping process as you wait on each platform and shoot to kill the enemies on the next. Checkpoints exist, but more often than not they're at the very end of the level, 2 platforms prior to the exit. What is the point?\nCertain... mini levels? Exist within the other levels. For completing one you get presumably an extra "high-five" on the level select screen. Most of these levels require the usage of a power up that you borrow from a random grandma's "attic" (except it's just a normal house by all means), and seem to forget which item was required to get into the mini level, because a majority of it can be completely bypassed with said item.\n\nEnemy Design: Goomba, Small Goomba, Large Goomba, Koopa Troopa, Fireball from Lava, Spike-ball that spins from the background to foreground. Also a ghost version of each one exists.\nThere is also a flying... circle pudding. That craps bombs non-stop. Upon touching the pudding you are harmed. Upon landing, the bomb explodes in a huge radius that is practically undodgeable unless you're focussing on dodging the bombs and not getting rid of circle-flying-pudding-guy.\n\nOther Thoughts: Controls by default are very odd. Jump and Shoot is done with the mouse, but apart from that the mouse serves no aiming or menu purpose. Oh right, there's also a menu which I never had to open once. Can easily be remedied though via the drop down and put into basic controls, (arrows + Z + X).\nThe 3 layer levels is an interesting concept that could be taken further. As of right now it's too simple, there's no depth in it at all.\n\nSo. What did I just play and beat in about 3 hours? I have no idea.","May 22, 2014","false","1.5"," 128 of 211 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","128","211","3","3"

The difficulty isn't too high, it's pretty fair and plays at a slow pace that should be enjoyable for anyone skilled in platformers or not.

I devoured the Demo on 3DS (though even that took many hours), and felt a rush of nostalgia when I found it on Steam - and better yet, it was on sale!\n\nWith alternate levels as an accompaniment to the main story, and secret levels within the main story, this game has a lot of replayability. You can also buy weapons by collecting the coins in every level.

If that sounds like fun to you, then you can ignore the red thumb and dive right in.

At first the game feels really cumbersome and clunky because let's face it, it's not supposed to play like New Super Mario Bros... You won't be running at top speed and almost sliding off in to a chasm only to do a triple backflip in to a ground pound... nope, none of that here. You walk, you hover, you jump, you shoot... bout it.\n\nThis game is very... let's say, square.... or rather pixel perfect... everything works in blocks, rows and lines... so if you keep that in mind when you're traversing the trecherous one hit kill spike traps, you'll be better off. The game is intended as a grueling challenge for older children, around the age of like 10-12... and for someone of that age, I can see this being incredibly frustrating and they will surely deem this game unbeatable... but it's really not.\n\nDon't expect "Impossible Game" or "Super Meat Boy" quality challenge here is basically what I'm saying. If you can tolerate playing most web based flash games for longer than 15 minutes, this game will proove only an above average challenge for you. You shouldn't at any point want to throw your controller at a wall... if you do, then you have no patience because that's all this game really requires.\n\nSure there's a time limit for speed running levels but that's more of a tacked on thing if you're craving more Mutant Mudds after you've collected over 4000 objects... and if you are, please seek some help. After the inital batch of normal stages and ghost stages I cringed at having to do 20 more stages with good ol' grannie but I actually found those stages the least frustrating after I had finished a few.\n\nAll in all the game is good, you can finish everything in roughly 5 to 6 hours which is decent for the price. Other less experienced platformers might take a bit longer but I can't see this game taking you more than 10 hours.\n\nSide Note: There's an exploit where you can stand on the very edge of spikes if they're on a platform, so use that knowledge to your advantage if you're having trouble finishing some of the harder areas.","September 13, 2014","true","5.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

Multi-layered stages allow for a degree of creativity in level design not easily matched by old platforming standards. What happens when an enemy swings at you from the background for instance? Here, you get thrown toward the player who is now potentially uncertain of the footing available to them. It's analogous to when Mario punched the rotating section of cage for the first time in Super Mario World, and it's why Mutant Mudds works. You have to consider what's happening on different planes simultaneously to ensure the best chance of surviving challenges - backgrounds (and foregrounds) aren't just pretty pictures.\n\nAdmittedly, I wasn't a fan of the floatiness of the main character, Max. In Level 1-1 the effect gives the impression the whole stage is moving rather than just the character - less Mario, more And Yet It Moves. Sticking with it though, the controls aren't quite as obtuse as first impressions would lead you to believe. Thanks in large part to a backpack that allows you to hover in mid-air for a few seconds at a time, you're still able to perform precision platforming sections with relative ease. In fact, most stages didn't feel challenging enough (until I reached the expert bonus stages).\n\nThe music bleeps and bloops as you'd expect in a retro themed platformer. Most are memorable with at least two or three standout tracks in the bunch (the g-land music is my personal top pick, followed by the ghost music, and the one from the expert stages screaming "fly like an eagle" which is painfully catchy). The graphics are a bit of a letdown however, if you were hoping to run the game at 1080p for a full HD experience, understand that the pixels will still be blocky, just bigger.\n\nI was able to complete the main storyline in one sitting which would usually lead to concerns about game length, but the majority of the game is found "after the break" as it were, thanks to secret stages, sub world stage variations, and expert stages only unlockable by certain characters in the game and/or once you've purchased upgrades. I'd say fully 1/4 of the package is main storyline, with 3/4 being extras, so the amount of content is substantial. Add to that, the developer has demonstrated a surprisingly long-term level of (free) support for the game thus far (namely, adding stages), hopefully that continues into the future so I can revisit these characters and rid the world of Mudds again.","August 18, 2014","true","8.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you look past the fact it's based on NES games you just end up with one of the most boring platformers I've ever played.\n\nFirst off the game has really stiff controls which makes the platforming harder than it needs to be as it almost forces you to use the jetpack for every single jump you make. I feel like if the character's speed increased a bit like to around Megaman's walking speed it would have the controls less stiff to work with. The level design is the typical get from one end of the level to the other end while dodging enemies and 3D thwomps, which I would be ok with instead that it stays the same through out the game with next to no new gimmicks added in every world.\n\nOn your way you get diamond pieces which there are 100 in each level and these star pieces with one at the end of the level and one in a secret room. In order to beat the game you have to collect all of them. So if you miss some collectables by the time you beat all the levels you are going to have to backtrack and get the collectables you missed because without those you are not going to beat the game.\nThere are upgrades you unlock during your journey but you can only carry upgrade at a time, and you're going to need them in order to access the hidden areas. The upgrades include a jetpack upgrade which has your jetpack last alot longer and a gun upgrade which has your gun deal more damage and also break certain yellow walls. So if you find the door which leads you to a hidden level and you don't have the upgrade to get to it....you have to exit the level, equip the upgrade and go all the way back to where you found the level. This can get tedious very quickly especially when you're in the backtracking stage of your playthrough.\n\nSpeaking of hidden levels, these doors you find in the middle of a level take you a challenge room where everything is either black and white or red and black (because virtual boy) and....they the same as the regular levels....nuff said.\n\nSPOILER ALERT:\nSo what do you get for getting all the collectables in the game.......NOTHING because the game just ends. No final boss, no final level, just ends and shows credits. After you get beat the game you unlock the nerd's grandma which has all the upgrades you had to switch through equipped. There are also some harder versions of levels you completed but at this point I just stopped caring about this game.\n\nThis game has a major problem where it gets boring after a while with the same enemies and level gimmicks being pasted over and over again, the collectables don't even help make the game more fun as it just adds more tedious gameplay to drag it out. Doesn't help that there is no boss fights to test your skills on.\n\nAt the end of the day it's just a boring, generic platformer that just happened to get tons of praise (and a Wii U sequel in the works) just because of it being 8bit. If you want to play a retro platformer then I don't recommend this. There are much more enjoyable 2D platformers to play including retro ones.\n\nInfact here are some I recommend over this which are available on steam:\nFreedom Planet\nShovel Knight\nDucktales Remastered\nMegaman 1-6 via the Legacy Collection\nSonic the Hedgehog 1-3 & Knuckles\nRouge Legacy\nAzure Striker Gunvolt\nRayman Origins and Legends\nand the list goes on.\n\nIf you really have to get this game then I recommend wait for the game to come on sale as it's not worth the £7 price tag  even if you're a NES fanatic.","October 18, 2015","false","2.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

The gameplay is so slow that it will influence the way you play. The player is not able to stop gliding which makes jumping on top of disappearing platforms more of a timing challenge. The lack of running makes it feel like you are held back. The inclusion of a timer is also interesting as It, in my opinion does not stimulate players to play again and beat the time, instead it just shows how slowly the game progresses. This game is not for everyone, only for the patient and willing to tackle this beast of a game.\n\nAs I do think some people will enjoy this game I will rate it up as I know there are also people who enjoy this. Again not a bad game its just not for me.","June 14, 2014","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/247370/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Mutant Mudds is an odd throwback platformer, in that it doesn't throw back to any one particular game. You can trace Shovel Knight back to a few NES titles, and Freedom Planet is Sonic with the serial number filed off, but this one is its own little homage to classic gaming. While it doesn't break any new ground, it hits all the traditional platforming notes so well that it stands all the better on its own.\n\nYour character is some pixelly little nerd living with his grandma. Suddenly mud creatures from space attack, and you take the fight to them by collecting diamond things and squirting them with water. The controls are as simple as they get; you can shoot, you can jump, and you can hover briefly by pressing jump again. If there's a way to hook up an NES controller to a computer, it would be all you need to play this game. The levels then are equally simple, with spike pits, moving platforms, vanishing platforms, and goopy enemies to clear out before making your next leap. There's one additional gimmick, portals that send you to the background or foreground, but outside of those it's a very straightforward design.\n\nIf that was it, Mutant Mudds wouldn't be worth delving into. But the creators smartly took that simple foundation and went deep with the content. Within each of the game's 16 levels are 100 diamonds to find, which unlock upgrades for your gun, jetpack, and jumps when you find enough. Completing the four levels that comprise a world then unlocks an additional stage to tackle. Each level also contains two secret stages, one fairly easy to find and one requiring certain upgrades to reach. These secret stages kick up the difficulty pretty hard over the base game, some of them taking me dozens of tries to complete. And then there are ghost versions of the base levels, with new hazards and invulnerable enemies.\n\nYou'll find more than enough platforming here to keep you busy, and the challenge forms an even spread between easy and nigh impossible. There's no sprinting and your hovering is limited, so navigating the levels is a slower, more deliberate affair than in Mario or Sonic. You'll encounter plenty of tiny platforms and tight jumps, but the pace makes them not all that stressful to tackle. The margins on moving and disappearing platforms are pretty tight as well, which can be frustrating until you come to grips with the pace of the game. Once you get to harrowing combinations of hazards in the secret levels, you may very well reach you limit.\n\nRegardless of your skill level, Mutant Mudds has plenty of simple, enjoyable platforming to offer. It occupies a remarkable place in retro gaming, not fully 8-bit or 16-bit in its stylings, but a unique blend that feels natural and approachable. The wealth of levels to explore and secrets to find on top of the very basic design makes it feel like something that would have been a worthy contemporary of Super Mario Bros. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this one, and I'd say it's worth the time of anyone with even a passing interest in platformers.","February 9","true","1.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Maybe it was the lack of expectation but I was extremely surprised with how good this game is. I played everything this game has to offer, collected everything, every unlockable character etc. It quickly became one of my favorite platformers on steam.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple and nothing original, with jumping, shooting and moving between background, foreground and middleground as the main mechanics. But it's so damn well made!\n\nWhen reviewing platformers it's always good to ask yourself a few questions regarding what kind of player you are. There are mainly two kinds of people (relevant to my point anyway): people who get satisfaction proportionally to the level of frustration and those who don't. Another question to ask yourself is how good you are in platformers.\n\nTo me personally this game has the ideal difficulty curve. Definitely not easy, I cursed several times. I fall in the category of people who don't get satisfaction proportionally to the frustration, but I also have 20 years of experience playing platformers so those things balance each other well sometimes.\n\nPeople are different, of course. Some may find this a bit easy, others a bit frustrating. I hope my testimony can help you make a better judgement before buying.","April 30, 2014","true","7.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Jumping, shooting and hovering past well-designed levels and obstacles was a treat. The interplay of multiple depths in the levels is an inspired mechanic as well. Mutant Mudds is well-paced and, at times, challenging, while never being too difficult or frustrating. Failure is only punished by having to go back to an earlier point in the level and the levels are not all that long to begin with. There are also plenty of things to collect and extra challenges to complete beyond the original 20 levels, providing for adequate length and value. The chiptune soundtrack and pixel art are an excellent complement to the classical design.\n\nIf there is anything truly lacking, it is the story. It wasn't until it told me that I had collected all of them that I found out that the things I had been collecting were "water sprites" and apparently had some connection with the defeating the animate mud creatures.","May 27, 2014","true","9.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Super tight controls are nice, like in games such as super meat boy and hyper switch force for example, are PRIME examples of what a decent platformer is.\n\nThis is neither of those things. This game has horrible spawn platforms, poor stage design with a collect-o-thon of gold and medals, but more often than not do i see myself making sacrifices to the health pool or dying to cheap mechanics (like the floating) or the near perfect timing to kill a mob before a moving panel etc. Having a tight game with perfect timing and excecution is a wonderful idea, but only if it works on the title promoting it. The main toon is slower than most "deactivating" platforms. The mobs are literally placed in spots ensuring a pit-fall or some other shinanigan.\n\nThis game tries, and it tries hard. It looks crisp, feels rewarding, has achievements and badge progression, but it is so cheap. Cheap is the perfect word. When I die, I dont blame my skill, I blame poor mapwork and toon placement. In games like super meat boy, if I die, I have myself to blame and only myself. When I die here, I sigh.

I installed it and let the madness ensue. For one, you're character, Max, plays well. The player can allow Max to jump, fire his water gun, or move left or right. Now the whole game you are collecting these water jewels and there are forty in total. In order to get some, you'll need to unlock and use some of the upgrades, one at a time unfortunately, like a vertical leap, increaed hover, and power shot. The game at this point is easy, with enough difficulty that it can allow wiggle room for. You'll die a bit but will get the gist of the level eventually. That said, the deluxe version of this game includes dark levels. That is, all the enemies are unkillable, unless you have access to a special gun which only has ten shots on it. The level is also much harder and I must say, these levels are frustrating. I don't think it was a good idea having the enemies invincible as it creates jumps which are almost impossible without taking damage or tricky platforming. That said, the Granny medals, probably supposed to be the harder thing to get, were surprisingly fun. I mean, there was a difficulty to them but it was enjoyable to figure out and play. Also, before I forget, Granny has access to all power-ups, not just one at a time. Ok, overall, this indie game is very enjoyable in actuality. The dark levels are very frustrating and grating but the rest of the game is great. I'd pick it up if you could, though maybe take the dark levels slowly.","June 30, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No special techniques, no super-insane gimmicks, just you and some pixel perfect platforming. Which, playing through this while playing Strider, was much welcome and deserved.\n\nMutant Mudds forgoes a lot of detailed mechanics for having the player be precise in his approach to platforming, taking their time through the levels and even being overly defensive much of the time. There were plenty areas where I probably could have just ran through and taken a hit, but the feeling of having to redo half of a level if one more hit is taken can aggrivate some (I know it did for me plenty) but once you've beaten it, there's a great feeling of success I felt that I really haven't felt in a long time. And I haven't even bothered with the Grannie levels.\n\nIf you're interested in a platformer that's going to test your patience in both player deaths and level procedure, this is a good fit. The lack of mechanics makes it perfect for the decisive play it encourages. Otherwise, you might want to try something with much more "updated" feeling controls.","June 23, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It plays upon common platformer tropes such as an ice stage with sliding physics or a lava stage with fireballs that erupt from the lava. One of it's only interesting ideas are levels where the enemies are ghosts and need to be avoided rather than shot. It also plays around with multiple layers in levels that can only be swapped to at certain points. It's a neat idea visually, but does little to add to the gameplay. At rare times it can become annoying to parse out enemies in the background before you swap layers or to see some enemies when they overlap. This at times can't be avoided because of certain instances like the ghost levels where the enemies are transparent. Besides this the levels are usually simple, clean, and designed well enough. There's even secret levels with themes relating to old graphics such as GameBoy, Virtual Boy, and CGA style.\n\nThe game's art is great through out but the product itself feels hollow as it never really does anything beyond it's base abilities of jump, hover to cross gaps, shoot mudds, and eventually a boost jump to rocket up. They hurt this even further by limiting you to having only one upgrade at a time of either increased hover, longer shot, or the boost jump for your first playthrough. After you complete it you gain access to another character who can use all three at the same time. The limited moveset keeps the art of platforming a bit more pure, but your ability to deal with situations differently could of been enhanced if they stuck with the more varied moveset from the beginning instead of making you play through the game once to acquire it. They did design certain secret levels around using all three upgrades, but it still doesn't feel like it reaches a varied or interesting enough game to really matter. You could still revisit these old levels and bypass huge sections after acquiring the characters that can use all three upgrades at one time, but there's generally little point besides speedrunning and finding the secret levels.\n\nThe game in general just suffers from being generic, unmemorable, and most of all boring. The games pick up and play style might of lent itself more to it's original home on the 3DS, but I grew painfully bored after only a few minutes each time I picked this up. The music didn't ease any of the pain either as it was an average chiptune soundtrack without anything that really stood out. The game laid out it's cards within the first ten minutes and then never did anything different enough to matter for the rest of the seven hours I took to fully complete it. I could only hope if a sequel is made that they add actual variety to the levels to mix up the monotony or make the game harder instead of the slight cakewalk it already is.\n\nI only recommend this as I find the game is a fine trip overall and will itch a certain platforming scratch for some people, but it could of done a lot more than it set out to do.","February 6, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Shouldn't happen for this game, but I am nothing if not (mostly) consistent.\n\nGameplay: On its surface, Mutant Mudds doesn't seem too impressive. It's an indie platformer in the vein of the NES games which inspired it. After playing it through, I can definitely agree with the sentiment that the game isn't too particularly impressive. However, this game does manage to be a good bit of fun, with a surprising bit of challenge in some of the hidden levels, albeit also with a rather wonky difficulty curve.\n\nThis game is best described as a level-centric Metroidvania-lite. There's four levels per "world" and five worlds total; twice that if you count the alternate stages for these. Within these stages are hidden stages which are unlockable via the three powerups you collect throughout the game: a powerup that lets you hover for longer; a powerup that allows your shots to break down barriers (not doing any additional damage to enemies, oddly enough), and a powerup that lets you jump much higher than initially. You can only hold one of these powerups at a time, but there are secret characters which you can unlock that have all three at one time. These characters are used to unlock CGA stages, a more difficult series of levels which are used mainly for completion's sake and nothing else. This game is also something of a collect-a-thon, albeit a very mild one. There are 100 collectables per stage, amounting to 4,000 by the game's end. These aren't hidden in particularly challenging places, but they do force you to do some precarious jumps from time to time.\n\nThe main gimmick of the game is that there are three planes of stages. One thing that I learned was that this game was  a port of the 3DS version, and after learning that, I can see exactly where the gimmick came from. While I don't own a 3DS and as such can't say for myself as to how good the 3D effect is, I can say that the game does an okay job of recreating that feeling of depth, even if some elements of the foreground do get in the way from time to time. It's not a dealbreaker, however. As for the stages themselves, they're fairly "rompy." I really can't think of any other way to describe them. There's no boss battles in this game, which rather surprised me considering that a boss fight could work with the control scheme, but again, it's not a big deal. My biggest complaint about the controls (and is a complaint shared by many others) is that movement is very sluggish and can potentially lead to a somewhat boring experience. I do wish your character moved faster, but that would also require changing a lot of the stage design.\n\nAt the end of the day, Mutant Mudds Deluxe isn't out to blow the hinges off of anyone's door. What it instead intends to do is give you a pretty good time. It did only take me just over five hours to 100% the game, and almost exactly the same amount of time for a person who is much better at platformers than me to 100% the game. Beyond that, I don't see much in the way of replay value. I don't know if I'll ever be coming back to this game, to be quite frank. I did have a good time, though, and I do feel like I got my $10 of value. 7/10.\n\nStory: Nothing remarkable; I'll be skipping to Graphics.\n\nGraphics: When you start the game, it launches in a window... with menus. In fact, things like screen resolution and control configuration aren't actually baked into the game, meaning that if you wanna change controls, you'll have to go into windowed mode in order to change your settings. A bit disappointing, but that would mainly be a niche issue if you ask me. Once you get that business sorted out, the game doesn't have any graphical issues whatsoever. As for the art design, it reminds me quite a bit of Wonder Boy's graphics. It of course comes down to how you feel about pixel art, but for my eyes, the game wasn't that bad. Animations are smooth, there's pretty good shading on the enemies, and it all has a pretty nice style. Good stuff all around. 4/5.\n\nSound: Again, this comes somewhat down to taste, as the soundtrack for this game is entirely chiptune music. It's not bad, but I don't really remember much of it, even after having just played it. As for the sound design, it's just some bleeps and bloops. Not really worth discussing all that much. Of course, there's no voice acting either, but did you really expect it? Pretty alright and nothing more on this front. 3/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/0/4/3; cumulative score of 7.0/10. It's just a fun, simple little platformer that doesn't go too far beyond being fun or simple.","December 21, 2014","true","5.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Way-back when, the platforming genre dominated home consoles,and today it remains a genre that evokes nostalgia in the best of us. Most games I have played fail miserably when it comes to kickstarting that trip down memory lane. Thankfully, Mutant Mudds Deluxe didn't end up on that short-list. Upon my first time playing, this game gracefully slapped failure in it's face, raised it's middle finger to all those that tried to hard, donned it's sunglassess then lit up a cigarette. Mutant Mudds Deluxe is nothing short of amazing. It's a platformer with some really nice tight controls (you have the option to play this game with a game-pad if you so choose), the best jet pack mechanic I've ever used, great level design, which in itself is great because you have to jump into different layers of the levels, so foreground, background, you know the score.\n\nWhat sets this game apart from most modern platformers? Well it has some real nice scrolling, the sprites are great, but the number one thing that set me off was the soundtrack. The soundtrack is pure chiptune, and that's never a bad thing. It sounds like it was done on a chiptracker, from my experience it sounds like an NES soundchip, so FamiTracker maybe? Ahh... Who cares, it's a great soundtrack, a great game, and one that sound be downloaded instantly. Easily one of the best indie games I've played, and a massive reccomendation to anyone that loves the genre.","December 3, 2013","true","7.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Starts off simple enough and feels somewhat weird at first, cause the timing of jumps is strange and you really gotta get used to your "backpack" that allows hovering and as a result delayed landing. Everything quickly falls into place after the initial "WTF"-phase and the levels are well done to provide both a challenge the first time around but also allowing ample opportunities to shortcut and speedrun once you unlocked both the advanced abilities as well as new characters. Each stage manages to not overstay it's welcome, and each world being over as soon as you got comfortable with the worlds "feature" - meaning challenges stay fresh till the very end.\n\nIn fact, it is so well designed and motivating I pretty much finished it in a 9 hours marathon-session - it really has that "okay, just one more level"-thing going for it and time flies as you grab diamonds, find hidden stages and collect waterspirits. It quickly becomes a real challenge too, the Ghost world and particularly the final 20 levels (all realized in a beautiful CGA-palette, including dithered shadows <3) are serious platforming-business that are reminiscent of stages from "They bleed pixels" or "Super Meat Boy". If you tire of the more challenging stages, you can always go back and collect stuff from previous levels, again providing a different style of play and a nice change of pace.\n\nThis title is pretty much pure gameplay - no cutscenes, story, or developed characters whatsoever and as far as platformers go feels very classic console-like. It is pretty much up there with the best on Steam right now. A real beauty too - bright and vibrant, with nice color palettes. A particularly nice touch were the Nintendo Handheld-themed secret levels each with a fitting color-palette too! Only downside to the visuals is that they tend to get very busy every now and then, making it hard to see what is going on in your layer as stuff from the background and foreground may be obstructing your view. It can be annoying at times, but is not gamebreaking. To top it all off there is some fantastic chiptune music playing in the background, perfecting the retro-platforming feel.\n\nCompared to the 3DS and Wii-Versions, the Deluxe Version on PC is pretty much the definitive version of Mutant Mudds - not only do we get all the levels and characters, but we got checkpoints too (which just so happen to make this game a LOT less frustrating)! Hopefully, we will see more from these developers in the future.","January 5, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The actual gameplay mechanics of the game are pretty sound. you start and stop on a time, Air control is one to one with what you put in, the hovering mechanics are fine. The transitions between planes is smooth and works just fine, and makes for a good addition to the game. But my issues lies in the games difficulty...\n\nMost of the diffucluty in this game comes from a gamer's impatience. Meander over her./ Wait for this to clear. Wait for the next thing to be clear. wait for the enemy to come back around. You messed up? go back to the last check point. It's not bad when there seems to be a reward... But this just came on as tedious and boring. If the main character moved a little faster, the game would be more engaging, and the tedium would go away, as it wouldn't take what feels like hours to get back to the point you were at before.\n\nAnother facet of the difficulty are the powerups. Sure, you unlock them by collecting the diamonds, but you get a single one at a time. The gun upgrade knocks walls out and shoots a bit further, but doesn't make your actual attack any more powerful. You don't feel any better eqipped to take on the mudds. The extra hover is nice, but it's more of a safety net than anything. The boost jump is what I defaulted for the most part. The point is, it's not helping you feel like you're getting stronger in the game. It's another layer of tedium to add to the game. And you have to slowly wander to grandma's house to change the power up... It's tedious! In the moon levels, you have the ghost mudds. Can't hit them unless you grab a powerup in stage. And then there are a few layering issues due to the ghost mudd transparancy.\n\nThe first half of the game or so you'll blow through fairly quickly. I suppose to summarize, the mechanics are both the strongest and weakest points of the game. It's ok... But there is a lot of frustration waiting to happen for you.","June 20, 2015","false","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/okram/recommended/247370/","okram","okram2k","http://steamcommunity.com/id/okram/","289 products in account","eleased this week on Steam from Renegade Kid is indy platformer Mutant Mudds Deluxe. On sale right now for $4.99 thanks to Steam and their never ceasing sales I picked up this nod to retro style platformers and gave it a try. The story in Mutant Mudds is uh… I think there’s a hint of a story somewhere. The closest nod to any sort of story telling is a quick collection of scenes of you watching tv in your house, flash to an asteroid, flash to a news caster about an invasion, flash to you outside your house armed with a jetpack and rifle! Ready, set, go!\n\nSo for whatever unexplicable reason our four-eyed hero is off to save the world as the only uh… kid… in the right place at the right time with his trusty rifle and jetpack. I would say something about the travesty of sending children off to war only to be slaughtered but these Mutant Mudd guys aren’t exactly the most organized or ferocious invasion force I’ve ever seen. I think they went through King Koopa’s army training because mostly they just pace around back and forth on set paths and hope somebody is foolish enough to run into them.\n\nSo you go through the levels with two goals, collect all the golden diamonds throughout the level and grab the water sprite at the end of the level. There are exactly 100 gold coins… I mean diamonds spread across each world and it is a good progress meter to judge just how many dumb Mudds you have to blast before you’re near the end. As with any good platformer the levels consist of a fair amount of enemy blasting and precision maneuvering in order to get to the goal. As you progress the levels get quite noticeably tougher and much less forgiving.\n\nOne of the major features of Mutant Mudds is the ability to jump to one of three levels, foreground, regular, and background. There are certain points where you can jump from one to the other and there’s a bit of strategy involved here. You have to be careful not to say, jump to the background right on top of an enemy. Also as one of the goals is to collect all the “gold diamonds” there are sometimes certain paths you can take which might keep you from getting all the diamonds this run and force you to repeat the level.\n\nAs you progress at certain intervals of the currency you can unlock power-ups. From what I can tell you can only equip one power-up at a time (although perhaps later you can unlock the ability to equip more than one?) They are quite handy, one increases the range of your rifle, another doubles the amount of time your jet pack can keep you hoovering, and the last has a big super jump that sends you flying high into the air. These power-ups are vital as well for accessing hidden secret zones in each level as some are tucked away in places that are impossible to reach without a power-up. I found doubling the jetpack fuel capacity by far the most handy as it makes jumping puzzles a lot more forgiving especially when trying to get timing correct.\n\nOverall I found the game quite appealing. I like the multi-layered levels and the graphics are pretty darn decent pixel works. The music is also really good and made me a bit nostalgic. You almost think this game would have been an old classic SNES rom rather than a newly released game to steam. It’s clear the developer had a long love for Mario and the likes and did a pretty good job emulating and expanding on old classics. The game doesn’t leave me without complaint as I wish four-eyes knew how to shoot in a direction other than parallel to the ground and the jetpack would be more handy if you could turn it off then back on again. All the same, for $5 it’s worth your money if you’re a fan of the old classics but the game can get frustratingly hard. For me, the game has to be played in short spurts or I start to get annoyed at the tricky timing required for some of the jump puzzles.\n\nFinal Score:\nGraphics: 7.5/10\nGame Play: 8/10\nMusic / Ambiance: 9/10\nStory: 4/10\nValue: 7/10\nOverall: 7.1/10\nVisit my blog to check out more indy game reviews!\nhttp://markofithian.com","November 30, 2013","true","2.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

And more waiting. Enemies will be placed on ledges just above you so that you have to shoot them to continue, or directly in your path just off of the path you're on. Or worse, invincible enemies will be placed in front of you that temporarily block your path. They don't shoot at you, by the way. They don't do anything but be an obstruction, and they take several shots to take down, so it's neither a fun run n gun about accuracy or a Megaman Style platformer.\n\nCollectibles are the worst example, with simple coins requiring you to get to the top of a series of platforms, jump down in a direction, and then climb back up. Or instead of putting a pit of spikes for failing an obstacle, they just put a few spaced out platforms covered with coins, with heights that go up the father you get, so you are virtually guaranteed never to get all of them. Moving platforms are just stacked with these things so that you have to line up your jump AND stay on each one a few times.\n\nIt's painful difficulty padding that the game never gets past. It's all that it seems to be ABOUT.\n\n---\n\nMore than that, the level design is simple and never involves you doing anything other than waiting and shooting, only being in danger if you get impatient and deciding to take the hits. There's rarely an option to dodge enemies or run and jump around them to speedrun. It's a game that makes you play at its pace, and that pace is not determined by your skill. It's just...WAITING.\n\nDon't play this. Please do not ever play this. It's awful.","August 23, 2015","false","4.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You must navigate through the environment with nothing but a slow-firing, short-ranged gun and the ablity to jump + hover (though later on, you can unlock some abilities which you can equip one of at any given time which make you somewhat better at platforming). There are 20 levels in the main game, plus 20 bonus mini-levels hidden in those levels, plus an additional 20 post-game levels and 20 bonus post-game mini-levels. The levels only take a few minutes to beat, generally speaking, but some of the later ones are fairly challenging and might require you to keep trying time and again until you beat them. Every level has a single checkpoint in it, which is mostly adequete for the task, though a couple of late-game levels are long enough that dying right before the checkpoint/end of the level is wasting a minute or two of time.\n\nThat being said, there is literally nothing else there; the graphics are okay but nothing to write home about, and the story is a more bare-bones excuse plot than Super Mario Brothers - it is very vague and uninspiring, and I really had no strong feeling about how what I was doing was actually helping in any way, or even what it was I was purportedly trying to accomplish. Consequently, the game has a real feeling of pointlessness around it.\n\nStill, the game isn't bad; it just isn't great. If you are interested in doing some random platforming, it isn't a bad choice, but honestly, you can do better, and there's no reason to go out of your way to play this particular game.","December 7, 2015","false","6.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/247370/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Twenty years ago, we never would have guessed that today’s generation of consoles would embrace 8-bit side-scrolling platformers. With the release of titles like Terraria, however, this trend does not show any signs of slowing. As these games continue to grow in popularity, developers such as Renegade Kid are fusing the power of new hardware with older gameplay styles, resulting in fresh experiences such as Mutant Mudds Deluxe.\n\nFor those out of the loop, this is throwback 2D title with a unique twist. Unlike traditional releases in the genre, it requires you to leap into the background or jump out of the screen in order to explore different parts of each level’s environments. In some areas, there are as many as three planes layered on top of each other, offering a chaotic screen filled with moving enemies, platforms, and dangerous spikes.\n\nThe title tells the tale of an asteroid carrying a hoard of barbaric, brown monsters. Max, a blond-haired boy with a water gun and a jet-pack sets off to rid the world of the vermin by gathering star sprites. With the help of his Granny, the hero travels through five lands in his quest to eradicate the problematic pests.\n\nTrying to wipe away the Mudds with a water gun is no easy task. There are several different kinds of enemies to attack, each with a different ability and movement pattern. Your weapon aims horizontally, has a limited range, and only fires the next water blast once the last one has disappeared. These limitations result in the cleanup operation being more difficult. You must attack or avoid moving Mudds while ducking through scrolling platforms, tight quarters, spinning hazards, and leaping fireballs.\n\nTravelling through each level requires patience, timing, aiming, and trial-and-error. Each enemy travels on a predetermined path, and careful shooting, jumping, floating, and ducking is needed to avoid enemies and their attacks. You begin each level with three hearts, and halfway through there is a checkpoint where progress through the stage is saved. To add to the challenge, a time limit of four minutes is placed on each outing. Fortunately, it’s not too difficult to pass these quotas, but you will need plenty of skill to cross the finish line without losing a heart.\n\nAs you progress through the game, new levels and upgrades open up – assuming that you’ve collected the required number of star sprites. There are also Ghost Levels, which force you to slip past phantom Mudds that cannot be killed. The levels offer a real challenge, and avoiding the mutants requires real agility.\n\nUpgrades, meanwhile, augment Max with the ability to shoot longer distances, add a longer lifespan to his jetpack, or the option to leap high into the air. You can only apply one of these upgrades at a time, but the enhancements allow you to complete levels much easier. You’ll also need to employ these additions to locate the hidden rooms in each stage.\n\nRegardless of which power-ups you employ, this can be a challenging game – and depending on how tough you want it to be, there are ways that you can increase the difficultly. You can, for example, disable the abovementioned mid-level checkpoints, allowing you to choose whether you want to be forced to beat the entire level in one run or not.\n\nThe music and visuals are enjoyable throughout the game, although the song selection for each of the shadow levels does get a little stale after a little while. When jumping in and out of planes, it can be very chaotic, as the foreground remains visible while you play. This increases the challenge on some levels, requiring a much greater focus if you want to make it through unscathed.\n\nThere’s plenty more to do once the vermin have been scrubbed, too. Gathering all of the star sprites, all of the golden diamonds, completing the secondary levels, and the other special levels offers plenty for you to accomplish beyond the core campaign. Granted, it’s possible to finish the adventure in less than eight hours using the hardest settings – however, since so much of the game revolves around replaying the same levels multiple times, you may not be compelled to come back once you’re done. Furthermore, the conclusion of the adventure is lacklustre, forcing you to focus on the satisfaction that you obtain from finishing the levels rather than exciting cutscenes or plot twists.\n\nMutant Mudds Deluxe takes the old-school platforming formula and freshens it up with a unique twist. The dimension hopping hook augments a tactical layer to the traditional side-scrolling action, and the occasionally devilish difficulty will test your dexterity. While there’s a lot of content to get through, however, the adventure does get repetitive at times. Nevertheless, there’s not a whole lot of grime in this game – just good, clean fun.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 27, 2014","true","25.8"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

Well, I must admit this one's is too.\n\nRemember how intensely slow and plodding old DOS game movement was? Yup, this one too.\n\nRemember how ridiculously basic old DOS game combat was? Sensing the pattern yet?\n\nEverything about this game reminded me of old DOS games. That might not sound like such a bad thing, but when is the last time you actually played an old DOS game? They're BURSTING with nostalgic goodness and they put a rose-tinted smile on my face, but objectively? They're stuffy, stilted, restrictive, confining, and almost all of that was due to required programming restrictions. Games were that way because they pretty much had to be.\n\nSo why would I want to play a brand new game that feels every bit as stuffy as a 20-year-old one, without any of the needed nostalgia that still makes them fun? You know, I can actually play the old games if I want to, rather than a bland similarity of one that only hints at vague shadows of nostalgia.\n\nThe art style is pixellated, but uncreative. The enemies are different sizes of round or gumdrop shaped brown blobs. The levels are entirely linear (except for not-so-cleverly-hidden "secret" doors on every single level), and they only last a few minutes at a time. There is nothing overly clever or creative, nothing mind-blowing, nothing exciting, and nothing fun.\n\nIf you were desperate for something new to play on your phone in the bathroom at work, this might be able to hold your interest for a while, but on a PC or console (or Vita, where I played it), it is boring, dull, slow, colorless, and any 5 other synonyms for lame. Don't get me wrong, I could see people playing through this game easily. I could not, however, see anyone playing this with a smile on their face or with excitement in their heart.\n\nI've been rather hard on middling games lately, but you know what?

That's a challanging platformer that's also fulfilling. This game is just...really boring. It feels completely uninspired. The enemies were completely uninteresting to me and seemingly all had the exact same AI pattern (move to the left for 2 seconds, move to the right for 2 seconds), which was, again, boring. If you're a sucker for 'modern' 8-bit soundtracks, I guess you'll like this one, but it felt to me like it was trying too hard and didn't feel natural.\n\nI completed the first worlds of levels giving it a chance, and moved onto the second world, which is an ice world and everything just felt "off". The physics of the platforming feel clumsy in general (and incredibly slow), add ice blocks and unpredictible sliding to that and it was just not fun to me anymore, so I stopped playing. I did play the "nightmare" versions of a couple of the levels, which was a neat idea, but not enough to make up for the rest of the mediocrity. The 3 plane idea also seemed cool at first, but quickly revealed itself as a gimmick that doesn't hold the weight that the game seemingly puts on it.\n\nMaybe you'll like it.

Those are 5 good words to describe this game.\nThe problems start with character movement. Your walk speed is sooooo. Sloooooow. I have played walking simulators where you move faster than this game has you moving. The hover mechanic is alright and the unlockable mechanics are serviceable most of the time (upward dash has issues registering, though). But it doesn't matter, because the slow move speed slows the game to a crawl.\nThe level design is also rock-bottom in quality. Some of the levels are okay but... ehh, let's list some things that happen numerous times:\n1. Enemies placed in a way that taking a hit is preferrable than trying to figure out/failing to dodge hits.\n2. Blind upward dashes where if you jump before you dash, you'll hit a spiked ceiling... sometimes. Other points in the level you'll need to do a jump first, but you can't see far enough up to know whether or not you need to jump first.\n3. Lopsided checkpoints. Frequently. They are very often misplaced, either too early or too late in the level.\n4. Wildly varying level length. Some of the levels are on the short side, others can take minutes to clear.\n5. The ones that take longer tend to have copy/paste level design where you do the same segment multiple times, point-for-point, needlessly dragging boring levels on even longer.\n6. There's not a lot of variety in general, there's only so many different obstacles possible with the limited amount of game objects and there are far too many levels for how little variety they provide.\n7. Foreground objects can get in the way of background objects, obscuring visibility. Legit fake difficulty, yo. The farthest back layer is too zoomed out most of the time anyways, character is way too small on-screen.\nThe game never gets too hard, really, which is maybe for the better as the controls aren't polished enough for really precise platforming. The music is decent and the graphics are decent, but the retro feel they gave off permeated into the game design and as a result makes it feel like a game that should've stayed in the time period it's trying to emulate.","December 20, 2014","false","6.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Explore great locations such as yellow platform with tree background. Red platform with spikes. Brown platform with angry cloud background. And the movement is painfully sluggish. I can't remember the last platformer I've played without a dash mechanic or something. Sonic, Mario, 90% of the Megaman games had at least a slide mechanic. All of the enemies are uninspired as well.

This game tries too hard to be "retro" just by taking away any sort of depth to the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darezzi/recommended/247370/","darezzi","darezzi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darezzi/","371 products in account","Let's talk about every single point the video wants to convey to you.\n\n1. Pixel-Perfect Platforming\n\nYes. If by pixel perfect, you mean that you can see every pixel and you move so ♥♥♥♥ing slow and sluggish that you will precisely know where every pixel will go. Except if you jump, then you're ♥♥♥♥ed, because you're probably a scrub that's used to main-stream things like gravity, and not hardcore games that ignore a=F/m. Mega Man? What a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, having realistic acceleration and ♥♥♥♥, like a conformist. And of course, we can't forget the ice. If you happen to jump while moving on the ice, you're confined to a cloud of slippery air around you, that shakes it's head angrily if you think it's gonna let you control normally, even though you can control jumps every other way (Including if you jump while on ice, but not moving).\n\n2. 80 Challenging Levels\n\nYes. If by 80 you mean 20 of them are actually copies, with the only change that enemies can't be killed. You go straight through them, nonetheless. Those 40 are painfully short, you wonder why there's even a checkpoint. Oh yeah, because you have 3 hearts in a game that either makes you wait the time it takes to have lunch, or sacrifice a heart because you're not hardcore enough to play a game of chess before you get the chance to clear a jump without one of the million crap balls hurting you. And spikes are a one-hit KO. It's pretty challenging to not scream at your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character, who, by all means, should get smothered in crap because for some reason, he thinks he's capable of saving the world by not being able to shoot and run at the same time.\n\n3. Three Depths of Gameplay\n\nYes. But what's the point if you're not gonna use it, and if I'm gonna feel uncomfortable in any other depth other than the middle one, because the far one in too far to be precise, and the close one is to close up to know what crap ball is inevitably going to hurt you. Or spikes. Then hope you hit a checkpoint before that, because you're gonna have to watch mr. geek sloth trot along for another 3 minutes, which seem like 3 hours.\n\n4. 5 Unique "12-Bit" Worlds\n\nI'd rather put the colons on "Unique", because every world just has a different gimmick. The first has nothing, the second has physics-defying ice, the third has lava balls, the fourth has alternating one-hit-kill clouds, and the fifth has alternating one-hit-kill spike pendulums. Oh, and spikes are replaced with lasers. Yes, very unique. That crap game, Cave Story, has only one world. That's awfully lazy. Oh wait, it's actually unique and has a lot of work and art put into it? Who needs that when you have 5 unique worlds Mutant ♥♥♥♥♥ deluxe gives you!\n\n5. Over 20 Original Chiptunes.\n\nYeah, I can give the game that. They belong to the world they're in. They're really forgettable, though. Seriously though, take a lesson from Mega Man, Cave Story, Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV. I can name every soundtrack from those games, and they're not that complex, but hold a LOT of emotion.\n\n6. Unique Ghost World Levels\n\nMy, these people really love throwing the word "unique" around like it's a 50% Coupon for Mutant Mudds Deluxe. Those are the same 20 levels from the beginning, only with unkillable enemies. My, so unique.\n\n7. Classic Neo-Retro Themes\n\nGreat job for using nostalgia to mask lazyness and sloppy game design.\n\n8. Utilize Special Power-Ups\n\nThis one takes the cake for being the most misleading thing on this list. There is only one "Power-Up" and it gives you 10 bullets (No, you can't have 20, you greedy piece of ♥♥♥♥) that CAN hurt the ghost ♥♥♥♥ balls. Still unkillable though, as they respawn in 2 seconds, which means they're only useful when the developers wanted them to be useful.\n\n9. Watch Out For Hazards!\n\nYes. As in the only enemy in the game. Watch out for the unique ♥♥♥♥ ball. And the unique spike, which comes in 3 unique spike sizes.\n\nWell that alone sums Mutant Mudds Deluxe up. So this promotional video was both their grave, and a very spread-out rouge.\nJust don't buy this game. Whether it cost 1$ or the unbelievable 10$ they want for this ♥♥♥♥ fest, literally. Go get an emulator, and play ONE Mega Man, you're gonna have a better time.\n\n\n","June 9, 2014","false","8.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Controls and platforming are well done.\n\nHowever, I still have a few gripes with the game. One, it can get repetitive as you will need to play every level multiple times in order to fully complete the game. Two, the level design is a bit repetitive as well. In a Mario or Donkey Kong game, you will get a variety of new platforming elements thrown at you in each individual level you play. The problem with Mutant Mudds is that is has 20 individual levels in 5 total worlds, only each world has variety, not the individual levels themselves. Three, the game was originally designed for the 3DS so the level design will feel slightly awkward with no stereoscopic 3D, but this is more of a nitpick than an actual problem.\n\nThe Deluxe version includes 20 extra levels, which are dark world levels. These levels  are the same as the levels you already played except for the fact that you can't kill any of the enemies unless you have a temporary weapon found in-level.\n\nAfter you complete the game you can also complete the grandma levels which are the hardest in the game but on the flipside you can equip all 3 powerups at the same time.\n\nAs a gamer who loves platformers, fully completing the game and collecting all steam achievements took a little less than 8 hours. Overall, If you're a gamer who loves platformers then it's hard to not recommend MM: Deluxe for 9.99.

Three, the game was originally designed for the 3DS so the level design will feel slightly awkward with no stereoscopic 3D, but this is more of a nitpick than an actual problem.\n\nThe Deluxe version includes 20 extra levels, which are dark world levels. These levels  are the same as the levels you already played except for the fact that you can't kill any of the enemies unless you have a temporary weapon found in-level.\n\nAfter you complete the game you can also complete the grandma levels which are the hardest in the game but on the flipside you can equip all 3 powerups at the same time.\n\nAs a gamer who loves platformers, fully completing the game and collecting all steam achievements took a little less than 8 hours. Overall, If you're a gamer who loves platformers then it's hard to not recommend MM: Deluxe for 9.99. Even with the gripes i'd say the game deserves an 8/10, but this is coming from a person who loves this genre of gaming.","July 7, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I actually wound up accidentally making this the first game I completed to 100%, and didn't even notice until the last achievement popped up. It does have its flaws, such as when things get a bit cluttered a couple of times between the different layers of the game(foreground, midground, and background), but otherwise it's mostly a seamless game for those that love platformers. If you don't care too much for it, though, this might not be the game for you.","June 21, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With simple mechanics like that, you would expect it to just run you down; but the game takes each element and subtly changes it so that each level actually feels different in it's own way. This game has 3 power ups that Max can utilize, all of which differentiate the gameplay in each level. As well within each level contain 2 secret levels, 1 which Max can access and another which Max cannot access till later in the game. For the perfectionists out there, you have the ability to collect 100 Golden Diamonds scattered along the path towards the end of each level.\n\nWith the mix of 8-bit to 16-bit era gaming, this "12-bit" game leaves a lot of room for frustration and excitement.\n\n9/10","September 13, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When i found this game on steam on the sale, i decided to try out the full version of the game\n\nThis game is fun for hardcore platformers, however some of the jumps have to be perfectly executed otherwise you die. I do find this to be a bit of a problem with the game as your jumps must be pixel perfect to make some jumps. There isint much difference between levels either apart from a few features. Also the weapon kind of blows and feels like your attacking with a water pistol rather than a actual weapon (I know that it can be upgraded)\n\nI feel this is one of those games where i would complete it once to get all the achievements and never play it again. However, i find this game to be very fun when im looking for a challenge and i would recommend this game to any gamer that likes or is good at platformers.\n\n7/10","November 8, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls feel a bit clunky at first, random windowed mode as well. It reminded me of old platformers like jazz jack rabbit. To beat every level you get 3 lives, no health pickups and optional checkpoints which if you die will respawn you with full health. Every level has two bonus levels (of which the second is reacheble only after you beat the game) and a ghost variant. This gives a plenty of content to go through. As you advance the levels are getting adequatly harder and it feels rewarding to collect all the little gems and medals. Achievements aren't that hard to get all.\n\nI would recommend to buy it if you like older platformers, this one is nicely done and I enjoyed completing it.","May 19","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
