You marines can only level up 4 times and this seriously puts them at a major disadvantage late game (especially on Normal and above)\n\n3) NG+ is not fleshed out. This connects to point 2, due to the limited levelling up and progression, the only reason to play NG+ is for a scaled challenge. Completed the game on Easy? NG+ is Easy 1.5 etc etc\n\n4) The game is meant to be played multiple times, but there is a slight lack in variey (especially in enemies)\n\nAfter completing a few runs, Ive seen enough.

I think of ascending difficulty where I try to find better gear and become more powerful so that I can attempt to defeat ever more challenging enemies until they kill me, or I manage to beat the end objective. Completing the game should be a proud moment that makes me want to brag to my friends that I finally accomplished it.\n\nSadly, Steam Marines fails to achieve most of this. The basic game mechanics aren't bad, and the first couple of levels were fun, but it gets sorely repetitive very quickly. Each area introduces new enemies, but they all do pretty much the same thing (except the bosses, but even they only have a minor twist to make them unique).  On the rare occasions when you find new weapons and armor, odds are your marines can't use it, or it will be worse than what you already have. Once you figure out how to beat the enemies, the game becomes very formulaic and more of a chore to trudge through each level. At normal difficulty, each level took about 30 minutes (that number can vary a lot). With 25 levels, it just takes way too long for a rogue-like.\n\nWhen I beat the game, I wasn't jumping for joy. Rather, I felt myself saying "finally, it's done." I decided to raise the difficulty to see if it got better. The enemies were tougher and more numerous, but still did the same thing. The levels just took longer and longer to beat and felt more like a crawl. After a couple of levels, I decided I had better things to do than wait a minute or two between every turn while the computer made its move.\n\nUPDATE: Changing the AI speed did help speed up the computer's turn significantly, but wasn't enough to reduce the tedium enough for me to want to play this game again. I got through a couple more levels and decided I'd rather spend my time playing something else. I do appreciate that the developers are still working on the game, so hopefully they'll be able to add enough variety to make me want to play it again.","January 10, 2015","false","56.6"," 91 of 96 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","91","96","2","9"

The game still does not feel like a full release. The random generator still spawns you in closed off rooms, the controls are still clunky, the UI still needs work and the overall experience still hasn't improved enough for me to recommend it.\n\nOriginal Early Access Review:\nI'm at a loss with Steam Marines. The game has promise and I might recommend it when it's finished, but so far the game is just lacking that special umph to make it a great experience rather than a mediocre one.\n\nIn Steam Marines you start the game looking over the tutorial, end up confused, start up a game and die... horribly. After 2 or so games and tinkering with the classes I started to get a grip on things. You choose a squad of 4 marines at the beginning of the game and each class has a different weapon and a different skill tree. The skill tree is interesting but basic, each level you get to choose a passive or an activated ability. I never did use the powers much as they take multiple points of Action Points (AP being the resource you use to move, shoot etc.) and it always seemed better to just fire regularly.\n\nThe gameplay is a slow tile-based tactical slog through a ghost ships with robots and other baddies crawling out of the walls before attacking. This can be very frustrating as a wrong move and lack of items to restore AP can lead to dead marines very quickly. Furthermore, the random dungeon generation really needs some touch-ups as rooms with no doors or walls placed on top of each other make it impossible to move without breaking down walls and you need to do this to create proper tactical spacing.\n\nAt the end of every level you're rated on your performance and if you're a careful player like me you'll most likely end with a negative score even if all your marines survived the level. The score seems to indicate that this is supposed to be a fast-paced tactical RPG but the gameplay itself rewards slow and methodical movement. It's frustrating to say the least.\n\nI'm not saying there isn't fun to be had with this game but in-between bouts of frustration, lackluster UI, boring music and a retro look that works but still needs a little work done (dropped items currently don't show up on the map) it just isn't worth the full price. With some polish I'm sure this gem will shine but right now I just can't recommend it.","September 10, 2014","false","8.0"," 151 of 187 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","151","187","3","7"

They might just hear you scream after playing this intentionally hard roguelike game.\n\nSteam Marines is a roguelike set onboard a ship that has been attacked. You control a squad of four soldiers who must reach the elevator on each procedurally generated floor to proceed through the ship and eventually find freedom. It would be fair to say the game takes a good amount of influence from the Space Hulk/Crusade and X-Com game series, with its dark corridors and rooms with ‘fog of war’ and action points to spend on movement and actions. While not an original concept, Steam Marines manages to blend its influences into a neat game.\n\nYour squad can be created from randomised suggestions or built from scratch. There are four classes to choose from, a leader, support, scout and grenadier. As the names suggest, their weaponry fits their names, the leader takes the front with a close range shotgun, scout with a long-range sniper gun and support with a high capacity machine gun. Having one of each is probably a good idea to get a good balance of strategy and combat.\n\nSteam Marines throws you in the deep end with a few words of encouragement to keep you afloat for a minute while you play the tutorial. The tutorial gives you a chance to see how the basics work such as movement and combat. Once completed, you are on your own to work the rest out. The tutorial could go into a little more detail for people who are not familiar with this genre of game. After reading the developers forums I found out a few features I knew nothing about. This is a Steam Early Access game meaning the game is still in development, so this can be excused but it is worth keeping an eye on the forums for this reason alone.\n\nAfter a floor or two, the enemy number becomes many, and you will likely hit a brick wall as you learn the game the hard way. Death is permanent and once your squad is gone, it is game over. Tactics is important as it is in any strategy combat game, never knowing what is around the next corner or behind a door. You will soon learn that moving a soldier with few remaining Action Points into a new room is a silly mistake as they will likely face a couple of enemy units with no points to take action with. The game is turn based, so killing as many enemy units or getting into cover before you run out of AP is essential, the enemy can be brutal even on the easiest difficulty. Tactics such as flanking enemies that have shields works particularly well and grants bonus damage.\n\nSteam Marines features a simple leveling up system that improves the soldiers stats such as their strength and class attributes. Your soldiers also have talents which are awarded as you progress and include attacks and defense buffs and special attacks which are important to take advantage of.\n\nMuch like the X-COM series, you form a bond with your soldiers and you will go to lengths to protect them. One mistake will make you scream as a group of enemy units slaughters half of your squad (if you are lucky). You can explore the ship to find items such as new weapons, health and AP replenishment and boosts. Survivors can join your team to replace any dead soldiers, but they will be weak and need to leveled up.\n\nThe graphics are an 8-bit pixel art style that is dark and at times scary. Scary, but not in a make you jump out of your seat way, more in a way that you never know what is in the next room. Your heart will miss a beat or two as you enter a new room to see what is inside. The audio adds to the atmosphere with again dark, slow and eerie effects that remind you of X-COM. It creates an opposing atmosphere and builds the tension very well.\n\nThere was little I did not like about Steam Marines. One minor annoyance is the auto-switch to new soldier once the selected soldiers AP has run out. If you manually choose a new soldier it can sometimes auto-switch to another without you realising and you end up moving the wrong soldier. You can switch this off in the options and I definitely recommend doing it!\n\nSteam Machines is a hard game, but it is fairly balanced and death will most likely be player error rather than the game. It is a dark, atmosphere filled strategy roguelike that works very well taking in a lot of inspiration from classic games. If you enjoy roguelike or tactics games this is a perfect game for you. If you are a newcomer, you may find the learning curve a little steep at the start, but it is something that can be reached and enjoyed.\n\nYou can buy Steam Marines via the homepage at http://www.steammarines.com/ or via Steam here.\n\nGameplay - 8/10\nTough but fair combat system. The approach to the levels gets you thinking the best strategy to reach the elevators.\nGraphics - 7.5/10\nNice pixel art 8bit style graphics that give a dark, opposing atmosphere.\nSound - 7.5/10\nEerie, slow background effects that builds up the suspense.\nFinal Score 8/10\n\nReview originally posted on http://www.gamergeddon.com","November 27, 2013","true","11.2"," 162 of 207 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","162","207","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/253630/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Steam Marines is another futuristic roguelike in town, released from the rather bizarrely named development studio, Worthless Bums. It offers a tactical squad turn-based gaming experience with some rather novel but very exact gaming mechanics which help it to stand out from the crowd. It boasts huge levels of difficulty and promises to provide the kind of old-school frustration which rogue players love to hate. The gameplay clearly caters to the kind of player who likes to make carefully calculated moves and always checks twice to ensure no mistakes happen, and for that type of player this game could well be the next thing on their shopping list. However, whether or not Steam Marines is a great deal of fun for anyone else is quite another matter.\nThe action takes place on a steampunk styled spaceship which is under attack. Your marine squad has been abruptly woken out of cryostasis to deal with whatever-the-hell is going on out there; an array of strange enemy robots and aliens. Details are left unexplained as you enter the top-down isometric playing field to take care of the invaders and progress through the game as far as you can.\nThe roguelike formula is interestingly twisted by the spaceship setting. Walls can be torn apart by both your team and the enemy. This offers the possibility of simply smashing through the walls rather than opening the doors. It also means you can be ambushed from boarding enemies at any particular moment. Equally, you can blast backwards enemies with knock-back weapons sending them into space and causing instant death. The objective of each randomly generated level is to find the elevator and descend. Each set of levels is split into the main decks – engineering, bridge, etc. – of the ship, all of them having their own tile-set and enemy unit types. After completing a deck and facing some kind of mini-boss you may choose the next deck to continue with.\nYour squad consists of four soldiers who can be any one of four different classes. Those consist of the leader, who has a shotgun; the scout, who has a long range gun and good visual range; the support, who has a machine gun; and the grenadier, who has an area of effect grenade launcher. XP is gained from exploring, descending, and killing enemies. The marines can be levelled up four times, each time you get to choose one of two special abilities; all of which are unique for that class. Additionally, special items, grenades and weapon upgrades can be found throughout the levels and made use of.\nThe game is designed to be completely unforgiving even on normal difficulty levels and it shows. One stupid mistake can easily cost you dearly, and the game is auto-saved in only one save game slot so there’s no way of reversing a disaster. The good news is that your marines do have hit points and therefore can normally withstand a small amount of damage, however; a great deal of errors do result in the death of a squad member.\nThere are also a few rather unique game mechanics in the game which are worth a mention because they make the tactical experience somewhat novel. For example, area of effect damage cannot initially kill units. This means that the grenadier can initially decimate a room of enemies, but can only finish one of them off at a time with direct hits. In addition, the game features flanking bonus damage where attacks from the side or back get additional damage.\nThe gameplay is compelling from a strategic and discovery perspective; in addition the game can move at a fairly fast-pace thanks to the ability to reduce the AI move-delay in the options menu. The combination of deadly enemies, ambushes through the walls, and a short standard weapon-range all adds up to an experience which could be rather charming for a certain type of tactical geek.\nConversely, the storyline is rather weak and doesn’t offer the kind of compulsion that, say, the space rouge-like Faster Than Light offered. Aside from a few Christmas cracker jokes from the marines and scraps of semi-nonsensical text discovered on computer consoles – which are really just acting as XP boosts – there really isn’t much plot to speak of. On top of that the game doesn’t offer an awful lot of customization. New weapons are few and far between and the four classes aren’t all that diverse; at least not to the extent of other roguelikes.\nPutting it all together, Steam Marines may be a tasty little challenge for some, but it’s not going to be everyone’s cup of tea. Perhaps it’ll be a nice addition to a rogue fan’s collection, and maybe a few indie diehards would like to pick it up to see what it’s all about. However, it doesn’t do a sufficient number of things in a new way or provide enough of a compelling experience to make it a hit for everyone; it’s nothing special, but it’s alright.","August 15, 2015","true","11.6"," 48 of 60 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","48","60","0","0"

There are so many other amazing roguelikes out there that I just can't be bothered. Heck, there's even a straight up Space Hulk game on Steam which may be less terrible, so if you're craving the derelict spaceship atmosphere of the beloved board game, maybe that's worth a shot instead?\n__________________________________\n\nAfter a brief glance at the development logs, I have my doubts as to whether or not the developer will produce that any time soon. The game was in early access for at least a year, and I made a point of not playing it til after it was officially released since my backlog is already ridiculous as is. (I think I got it on a steep discount or as part of a Humble Bundle.)\n\nIn my admittedly brief time with the game, I found a number of irritations:\n\n- Long (non adjustable?) delay after your squad members run out of action points before it switches to the next squad member. (Weirdly enough, you can adjust the enemy AI delay re: the length of time for their actions. It's a small quirk, but I knew if I played for awhile, nitpicks like this would drive me nuts.)\n- Needs easier access to contextual info. It would be nice if I could just hover the mouse cursor over a tile to get more information. I don't think left click to focus does the trick, but I honestly can't remember.\n- Enemies telegraph their location during their phase. (I was playing on Easy to try to learn the mechanics / interface, so I'm not sure if this applies to higher difficulties.)\n\nI found myself wishing it had a user interface closer to something like Dungeons of Dredmor, which had excellent visual feedback and mouse support. Maybe the devs have to work around limitations of the Torque engine that they used to develop Steam Marines. Either way, there are better roguelikes to spend your time and money on.\n\nThere may be a fantastic game in here somewhere, but I doubt I'll put more than a couple hours into it out of morbid curiousity. Maybe I'm a masochist, but I find it interesting to see how badly a UI / mechanic can be implemented, which makes me appreciate all those little things I usually take for granted in other better games!\n\nAs it stands, I can't recommend it at anywhere near full price. The regular price on Steam is absurd, as I wouldn't pay more than $3 - 5 max and can't see it being worth more than a tenner if it ever gets proper UI updates. :(","April 2, 2015","false","0.5"," 53 of 73 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","53","73","3","4"

It's 100x better, and cheaper too.\n\nI bought this game when it was discounted heavily at the Humble Bundle Store. It had been very high (top 20ish or so) in my wish list because a adore the rogue-like genre. Although I had been very excited to try it, I was very disappointed with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you like turn-based strategy games, rogue-likes, and the space theme, then you might enjoy this game. Honestly though, you should play Bionic Dues instead, a much more fleshed-out and well-done game. Here is my review for that game if you wanted some more info about it.\n\nThe aesthetics are okay - the amount of detail in the characters and background is decent. The sounds and music are also decent, however, I quickly muted the music in favor of my own.\n\nThe controls are easy to learn, however, the hotkeys (vs. clicking on each action) may take a bit if you are not used to using them - they are fairly intuitive (R to reload) though. There is a tutorial when you begin that teaches you everything you need to know. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with turn-based strategy games, and the lack of complex mechanics keeps the difficulty pretty reasonable (contrary to what I would expect from a rogue-like). Playing the different difficulty levels, however, seem to be scaled strangely - if you move from easy to normal you will find a large spike in how challenging the enemies are.\n\nGameplay consists of you moving 4 squadmembers through a randomly-generated ship floor - your goal is always to find an elevator to the next level. Before you begin, you can select different classes (engineer, sniper/scout, leader, etc) and a single perk (ex: splash damage, extra experience gain per enemy spotted) to better match your playstyle. Your characters can level up and select new skills and abilities, however, the pool is extremely small and lacks variety. I did not like this levelling mechanic because it meant that trying out the other difficulties had less incentive - maybe if there was an increased ability/skill pool or level cap for doing a higher difficulty it would justify playing new game +.\n\nCombat and movement occurs on a grid-based system. Each character has a set number of action points (AP) each turn - you can use items in your inventory to refill some AP. Orientation is also important (and costs AP) - you don't want your character facing away from a door or chokepoint. Line-of-sight plays a big role in this game, meaning that enemies can sneak up on you if you are not covering all areas with your team (an enemy unit can be right behind you and not appear on your screen until you turn around). Shooting your weapon costs both AP and ammo, and reloading will take a large amount of AP - so a good tactic is to always have at least one squadmember able to fire (similar to overwatch mode in games like XCOM). You can have your members "wait," allowing them to fire during the enemy's combat/movement turn. This is crucial because your members are very fragile, and leaving them open to enemy attack can easily result in their quick deaths. The lack of depth makes combat fairly boring, as you will mostly be moving your characters, using items, and attacking - compared to other similar titles (Bionic Dues) that have different types of attacks and usable abilities.\n\nEnemies will execute their turn after you finish yours, spawning and moving throughout the ship. There will usually be slight indications (noise, a small flash/effect) of general areas where you can expect enemies to be. You can spend AP to destroy walls, allowing you to take unorthodox routes and take advantage of line-of-site (you can often safely scout a room by destroying a wall rather than going through the door). If you break open a ship wall to space, you can also push enemies to their death. There is a small variety of enemies, making combat predictable if you play enough and understand each unit's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAs you play, there are a large number of objects you can interact with - doors, crates, switches, etc. Each object may give you a random item, experience, etc. Items are kept in your inventory and shared by all squadmembers - which is good if you want someone to use a "restore x AP to all squadmembers," but only have 1 person with actions left. Once you exit the commander deck area (several levels), you can freely choose different areas of the ship to tackle (ex: armory).\n\nOverall, the game plays decently enough, however, there are better alternatives (again, Bionic Dues) that I sincerely think you are better off trying those instead. The gameplay feels far too one-dimensional for a turn-based rogue-like title. Even after only a couple of playthroughs, you will probably be bored of the repetition (even if you are trying to go to different parts of the ship after the commander deck) - the lack of item/character/enemy variety further impairs replayability. It is probably easier to try Steam Marines before any of the more complex alternatives, however, I would still not recommend this unless you were dying to try it. I try not to mention price if I think it is unnecessary, but I would wait until this game is heavily discounted before picking it up - at a retail price of $16.99 I don't feel it is worth it.\n\nDo not recommend.\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","May 16, 2015","false","4.2"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","44","59","2","3"

Open a door; set up the rest of the squad to guard behind. Look around the room; set up the rest of the squad to guard. If there are enemies, kite backwards while setting the rest of the squad to guard and maybe get some pot shots in. Failure to do any of these things risks the chance of some ranged bot popping out the shadows and taking a marine from full health to dead/near dead in a single turn. You have a rough idea of where enemies are from hearing their footsteps, but you have no idea how the rooms and doors are connected until you actually pop your head in and turn about.\n\nThe marine health/enemy damage ratio is so very low, so there is no room for error. Trying to run and gun, or even advance to a forward position and burst an enemy down, will get you killed very fast.\n\nThis demanded precision is frustrated by the control scheme: every  of the many actions has a mapped key, with NO context sensitivity. While I'm used to games like this, the learning curve is still a little steep, and the memorization will be a turn-off for many people. This frustration is compounded by the fact that there is no undo, even for benign actions with no impact on the immediate turn, such as guarding. Did you just hit the wrong key at a critical turn and accidentally fire at nothing, or guard into a wall, or use an item you didn’t intend to, etc.? All your hours and effort is wasted now, your run is over.\n\nIf a repetitive, boring, and cautious slog through a hardcore dungeon where small mistakes will waste hours of work sounds exciting to you, this game is for you. Again, I’m sure there are some people who will enjoy such a neurotic challenge, but this experience is not for most.\n","March 30, 2014","false","5.7"," 70 of 107 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","70","107","0","3"

I was able to overcome some of the bugginess with this.\n-Difficulty: As you learn how things work and how you kill different enemies, things get easier so that you actually survive. Meaning, that you propably wont be playing the game through with first attempt, thus providing some challenge.\n\nBAD\n-It has terrible graphics: sometimes I'm not sure what I'm looking at, while occasionally I have difficulties with reading the text. Sometimes its very hard to say whether a piece of wall is bashed or if it's semi-destroyed. In some maps, the wall tiles are so dark that I have to look the screen from different angle (benefits of flat screen) to be able to actually differ them from background or unexplored tiles. Some enemies can't be recognized from each others, until they blow on your face.\n-Moving around often bugs like hell: unit graphic may stay behind from actual position during moving, sometimes the whole movement is ignored. I have had two marines standing in a same tile more than once. Luckily this mainly plagues PCs, it could easily make the game unplayable if this would affect NPCs as well.\n-Shop pricing skyrockets like stockmarket-bubble.\n-Item prices increases every time you enter a shop.\n-Shop offers four items, chosen randomly. Combined with above, trying to buy a med-kit can become very, very expensive.\n-You can't sell items.\n-Using mouse over the battlefield is buggy, and supposed benefits are often broken. Not to forget that sometimes moving the mouse on the map area causes heavy lagging and shooting CPU-load to roof.\n-Occasionally "targeting indicator" does not appear as supposed to, you have to rotate the character or switch between characters for it to show.\n-Game is balanced in a wrong way: You must make sure that you wont be shot at all, because enemies will tear apart your marines too easily, even on easy-difficulty. This means that you must use lure-tactics constantly, and even a single mistake may result to complete failure.","January 1","true","17.6"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

Your team and their enemies cannot target each other diagonally, making combat easy to plan and to execute. However, a single miscalculation from one character might end up costing the whole teams life. Learning from such mistakes, by dying, is part of the charm, as in other roguelikes.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone that enjoys fighting robot-aliens in space with simple tactics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/253630/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","This is a very hesitant recommendation. Steam Marines is a turn-based roguelike that tries to stand out by having the player control a squad of 4 characters (of different classes), instead of a single one.\nIt's also extremely difficult -- far too much so, to the point of imbalance.\n\nI haven't played many turn based games, so my perception of the difficulty might be distorted. However, I will say that the gap between Easy and Normal mode is huge -- especially considering that there are also Hard and Brutal difficulties.\n\nThe game is pretty standard in its mechanics -- each character has action points that they use to move and attack, there's ammo and reloading, and position is crucial. The enemies follow the same rules, some with little quirks that make the game more interesting.\n\nIt's... solid. I enjoyed my Easy playthrough... somewhat. I'll get into it later.\n\nThe game has several issues that make it just an "okay" game, for me. Still, okay is fine, in this case. I do think the mechanics work well together, and a full playthrough is enjoyable. But that's about as far as I go, as someone who quit on Normal Mode.\n\nIt's hard to review exactly how I see the imbalance in the game, since it's heavy on numbers. Let's just say that enemies on Easy kill you in perhaps 2 hits, and only have 2 Action points per turn. They also have 6 HP. On Normal mode, they have 4 Action points, 12 HP and kill you in 1 hit. The actions points, especially, make a huge difference, as you need to be really far away from them to be safe. Plus the necessary reloading (that takes ALL of your action points), small rooms, and several enemies at once, make Normal mode infuriating. It's too easy to lose a character on the very first level. And there are 30 or 35 of them!\n\nOn Easy Mode, however, it's still hard to get through the first set of levels. When you reach the 6th level (second area), you have access to these Hulk suits that are incredibly overpowered, in comparison with the normal characters. After that, you can play through the game rather easily. Which is a huge problem, for me. The first set of levels being by far, the hardest. It's just a big wall that keeps most players away.\nOn my easy playthrough, I actually quit out of boredom. I understood the mechanics and quirks of the enemies, so the game got pretty formulaic. When you beat the game, you go into NG+. I beat that as well. When I started NG+2 I quit. It was simply not fun, anymore. I knew what I need to do everytime, it wasn't fun.\n\nAt that point, I tried Normal. I didn't get past the first set of levels... again. I could do it, but not without losing a character. There's an incredibly big difference between the two difficulties. It's just not fun, for me.\n\nThen, there are other issues about its "rogue-like" label. It's always the same thing, essentially.\n\nCharacter have 4 levels, with each one having a choice between 2 skills - a passive, and an active one. Always the same 2 for the given level and class. There's virtually no point in experimentation.\nSome of the classes are also virtually useless, so your party won't vary too much.\n\nThen, the worst of it, is that there are almost no equipment and weapons to find. Even when you do, it's purely numerical and provide absolutely no interesting choices. It's just a question of "this does more or less damage, accuracy, etc. etc.". If you take something like The Binding of Isaac, there are tons of interactions between the items, some of them drastically changing the game. In Steam Marines, there's none of that.\n\nIt also lacks a purpose, having a very monotonous pacing. There are 5 or 6 "zones", each with 5 levels. You find an elevator to proceed to the next level. Every 5th level, there's a Boss in the elevator.\nIt's always the same. Story is virtually non-existant, and the Bosses aren't very interesting, either.\nTake FTL, for example, and there's a very clear threat and purpose in the Mothership fight. The whole game is a build-up to that moment. In this game, there's nothing resembling that. Especially with NG+, you can just keep going, without any sense of progress.\n\nIt's also far too long for each run. Even on Easy mode, is may have taken me 6 hours or something.\n\n\nThis is apparently a very, very negative review, despite the recommendation. Well, I really had big issues, especially being unable to progress on Normal mode. Maybe it's just not for me. But I still recognize some merit to its mechanics are the general idea. Perhaps it can appeal to veterans of Turn-Based games. For me, it seems imbalanced, lacking a good difficulty curve as well as pacing a variation.","August 21, 2015","true","18.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","1"

The core of the game is about managing a team of 4 Marines are you move through a procedurally generated ship, combating a variety of enemies in turn based combat.  You clear the ship room by room, exercising the best tactics you can to conserve life and ammo so you can make it to the next floor.  There's an AP system in place, so on your turn, you move your squad around as far as your AP will let you, and then it's the enemy's turn, exhausting their AP, etc. so positioning and attention to detail is required to make sure you don't leave a Marine stranded in a bad position\n\nI've never strayed past normal difficulty, but even there the game can be pretty unforgiving.  Death is permanent, and often swift.  Ammo is limited and so is inventory space, so you really need to scrounge carefully and decide on what to pack when you move between decks.  I've had games that were rougher than others, but never once did I feel as if the RNG was the sole thing that screwed me over- in most of my games, there was something better I could've done to avoid calamity.\n\nDespite being an early access title, I wholly recommend Steam Marines.

The music, sparse in-game writing and the included bonus stories help in establishing it, and the constant feeling of all odds being against you fits very well with the premise of facing an unstoppable menace on a doomed spaceship (think Space Hulk Death Angel, or the Alien or Predator movies).\n\nAt first I wasn't too interested because I thought the game was all about the "steampunk" fad (I was wrong), but gave it a second chance after hearing recommendations for it on Roguelike Radio. After playing a little I almost gave up on the game because the user interface is somewhat unpolished and sometimes confusing, and I couldn't find complete documentation (official or fanmade) but after sticking with the game for a while you'll discover the quirks of the controls and rules of the game.

Nice pixel-art style graphics and a well chosen score set the mood for this broody journey through a space ship taken over by killer robots! If you are looking for story it seems that's all you're getting, but the gameplay is so engrossing you'll forget that pretty quickly! Add in the fact that once your squad members die they're really gone for good and a wiped out squad means game over and it's really easy to get pulled into this game. Fiendish difficulty and a steep learning curve help to keep you forever on your toes whilst playing.\n\nAs far as the early access goes it seems to be a fully functional game, with a lot of room for expansion. For example there are currently 4 possible squad member classes (that cover quite a range of skills), maybe half a dozen item drops (but the varied effects show that there could be many more yet to come), and from what I've seen a small selection of enemies with pretty basic AI. That said I think this Alpha will probably entertain me for at least a couple more hours (especially if the difficulty keeps ramping up as it has been). I imagine the beta and full release will have many hours of gameplay due to the procedurally generated levels and possible squad configurations and tactics.\n\nMy only gripe so far is with the control scheme and UI which sometimes make it difficult to work out exactly where you're at (which squad member you're controlling, ammo, etc) and makes it all to easy to make costly mistakes. It would be nice to see some refinement in this over the next few builds as it slows you down in a game that is already requiring a lot of thought before each move.\n\nI would definitely recommend, especially at it's current low price, currently very good, only going to get better :)","December 28, 2013","true","2.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The tactical and random properties to the game are great with many fun features such as finding items, gearing and skilling up your team members - add perma death (wouldn't be rogue-like without it) to the mix and you know you have to think two and three times about your next step.\nI felt the game eased you into the difficulty nicely, challenged you and punished you fairly for silly mistakes.

This is an amazing game, who will provide you with countless hours of fun, as long as you are ready for facing the complete unknown. The first thing to remember about this game is that you have to remember that a lot of it being fun is due to its "old style", "retro style", game, so don't expect things to come as easily as they come in modern games, where you can control everything just using your mouse ... this game requires you to really understand it and learn how to play it, and that means that the first times that you play you are probably going to loose, a lot! So, be ready to die, die, and die, as many times as it takes until you understand the gameplay. If the game doesn't look appealing in your first try, consider playing a few more times, since the easiness of dying can make you feel kinda blue when u are beginning. One of the key aspects of the game is memorizing what each class of soldier can do (leader, grenadier, etc.) and understand how to use them ... for instance, if you are not careful the grenadier will most likely get your other soldiers in a friendly fire ... also, you need to pay a lot of attention to how many moving points each soldier has, since a single mistake usually means death. What is fun about this game is that each scenario is completely random, so each start is almost like a fresh new start ... details, like paying attention to ammo, to doors that have bombs on them, or learning when is it worth to break down a wall to move to another room instead of using doors can mean the difference between life and death ... game rules as well must be well learned, since "simple" things like reloading means using all the action points available for that marine ... learning how to fire at enemies is also interesting, since you can only fire in straight lines (exception to the grenadier who can cause collateral damage around where his shells land), so it is almost like playing chess only with pawns and towers ... the guard mode can be pretty useful if you positioned your marine in the correct line of fire, or useless if he is looking to the left and the enemy is coming from the right ... and no, although in guarding mode, he won't turn and shoot the enemy ... in essence, I think this is a game where you spend the first hour learning "how to play" and counting how many times you already died ... however, after understanding the gameplay, it is fun, definitely! Due the random nature of the game you can find yourself suddenly surrounded by enemies or just exploring room after room and getting credits and more ammo ... what is going to happen? Nobody knows, each game is unique, and they are worth a shot ... however, if you are expecting an easy to play game, this is not a good idea ... it takes  time, strategy, memory and the ability to cope with defeat ... just like in real life!","July 12, 2014","true","3.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Great for bosses...\n- Sometimes I cannot level up marines right away, but only in the next round\n- XoX - Every 3rd-4th time, when using an hour glass or stim, I cannot use the AP for attacking anymore (moving still works at least). Tactics? Bad luck.\n- XoX - Sometimes I run "into" an enemy instead of making a melee attack -> Marine gets stuck "in" the enemy. Now you can't shot/hurt it with other marines, nor can the stuck marine get out until he killed the monster with (now working only for him) melee attacks. Which, in most cases, ends up in the marine dying.\n\nEspecially the last two ones are really game breakers, as the game is hellish hard at times and, surprise, its perma death.\n\nI know this is a game where you die a lot - but if I die due to a technical bug and not my stupidity, that really kills all fun for me (and, come on, this game is not a code-complexity monster!).\nWhich is why I cannot recomment it as it is.","November 2, 2015","false","8.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

This game has not technically been "released" yet. You are paying to playtest and report bugs/problems. In return, you get a copy of the game when it's released. I have given this game a thumbs up because I think it has potential, not because I think you should buy it. If you don't want to playtest a game in development, DON'T BUY THIS GAME.\n\nAs I said, I think this game has potential But right now, the word is "simplistic." And in this context, that's a bad word.\n\nThe gist is, you get a squad of four space marines of various classes, and you fight through several decks of a derelict space ship. Every turn, each marine gets a certain number of action points. Moving one square costs one action point, shooting costs one action point, turning 90 degrees costs one action point, reloading your weapon costs all your remaining action points.\n\nThat gets very frustrating, very quickly, but I could live with it. what I CAN'T live with is the aiming mechanic. You can only fire at an enemy that is DIRECTLY in front of you. So if the enemy is four squares north and one square west, your first shot is going to cost three points (move one west, turn north, fire). Not only does that make the game difficult, but it also makes it very frustrating.\n\nThat on top of the fact that realoading your weapon ends that marine's turn makes this game (for me) essentially unplayable in its current form. There are a lot of nifty ideas in this game, but for now that is preventing me from enjoying it.\n\nBut take heart! This is a pre-release game, so it will be getting better. I can't say for sure that the things I don't like will get fixed, but I am optimistic that Steam Marines will be a fine game some day.\n\nEDIT:\nJust started playing this game again, and I'm enjoying it thoroughly. Reading my review above, I can't say that any of that has changed (though unchecking the option for "facing costs AP" was a big relief), but it seems that it matters less. Another problem that I had before was that it was hard to see. Once a marine looked away from a wall (for example), I seem to recall that there was no placeholder graphic to remind you "hey! There was a wall here!" Now walls don't disappear when you're not looking at them. I could be remembering wrong, but if that was a problem before it no longer is.\n\nThis is now a game that I will whole-heartedly recommend.","December 28, 2013","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

At first it can seem overly simplistic and somewhat uninspired. In reality this is the difficulty of the game trying to force the player to have some ambition, to get into the feel of a roguelike where you trying to fight your way out of a dire situation. For example, in the earlier stages of the game there is some confusion as to whether you should take out the enemy robots or just run for the nearest elevator with minimal losses but no gained experience. At first this seemed like a design flaw, but after multiple playthroughs I'm of the opinion that the designers want an authentic roguelike experience, they don't want a corridor roguelike where you're just blasing through enemies to get to the randomized item at the end of the level. Thus I appreciate the game so far and need to put more time into it (that is the goal of an good indie game right?).","September 8, 2014","true","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is a concept that is starting to stale out due to oversaturation in the marketplace. However there are still plenty of concepts that have yet to be done in rogue like fashion, one of which is Stratagy. That is where Steam Marines comes in, to accomplish with its turn based stratagy gameplay, while using rogue like elements to raise the steaks. The game revolves around a team of 4 marines, each with his or her own perk and class. The objective of the game is simple enough, just fight your way tooth and nail to the end of the level without suffering to severe casualties. All of the movement takes place on a grid layout where moving takes up one of your characters points, along with firing  your weapons, and reloading. It all sounds fine with great potentional for stratagy through where you position your troops carefully to take out the enemies in the most affective way possible; but thats where the game starts to show its cracks (granted its still early access and everything I say can be subject to change). You can never really see the enemies until its to late due to the fact that you must break down doors that almost always have enemies behind them (enemies you cannot see until the door is broken), so you can never really "stratagize" enough to execute a good plan, than the game just turns into find the person who has ammo and shoot. So the fruit of your labor from placing troops strategically is never really warded, since you can never guess which door/wall will lead to the enemies. With that out of the way I feel its time we talk about its rogue like features and if they need to be there at all, or better yet does the game benefit from being a rogue like? I personally feel it doesn't, I would have much prefered this style of gameplay with a story, maybe the death of your squad would have you replay that level, instead of just starting from the begining. You could argue that making it rogue like will add hours of replayability, but the amount of hours put into a rogue like versus the amount of things you accomplish is terrible. I'ts great if you have hours to play and master everything, but for me I would of enjoyed a simple 2-4hour linear story/scenario progression. All that being said its still early access and all my views may change as more features/polish come into the game. I will reccomend this on the basis that you understand that its early acess, if you are expecting everything to be perfect than stay away until full release.\n\nPro's:\nThe art style looks appealing.\nVery easy to pick up and play for a little while.\n\nCons:\nThe strategy gets tossed out the window very fast.\nControls feel clumsy.\n\n7/10. (This can and most likely will change as the game is still in early access.).","February 23, 2014","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game works on a turn-based system with action points that players of XCOM will be very familiar with.  Once you've exhausted the action points on each marine, your turn ends, and all nearby robots get to spend their own action points to move or attack.\n\nMarines can move, attack, activate consoles, pick up loot (and believe me, you'll need a lot of it to survive), guard certain fire zones, or even bash down walls to create new paths.  Destructible environments make this a very dynamic game where you're never safe from the impending march of the machines.  Robots WILL come bursting out of the nearest wall when you're least expecting them - ruining your most careful positioning.  And positioning does matter quite a lot, particularly with some enemy types that are shielded from the front, forcing you to split your forces and flank.  Randomly generated levels provides endless replayability to perfect and level up your squad.\n\nI could go on about this game, but for how cheap it is, and much more is yet to come (it's only in alpha and already a blast to play), this is a no-brainer.  For gaes like it, take a look at Bionic Dues, XCOM, or Space Hulk.","December 27, 2013","true","2.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This game feels like playing a full fledged game and while if you look closely you can spot the rough edges, it generally doesn't affect gameplay. Even better than that though is the fact that the developer is constantly active with the community working to fix any issues that crop up and discussing future implementations. As a personal example, I reported a minor bug that I noticed. He responded within 3 hours saying not only had he found the problem, but he also fixed it. If every early access developer put this kind of effort in, it wouldn't be nearly the crapshoot it currently is when buying early access games. If you want proof of developer involvement just look at the forums for this game, he is constantly posting.\n\nOn the play side of things, this is not a game that will appeal to everyone. You control a squad of four marines progressing through procedurally generated "decks" of a space ship. There are a lot of gameplay mechanics reminiscent of the XCOM series in that every unit has a limited number of "action points" to use for moving, attacking, healing, etc. Once you have used all of your points the computer takes its turn moving the enemies about in the same fashion. Each of your marines has a different class/weapons and it is up to you to use them in a way that utilizes their strengths. With the exception of a brief tutorial that introduces just enough of the mechanics to kill yourself, there is very little hand holding in this game. Let me be clear though, there is a big difference between accessible and dumbed down. This game is most certainly accessible and honestly, pretty intuitive; it is not at all dumbed down. It will not stop you from accidentally throwing a grenade right next to a teammate, wandering around dying because you went the wrong way, or even wasting your points on accidental actions. This game will never ask you "are sure you want to (insert random action here)".\n\nIf this sounds boring in any way let me disabuse you of that right now. This game is incredibly intense in a on-the-edge-of-your-seat way. If you ever start to feel relaxed, it's probably because you are staring at the menu screen after getting your face melted by a robot. Turn based means you get as much time as you want to choose how to lead your marines to their death, it also means you have to sit and watch as the AI exploits your mistakes to bring said death about even faster. As you progress through the game your marines will earn experience that translates into more perks and better stats. You will find yourself becoming more attached to your marines the longer you survive, making it that much worse when they suffer perma-death. The reluctance to enter a new room or turn a corner is heightened by the fact that the game has only one save file that is constantly updated so there are no second chances. You can find survivors along the way but they will be lowly privates with none of the awesomeness of your fallen soldier. Unlike some procedurally generated games there is a definite (and achievable) end goal which is perfect for people like me who need something to work towards besides a general "do good...".\n\nIf any of this has sounded interesting I would recommend getting this game. Whether or not it is worth the list price is something you will have to decide for yourself, for me it was. If nothing else, watch for the game to go on sale or try to win one of the free keys the developer offers on his site   www.steammarines.com [www.steammarines.com]. Personally, I can't wait to see what this games becomes as it is developed further and until then I will continue to enjoy the current iteration.","September 3, 2014","true","30.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's a very unforgiving squad based dungeon crawler. The robots on the ship want you dead, and they are very good at it. You need to recognize each type of enemy and learn to deal with them. You can, with some luck, find equipment to help you out. But first and foremost, you need to keep your squad healthy. Learn how the enemies move, learn how to cut paths through the ship, and make sure to cover the entrances to the rooms you're in. It is a very bleak game. You're not gonna find health packs all over to heal your squad, but at the same time you are invested in them. There's multiple classes, each good for different roles, and together they mesh to make it survivable. Losing a squad member hurts, and you will be fighting to save a squadie if he gets cut off from the rest. I do wish that firing was more free line of sight, ala space hulk, but it's all tile based, which offers a different strategic element, though I find it works pretty well with the constricting corridors you often find yourself in. Playing the tutorial is a must. There's not a lot of clicking to be done, as most controls are done with the keyboard, and if you don't play the tutorial, you will not know what keys to use. I almost wish they had just completely removed the mouse from the controls. I think it just confuses people more than anything. Graphically, it's retro. My only real gripe is that I wish there were death animations and corpses left from your squad members instead of them just dissapearing. If you like roguelikes and you like tactical gameplay, and you don't mind (prefferably like) the retro presentation, it's a pretty fun game. I feel like there should be more depth to it, more classes offering more weaponry, etc, but it is what it is, and what it is is a pretty solid, cuthroat scifi roguelike with squad management. Just don't give up after you get murdered the first couple times.","December 4, 2014","true","7.0"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Controls seem on occasion buggy can be a minor nuisance. Prices in shops fluctuate drastically it seems a little too random.

It’s hard yes but to the point sometimes the enemies are harder than you and your facing more of them. Too random, some levels you breeze through no problems other times your get creamed by strange map design, and overpowered NPCs.\n\nTry Halfway it’s very similar but seems to have dropped the complete randomness for a better storyline and a much more enjoyable play. I would easily change this review if the above were fixed or the price was slightly less (worth it on sale).","January 10","false","4.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Normally I like experimenting with new & different things, but I wasn't a fan of how things were handled in this game.\n\nThe movement system is strange where you use directional arrows to move characters around instead of pointing and clicking. If you press into a wall, that actually takes an action point.  This is because you can break through pretty much any wall.  Changing your facing consumed an action point, which I consider an unforgivable flaw.  This is something I'm used to being "free" in all other TRPGs.\n\nThere is no story at all.  There's nothing between each level.  It just jumps into the next level as soon as you finish one.  The goal in every level is to reach the elevator.  You don't have to kill all enemies.  The enemies are unbalanced.  I played at the easiest difficulty and I encountered several enemies that I couldn't cause ANY damage on.  That includes blasting it with my "heavy" and nearly killing himself with the splash damage.\n\nIt felt like a random demo that someone made to show off their gameplay system.

That's very rare for Roguelike games because it requires control multiple characters. But a mix of design elements makes it work very well. It's very surprising how light the play is despite you control 4 characters. Also the team aspect gives it a lot of originality and helps reinforce the depth.\n\nAnother noteworthy element is how the game evokes Spacehulk/Alien, that's great.\n\nAbout Steampunk, look yourself the snapshots, it's very light, so don't really search that in the game.\n\nAbout about random range and diversity, it's here, enough to make a play enough different to another, and to keep the surprise which is an important element of the gameplay. But if my experience of Early Access is still valid, and additions hadn't changed it deeply, then the range of variations isn't huge like some of the biggest Roguelike. It's solid random and fair range of diversity of random, but don't expect much more. It's still enough to makes it a true Roguelike.\n\nOverall its key words are, very fun Roguelike, light play, good depth, team, Spacehulk/Alien.","September 24, 2014","true","41.0"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

You control a squad of four marines trapped on board a spaceship full of human killing robots all wanting to rip your squishy human squad into teeny tiny pieces.  The game is rouge like so each time you play the ship, enemy and loot layout is slightly different meaning nothing is predicable.\n\nWhen you start the game you select classes and perks for each of your four marines, I higher recommend not taking duplicate classes and some loot is class specific.  The leader & scout class are a must.  Marines have an allotted amount of action points which are depleted by one everytime a marine moves, fights, shoots, open doors, use items etc...  Fight your way to the elevator on each floor and take on the boss mob in order to advance.\n\nEasy mode is great to gets to grip with the game but the true mature of this game is best played on normal mode.  Easy mode is too easy, marines have lots of action points, enemies have lowered health and action points.  Not much of a challenge.\n\nNormal mode is good but is ridiculously difficult.  Ideally this needs nerfing slightly and for that reason I rate this game 6.5/10.  If normal mode was adjusted slightly to make it passably hard as appose to impossible I would rate this 8/10.","December 22, 2014","true","6.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Myself, after dying five times on the level 2 (talk about learning curve) of average difficulty, I switched to easy and then was really bored most of the way;\n- Monster types are limited, they're stupid, and when they manage to damage your characters it's because of something which would seem more like a game bug then legitimate gameplay;\n- Leveling up is weird, it's like you're getting XP for discovering monsters, not killing them. And when you character reaches final level, you can reset his feats and start training in other class.\n\nOther then that, game is fine, crushing walls in robot suit is fun :)","February 6, 2015","false","17.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I enjoyed it a lot, despite the fact that I've only made it past the first section once.\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4_ibJzI9F0\n\nWhat is it?\n\nSteam Marines is a rouge-like turn based strategy game. It's gameplay most closely resembles the old Space Hulk board game (also the more recent games of the same name). Every time you start you get to choose four soldiers, each of which has a class and a perk. You then enter a randomly generated space ship that is infested with evil robots. Your goal is to fight your way to the elevator and get to the next floor.\n\nThere are five different decks of the ship that you have to go through. Each of these decks is divided into five levels with a boss on the final level. You always start on one deck, but you then get to choose where you go after you complete it. Each deck has its own asthetic and set of enemies that goes with it.\n\nThroughout the game, your soldiers will level up, thereby gaining skills and abilities, as well as get new equipment. This adds good depth to the later game (and probably stops you from being completely curb-stomped).\n\nI thought I might also note that if you have a less then four soldiers in your squad at the end of a floor you have a chance of getting a new soldier. You don't get to choose the class or perk, but this can at least give you a fighting chance if things don't go too well.\n\nPros:\n\n-The game has a good variety of classes. In saying this, I mean that each class has a distinct role in the squad because of their specific weapon.\n\n-The enemies feel equal to your soldiers. In my opinion, a squad turn based strategy needs enemies that are on a similar level to your soldiers. Without that, it would either be so easy that you don't have to think tactically, or far too hard. Steam Marines strikes a nice balance.\n\n-There are distinct enemies. Through my journey I've seen enemies that are pure melee, pure range, ones that lose AP as you hit them, and ones that can't be damages from cenrtain sides. Each of these enemies needs to be dealt with using different tactics, which adds a good depth to the game.\n\n-Each deck has a difficulty rating. You might think that this doesn't mean that much, of course they do that just makes sense. You're right, it does make sense, but the permadeath makes that addition all the more important. You will know which deck is least likely to kill you and thereby least likely to lose you all of your hard work.\n\nCons:\n\n-The random generation sometimes causes problems. It is possible to enter a level on that levels elevator. One would think that that would be a good thing, but there is a problem. The boss on the final level spawns on the elevator. The first time I made it to level five I spawned on the elevator, directly next to the boss. This is an almost guaranteed loss.\n\n-This con is not necessarily bad for everyone, but it still needs to be noted. The game is VERY difficult. I've played nine hours of the game and I only made it past the first deck once.\n\n-The system for executing the enemy turns is flawed. Firstly, on default settings the enemy turn will last an ungodly length of time. This can be easily fixed in the settings, but there is a bigger issue. The game has a setting that, in essence, focuses on the screen as the enemies move. It will do this not only for ones that you can see, but also enemies that you can't see around you. This gives you advanced warning of where enemies are. Turning this off means that it will NEVER follow enemy movements. Your screen is also locked in place while the enemy moves. I hope you kept all of squad together, or you won't get to watch the action. (Man, that was long winded)\n\nThe game has some flaws, but overall I enjoyed it a lot. If you have played Dark Souls (and are hardnened to the idea of constant death) and enjoy squad turn-based strategy games then this game will hit the mark. It's a lot of deadly fun for $15.","March 13, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

For the first couple minutes of gameplay my marines walked around punching walls until they broke apart. At least thats what I had guessed was happening as it was difficult to make out exactly what was going on just from watching the awful color palettes of blurry mosaic squares moving to amateur 8-bit sound effects. I finally found an enemy and spent a minute trying to figure out how to attack it before quitting out of the game. I'm reluctant to beta test even AAA products so maybe this sort of thing isn't for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mzizzle93/recommended/253630/","mzizzle93","Gishidanti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mzizzle93/","118 products in account","Bottom Line: A contrived attemp at a turn-based rogue-like squad combat sci-fi RPG that has a painfully slow start and so many key bindings that you may need to actually forget some general knowledge to make room in your brain for them (Oh and the tutorial basically only tells you how to move and shoot). I do not recommend this game to individuals with short attention spans (you know who you are) as you will likely not get past the tutorial. I also don't recommend the game to people in search of another good Rogue-like (the reason I bought it...), this game is not it.\n\n\nThe Long of it (4 paragraphs):\nI'm gonna be honest, I tried to get into this game. Really and truly. After roughly five separate attempts over the past year I finally gave up. I know I only have a little less than an hour of play time on it, and truthfully I didn't get far past the tutorial on any of my attempted plays; but what I saw from the time I spent on the game I could tell the game had a serious flaw: even after the tutorial, there is a strong chance you still won't be able to play the game effectively. Now, I don't mind teaching myself how to play a game, but as far as I'm concerned any rogue-like game that I can't get comfortable playing within the first 15 minutes should reconsider its place in the genre.\n\nExpanding on the utter lack of a real tutorial: The tutorial informs you of critical game mechanics...... that's it. At the start of the game you learn how to move, shoot, reload, and open doors/chests. It completely glosses over the 40+ controls/key bindings as well as basically neglecting to explain most of the UI, which is, by the way, and utter trainwreck.\n\nLooking past the lack of initial information, the level design is not well though out. At all. Most rooms are too small to have more than two of your squad comfortably occupy (since they are likely also completely filled with enemies). Sometimes you will start on a level in a room filled with enemies, sometimes the room doesn't have an exit, sometimes filled with enemies and also no exit. The 'rogue-likeness' of this game is sloppy at best and provides a purely annoying game environment, as opposed to that fresh feeling you get from ideally executed rogue-likes. It almost seems like the devs wanted to make a game that spanned as many genres as possible so they put in a crappy random number generator and called it a rogue-like.\n\nSuffice to say, this game is like Indian food, it tries very hard to be a lot of things, and looks enticing, but often leaves a bad taste in your mouth. After you play what you thought was supposed to be a turn-based squad combat, rogue-like sci-fi RPG, you realize that there is just too much going on and you were silly to think it would deliver everything you thought it would.","January 20","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But more importantly, it just isn't very fun to play. Nothing feels "cool" or exciting except a few bosses that do manage to stand out. Gameplay works but just feels kinda uninspired. The later decks introduce better enemies and the pace picks up a bit, sadly most of my time was spend running around all too similar layouts and combat situations.\n\nIt's not a bad game, so you won't regret a purchase, it just isn't very good. Compared to Bionic Dues it manages to bungle the UI in a different way and it's overall simpler to get going, but there's no strategic mode other than advancing through 5-level sets.\n\nThe worst fault of the game is probably that i never felt invested in my squad or cared about the characters. Despite some random banter and unique abilities and upgrade paths, there wasn't any connection.\n\nAlso, for a game that's fairly straightforward and easy to get into, somehow the pacing felt very very slow. Even with AI movement sped up, it takes too long to finish a level and it doesn't feel rewarding.\n\nThe pixel art doesn't work for this game. Some assets look nice and clear, while others look downright ugly.\n\nSteam Marines is not a bad game, and it's not even dissapointing. I can't bash the developers because very little here actually stinks. Unfortunately nothing is above average either making me wonder how i spent around 7 hrs playing it.","August 18, 2015","false","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does have some issues. The random level generation is desperate, creating rooms with too many doors almost as often as it creates rooms with no doors at all. Enemy placement is similarly unpredictable, and yet the AI is predictable. This is a flawed game, but enjoyable, and if the challenge isn't always fair, well, at least it is there.","January 30","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mzizzle93/recommended/253630/","mzizzle93","Gishidanti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mzizzle93/","118 products in account","Bottom Line: A contrived attemp at a turn-based rogue-like squad combat sci-fi RPG that has a painfully slow start and so many key bindings that you may need to actually forget some general knowledge to make room in your brain for them (Oh and the tutorial basically only tells you how to move and shoot). I do not recommend this game to individuals with short attention spans (you know who you are) as you will likely not get past the tutorial. I also don't recommend the game to people in search of another good Rogue-like (the reason I bought it...), this game is not it.\n\n\nThe Long of it (4 paragraphs):\nI'm gonna be honest, I tried to get into this game. Really and truly. After roughly five separate attempts over the past year I finally gave up. I know I only have a little less than an hour of play time on it, and truthfully I didn't get far past the tutorial on any of my attempted plays; but what I saw from the time I spent on the game I could tell the game had a serious flaw: even after the tutorial, there is a strong chance you still won't be able to play the game effectively. Now, I don't mind teaching myself how to play a game, but as far as I'm concerned any rogue-like game that I can't get comfortable playing within the first 15 minutes should reconsider its place in the genre.\n\nExpanding on the utter lack of a real tutorial: The tutorial informs you of critical game mechanics...... that's it. At the start of the game you learn how to move, shoot, reload, and open doors/chests. It completely glosses over the 40+ controls/key bindings as well as basically neglecting to explain most of the UI, which is, by the way, and utter trainwreck.\n\nLooking past the lack of initial information, the level design is not well though out. At all. Most rooms are too small to have more than two of your squad comfortably occupy (since they are likely also completely filled with enemies). Sometimes you will start on a level in a room filled with enemies, sometimes the room doesn't have an exit, sometimes filled with enemies and also no exit. The 'rogue-likeness' of this game is sloppy at best and provides a purely annoying game environment, as opposed to that fresh feeling you get from ideally executed rogue-likes. It almost seems like the devs wanted to make a game that spanned as many genres as possible so they put in a crappy random number generator and called it a rogue-like.\n\nSuffice to say, this game is like Indian food, it tries very hard to be a lot of things, and looks enticing, but often leaves a bad taste in your mouth. After you play what you thought was supposed to be a turn-based squad combat, rogue-like sci-fi RPG, you realize that there is just too much going on and you were silly to think it would deliver everything you thought it would.","January 20","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
