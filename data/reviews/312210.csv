Same three bots since the begining, looting system is currently a chore to pick up anything that's inside a box/bag, game lags on lowest settings possible, in the dark sections of the game it's basically pitch black even on the highest brightness settings.\n\nThe Robots:\n\nThe Hunter is broken, always has been. In the begining it one shot you and could detect and walk through walls. One year later the only change is now it takes two shots to kill you. With how the damage system works the more damage you take the less mobility you have. One shot takes you from 100% down to 18% essentially crippling you. Leaving you to wait to die or take an hour to find a repair station to fix the damages. Personally I liked it better when they insta-killed me instead of me stuck there waiting to put the second bullet in me.\n\nThe Kamikaze bots are stupidly easy to deal with. They walk slowly, stand in place to explode, and take five seconds to explode. Making it insanely easy to just walk up to them to activate their self destruct and then casually walk away.\n\nThe Hives I don't know if they've been changed or not because I kept getting shot down by Hunters before I could get anywhere near one of their nests. They're insanely hard to shoot down and hack considering their high mobility.\n\nOverall they can detect you before you even know they're there and you end up just getting gunned down.\n\nLoot System/Items:\n\nThe loot system is rudimentary at best. picking up individual loose items is a breeze but picking up items in boxes or bags is time consuming and grating to grab items out of. Oh by the way the ammo comes in a box that you have to open first then take the ammo out of adding a needless step to looting. When grabbing items from a box/bag you have to click it then select the item then take an amount of said item. There is no double click to grab the whole stack or singular item. Items now no longer come in completed products. You now have to go out and find the seperate parts to craft said tools to do anything.\n\nWeapons:\n\nMelee weapons are a joke in single player. Good luck getting close enough to whack a Hunter to death, the Hive Drones are out of the question, and "Why would you even?" with the Kamikaze bots. Guns now need to be built which is the only way to effectivly defend yourself against the Hunters and Hive Drones. So have fun hunting down every single part. Also you can't break down items into their base components or continue to craft on an incomplete item. Making anything you've finished crafting with only the parts you had effectivly useless.\n\nHacking:\n\nHacking is overcomplicated, if you don't know coding before hand you're going to be referring to a guide before you memorize the basic commands (if you can even stomach playing that long).\n\nPower/Mobility System:\n\nI like the power system in this game, you need capacitors to store charged up power and you need reactors/solar panels to generate power. The more weight you carry the more energy you consume. If you run out of power you have to slowly waddle around or stand around a bit to generate some more power (unfortunatly you're not going to be able to stand around much). The jumping system sucks, let's just sit here for two minutes while I charge up my jump to get over a two foot high ledge. Basically making jumping a chore and something to not bother with considering most of the map is flat anyway.\n\nOptimization:\n\nThis game is terribly optimized. It lags on the lowest settings possible. The brightness setting literally doesn't even matter for it does basically nothing for the pitch black sections of the game.\n\nAfter all of this my only advice is never buy this game or wait for another year to see if something significant has been done. After a almost a year in development this game has basically gone no where and it won't get anywhere fast. Just avoid the game and find something else to buy/play.\n\n(Edit) The reason I have 16 hours on this game is because when it first came out the game had a fun masochistic challenge to it, even though the AI had quite few advantages. In the beginning we had a little thing called the RFID Tracker. It allowed us to see enemies on the map due to their RFID chips installed. So you could effectivly avoid enemies before they could even auto lock onto you or run out of the range of their auto lock before it was too late (F.Y.I This item isn't in the game anymore.) . The PvP aspect had you set in teams of two to survive against three other teams. Unfortunatly when the PvP was first introduced you couldn't win with your partner being alive, it was coded to be last man standing. So you either ended up murdering your team mate in the beginning with the basic tools given to you or have a battle royale at the end. Game was fun at first but with nothing new to up the ante, fix issues, or add more interest to the game it gets dull and repetitive.","June 8, 2015","false","15.8"," 498 of 562 people (89%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","89","498","562","25","17"

In this vast world of robots mercy does not exist. You will have to make use of every item you can find if you are to survive even one day. So far, the tutorial is very informative. The tutorial gets a very good foothold into the basics of the game and made starting the single player pretty easy. The game itself is running pretty smoothly so far. This game has some really good potential. I would give it a 7/10 so far. The final product should be promising.","July 25, 2014","true","29.5"," 362 of 445 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","362","445","6","10"

IF YOU LIKE IT, KUDOS TO YOU. BUT NOTE I AM NOT YOU.*\n\nI really tried to like this game, it felt like it could be something special even if it was really F-ing hard. But as the game is now, I can't play it without feeling increasingly frustrated at nearly every aspect of the game.\nYes, its a good game, it held on to me for almost a week, but my patience for it has ended, and I just can't play this anymore.\n\nPros:\n- Crafting - Done in two ways, one by assembling tools & guns through your inventory screen (provided you have the parts), the other through some machine that cannot be moved or made (luckily there's more than one).\n\n- Loot & Materials - All found in small flashing crates in almost areas. Most of the loot is pretty easy to find, but expect copies along the way. You can also, if you have the scematics, use the craft machine to recycle items in your inventory. And there's at least 3 Harvesters (that I'm aware of) that you can control & gather Wood, Ore, and Concrete for you.\n\n- Jumping - Once you figure it out, you'll be able to jump at ridiculous heights, helps when you need to access an item & simply want a safe spot (I'll explain why in Cons).\n\n- Building - As the trailer shows, you can build stuff. You can build pretty much anything in Wood, Concrete, or Brick. The Turrets however require a bit more to build & start up (but they are your base defenses with pretty epic range), and get their own drives.\n\nCons:\n*Note - This is being developed by apparently one guy*\n\nBots (Enemies) - Every survival game wouldn't much of a challenge without enemies, but these enemies are relentless, annoying, and frustrating. Hunters (looks like Terminators with helmets) move a somewhat slow pace, but have ridiculous range, their mere presence WILL make you run for your life cause there won't be a viable way to fight them at start, and they can shoot you twice & you're dead. Suicide Bots will walk up to you and blow up (after having a seizure).\n\nBots Spawns - Random spawning is also understandable, but most times you'll as if the game intentionally TRYING to kill you as if you're the end of days or something. You can be walking along and then 1 foot away, an enemy spawns (sometimes you'll get a group).\n\nBugs - The bugs hurt the play experience a lot. Some enemies will clip on ladders then one second later they're back on the ground, then back at the top again. The menus during multiplayer will randomly stop working, making something simple become abyssmal level frustrating. Since the Hunters will war with the flying hive bots, you can expect some ridiculous lag. When building stuff, you can expect some decent lag, but the more you place & build, then more it goes from ok lag to WTF lag. And best of all, Bots can walk THROUGH WALLS that you built! Making your defensive walls pointless.\n\nBuilding - Since the Dev tries pretty hard to add realism like gravity to the game, don't expect anything like Minecraft building in this game. If just one piece of your structure is even SLIGHTLY off, expect all your hard work to go to hell, and even better, you lose ALL of the used materials if the building falls. And it gets worse, sometimes you'll hit a point where the Auto-Placement will go where you don't want it, making custom projects almost impossible.\n\nMultiplayer - Despite the game having 352 positive reviews, hardly ANYONE is online to play. Most people I've seen was 4 people in one room (including me). Most times though, the lag & menu bugs will increase rapidly while playing multiplayer (big bad for multiplayer only gamer types).\n\nOne Map - Thats right, just one map. The items' placement is random, but buildings, repair station, recycle machines, everythingelse in completely preset. And though there is a ridiculous huge tower out there, the point of it has not been discovered or explained - as that is, the huge tower is completely pointless & serves no other purpose than to take up space.\n\nThe Hunters always getting the drop on me, even while having a Radar was getting to me.\nMy health getting low forcing me to move slower than Yoda with a cane.\nNo real plot or story in the game.\nBut bots being able to walk through walls while being able to spawn in unfair spots, that pushed me over the edge.\n\nSorry to say, but you'll find less frustration in Dark Souls. I'm starting to regret even buying it...\n\nRating: 5/10.","July 17, 2015","false","25.3"," 261 of 320 people (82%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","82","261","320","26","12"

It is currently still in Alpha and since the developer has never bothered to release a road map it's unknown if, or even when, it is supposed to progress beyond its present state.\n\nSadly it's now over 5 months since the last software update and the developer, Touz, continues to ignore the Steam community. A brief posting by him on January 6th was a rehash of previous statements he's made but did nothing to instill confidence that the game is moving forward in any significant way.\n\nCurrent game play is, quite frankly, boring. At one time there were multiplayer servers that allowed for PVP but the online community has vanished.\n\nThe singleplayer component is bare-bones and has no goal. Essentially it consists of running around and attempting to find components for weapons and other bits and pieces while trying to avoid enemy AI. That's it. The weapon crafting system is needlessly complex and there is absolutely no reason to build a base as the AI is not programmed to recognize player structures.\n\nThe lack of any progression system, storyline or end goal severely limit replayability. This is made worse by the small static map that comprises the player world . Once all areas have been explored there is nothing to draw the player further into the game since there is no 'further' to be had.\n\nIf you are interested in this game, I'd suggest you wait. If the developer decides to actually work on the game and make significant improvements it may be worth purchasing at a future date. Right now it would be a waste of money.\n\nNot recommended.","April 22","false","7.0"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","51","53","0","1"

If you can't handle incomplete games with glitches and bugs -- look elsewhere.\n\nPotential is nice - StarForge had mass potential and so have many other games.  Some reach it, others don't so go in knowing the risks and judge it based upon it's current state for playability -and- your willingness to risk based upon that potential.\n\nA list of things to look at:\n- The skill-point system only works multi-player so you won't skill up in single player.\n\n- Multiplayer you will end up against leveled up oponents and those levels have meaning and high value.  Lots and lots of value to being leveled up here.\n\n- Gathering requires hacking a harvester which then can take quite a while to gather things - you can't harvest anything.\n\n- to get that hacking device you must find it.\n\n- Robot NPC's drop nothing.  You need to hunt through ruins to find weapons, ammo and other supplies.\n\n- ammo is fairly scarce for the quantity of robots you'll bump into - again, no points for dealing with AI opponents.  You're best bet is to run/aviod them.\n\n- robots can pop up at any point near or far.  They have been toned down to 2 shots to kill you but that's the best you'll get.\n\n- AI robots cannot aim upwards.  If you are above them, they can't hit you with their weapons -- if at range and above, they can and will hit you.\n\n- AI robots can walk through walls that you build.  So if you build, make the building tall and use stairs to get up there.\n\n- You need to find power for your unit - not those silly solar cells but nuclear power.  Without it, you won't be able to power up the capacitor to run, jump, etc.  Extra capacitors are good but you shouldn't need too many of them.\n\n- picking up anything early will stop your running.  Anything except a nuclear power units.  The solar power cells weigh a ton for the energy they give, which slows you down.\n\n- many items are sunk in the ground and other items - you'll see loot markers but can't loot the item nor even know what it is.\n\nAgain, it's got potential but that potential has a long way to go to be achieved.  IMO - worth supporting with funds but don't expect a highly clean and polished version at this time.\n\nIt runs well but it's not done yet.","October 6, 2014","true","8.7"," 136 of 189 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","136","189","5","1"

I am eager to see how this progresses as it has the potential in my mind to give games like Rust a run for its money. The premise of a left behind robot trying to survive in a world of hostile robots is a very fresh concept and the use of a hacking system is reminiscent of other awesome games like System Shock.\n\nFrom only playing about 2 hours of the game so far, in that time I found 2 harvesters, hacked them and set them to gathering resources. I also looted one of the nuclear power plants and towns and got some loot before getting bumrushed by 2 robots as night was falling.\n\nQuite eager to see what new updates will bring!\n\nNavigating the inventory is a bit clunky when switching between RFID reader and weapons etc, draws you out of the game a bit but I am not complaning. For a game this early in development (and by a sole developer) it is probably the most stable I have seen before bar none and expecting this will be optimised in the future.\n\nHighly recommend this game for anyone that can handle the fact that the game is very early alpha!","October 10, 2014","true","3.3"," 61 of 82 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","61","82","2","0"

I spent a couple hours exploring the single-player world and was impressed with how good it looked, as well as how good the enemies and character models were.\n\nGraphics aside, the gameplay is quite slow-paced at first. You'll spend the first few lives exploring around and learning the map. Since there's currently no in-game map feature at the moment, you'll have to use your compass and navigate by landmarks, like the tower, cities, and nuclear power plant. The hacking, which is necessary for any type of survival in the game, requires a tool that you don't start off with, so the first few minutes of every life will be spent searching for a hacking tool before too many enemy robots spawn. Once the tool is in hand, you can hack enemy hunters to make friendly guards that follow you around. I once had thirteen friendlies plodding their way behind me, shooting anything else that spawned around me before I got the chance to hack it and add to my army.\nOh, and you should avoid swarms like the plague. It's currently fantastically hard to hack a swarmbot, and they'll kill you and everything following you while you're trying.\nAnyways, once you have a hacking tool, you need to find a harvester. These spawn in large dish-like structures in the ground, and they allow you to collect wood and other building materials for your base. Unless you know exactly where they are on the map, or unless you get wonderfully lucky and find a hacking tool right next to the harvester, you'll likely spend a good while searching for one before you can build a base, Once those resources start coming in, you've got the game won. Enemies can't currently shoot through doorways or windows, so you can build a square structure and hide in it until the end of day 5, or you can make a bunker with charging stations and turrets and only leave to scrounge up more resources that the harvester can't bring you, like ammo and capacitors.\n\nAll in all, it's a fantastic Alpha.\n\nPROS--------\n-Beautiful game\n-Fun gameplay so far (if you enjoy exploration and the long-play style of Rust and 7 Days to Die)\n-Loads of potential\n\nCONS--------\n-The updates are rather slow. Touz is currently the only dev on this game at the moment, and the updates are spread out. There was an update just a few hours before I posted this review, so it is still being worked on, but it takes a while.\n\n\nThis game is a fantastic early-access experience. If you like following early-access games, you'll love this.\nI'd really love to see this game maintain the Robots gimmick instead of turning to Zombies, as many people have suggested in the forum. The market is already saturated with zombie crafting survival games, and even if it is a slight change, the robots and hacking and power supplies bring a refreshing change to the survival genre.\n\nThis dev does a great job and should be supported. This game is still extremely early in development, and is already fantastic. I love it.","October 19, 2014","true","4.4"," 86 of 123 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","86","123","3","0"

And, it actually kinda saddens me that this game is getting so much hate.\n\nYes, The Fifth Day is incomplete. It's obvious. But, it's not bad... Actually, I find myself loving it when I find another person to play it with, as Multiplayer makes the Death Game so much more fun.\n\nSimple, you start out with nothing (Sadly), and work your way around the map, avoiding hunters and other dangers while keeping your power up, until you can find a Hacking Tool, a harvester, and a construction tool. Then, you multi-task exploring for ammo, weapons, weapon parts, etc. and managing your base, its power, its defenses, and the supplies your harvester(s) collect.\n\nYes, it's obscenely hard in single player, especially when you have nothing to work with... But that's the point.\nIt's not supposed to be a solo experience.\nIt's supposed to be either a team of people, working together to make a base, and survive who knows what, or a fight for your life as you hunt for supplies, watch out for hostile players, and hope that there are still harvesters around to claim so you can survive on your own.\n\nPlease, if you're thinking of getting the game... Get it. Support the game devs, expand the community, and wait who knows how long for an update. (Yes, it's updating... But think how hard it is to make this kind of massive game, with all those A.I. trying to hunt you down and destroy you. Along with managing the hacking gimmick... yes, you can hack everything except for other players. It takes a hellish amount of time to master, but if you can get hacking something to make it friendly before it kills you down, then you stand a chance for experimentation.)","May 18, 2015","true","14.3"," 217 of 339 people (64%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","64","217","339","25","35"

Other than that I haven't found many other reasons to play the game as you can run about and loot all you want but the single player aspect is pretty much limited to building.\n\nMultiplayer was interesting but surprisingly for a survival game, everyone ended up working together rather than just killing eachother to win so that was nice,\n\nOverall, I do not recommend this game as I feel like this is another "Early Access" game that doesn't deliver. The premise of the game is interesting but since the game is very rarely updated I feel like it isn't making enough progress or taking in  the consideration of the players.","November 8, 2014","false","4.6"," 144 of 220 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","144","220","0","18"

All of the current positive reviews say the game has potential, which is true. But the game in its current state as a new released early access game, it is not very fun. Multiplayer is completely unplayable. The map is too big for such a small multiplayer mode, I played three matches and ran into only one person. And I always "won" because people would just quit because there was no point to multiplayer. The inventory bugs in MP, preventing you from picking anything up. The only reason to do multiplayer is because you get skill points, which is an awesome idea, but you just have to stand around and wait it out to "win".\n\nIn single player, the game is rough starting out. You have no defense against enemy robots because you don't start out with anything you can hit with and the robots will one shot your face off. Eventually you will run around and die enough that you finally manage to find a gun or something else. Items are very rare except in cities. Hacking is too difficult, it is near impossible to even try hacking the enemy robots because of their one shot kills. The harvester, which is the only way you can gather to start building, is VERY buggy! It does not fly high enough above the trees and frequently gets stuck. Sometimes the harvester does not listen to your commands and just flies away forever. And when you died and load your save, your harvester will be all the way back at its original spawn.\n\nThe game has potential, and I will surely revisit in the future. But if you are unsure I would wait. You can check out my gameplay at twitch.tv/Lowco2525.","July 25, 2014","false","5.0"," 108 of 184 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","108","184","0","3"

I know this game is an in-development prototype but a game good as this should at least have a good AI system. To me personally the AI is the worst thing about playing this game. Having a stable AI system that doesn't spawn ten feet in front of you and then kills you instantly and still follows you when you respawn and will try to kill you until either you or itself dies. It would be amazing to be able to do what the game has in store for you and to be able to play with your friends in peace without getting interfered by the AI, but I won't give my hopes up yet and I hope to never give my hopes up on the game's up coming development, but once this game seeks the development that it deserves I will find myself and I hope others start to praise the amazingness of this great game.\n\n\nKeep up the good work Touz","January 11","false","26.5"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

There's the ground, and hills, valleys, trees, buildings, tunnels, and the world extends out to the horizons in 4 directions (although you do hit the invisible wall at the edge).\n\nThere are no objectives per-se. You simply need to survive. You can collect resources (mainly via harvester dotted around the world that require hacking to activate and control). You play a drone robot, so power generation and consumption is everything. I found the fastest way was to collect solar panels from the farms and capacitors from various locations, then stand still for a while to charge before moving off.\n\nAlways keeping a watchful eye on the automated drones gives the game a certain edge, especially at night and when you're building structures. I build a small tower, and was standing at the top adding a roof when a drone walked into the bottom and exploded.\nNeedless to say, it took out a corner of the building and the whole thing fell down, but you take no damage from falling so dont die.\nNo, that comes in the form of hunter bots with shotguns that kill you in 2 shots.\n\nOverall, in my opinion, a nice game. It contains elements I enjoy: survival, open world, freebuild of tools, weapons and structures, achievments (there are Steam ones as well as in game for solo and multi play), and most importantly, it's always recieving updates. Always small, but they are always fixing a bug or adding a new featre, which is great.","January 28","true","18.8"," 39 of 66 people (59%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","59","39","66","9","4"

The game itself is a lot of fun once you figure things out.  The fact that I had to use trial and error while figuring out the game was extremely refreshing.  The tutorial is great and teaches you about all the gameplay functionality but it doesn't hold your hand throughout the game.\n\nYou can currently play locally or multiplayer.  The multiplayer game reminds me of a "Hunger Games" style arena.  The servers are 10 player max with two game modes.  "Loner" where it's every man for himself, or "COOP" where there are 5 teams of 2.  The idea is to be the last man or team alive.\n\nIn the early access there is already a lot of functionality:\n-  More than several weapon variations (Melee, Pistols, SMGs, Assault Rifles, Grenade Launcher, etc)\n-  Crafting system for base building (Foundations, Walls, Stairs, Doorways, Pillars, Charging Stations, Automated Machine Gun Turrets, etc)\n-  Hacking other robots and controlling them\n-  A reasonably large size map\n-  Lootz\n-  more things...\n\nNow, this is an early release game and you can expect some things to bug out.\n\nHere are some gripes I have with the game so far:\n-  UI sometimes bugs out and in game weapon and UI functionality stops responding to buttons and clicks (requires exiting to fix)\n-  The UI is clunky in the sense that navigating the UI is not optimal\n-  The multiplayer mode doesn't encourage players to utilize any of the base building or resource gathering mechanics.  It's basically this: Get weapons and power -> kill other players.  Every time I've started harvesting resources and building a base the other players got killed or quit.  The longest multiplayer match I had was the first day and half of the first night.  This might improve as players get better though... the game has only been out one day.\n\nOverall, I think this game is really fun.  I'm very excited about building large bases and creating power arrays... crafting in general.  In my opinion, this game is going to go from "early access fun" to "completed game awesome".\n\nGreat job so far "The Fifth Day" devs and keep it up.  Congrats on the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","July 26, 2014","true","21.4"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","21","33","0","0"

Hacking tools, humans extinct, robots, etc. I am sort of disappointed that it's not a true open world game like Rust or DayZ. But considering that instead it is an arena sort of game, I am still interested. I like the concept of entering a battle to the likes of Hunger Games and for five days be a predator and a prey at the same time. Still and as most EA games, I cannot recommend this game at this time for a lack of content. I will keep the "recommended" state because I see potential.\n\nPros\n- the tutorial, it explains everything very well\n- fresh look on the survival genre\n- a lot of interesting mechanics like hacking\n\ncons\n- for now, the multiplayer looks stale, you get in a match and sometimes you wander untill you're killed with no chance to fight back\n- survival gamers might not enjoy the arena style that much","July 25, 2014","true","0.7"," 33 of 56 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","33","56","0","0"

He stated in his video that the game was poorly made, very buggy, and had little to no content. Still, I purchased it in hope of a half-way decent survival&building game.\nOnce I launched it I was greeted with a pleasant surprise. The game's visuals were beautiful and captured the asthetic of a cold, lonely wasteland well and without any FPS drops or crashing on maximum settings. Once I started walking around the desolate world I came across a new breed of enemy, robots. The bots were well modeled and effectively frightining, as one of them slowly turned around; scanned me and shot one round. Killing me in my place. I must say I jumped as the shot rang out.\n\nGameplay mechanics such and building and combat are fluid and difficult enough to provide a challenge, not a headache.\nTo start building you must find a hacker tool (They mainly spawn in cities and towns), and a harvester. (Harvesters are found in pits around the map) If you do find a harvester, you must hack into it using the tool mentioned above. Once hacked you command the machine to collect resources and drop them near you (The way the harvester flys around and drops supply pods is impressive for a game this young). Once you have enough resources you build using a recipe book found around the map. The building itself is rather alot like the game "Rust" by Garry Newman, You craft templates and place them in a locking format. I prefer The Fifth Day's building more because it has no glitches with the terrain and more templates to produce more complex structures. Combat is wonderful, the weapon models sway with your charecter, the firearms themselves feel powerful and fun to fire, and the recoil is set properly to give you the satisfaction of a well aimed shot.\n\nThe AI is not the smartest out there, but still provide enough of a challenge to keep you on the edge of your seet as you walk through the deserted countrysides and cities.\n\nAll in all I give The Fifth Day a 10/10, for breathtaking visuals and atmosphere, no bugs or glitches, well designed building and gunplay mechanics, interesting and new hostile enemies, low hardware requirements, and low price.","August 4, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

First off this is a early release game and its only 0.0.3 anyone ♥♥♥♥♥ing because it has bugs, or because it doesnt have much content how ♥♥♥♥ing stupid can you be. a game takes time to make, and since its only one guy making a indie game i think hes done pretty damn good on what he has done so far. for instance lets compare a published game by a company like square enix. its takes them ♥♥♥♥ing years to create a game with a big ♥♥♥ staff to make a decent game. so pretty much if you have anything bad to say then go play something else till the game is worked on more and features has been added. For me the game looks promising and i know its tough roaming for supplies and then trying to find your base again while constantly avoiding enemies.\nMy thoughts on improvements would be a few things starting off, lets have it where we can manually collect supplies so we can start building from scratch once we have the books. add the recipe for solar panels the stand the are attached to and such as. add recipes for ammunition, weapons, and other things that is hard to find like circuits. i would like the map expanded when time allows with more complex and beautiful towns, cities, and landscape adding underground areas and caves and such as. keep up the good work and seriously dont expect a indie game that has just came out to be like a game you buy in the store, give it time to progress just like your parents who bought you the game are waiting patiently for you to grow the ♥♥♥♥ up and move the hell out of thier house.","October 5, 2014","true","7.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I wasn't expecting too much, but even then it failed to deliver.\ntl/dr; the combat is probably the worst part of the game, and in a survival game like this, that's a huge dealbreaker.\n\nThe best thing about this game I can say is probably weapon crafting. While it's a pain early on, you could probably make some pretty nice weapons later on. I say probably, because I've never actually lasted longer than a few minutes, so I've never gotten to experiment with the weapon crafting.\nThe enemies range from either absurdly stupid to absurdly powerful. There are "creeper bots" (they walk up to you and explode) but they're hardly a threat. I don't think I've even been damaged by one of them. There are Hive Bots, which are small, flying robots that swarm near their hives, but they are easily avoided. The real threat are "Hunters" I believe they are called. They spawn randomly and just wander around until you get near. And once they have locked on to you, you might as well be dead. They can kill you in about 2 shots and don't ever seem to miss. AND they travel in groups most of the time, spawning quiet frequently. Maybe they would be easy to kill with a decent weapon, but finding a gun isn't so simple. You usually find PARTS of weapons scattered through the world that you can craft together, but finding all of the essential parts takes awhile, and even if you complete a weapon, ammo is scarce. Melee weapons are a joke, the exploding bots kill themselves, Hive bots can be easily avoided, and Hunters will destroy you the moment you get within range.\n\nEven if poor combat wasn't enough, the world in this game is just so empty. The only place of interest is the giant spire which sometimes (I stress the word SOMETIMES) has good equipment. There aren't any bosses, food isn't a concern, base building is crude and, in the end, pointless, hacking is slow, confusing, and again, pointless. In the end, there just is nothing to do in this game.","September 9, 2015","false","2.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

At first it seems extremely hard but once you get skill points and improve yourself (or use cheat engine to get em, heh) it gets much easier. The first patch loot was so extremely rare it made it hard. Now theres a bit too much. The base building is already better than rust's, theres a ton of stuff you can do as far as base building. Once you find a few power generators beating the mobs is easy, you see them coming on your RFID scanner and you simply run away. Theres a bunch of work to be done but the sole developer Touz is shuffling out updates regularly, and they improve alot in the game already.

The reason? Well, the game may deliver a new fun game style, meaning that you are a machine that need more power to be able to, for example, jump higher. That perhaps doesn't sound very exciting however I think that this game can be worth putting a few hours in to IN A LATER STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT. At the moment the game is lacking content and I would dare say that I would have discovered the most you can do and been able to do it in the 11 hours I put in to it..

The Harvestor will actually freeze up in place and not move at all. To where you need to deactivate it and then reactivagte it to get it moving sometimes. Also I do see alot of people complaining about it being hard to find alot of stuff such as guns and ammo and etc. but i could care less cause it is a post-apocalyptic and is meant to be hard to find stuff. Also the AI are nearly impossible to destroy, they are like terminators they kill u in a few shots and u can empty mags out on them and do little damage. But at the same time that is why I love this game because it is really challenging and they do not go easy on you like alot of games do.

I love everything about this game man, the idea is great, a robot apocalypse. But everything you do in this game wont do nothing if your looking to go to those high loot spots with a lot of enemies. honestly I've played my singleplayer world for a long time, online, offline, and I was having blast, stocking up of good recources and ammo. Then i tried killing one enemy that had found my base. I shot him and used up 143 bullets on him, and nothing happened. Unless I'm doing somethng terribly wrong, It's not finished yet. I hope the dev fixes this problem or someone helps me know whats wrong, so I can go back to that same big smile on my face.","July 25, 2015","false","5.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

It offers a new setting for a survival game, in a futuristic setting. Zomies are replaced with several types of ruthless machines who make survival in this game much easier said than done. Considering the game is only in 0.01 Alpha, it has a bright future and if the deveoper continues to work on the game, it can really become a powerhouse game in the genre. Right now, bugs are plentiful and there isn't a huge variety of items or structures. But if you can look beyond the surface and see a game that, at its core, is very original and enthralling, you'll have no qualms about dishing out the 15$. You won't regret supporting a developer with an exellent concept. The Fifth Day is splendid.\n\nAlso, please message me if you know how to build. I haven't been able to find the resources to actually build what blueprints are in the Survival Books you pick up","July 31, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"
