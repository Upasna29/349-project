The weapons are some of the most unique I've ever come across, and are worth the purchase of the game. The game itself is narrow and linear, with awesome graphics (DX11) and decent voice-acting. Get it on sale and get ready for a fun 10 or so hours.\n\nAfter finishing the game, I wanted to do more in the game world, but didn't want to play through the campaign again. Ruin mode (destroy the environment) is a lot of fun, but there are not enough maps and only two modes: Free Play and Challenge. Multi-player is fighting waves of enemies, in either Survive mode (what it says) or Defend mode (repair / defend something while waves of enemies attack). There are eight multiplayer maps, each in two varieties for 16 maps in all.\n\nThe "Path to War" DLC, now included for free, is a series of four missions that tie into the main campaign. There doesn't seem to be any reason for them to exist. Maybe the missions were rejected from the main campaign but the dev team were perhaps proud of the level design and released them anyway. The missions are fun, but it is a short, disjointed experience.\n\nI'd like to think that the dev team, knowing THQ was facing troubled times (they went bankrupt shortly after the game's release), said something like, "However big or small our budget is, that's how big /small our game will be. Whatever. Let's make it the best game that we can." And they succeeded, it's a tremendously fun game. If you enjoy playing it as much as I did, at the end you'll be wanting more.

The DirectX 11 visuals, physics engine, wide variety of weapons as well as a multiplayer/co-op mode make for a solid third person shooter.  Where the game fails however is in it's lackluster narrative and on the rails play.  The game feels very linear, which is a disappointment after the open world experience of Red Faction Guerilla.  With that said however, there is enough good gameplay and solid voice acting to make this game an enoyable but flawed title.","September 5, 2013","true","32.4"," 54 of 69 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","54","69","0","0"

Notice that this game is called Red Faction: Armageddon, NOT Red: Faction Guerilla 2.\n\nThat being said, if you are a fan of the series, like third-person action shooters, and environment destructibility, then you will really, really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are great, with absolutely fantastic environmental destruction depending on what weapon you use. The music and sounds are good. The story is decent, plot and gameplay progression is considerably more linear than Guerilla's open-world freedom, however, you should not be coming in to this game expecting it to be Guerilla 2.\n\nThe controls are easy to familiarize yourself with and the learning curve is minimal to moderate.\n\nThere is a horde mode that can be played local co-op or online multiplayer (or even solo) that is extremely fun. You unlock the levels you beat and can start at whatever wave you have unlocked. Solo playthrough is fairly challenging but doable if you keep practicing.\n\nThere is also a destruction mode that is insanely fun. You can choose whichever weapon loadout to use (you can swap weapons by going back to the equipment console) and just destroy everything in the environment. The magnet gun is amazing - shoot two (applicable) areas and the lighter object will fly toward the heavier one. Most of the weapons available will easily cut through most buildings and materials. You can play without a time limit or try the challenges - clearing the level within a time limit.\n\nIf you like third-person shooters with a lot of action and colossal amounts of destruction, give this game a try.\n\nHighly recommend!","July 28, 2014","true","0.7"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","44","54","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chromfell/recommended/55110/","chromfell","Chromfell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chromfell/","153 products in account","This is the first positive review I've done in a while, Jesus.\nWell then. This is it.\n\nI honestly didn't know what to expect. Red Faction: Guerilla was pretty fun, but the story was very... simple. Boring almost. The Multiplayer was a lot of fun, due to drunk friends, playing hide&seek and destruction. After more than a year, I decided to buy Armageddon for 2.49 on the encore sale.\nBasically, what Volition with Red Faction: Armageddon did, was:\nEverything that was missing, is now here!\n\nAnd now, let me elaborate. (This is where the review starts, get hyped)\n\nGeneral World Design: This is probably one of the biggest pros. The worlddesign is non-repetitive, detailed and story-fitting. Yes, that's noticable. The fact that you can destroy everything you see makes everything even better. "Use the world to kill your enemies". Remember Battlefield 4s "Levelation"? This game does it better. A lot better. Not scripted.\n\nStory: Well, a zombie alien apocalypse outbreak mysterious ancient ♥♥♥♥ on Mars. That's it, and I am not going to spoil you about the story. I will try not to. That might sound boring and mainstream (especially on the zombie alien apocalypse outbreak part), but it's actually kind of addicting. I couldn't stop playing to be honest.\n\nWeapons and Equipment: We got Mars stuff. We got normal stuff. Lazer pistols. Rocket launchers. We also have nano-robot-grenade launchers and tissue destroying grenade launchers. And shotguns. Can't go wrong with a shotgun.\nLet's be serious, the weapons and the equipment are plain awesome. Come on, we got magnet guns right here. Magnet guns. We finally have a repair tool aswell, to repair all the things you break. In single player and multiplayer. That's a necessity by the way, you'll use it a lot.\n\nGamemodes: Well, we got Single Player, Co-Op Survival and Co-Op Protection. But let me give you a heads up: You WILL just run around destroying every building and playing around with the environment. Co-Op is insane fun. Like, INSANE fun.  Destruction. Magnet guns. Many zombie aliens. And to top the gamemodes off, we have FREE DESTRUCTION MODE in SINGLE PLAYER. Yes. Destruction without a timelimit. That was the biggest contra in Red Faction: Guerilla, because it didn't exist. BUT IT DOES NOW.\n\nLevel system: Exists for both Multi- and Single Player. And guess what, the skills you have earned and bought in Singleplayer (It's all in-game-currency [you get that mostly from destroying things {this game has no micro-transactions. No windows live. It's all good.}]) work in Multiplayer aswell. Same the other way around. So, if you are stuck in Singleplayer because you happen to play on Hard or Insane, and you want that one ability that would save you from everything but you cant afford it, do some survival with your best buddy and you'll have it in no time. And the abilities in this game are awesome. It's like having the force. For example, a plasma wave that destroys everything in your path, or a shockwave that stuns your enemies, lifts them up in arcs of electricity, kills them slowly or allows you to smack the ♥♥♥♥ out of them. Every enemy is liftable. No enemy is too heavy for the magnet gun either.\n\nLast but not least (actually very much least after all that awesome sh!t)...\nGraphics: Textures look horribly upscaled on 4K. Alright on 1440p. Perfect on 1080p. Framerate amazing. Everything good on the performance part. Anti-Aliasing exists. Let's be honest, what did you expect me to say about the games graphics? Just can check that out yourself. You have the internet.\n\nRed Faction was always known for having the best destruction. And here they go again. Still here with the best destruction.\n\nIn the end, this game should be a solid 9/10 for anyone who likes what they see here.\n\nAnyway, I hope this helped. :)","January 5, 2015","true","27.3"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","88","36","41","10","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/55110/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Red Faction: Armageddon was quite a surprise.\n\nI got it way back in the THQ Humble Bundle on December 6th of last year, and up until now went unplayed. What a fool I was not to have tried it until now! It's a great game, and to have gotten it in a bundle? *mindblown*\n\nArmageddon is a Third-Person Shooter that puts you in the shoes of Ex-Red Faction member Darius Mason on the surface of Mars. After a series of events spanning a few years, you are set on the path to stop a madman from destroying the planet. Along you way you will face thousands of alien lifeforms hellbent on your demise.\n\nBut do not worry! You have plenty of weapons with which to arm yourself. The most notable of which is the Nano Forge, a glove-like apparatus that can not only project a burst of force ahead of you, knocking back anything in its way, but can also repair ANYTHING in your environment. Found an Upgrade Station or Weapons Locker, but accidently blew it up in a battle against aliens? Come to a broken bridge that halts your advance? NO PROBLEM! Just use the Nano Forge's Repair ability to fix everything right up in seconds! You will definitely make use of this tool because literally about 98% of what you see on screen (terrain, buildings, etc) can be blown to bits. Other nifty weapons include the trusty Shotgun, 2 different sets of twin pistols (standard Pistols and later the significantly more powerful pair of Banshees <3 ), and even a Singularity Cannon, which fires a mini black hole which sucks in all around it, then explodes!\n\nOne of the mose useful tools, but one that some might consider the game's way of "holding your hand", is the GPS. Simply hit tab and for a few seconds a path will be lit up showing you the way to proceed. For people who like to figure things out on their own, this may seem an annoyance or a turn-off, but for others who prefer the action, shooting, and storytelling, this won't be a problem at all.\n\nAs you play you will collect Salvage, which you can use to buy upgrades, which range from more health, faster reload times, extra Nano Forge abilities, or increased damage and effectiveness with certain weapons. There was even an upgrade that awards you Salvage when defeating enemies. The game will reward you salvage for exploring your surroundings, as you will find some in dark corners of each area. Just look down every path and around every corner!\n\nAll-in-all, Red Faction: Armageddon is an exciting shooter, which you will enjoy til the very end. The only downside is that I was able to complete the campaign in just under 8 hours, so it's a tad on the short side. But there are multiple game modes (like New Game Plus) and even a multiplayer I believe, to take the game further. I cannot comment on these because I just played the main campaign though.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","September 19, 2014","true","38.9"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","37","47","0","1"

It's limited too: unlike the first game, which also took place in the cramped tunnels in Mars' surface, you CANNOT blow up terrain.  No making your own tunnels to get past the tedium, because that would let you bypass the riveting on-rails experience.\n\nThis is the worst game in the series, worse even than Red Faction 2.

If you've ever liked a linear, story driv- well, oriented shooter there's no discernible reason you won't like this.

I found Guerilla to give me more entertainment since it was open world and the destruction you caused wasn't limited to a level. However, Armageddon still gave me a solid 8-10 hours gameplay offline, which only included the campaign, a few infestation levels and about an hour mucking about in free roam. I have not tried Online and there are plenty more things to do in offline mode (achievements, secrets, harder difficulties, etc.) Graphics wise the game was OK. I was playing the game off a new-ish laptop and everything ran fine, however I don't think graphics are on par with games that came out around the same time. But hey, don't judge a book by it's cover, right?\nI definitely recommend this game to any one looking for intense FPS destruction game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/55110/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Download size: about 8 gigabytes if I remember correctly\nPlay time: about 8 hours (with the DLC)\n\nRed Faction Armageddon (RFA) is the latest in a series of games made famous for their “destroy the environment” gameplay. Like its predecessors, in RFA you can use your sledgehammer or guns to blow apart basically anything that is “manmade” in the game. This includes walls, bridges, and entire buildings. You can’t break through “natural” obstacles like cave walls, the floor, or most rocks on the ground. A lot of people I’ve spoken to seem to think that RFA is a step down from the previous game Red Faction Guerilla, but I like RFA more. For one thing, it’s much more straightforward and action based (Guerilla was an open world sandbox game like Grand Theft Auto on Mars).\n\nYou don’t need to have played the previous games to get into Red Faction Armageddon since this game takes place a generation or two after Guerilla. Now the “Red Faction” is the legitimate military of Mars and you’re one of them (in the previous games they were rebels). In RFA you play Darius Mason, an engineer with an artificial intelligence computer companion named Sam who helps you out, like Cortana in the Halo series. Your enemy is Hale, some kind of cult leader who tricks you into unleashing an ancient alien race sealed deep underground. The rest of the game is spent trying to fix your mistake.\n\nRFA is a third person “over the shoulder” shooter game with a variety of weapons and “super powers.” The super powers are part of the Nano Forge technology that Darius wears on his wrist and can get you out of any jam. You have Impact (a force push), Shockwave (lifts up enemies around you), Berserk (some kind of damage buff), and Shell (an area effect shield).  All of the powers share the same cooldown bar. Money in the game is “salvage” just like Red Faction Guerilla. Salvage is glowing junk that is left over when you blow stuff up and can also be found just lying around. You mostly spend the salvage upgrading your character, but you can also unlock cheats like infinite ammo or vehicle weapons (guns that are usually mounted on vehicles but you can now use when walking around).\n\nSpeaking of vehicles, there are a bunch of times when you get into an EXO suit or an assault walker and run around blowing stuff up with your heavy weapons. In the Path to War DLC for the game, you spend most of the time in vehicles. The DLC adds about 2 hours more gameplay and a few easy achievements.\n\nI haven’t tried the multiplayer much since the game has been out long enough that nobody’s playing online anymore. You can use the “Infestation” game mode to grind for more salvage since Infestation shares the same unlocks as the single player campaign. Any upgrades you buy in Infestation (except cheats) can be used during the campaign and vice versa.  Infestation is a survivor mode where you just kill waves of aliens, which get more powerful as you progress. It can get boring fast though, since you don’t really get penalized for dying (and there’s nobody to play with).\n\nPros:\n+Excellent graphics and story. The aliens are freaky looking and it’s always fun blowing stuff up. The game mostly takes place underground, but there are a lot of buildings that you can bring crashing down. The Nano Forge can also repair broken things, so if you accidently destroy a ladder or stairs, you can rebuild it in seconds.\n+In one playthrough of the game you can unlock most of the skills, and there is a new game+ option where you can start over, keeping everything you bought. During the second playthrough you’ll get enough salvage to unlock all the upgrades you missed, plus a couple of cheats, which can be used for higher difficulty levels. The cheats do NOT disable Steam achievements.\n\nCons:\n-Multiplayer is dead. You won’t find anyone to play with online unless you set it up beforehand.\n-Like most over the shoulder games, you might get a headache the first few times you play. It varies by person though, and you’ll get used to the perspective eventually.\n\nOverall, the game is great and you should give it a try if you haven’t already. A lot of people probably got this game from the THQ bundles back when THQ was going out of business. The main game takes maybe 7 hours to beat, so you can finish it in a weekend and rake in a few Steam achievements while you’re at it. You get about half the achievements just playing through the game one time.\n","October 27, 2014","true","20.1"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

I discovered Red Faction: Guerrilla at my local Internet Cafe after school. I sat there, enjoyed myself as I destroyed literally EVERYTHING I could see. The game was a masterpiece, a beautiful black diamond amongst an unholy horde of ♥♥♥♥ coming from Infinity-Ward in the form of Call of Duty this, Call of Duty that, and Call of Duty blow it out your ♥♥♥.\n\nMoving along to late 2011. Walking to school, and I look to the bus stop across the road from my house. New poster day, interesting. On the other side of the two-sided poster wall: Red Faction Armageddon. "A new one? WOW!!!" I thought to myself.\n\nA year or two later, I get this game on Xbox. Yeah, bit slow, but I wasn't exactly rich. Anyway, play through it, and I'm like "but, where are all my destructions and my booms and my bangs and whats this annoying ♥♥♥♥ on my arm that keeps telling me what to do?"\n\nSo things I liked about this game:\n- You can repair ♥♥♥♥. This would have been great in the previous game, because I lost a few missions because a ladder I had to climb broke. EDIT: Thanks to abedsbrother for informing me of the repair function in RFG. Still a pro on RFA because thats where it was first introduced.\n- You get this super cool futuristic nano-gauntlet that can blast walls to kingdom come at the touch of a button (Mjolnir, you have been replaced). When fully upgraded, you can zap bugs into the air, launch ♥♥♥♥ for miles, activate a shield around you, and go Rambo- I mean Beserk.\n- DUAL WIELDED HAND CANNONS\n\nThings I hated about this game\n- Theres less ♥♥♥♥ to destroy. Like literally, cmon man I wanted to see a giant ♥♥♥♥ing tower fall and destroy half of the town, not walk around some ♥♥♥♥ing pitch black cave that sucks balls.\n- The world is no longer open. This legit means you are walking in one path. Constantly following the story. No fun to be had because no fun allowed. Zero replay value.\n- DLC DLC DLC DLC DLC DLC DLC DLC DLC[/stike] Well at least they aren't Payday 2 but if they wanted to revive the franchise, remake this game only make it a ♥♥♥♥ing open world dip♥♥♥♥♥.","June 1, 2015","false","25.9"," 63 of 107 people (59%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","59","63","107","13","9"

Red Faction Guerilla was one of my favorite open world sandbox "GTA style" game, and that's saying alot, since there's only a handful of those games I find most of them boring and repetitive. Admittedly, even I was eventually bored by the RFG singleplayer over time simply because that genre does that to me. What Armageddon does is basically take all the good parts of RFG, but turn it into a bog standard, linear corridor third person shooter. Remeber destroying damn near every object to gather salvage? Don't bother with that here, as salvage is only found via pickups and exploding barrels, essentially discouraging environmental destruction because you need it for cover (and using the repair mechanic, while pretty nifty, seems a tad inefficient when it's destroyed as soon as you rebuild it) and encouraging the typical "blow up the red barrels" trope that has existed since Doom.\n\nSome how, Red Faction: Armageddo makes environmental destruction boring. How can that be possible? The sound assets feel lifeless - you don't hear buildings creaking as much when you destroyed most of its support, guns don't have any "oomph" to their sound feedback, destruction, especially with weapons that disintegrate objects is so quick that they feel more like magical or technical teleportation spells than actual explosions and deconstruction. Despite the quality of the game assets, the game just has no character, even down to the typical  "soldier needs to save the day plot". I messed around with the Free Mode, which gave me access to what I assume is end game weaponry, and even those weapons, such as the Plasma Beam, Rocket Launcher, and SINGULARITY CANNON had barely mild entertainment value at best - the gunplay is absolutely boring and is puzzling, as it was so good in RFG that I loved playing the multiplayer for the gunplay (I actually used the guns more than the Sledgehammer or backpacks, which brings me to another point that there aren't any backpacks!). Even the assault rifle feels weak, damn near useless, and not competent with head shots (my bullets always miss the dot on the crosshair, and it still takes like 5 headshots to kill a standard grunt)\n\nThere's a multiplayer horde mode that looks ok, but practically nobody is playing this game any more and there's plenty of co-op shooters to play on PC. Thankfully, I got this through a bundle so I think I only technically paid less than $1 for this. I can't honestly recommend this, unless you played all the other good 3rd person shooters to death and just want something else to play, or you like run-of-the mill modern, third person shooters and would like to play one with a slightly interesting destruction/repait mechanic. Everybody else should not bother.","December 28, 2013","false","1.3"," 55 of 93 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","55","93","0","3"

However, the game does still have some interesting level design, once you get out of the first couple of levels.\n\nThe story was actually better than expected.  darius and Kara were the only characters i really cared about, and thats fine because they were highlighted more than others anyway.  I did find myself using many weapons throughout the game, and not so much just the sledgehammer like i did in RFG.  In this game the weapons seemed to be more balanced, and considering there is more z-axis fighting, you might need some long range weaponry to aid you here.  Sorry, no jet pack like in RFG.\n\nAll in all a solid game, worth a run through, and the co-op is pretty decent too.  The DLC was pretty forgettable though.  Felt like levels that were cut from the basr game and reinstalled as DLC.  Plus, the first DLC level in the canyon just kept going forever.\n\nBase Game; 7.0/10\nDLC 3.5/10","October 13, 2014","true","48.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

It is a great idea that seems very underutilized given it only has a handful of maps. The previous Red Faction game had the same mode but it was much more fleshed out in its execution so this was a bit of a disappointment.\n\nThe game has a lot of enemy variation but it certainly doesn't feel that way. For most of the game you will be fighting the same 3 types of enemies over and over again.\n\nMain campaign will take around 6 hours to complete\n\nThe DLC is decent but also very short. The levels are not as well designed as the main campaign.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The story is decent if a bit simple in its premise, it doesn't feel as developed as it should and serves more as an excuse to kill hordes of enemies. Given the location and history of Red Faction it seems like wasted potential.\n\n- Multiplayer achievements which are now almost impossible to obtain.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nI can't recall another series that has had more changes each entry than Red Faction. The first game was a linear first person shooter similar to half life. The second was a level based first person shooter with bosses. The third was an open world third person shooter. This game is a linear level based third person shooter with upgrades. At this rate its only a matter of time before we see Red Faction the real time strategy game. This is a good game but plays it entirely safe with its gameplay and design. The potential is here for something special but never achieves it.\n","October 27, 2015","true","16.7"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

Most levels also have a very good atmospheric feeling.\n\nThe gameplay is very solid, you have bunch of very different weapons at your disposal (the magnet gun, you never grow tired of that:), plus the distruction mechanics (i think is the best i've seen in a game so far) really let you solve the various challenges you have to face with different approaches, also boosting replay value. Also a nice character progression is implemeted and you may upgrade Darius' gear and abilities proceding in the game.\n\nOn the technical side graphics are very good, in particular the explosion looks gorgeous, and the performance were fine. I've not expereinced any glitch, bug or crash (but other rewiers instead did).\n\nOnce you finish the story you have a story+ option that let you replay it with all your upgrades and special weapons (ever dreamed of disintegrating your enemy with a rainbow ray coming out from a pony's ♥♥♥? I didnt but whatever) unlocked from the start.\nThere are also a singleplayer destruction mode that can be a lot of fun and a very good multiplayer coop survival mode (even if recently might be hard to find players online).\n\nConclusion: I really enjoyed this game (completed the main story 2 times and i'll probably come back for more sooner or later) and i surely raccomend it to anyone which is interested in pleasant, linear, story-driven shooter experience.\n\nUseless comparison with Guerrilla (if you are not interested in sterile debates or stupid comparison skip this section)\nComparing Armageddon and Guerrilla really dont makes much sense, one is a story driven linear shooter while the second is an open world TPS (you have to free a bunch of outpost, assault a bunch of convoys etc.. when you are done move to the next sector and start again)... i played both and i would surely choose Armageddon over guerrilla... but that really depends on your personal tastes.","December 4, 2014","true","35.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","4"

Dull\n\nLinear, boring, cliched and utterly dissapointing are the words which jump to mind. This FPS action title is the follow up to the hugely successful Red Faction: Guerilla, the open world masterpiece. Sadly, someone sitting in the finance department must have decided that the strings needed tightening and that they should pursue an on rails FPS, and everything went ♥♥♥♥ up from there sadly.\n\nThere should be a strong story here, which follows the Red Faction universe, but instead theres a shadow of a story and a ton of bugs. There should be a ton of destruction and some great hammer battles, but instead theres a limited field of a play to smash up and then little to no reason to whip out the hammer.\n\nSo the key question.. is this even worth purchasing? Honestly, the campaign is quite long and it's not the most awful game I've ever played, maybe.

The game is played in third-person, both as a single player campaign and in multiplayer mode. The story revolves around Terraforming operations on Mars and hostile Martian creatures who attack your Terraformer. The environment is destructible which is a departure from a lot of shooter-type games, and makes Red Faction particularly fun to play. Visually speaking, Red Faction: Armageddon seems pretty average for a shooter, though it was released in 2011. The story doesn't seem all that deep, but you do get to blow stuff up and rampage out, so I suppose like a hollywood movie, if you can't win them over with story, just add explosions.

I'll try not to compare, as Armageddon is a game in its own right of course, but it is, however, part of the Red Faction franchise... so I'm going to compare anyway.\n\nTo start: why? I'm utterly amazed by design decisions that went into this game. RF Guerrilla is an open world, near sand box-destruction, action-shooter. Completing RF Guerrilla, I thought "Wow. Great game. The next'll be even better! It'll be in a dense, grimy, overpopulated martian city! Yeah! I'm going to be able to bring entire sky-scrapers to the ground!". Nope.\n\nGEOMOD 2.0\nOf course, the destruction engine is fantastic. Any better than Guerrilla? Collapsing structures have an effect on camera, and deal varying degrees of damage to enemies and you, according to their size/weight. This aspect I feel has improved from RFG as there feels like a real weight hangs behind each structure and destroying one is both a satisfying and almost awesome experience. Why almost? Well, I've seen it. Done it in RFG; this game makes no attempt to scale up from its predecessor, and if you havn't played RFG, then destroying small structures that are verticaly impared, (Of course they're going to be; The game's set underground), will get pretty old, very quickly. That's another thing; the game's setting just doesn't allow for the exploitation of this franchise's destruction engine! I mean, what good is blowing up stuff if you can't see more than 3 meters ahead of you!! The game doesn't even allow you to manually activate your flashlight! Overall, this destruction engine is just wasted, and it's easily the best feature of the game.\n\nNARRATIVE\nBah I havn't even completed it. Honestly, I got bored. That might speak volumes to you, about the game, or about me in fact, eitherway, I washed my hands of the story instantly. It's good in short bursts; I've been on and off the game, but I'm in no way hooked. It's the destruction engine that keeps me playing the game.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nYour standard 3rd-person perspective; the camera is of good distance from the character and worked well without any issues.\nGood god- Agile bullet-bags! All of them! Small arms weapons, such as your pistols, assault rifle, shotgun, are all just a bit...meh. There's no stopping power behind them, and that's hugely unsattisfying. Enemies dart around, in and out of sight, usualy never bieng able to hit you or, for that matter, doing any real damage. They feel merely time consuming and tedious, for the most part, thanks to frantic AI and pea-shooters for weapons. This isn't the case for all weapons however..."AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY, GOD CREATED THE MAGNET GUN". Truly, there has never been a more fantastic, utterly enjoyable, gun in gaming history. Got a big fella getting all up in your grill? That's ok; Bring down the very building that he stands in, on top of him! Attatching a...err...clamping node first to whatever you desire, you may then fire off an attractive node somewhere adjacent to the clamping node; the clamping node, and the wall/enemy/debris to which it was attached, will be violently accelerated accross the map towards the attractive node. Chaos, death, destruction, follows. Wonderful!\nAs I've said before, the game features primarily underground sections-this makes the game a bit dull, in terms of locations and scenery, and does not aid the linear gameplay at all, as I found myself quickly bored by the overall atmosphere of the game. The game has Exo suits that you can hop into. They're barely worth a mention; yes you're unstoppable, and a badass, but that gets boring when you're an unkillable, unstoppable, badass. Bieng unkillable, actually, I consider, is the opposite of bieng badass; What's the point of it all?! I played on normal, the reccomended setting, and this game has yet to challenge me. Enemies just feel like a tedious filler, much like all the scenic walks through the game's martian underground.\n\nHave I mentioned that the game is increadibly linear? Oh. Yes. Ah.\n\nPerhaps they were going for a more...atmospheric and cholsterphobic Red Faction game...If that is the case, they do not focus on the darker elements of the game enough; the main protagonist wipes out any trace of grit about the plot immidiately, enemies are not to be taken seriously- they are mere insects to you, only to be crushed completely and utterly with ease. With this game's setting, it could have been a horror; the enemies look terryfying enough and there's plenty of corpses strewn about. The lighting is dark and moody, and yet, these features were never focused upon; the game does nothing in the way of building any tension. Yes, this isn't the Red Faction I wanted, but this concept... It's not done well, in many of the aspects the game claims to be about.\n\nTo round up, (Well done for reading this far), I'd like to say that this game is a setback for the Red Faction franchise; the design decisions that are present baffle me, in comparison to Red Faction: Guerrilla, and in some cases just downright backwards. The game's predecessor aside, Armageddon itself is just boring, samey, and needlessly restricted in many aspects. The engine's destruction is good, fantastic, in fact, but that's all I've really got out of this game. Without Geomod 2.0, the following rating would have been far worse.\n\n5/10. Worth a 90% off, for the somewhat restricted spectical of the Geomod 2.0 engine, but otherwise, buy Red Faction: Guerrilla.\n\n","August 3, 2014","false","6.7"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Graklinghunter/recommended/55110/","Graklinghunter","GraklingHunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Graklinghunter/","190 products in account","An intriguing third-person-shooter take on the traditional 'Mars settlers encounter alien lifeforms' genre. The story takes obvious cues from similar settings, but what the story lacks, the game makes up with amusing and interesting gameplay\n\nStory Pros:\n- The main character is easy to understand and grasp his personality.\n- The importance of the previous games in the series is minimal; what you need to know to understand the story is all contained in dialog etc., so you won't feel lost if you haven't played the previous games.\n- The main character is able to communicate important details of what's going on without directly talking to the player, thanks to his dialog with his "S.A.M." AI on his wrist.\n- The comraderie of the main character and a number of his acquiantances makes it easy to enjoy dialog, instead of it feeling like dead-pan exhibition.\n\nStory Cons:\n- Due to the importance of your character's past, you cannot customize your character at all visually.\n- The S.A.M. AI on the character's wrist is near omnipotent at times, like finding routes for you through completely uncharted caves, yet other times seems completely oblivious to certain details.\n- The story will frequently, intentionally mislead you through certain portions of the story, often through the AI either not providing all the details, remaining silent, etc. This tends to create a feeling of Deus Ex Machina when the Story says you can do X thing to fix the situation, long after you should reasonably have been told, or even after it made it seem like that thing was impossible (No spoilers, but the ending definitely reeks of this)\n- There are a number of cuts the story takes through Cutscenes. The cutscenes themselves are actually quite nice, however, there are a number of occasions where the game will painstakingly walk you through every detail of a particular scenario, and the abruptly move you to the next chapter with no details of what happened in between (I.E. cutscene shows you loading up on a truck with your buddy, talking about where they're going, and then it immediately goes to another cutscene where you've been at that location for some time and are already talking about heading out again.)\n\nGameplay Pros:\n- Physics & Destructible terrain are immensely enjoyable. This is seriously the best thing about the game. As you progress, you get a number of unique weapons and skills that will wreak havoc on your surroundings. And once you've had your fill of destroying buildings and sending your enemies flying, your AI can use a 'Nano forge' to repair things like bridges, so you need not worry about accidentally destroying your path to the next objective.\n- There is never any time where the game takes away your progression through the skill tree, nor any of your weapons. Once it's unlocked, you can expect it to be available for the rest of the game.\n\nGameplay Cons:\n- Objectives aren't always clear as to how you should get where you are going, unless you use the 'Compass' tool which projects the direction to your goal onto the terrain around you. There's no middle ground between, "I'm lost" and Handholdiong from the game. I would have liked more well-designed levels that make it a little easier to find where you are going without asking for an explicit map.\n- Gameplay time is fairly short. Two full playthroughs took me just under 12 hours.\n\nVisuals:\n- Textures are magnificent. The developers knew what they were dealing with, and didn't leave anything blurry or pixelated.\n- Meshes are a little angular at times, but instead of looking odd, they made sure to make the artistic style incorporate angles as seeming intentional (i.e. crystals on the walls, angular architecture, and spiky enemies)\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend the game simply because of how enjoyable it is to be able to destroy the large majority of your surroundings. It makes you feel in control, and powerful.\n\nIt's definitely not a legendary game like Half-Life 2 or Portal, but it's a good 6 or 7 out of 10. Definitely worth a shot if you see it go on sale.","April 24","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Red Faction has been made of one of my favourite game developers when I was a kid; THQ.\n\nWhen I first time played the game I was already starting at the battlefield to hunt down some rebels. In the game you can carry up to four weapons max. The game starts with two weapons: a Maul, an assault rifle and you can find more weapons in the same level as well. At the first mission you will also have a hand that could repair the damaged objects in the environment, but the hand can only repair in a close distance between you and the damaged objects in your surroundings. In the game you can purchase upgrades with the salvages that you can find somewhere around in the game.\n\nThe game takes place in the peaceful Mars. The peace there was threatened, because of the rebels who wanted to avange the loss of their boss. His family was killed by an important person of the military. This turned out a war with the military and the rebels. And there was also an another problem: at a mysterious wise turned out: that there were Aliens in a underground cave.\n\nMy impressions of the game.\n\nThe game looks in my opinion a bit like one of the games that was made by THQ, meet the Robinsons on the Wii. I came to that impression by one of the boss fights with Adam Hale and in the Robinsons Mega-Doris.\n\nPros and Cons of the game.\n\nPros:\n\n-	The graphics of the game is modern\n-	The gameplay is so amazing, that you most of the times can forget how late it is\n-	Lots of varieties in weapons\n-	The hand repair function is amazing to use\n\nCons:\n-	The game looks a little bit like meet the Robinsons on the Wii\n-	The game needs more varieties in Aliens\n-	You’ll sometimes die randomly\n\nI'd say buy this game only if it is in a sale for a nice price.\n\n\nReceived a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

It has performed rather poorly in sales and it's easy to see why.\n\nThere is no more revolution or fight against oppression (which would mean human opponents), in it's stead - bug-like aliens take place. It reminds me of Alien Swarm or Alien Breed but with a much higher level of quality and that AAA feel to it. It's a rather decent game with the physics and destruction being improved, some very nice weapons and fairly challenging difficulty.\n\nThe storyline isn't bad. In fact it's much better then any of the new blockbusters.\nA special place holds the music in my mind, it's not only a new style for the franchise, but a very well made artistic move that revolves around a more claustraphobic environement - like the first Red Faction and second Red Faction games to a degree.\n\nI also can't help but regret that the socialistic revolution theme was somewhat left aside.\n\n\nIt feels as if the identity on first glance changed, leaving nothing but the destruction aspect as a standing-out feature. In the end THQ went bankrupt and Nordic games took it's place releasing a little bit of content for free. Thank you Nordic Games!\nThe style is much too different.

I thankfully didn't (in a fashion), having gotten it as part of a THQ humble bundle (which I bought for Saints Row The Third), and so my rage at this game was far less than it would have been had I spent my cash on it. So what's wrong with it? It's a horrible sequel for one. Where Guerilla was a open world Sandbox that let you wreck tons of stuff as you pleased, this game is completely linear with basically no freedom of action. Guerilla didn't have an especially strong story, but the one here is even worse, with almost no likeable characters (especially not the main character you play as) and one of the few I did sorta like getting abruptly killed off late in the game. The gameplay is fine, but the other factors here helped to ruin the game for me. Also it's extremely short (Yes I beat the game with those hours played).\n\nIf you like Guerilla, just stick with that and pretend this game does not exist. Trust me.

Combat in this half is half projectile based, half physics based, meaning that you can use a special gun to literally rip a ceiling down (Including hundreds of uniquely modeled debris with it) on top of an alien then blast them to pieces while they're pinned with the assault rifle. Like wise you can launch enemies through walls, ceilings, blast the floor out from under them, etc. Very entertaining combat system with a huge and destructive arsenal, polished performance for a Volition game on PC, and large campaign and suite of multiplayer options means that whenever this goes on sale it's worthy of your attention.","August 31, 2012","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, this game is still great fun and I thoroughly enjoyed playing through it. I bought the game on sale for $7.50 so perhaps that's why I'm not as critical when it comes to reviewing it. As someone who has little time and a lot of stress, this game provided me with an outlet to destress and I loved every minute of it. Sure, the sandbox is gone, but the destruction and carnage are still there. Nothing brought me more joy than bringing down an infected building with cool and creative weapons, or blasting through enemies with badass vehicles.\n\nAs an RF fan, I enjoyed the small touches they placed here and there to build upon the lore. Little things references to the RF history I thought were pretty cool and even how the Terraformer had the EDF symbols on it still were a nice touch.\n\nIs the game a setback from Guerrilla? Yes, but not a huge one. It's definitely worth a playthrough, at least during a flash sale. It's great, mindless fun and decently long. The enemies, while perhaps a cross between the Flood and Necomorphs, are entertaining to cut down and you learn a good deal about the RF world in the process.","November 2, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its story feels a little out of place in the universe and I'm not sure its action will challenge veteran shooter fans, but the game is genuinely fun and engaging.

For fans of the Red Faction series, do not buy this game. It will shatter any love you have for the franchise because of its interactive environments, diverse enemies, and deep storyline, because this game has none of those. It is easy to see why, with the incarnation of this game, that the Red Faction series is no more. If you don't understand what I just said, Red Faction is dead, and Armageddon killed it.\n\nOn the other hand, if you take the game for what it is, and ignore the Red Faction stamp at the beginning of the game, stand alone this is a good game. Not game of the year material, or "OMG do you remember that game we played 5 years ago?", but still a fun experience. Best part about it by far is the magnet gun, you can have hours of fun tethering two enemies together to their death. The story is decent, graphics are good, and you even get a few mech moments.

For fans of the Red Faction series, do not buy this game. It will shatter any love you have for the franchise because of its interactive environments, diverse enemies, and deep storyline, because this game has none of those. It is easy to see why, with the incarnation of this game, that the Red Faction series is no more. If you don't understand what I just said, Red Faction is dead, and Armageddon killed it.\n\nOn the other hand, if you take the game for what it is, and ignore the Red Faction stamp at the beginning of the game, stand alone this is a good game. Not game of the year material, or "OMG do you remember that game we played 5 years ago?", but still a fun experience. Best part about it by far is the magnet gun, you can have hours of fun tethering two enemies together to their death. The story is decent, graphics are good, and you even get a few mech moments.

But it's still a good game.\n\nYou play as Darius Mason, the grandson of Alec Mason from Guerilla. Set fifty years after Guerilla, the premise is that the Cultists and their leader, Adam Hale take control of the terraformer, the machine which supplies Mars with its sustainable atmosphere. Darius, working with Red Faction forces, try to assault the terraformer and take back control. Ultimately, the Cultists end up destroying the terraformer and some time later, Darius is a contractor taking on drilling jobs in the underground. Things go awry when, on a certain drilling job he takes on, he awakens an infestation. Turns out he was set up and now he has to save the planet and bring order back to civilization. Along with some help.\n\nThe unique mechanic in this game is the nano energy and SAM. SAM is like Cortana, but not as emotional. She helps you decrypt things, unlock doors, give you power ups, etc. The nano energy is cool, like the repair mechanism so that you can rebuild bridges you need to cross over canyons or lava flows.\n\nThe enemies include both the Cultists and the infestation of bugs. The bugs were a dormant species living on Mars that Adam Hale had tricked Mason into waking. They're kind of what you'd expect, and more. They vary in size from flying little things that annoy you, to walking fiends that fire lasers at you. And giant behemoths that charge and shoot green gases at you. And tentacles that pummel you. Basically, there are plenty of enemies and you'll never be bored fighting them.\n\nMost of the game takes place in the underground, and I think the devs really nailed Mars' undreground. Mars seems like the place where the underground would be vast and large with flowing lava in various places. But also gloomy and dreadful because life on Mars means being in constant fear of death from seperate factions or unknown species. Especially underground where there are unexplored territories and systems that may have been abandoned long ago. It's really interesting to think about, honestly. You don't see much topside beside the opening mission and maybe two or three more bits, but over 90% of the game is underground.\n\nEverything else is nice too, graphics, sound design/mixing. Rarely any bugs. Music is a bit overkill with the guitars. I would have liked something more electronic to fit the mood of sci-fi action. Or at least more orchestral. But the guitars and drums didn't do it for me.\n\nAnyway. The game's plot started iffy for me, but I grew into it and ended up really liking it. Also, start a new game plus after you beat it for the possibly the greatest weapon out there, Mr. Toots: a mini-unicorn you carry that shoots rainbow plasma from its booty.\n\n8.5/10","August 2, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wasn't really looking for much more than what I got - interesting, utterly destructible environments, good graphics that ran smoothly, big booms and crashes and lots of enemies that presented a hazard but also went splat rather nicely. The story isn't all that bad either, even if it takes a back seat to the action, and of course it doesn't pay much attention to the Red Faction storyline of the first or third games but who gives a crap?

The single player campaign is pretty long and satisfying. Enjoyed most of the game like around 95% .Few part had too much enemies lol but it was fun dying at different places :P . The best part that i literally enjoyed was reconstruction. Since most the structures, actually almost everything, in the game is destructible hence it can be rebuilt too :3 too much fun. I dont care of the graphics but still for the sake of review just a comment 'pretty good'.\n\nThe bosses are pretty damn easy too kill(once you know where to attack), not VERY EASYYY but yes you wont die (max maybe once but not more than that). Lots of weapons but cannot carry then all well you get a lot of opportunities in the levels to change them according to your style. A hand full of upgrades but make sure you look out for nanites(the currency ingame to buy upgrades). They are spread out in almost every corner of the level even at places you dont neeed to visit. (just for sharing i - I was able to unlock around 85% of upgrades)\n\nThe one weapon which has a unique twist to it is the MAGNET GUN. Most guns would shoot, launch grenades or rockets or even vapourising beams but NO this gun?! well it shoots magnets powerful enough to destroy a whole building. The uniqueness isnt in this though, the uniquness lies in the fact that you can actually throw an aliens at stuff around you. And if not that you can go entirely opposite of it, throw stuff at the alien with it (everything else you'll get to know ingame not gonna spoil it all :P )\n\nOnce you finish the game you have 'NEW GAME +' too, just like most other games now-a-days. Also you have a few rewards once you complete the game which you get to use in 'NEW GAME +' mode ^_^\n\nI highly recommend this game to those who are die hard shooting fans and of destruction.\n\nALL IN ALL I HAD A PRETTY GOOD TIME PLAYING THIS.

Stripping the open world in favour of a tight, linear structure turned a lot of people of to this game as did the focus on fighting alien bugs rather than a human threat. If you can play beyond the first third of the game however up to when you get back to the surface of Mars  the game does open up a little into more open canyons with some great vehicular destruction.\nThe game features the meatiest story in the series and follows directly on from the SyFy movie Red Faction origins with you playing another decendant in the Mason family responsible for allowing the Martian atmosphere processor to be destroyed by Cultists and in turn letting lose a whole nest of alien creatures from underground. The story ties back into the previous games and playing them first would be benifical.\nWeapons are inventive and forceful and are fun to use, especially the mechs and tanks and their respective missions.\nVisuals have gotten better from the last game and there is still destruction of buildings but this time you can bring anything back with the new Nano rebuilder to recreate destroyed stair ways etc so you are not stuck trying to climb the geometry to make progress after a fire fight which was a problem in guerilla.\nThe only problem is the Aliens are used a lot and are thrown against you overwhelmingly at some points so it can get a little repetative fighting them again and again.\nOverall if you're coming back here for more of Guerilla you will be dissapointed but if you enjoyed the first game's structure or like linear shooters in general theres fun to be had here.\n\n7.5/10","December 21, 2014","true","11.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also it’s not a bad looker either.\n\nIt might not be the best game it is worth every penny and when on sale it is a MUST BUY.\n\nHave fun ^_^","October 11, 2012","true","47.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/recommended/55110/","RJtheShadow","il Duderoni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/","537 products in account","Big part of the people who are interested in this game, are going to want it because of Red Faction: Guerilla. So I'll be adjusting my recommendation with that in context.\n\nAs comparisons go, the first one is as simple as this: The story is now lineair and you are no longer in a free-roaming world. With that, means that the walls surrounding your path are unbreakable. However, this doesn't mean that desctruction is very absent.\n\nOn the contrary, destruction and debris play a much bigger role than they did in Guerilla. In said game, your sledgehammer served for nothing to break down buildings, maybe kill those inside.\n\nIn Armageddon, debris is a potential weapon. The Magnet gun is the tool of the trade now. It's functioning is two-staged: You attach/shoot first what you want moved, then attach the second magnet to where you want it to go. This can be structure parts, pickups or even enemies (all but the biggest Behemoth).\n\nThis makes for some fun and unique gameplay. And while the tool is powerful and relatively fast, you'll still be needing some firearms. Because the Alien swarm is fast and massive.\n\nBesides that, the weapons array is pretty much classic. Shotguns, Assault/Sniper rifles and two sets of dual pistols. The Sniper rifle does feature a heat-mode that allows you to see and headshot through surfaces, which is the only reason the sniper is not obsolete, as vantage points are nigh unexistant.\n\nI won't spoil the story because... it's not that extraordinary. Saying anything about it may as well spoil it all. It's classic, a little bit cheesy but not too annoying.\n\nS.A.M. however, that's a new box of toys. S.A.M. is your wrist-mounted A.I. that serves a guiding purpose in the story, and a more practical one in combat. You start out with a repair functionality. Anything destroyed can be repaired by the nano-forge that is built in.\n\nWhich means, you now have a new renewable weapon in debris, as well as a renewable cover source. Too bad there's no cover mechanic. Just crouching, and that's it.\n\nThe Impact skill basically serves as a short-range air bash that pushes back any debris in it's path. Of course, this makes the sledgehammer pretty obsolete. (which can now be swapped out)\nIt also makes for a nice punching weapon, though eventually you'll want to power it up with upgrades.\n\nBesides that, you have three classical 'extra' skills you can get through the upgrade station. Berserk ups your damage and fire speed, Shockwave (that I didn't even bother to try) is a typical Nova ability, and the Shell works as a projectile shield (great for when you're almost dead) and DoT for enemies that are inside of it.\n\nAs per enemies go... it's a good thing your toys are more destructive rather than precision based. AFAIK 25% of the enemies you encounter are human. And they tend to be pushovers, even at Hard difficulty.\n\nThe real threat are the Alien creatures. They all come in several ranks, and tend to just swarm you late-game, with the low-rank creatures coming in masses and tending to be very melee based.\n\nBut, even on Hard mode, the only real threats are the Berserkers are the Behemoths. Berserkers are quite tough and are hard hitting on both ranged and melee. But they can just be punted around with the magnet gun and melee'd to death once you've taken care of the other critters.\n\nBehemoths, when not encountered while in a vehicle, tend to be mini-boss fights. The area is locked off and you need to use your weapons or available debris to kill them. They're real bullet spunges and hit pretty hard in ranged and melee.\nAnd they can't be punted around.\n\nWhile in a vehicle, they are the only types of enemies that really pose a threat if not paid any attention to.\nEventually though, you'll find a gimmick that works for you and they just become a nuisance. Much like the other aliens, really.\n\nThis is a game with a gimmick that plays it very, very well. But sadly, it can't lean on it to justify a full price. Maybe if it had been free-roaming. But regardless, the game is not something you should avoid simply because of that.","June 15, 2013","true","11.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/concordance/recommended/55110/","concordance","emb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/concordance/","232 products in account","This game feels like it was made by talented developers following a checklist, with no regard to how the game will be received and whether the end result will be any fun. They were told to make another entry in the Red Faction franchise, so they did, got paid and moved on. I'll skip ahead and say that this game really should not exist, and it's not fun after 3-4 hours in.\n\nThe game's campaign is roughly 10 hours long, even on the highest difficulty. Most of the game is spent fighting the same 3-4 enemy types in same-looking caves. The protagonist has a ton of health and regenerates quickly, the enemies are mostly armed with peashooters, and fighting them is about as difficult as playing a cow clicker game. Most of the environment is so generic and forgettable, I couldn't recall most of the game even immediately after I finished it.\n\nThe destruction engine the Red Faction series is known for is there, but roughly two thirds of the environment are indestructible. Regardless, wrecking the destructible parts of the environment while enemies are in/on top of it is virtually the only fun aspect in the game.\n\nLiterally every level in the game is at least twice as long as it should be, dragging on so much that I had to take breaks to do something else in order to stay awake. You would think that destroying the environment inside a walker mech armed with infinite missiles never gets old, but it does - every single vehicle scene repeats at least twice, involves no challenge and no risk of dying, and consists of mashing mouse1 for 10 or more minutes.\n\nWhile you can technically have fun in the game if you play it in short bursts and don't treat it seriously, the final 3 levels are disgustingly bad and *will* make you hate it. It feels like THQ told Volition the game should be at least 10 hours long, and they struggled to add enough filler to hit the 10 hour mark.\n\nThere is a reason this game sold so poorly that THQ decided to terminate the Red Facton franchise.

And some of the soundtrack (and general sound design) has some incredibly high pitched instrumentals and overall loud volume.

I gave it at least 3 separate tries and on each occasion I felt dumber and dumber playing it. The game had huge and bland lifeless environments similar to Far Cry 2 canyon-like map only with no vegetation. The Martian physics were also something that I just couldn't get used to; the game introduced the seemingly unnecessary destruction of everything even of civilian buildings; there was the un-tactical running and shooting gameplay even though there were some guerrilla type raids involved; ultimately most missions turned into run and shoot mess.\n\nI had slight hopes for this game because I was hoping that the linear single player story would at least be something to enjoy.\n\nWell, as for gameplay, this is a regular run'n'shoot BUT have-the-ability-to-destroy-everything game. There is no cover to speak of, and there's no ability to take cover and for a good reason - everything goes. That is, taking cover behind a wall will result in the wall being destroyed so you would attempt to kill the enemy before he or it kills you after blowing your cover, literally. There is no real tactical movement required - just keep on shooting and moving and you will most likely win.\n\nAs you descend deeper into the Martian caves you will encounter aliens. For the most part you are going to be battling angry insectoids, small roaches, giant roaches and some other disgusting creatures including huge mean looking worms. There's some suspense to have as you go deeper and deeper into caves and the CGI cut scenes are pretty cool however, this suspense is quickly dispensed by hordes of insects swarming you from every direction throughout the game. From that point on, the game pretty much becomes a giant insect fest comprised of killing as many bugs using different weapons as well as the environment before they get you. I think I've seen this somewhere, dare I say Lost Planet 2? Only that game had co-op.\n\nBesides, for some reason, you will constantly encounter the ammo for your guns even in the deepest caves where no man has set foot. You will never run out of ammo because the ammo caches are spread out in almost every direction.\n\nThe portable computer system that you have, SAM, is reminiscent of the Dead Space navigation pointer, except this time, SAM has a voice and it tells you what to do constantly. You don't really have to think or wander around caves because the SAM guiding system will tell you where to go. The game practically plays by itself.\n\nThe weapons are okay. We have the usual guns as well as magnet gun that connects point A and B- this gives you the opportunity to hurl objects from point A at enemies that are located at point B. You can also destroy entire multiple story buildings and constructions with one placed shot.\n\nThe graphics are great, the DX 11 and all. The water looks okay and for the most part the environments are well detailed. The aliens are sometimes revolting to look at too.\n\nYou do have the ability to break through walls as well as re-construct virtually every man made structure via your molecular reconstructor or whatever, which is neat, but extremely unrealistic. So, in the end you end up with great looking engine that actually lets you destroy just about everything but at the same time lets you fix pretty much everything. Take that for what it's worth. There are also some weapon and skill upgrades you can buy with your easily earned credits.\n\nI guess the biggest disappointment is the gameplay. You just want to keep running and shooting without looking back. Or you DO look back only to shoot up some chasing insectoids while keeping on running.\n\nThere are no invisible walls in the game but some battles requires you to stay within a set sector without having the ability to retreat. Thus you are given 10 seconds to get back into battle...\n\nThe game is also extremely easy, even on Hard. The health regenerates within a few seconds. The game itself runs smoothly though and the controls for your character are fluid. You will be able to move fast and avoid being hit.\n\nAll in all, buy the game at bargain.","November 27, 2013","true","5.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zwagoth/recommended/55110/","Zwagoth","Zwagoth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zwagoth/","239 products in account","Warning, this review may contain spoilers. I wasn't paying close enough attention to the story to tell you if any of the events were foreshadowed or not. Read at your own risk, since I'm not recommending the game, I don't think you're missing much by seeing some of the minor plot points.\n\nIt's hard to write an in depth review about this game because it does so little that is new or unique. This is essentially a by the numbers over the shoulder shooter and will fail to keep the attention of those who don't find the "story" interesting or capturing, but few are going to be really captivated by it.\n\nThe games gimmick is that you can destroy areas of the world and rebuild them again using some magical nano builder gizmo that apparently only you possess. I wasn't paying close enough attention to the story to figure out if they ever explained why you're the only one with one of these tools. While it sounds interesting on the surface, the destruction tends to feel unsatisfying after the first few times. Most of the time when you are actually noticing the destruction physics going on around you, it is because an enemy with an explosive ability has destroyed the area you were standing on and then you get to rebuild it later once you've defeated them.\n\nEnemy variety is fairly limited, and the environments while pretty, are fairly boring to look at and consist mostly of being in tight corridors or in an enclosed outdoor space. Very rarely is there ever any wide open areas. You get your basic trash enemies that you spam the melee key to get rid of, the typical flies around and is annoying but not really dangerous enemies, and then the takes a bunch of ammo to kill enemies that have more powerful attacks. It doesn't get any more complex than that. Some of the enemy designs blend in quite nicely with the environment, and while they tried to add special effects to make them stand out, they were sometimes unsuccessful to make them visually distinct from what they are attached to.\n\nMason has to be one of the dumbest and unluckiest protagonists I've seen in a video game. He's repeatedly tricked, knocked out, and captured, and he repeatedly runs into situations without a plan, without backup, and without thinking things through, often cutting off the recommendations of his personal assistant computer which is trying to give him good advice. It's hard to feel sorry for him and hard to feel connected with him or his plight, which seems to be mostly self inflicted. If anyone on the entire planet of Mars had a few brain cells they could have probably resolved the entire story of the game within 3 days of the introduction.\n\nThe primary mission objectives are to destroy something, fix something, run around in mazes killing enemies, kill all the enemies, and escort vehicles through heavily scripted events. Most of it is in the guise of him being a good guy and helping out, but a lot of it just feels tedious and forced, just padding out gameplay length. The whole game can be rushed through in about 6 hours if you feel like it, and it isn't terribly hard even on some of the higher difficulty levels. Difficulty curve is fairly flat other than an occasional spike and a hard upwards curve at the end of the game where they throw everything they have at you.\n\nMost of the weapons feel unrewarding to use and enemies act like bullet sponges until you begin upgrading. The weapon variety is decent, offering you some fun toys to play with, but you'll likely pick the weapons you like in the first half of the game and never venture out into the newer heavy weapons that the game gives you. Ammo for the heavy weapons tends to feel as though they are giving you very little of it, or way too much of it, depending on the situation. You'll need to keep some of the standbys with you anyways because while the game lets you choose any four weapons, you don't want four heavy weapons. The fire rate is too low and the ammo too limited.\n\nThere are some fun mech segments in the game, and the unlimited ammo gets put to good use, but it makes you part with the suits too quickly for that high powered, bullets actually kill things feeling to last. Generally you're walking around at a modest pace, and going from place to place takes time, often more than I'd have liked, giving the game a plodding feeling to it. There is a sprint mechanic, but it doesn't last very long and has a moderate recharge time before it can be used again, leading me to believe it is more for panic events than travel. The dodge mechanic feels slightly clunky as it is tied to the jump key, and while useful in some situations, I didn't find myself using it very much.\n\nYou are given a GPS which always shows you where you need to go, and the pathfinding for it is top notch, working around broken obstacles, or pointing out the path even in there is something broken that is required to advance. You'll make good use of it should you choose to play the game.\n\nIf you're looking for an over the shoulder shooter that lets you shoot things, has some pretty physics and decent graphics and audio, but not much else, this is right up your alley.

I have to say that despite the good things I heard about the series, either this one is defective or they all suck.  3/10\n\nThere is only one thing this game made badass: using vehicles.  Too bad the usage is few and far inbetween.  Everything else...and I mean EVERYTHING ELSE is borrowed from other games.  They don't add an exceptional twist to it either.  Game play is okay; not very intense and often monotonous.  The graphics and music are nothing special.  Storyline is probably stronger of these aspects, but its very predictable and is mainly improved because of a slightly better presentation.  Some of the level design is quite interesting, but with the rest of the game wholly against it, it is kind of like a feeble attempt at a come back.\n\nWhat really kills this game is the dialogue.  For the entire duration of the game, you will hear the constant ♥♥♥♥♥ing and moaning of a guy about as masculine as Ryan Seacrest.  Whine whine whine whine whine whine whine whine whine whine.  It's like going on a road trip with a kid in the backseat that has massive cabin fever.  At first its like...well okay maybe he will shut up at some point.  Then it becomes...can I turn this off without missing anything?  FInally it evolves into concern for society at large, because you know they are trying to portray this guy as a wise-cracking masculine male, and anyone who believes he is so...well...

There's nothing quite like them out there (although I haven't heard great things about RF2). There are so many ways to play - when you can destroy any structure in any way you want with any weapon, you suddenly have a lot of options.\nIn Armageddon, there is a new weapon called the magnet gun that lets you pull objects together (violently) and once you figure it out, it can be a lot of fun to use. Armageddon isn't open world like guerilla was and is more linear, which was disappointing but I still liked it. I also like the multiplayer, and play local games (LAN) with a friend of mine. You can upgrade your character with "salvage" you earn - however the time you have to choose upgrades between rounds is short and often the round starts before I can choose (possibly because my friend started the round).\nAll and all, a very worthy addition to your collection.","June 21, 2014","true","22.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Graphics are good, the destruction engine is awesome and opens a huge door for creativity. I mean, why waste ammo when you can crush a building down with your maul and let gravity kill your enemies for you? The Magnet Gun is in my personal top 3 of best video game weapons of all time. It's incredibly fun to use, and gives you an unlimited advantage over your enemy, with its unlimited ways to bring tangos down, from crushing them with one another to drag them next to you so you can be able to finish em with meele.\n\nOn the other hand, I wouldn't say single player campaign is short, but it sure is a little easy, even in the insane difficulty.

We're not talking just about fancy animations and light effects. This game's destruction model makes a spectacle out of every single rocket, making holes into buildings and sending parts flying everywhere.\n\nThe game tries to be more than its physics model, and it fails miserably.

Good cutscenes. Cool characters. Fun Gameplay.\n\nWhat my problem was are the cutscene loading. This seems to be a common issue. At least i found several people reporting the same problem. Everytime a cutscene loads (this includes the creation of a new game) the game just returns to the main menu.\nIn Direct X9 it was possible to restart the game and by pressing several times on continue or load game eventually the cutscene run through and did not just return to the main menu.\n\nI managed to play through this game using this method ... but this was somethimes really annoying ...\n\nSo what to recommend? If you do not have this problem - totally recommend. If you have the probem - NO :D\n\nAnd one remark. Play on Hard. I used normal and after a few upgrades it was just to easy. The final battle has no challenge at all.

The single player is the perfect length to get it all done. There are special vehicle to drive that make the action more fun.The sounds in the game really make your surrounds seem more in depth, the monsters move alot. The online play with friends is great! There isn't alot of people that will come online if your trying to find a match but you can complete most of the online portion alone. There is a survival mode in online were you get waves of monsters. The graphics make you feel like your watching a movie. The guns are creative and well done.

Linear and little stuff to blow up. Graphics look pretty good, and, in comparison to Guerrilla, this is a great port; solid 60fps all the way and lots of options. There are a lot of fantastic weapons (<3 Mr. Toots) so the action is pretty good, but it's just an endless spawn of alien enemies in the end. I lost interest pretty quickly. And most of the time you have to kill them to continue. I really missed the freedom of Guerrilla, and using my sledgehammer to kill the enemies. Because of the small caves, you usually use one of yours guns, especially when you're being surrounded by 10+ enemies. So yes, it's more action packed than Guerrilla (the powers you can acquire are a plus actually), but blowing things up and the whole freedom aspect were two of the things that made the previous game so great. Remember the Dragon Age 2 criticism ? It's just like that all over again. Get it when it's cheap.\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","June 10, 2011","true","9.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So, what better way to follow that up than with something one step above a 1990s rail-shooter.  The game is beautiful, using all the DX11 goodies it can find, and the characters are well to the right of the Uncanny Valley. But the gameplay is just so... bleh.  You just pass from zone to zone, blow up critters that jump around everywhere, then move on to the next obvious place to be attacked by another wave of uninspired enemies.  The game adds a literal rail-shooter section from time to time, or an unconvincing vehicle segment, just to remind you how much fun you aren't having.

Instead of wandering around doing missions, you're guided through a more linear, richer story.

Blowing everthing up and having the ability to repair stuff with the nanoforge is extremely fun. The gameplay actually takes advantage of both of these, so I think it meshes quite well, and it isn't just a gimmick.\n\nStory wise; it's okay. Better than Guerilla (personally)\n\nShould you buy it?

Unfortunately, what I got was a linear story progression that didn't have the same charm as its predecessor. However, that does not at all mean it's a bad game. In fact, I enjoyed the game just as much as, if not more than, the other one.\n\nThe combat in Armageddon is fluid and well played. Swinging the hammer to destroy almost every piece of the world and then bringing it back to life by repairing it in an instant allows for total control over the battlefield. There are upgrades such as shockwave which pushes your enemies away, berserk which increases damage output, and creating a defensive shell that reflects bullets. These are all unlocked through progression and can be allocated to the enhancement of your choice,  giving a noticeable and substantial edge in combat. There is also a wide choice of weapons to choose from including dual pistols, machine guns, and a rocket launcher along with its own unique array of weapons like the magnet gun and rail driver. I never felt more powerful in a game bashing enemies as a single-hero-against-all-odds than I have in Armageddon.\n\nThere is also a four player co-op mode where you fight waves of enemies or complete objectives (usually defending structures) that can be enjoyable with friends. There are 15 maps total and 30 waves each, leaving plenty of variety and content to satisfy this game mode for a while.\n\nOn the downside, the game is a bit short and doesn't offer too much in terms of difficulty, at least for me. Though time has passed, and price has dropped and I would HIGHLY recommend giving this game a chance.

Armageddon does seem to have, however this is a behind the scene plot. The story is this great; gameplay is somewhat boring compared to the previous Red Faction titles. Graphics are nice I would say that the lighting and shadows are its strong point but the levels are usually plain and the textures are usually hidden due to the darkness that is 90% of the time present; the weapons are pretty much the same as Guerilla’s with curvy models which makes it look futuristic which complement its 3rd shooting perspective. Controls are very responsive. Story (6/10), Graphics(7.5/10), Gameplay (4.9/10) over all the game is worth getting on a sale if you have the previous titles and no other game on your wishlist interest you.","May 3, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's nothing quite like them out there (although I haven't heard great things about RF2). There are so many ways to play - when you can destroy any structure in any way you want with any weapon, you suddenly have a lot of options.\nIn Armageddon, there is a new weapon called the magnet gun that lets you pull objects together (violently) and once you figure it out, it can be a lot of fun to use. Armageddon isn't open world like guerilla was and is more linear, which was disappointing but I still liked it. I also like the multiplayer, and play local games (LAN) with a friend of mine. You can upgrade your character with "salvage" you earn - however the time you have to choose upgrades between rounds is short and often the round starts before I can choose (possibly because my friend started the round).\nAll and all, a very worthy addition to your collection.","June 21, 2014","true","22.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story is not bad at all, and keeps you invested from the beginning to the end. The game is very linear and there's not many options other than whats presented to you. However I don't find that a bad thing, I actually think the game benefits from it. This is not a game that you walk around exploring your enviroment or wander off on some side quest, but rather sit back and enjoy as the story unfolds itself. It's decently long and can accomplish this without making the game feel repetitiv.\n\nNow let's talk about the best part, the destruction. A lot of stuff in your environment will break, and I mean a lot. You can bash through a wall with your sledgehammer and tear down pillars and buildings to their core. This means that you can destroy any cover that the enemy might try and hide behind, but so can they. You can repair stuff to quickly make cover for yourself or you can grab a piece of a wall and swing it on your enemies. It never gets boring and will make a huge difference in how you play the game.\n\nAside from the single-player action you can team up with some friends and play coop missions. These center around fighting waves of enemies while trying to survive. I found this to be very fun and intense gameplay, but it falls short when it comes to veriety and exensivness.\n\nIf you can find this game on a sale, I would highly recommend it.","December 2, 2014","true","16.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This time, an enemy thought dead came back, and unleashed hell hidden beneath Mars, and the only guy who can really do something about it... is Darius Mason... if he can survive the onslaught of multiple enemies... but he has a few friends. Will it be enough? There's a bit of auto-aim, and there are a lot of different weapons (but you can carry only 4 at a time). There's a bit of RPG element as you can choose different "skills" to enhance your combat and destructible environment such as buildings, walls, and others are pretty cool the first few times, but gets old a bit later.

In fact the tech is more prominent due the closed nature of the level design.  Explicitly stated RFA is without doubt one of the most technically impressive works that I have ever interacted with. Volition proves themselves again that they are leaders in their field.\n\nAn additional effect aside from the destruction the series has become known for is reconstruction enabling you, for example, to completely destroy a bridge during combat that's needed for level progression and later allowing you to rebuild it.\n\nOn the downside, from a PC perspective the FOV is too close and I've never really adjusted.  To compensate I've moved to a couch/plasma/cont setup so that I'm farther back from the screen.  While this improves the expereince it's not optimal.  On the upside the DX11 visuals are great given the console nature of the game.

But that's all you really do in it, there's not much else to it, and you're not given anything for accomplishing it. The second is Ruin mode, where your goal is to destroy as much as you can as fast and chaoticly as you can, and even if that sounds like what this game was trying to give you in the first place, it doesn't feel that nice.\n\nThe weapon and fighting mechanics are just meh as the rest of it, get a few weapon slots for pre-defined weapons, and bang bang, hide to recover health, repeat. There's a few interesting weapon aresenals out there, but nothing that'll keep you hooked. The main enemy of the game is an alien race, but instead of clawing you to death with scythes or anything (which they have), they just shoot spikes at you all day. Again, another illusion of doing something unique, but it just masks the fact that they're all faceless soldier grunts.\n\n\nEven with all this, I never played Guerilla, which I heard was way way WAY better and cooler.

You have the Red Faction feel with complete and utter environmental carnage, but the storyline seems out of place.\nQuick and Easy game, even on the highest difficulty.\nWould overall not recommend.\n_______\n\nDry Humor on a Dry Planet\nI will forever love the little bits of comedy that came around during cinematics/gameplay.\n\nMason: SAM, show me where the bugs are.\n-SAM gives locations. Mason sees the hive colony-\nMason: Buckle up, SAM. This may take a while.\nSAM: There is no "buckle up" directive in my drive.\nMason: -sigh- Just shut up and show me where the bugs are.\nSAM: Affirmative.\nIt's those little chuckles that get you through it all.\n\nHowever...\n\nThe story feels wrong (it was half-decent though).\n- First off, this feels nothing like a Red Faction game. You fought the Ultor Corporation in the first one, Sopot's military in the second, and finally the EDF (military/corporation) in the third. This one just suddenly jumps to aliens. What the hell?\nThere were no hints that I recall in the previous 3 games that even remotely stated aliens were here. They just suddenly exist. I suppose you could say those mutants you fought in RF 1 were a hint, but even then...They were mutants. Animals/humans Kapek experimented on with his nano-tech.\nNot even (some of) the  journals which tell of events prior/during/post RF 1 still felt right. They seemed out of place, what with their recordings being about aliens and Kapek, rather than something more believable (like Kapek and experimentation on humans/animals they brought (see/play RF 1 for animal/animutant encouters)).\n__\nThe Destruction is awesome\nWhat more can be said? This engine knows how to supply the demand for endless carnage.\nWhether you use a Magnet, a Hammer or a Rocket, just about everything can and will be blown to bits.\nIt's all so satisfying to see those explosions consume the aliens that won't stay the f**k still.\n\nMy only gripe is..\n\nOh holy ****, I cant' progress because the place keeps falling apart!\nLong story short, you will be constantly repairing the entire level you just destroyed. If you don't, you're likely to blow up the bridge you needed to cross to get through the campaign. There's as much repairing as there is destruction, which can get annoying.\n\n\nA variety of abilities to complement the weapons.\nThis game really made me want to use my abilities. I wasn't just firing my weapon, I actually felt encouraged to use my nanoforge's attacks to help maximize my damage, destruction, and survivability\n\nThe $20 price is around the right area, although getting it for less never hurts. Compared to the other games in the RF Franchise, this was a disappointment for me.\nThat aside, it is a decent playthrough, though not as good as it could have been.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this game, especially if you've played Red Faction: Geurilla.","January 4, 2015","false","13.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Didn't get into the first two red factions, but started at Guerilla and wanted to check out how its sequel was going.... I really wish I hadn't. AI hasn't improved since side-scrolling days, enemies standing upright until you walk around the corner then immediately blast your face off, so no element of sneak or suprise, you eventually get bored of peaking so just run around the corner already firing your gun.\n\nThe difficulty is determined by how many enemies there are, not the skill used to take them down (oh look, there is no cover in this room, I wonder how long it will take for the player to die? Let's cram wave after wave of the same ♥♥♥♥ into that room, and to add some "origionality" lets make those waves get slightly harder each time.\n\nAlso the bosses are freaking dumb as ♥♥♥♥ and take no skill or brain to complete, it feels like I have a Navi over my shoulder pointing out the big freakin' glowy-ball-stuff that I need to shoot a certian number of times until the boss changes colour or something and I need to repeat the process again, except this time I need to avoid some other attack because he somehow transformed from you shooting his ♥♥♥♥....\n\n*spoilers*\n\nThe story is so unbelievably bland. It starts off fairly positively, which is what made me want to play, however it turned exxtremely quickly into a dumb panto written by a three year old and performed by Kirsten Stewart.\nTHERE IS NO EMOTIONAL VALUE TO ANY OF THE CHARACTERS!!\n\nI have already mentioned there will be spoilers so here it is, Mason's girl (friend/acquaintance/random-person-he-just-meets??) dies near the end and all he says is "NOOOO" and carries on just as normal.\n\nThe ENTIRE game is COMPLETELY RAILROADED, with little to gain from veering from the obvious paths, there is no free-world like its predecessor and I get that because you are in caves, but there is no varation from the story, no side-missions, no backstory, the only option after completing the campaign is to do it all again... And I would rather smash my face onto my keyboard repeatedly whilst listening to Skrillex than put myself through that again.\n\nSo to conclude: DO NOT GET THIS GAME IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY\n\nYou're welcome\n","December 3, 2014","false","8.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Compared to the other games in the RF Franchise, this was a disappointment for me.\nThat aside, it is a decent playthrough, though not as good as it could have been.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this game, especially if you've played Red Faction: Geurilla.","January 4, 2015","false","13.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

One second you're a honest working miner forced into a rebellion to stay a live, next you're a super soldier and then you're a terrorist insgurent on mars during the uprising...Now...Now you're a down on his luck outcast who accidentally always makes bad things happen and he just happens to be related to the previous games protagonist.... I love red faction for the first 7 or 8 hours I was actually enjoying Armageddon but it just started falling a part with choppy mission structure, abrupt cutscenes and a anti-climactic ending. Easily the worst in the franchise imo and thats hard for me to say given my thoughts on RF2.

Guerilla also has its share of flaws, and they are different from Armageddon's flaws. In Armageddon, I would have liked more outdoor areas, more human enemies, vehicular enemies, and more large structures to destroy.

There's nothing wrong with it save for some optimization issues. The only things "wrong" I found were the aesthetics and that is, of course, debatable. The Red Faction just looks wrong, to me. They look silly all shaved bald and running around in capes. Their technology looks just plain wrong. It looks terrible and boring. Even the vaunted destruction physics are utilized poorly. Driving a tank through a wall never felt so boilerplate. And the enemies are even worst. Who honestly thought that using monsters would be a good idea? The Religious zealots you fight look ridiculous. They look like rejects from a GI Joe cartoon and act like it, too. It all looks like they were made to market a toy line.\n\nBut, is there anything wrong with it other than that? Not really, it's solid, sure. It's just so unimpressive. Sure, there's fun to be had bashing down walls to kill enemies, that's definitely a high point. But, really? That's it.

I was pleasantly surprised though :)\n\nThe game is very well made, the environment design, the lighting, the animations and weapon effects. It’s all made to a very high standard, similar to the previous game, Red Faction: Guerrilla. Unlike Guerrilla though, this is a corridor shooter but with some seriously innovative features.\n\nReturning from the previous games is the geo-mod technology that allows the player to destroy the environment. I’m so happy they've brought this back and even enhanced it! The new features include a  magnet gun, which allows objects to be pulled into other objects with great force. This creates a gameplay style I’ve never experienced before! Using a house to crush your enemies never gets old!\n\nThe new nano forge ability allows the player to regenerate the environment after you have destroyed it. This I found particularly cool, destroying the environment and then rebuilding to create cover or access new areas. Clearly a lot of thought has been put into new gameplay features for this game.\n\nThe story is probably the weakest point here. There are many links to previous Red Faction games (which is always great to see), but the characters are somewhat stale and the story feels as though it’s moving too fast at times. The low res cut scenes don’t help either.\n\nBut overall, a very good game. It’s always great to experience new and interesting gameplay mechanics, which Armageddon pulls off very well.\n","February 23, 2013","true","21.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

There's nothing wrong with it save for some optimization issues. The only things "wrong" I found were the aesthetics and that is, of course, debatable. The Red Faction just looks wrong, to me. They look silly all shaved bald and running around in capes. Their technology looks just plain wrong. It looks terrible and boring. Even the vaunted destruction physics are utilized poorly. Driving a tank through a wall never felt so boilerplate. And the enemies are even worst. Who honestly thought that using monsters would be a good idea? The Religious zealots you fight look ridiculous. They look like rejects from a GI Joe cartoon and act like it, too. It all looks like they were made to market a toy line.\n\nBut, is there anything wrong with it other than that? Not really, it's solid, sure. It's just so unimpressive. Sure, there's fun to be had bashing down walls to kill enemies, that's definitely a high point. But, really? That's it.

I might write a full review sometime later.\n\nAnyway, this game is fun and has full destructible/repairable environments. What's not to like? Sure, it's not open world like Red Faction: Guerilla, and it definetly would be better if it was, but it's still heck of a lot of fun. It took me 16 hours to complete the full campaign, which is longer than your average shooter. This game could also do with a bit of variety. Most of the levels look way too similar and throughout the game I was really hoping for more sections on actual land and not underground. The story isn't perfect and does suffer from some cliches, but it's still good and is better than most of what we get from shooters nowadays.\n\nWhen I finished the game (which was about 10-20 minutes ago as of writing this review) I felt a bit disappointed and it did feel lackluster. I expected a bit more of an ending. The game doesn't necessarily end in a cliff hanger, but I felt that the ending could have been more conlcusive.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Guerilla and Armageddon thoroughly and equally (I also remember playing the original Red Faction on the Nokia N-Gage... I know), I honestly really want to see a Red Faction 5. The IP currently belongs to Nordic Games, so Volition, the developers of Red Faction 1-Armageddon (fun fact: also the developers of the Saints Row franchise) will not be working on RF5. Now we can only hope that Nordic Games know what they're doing and will deliver a solid next instalment in the franchise. It would be great if they would try to co-operate with Volition (Volition stated they will not do work on RF anymore, but hey, they could still help). So, good luck, Nordic.","February 26, 2015","true","16.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's NOT Red Faction: Armageddon. The worst RF game goes to Red Faction II. Seriously, Armageddon is better than I thought it would be. The story is ok somewhat, but it's better than in RF:G. You play as Darius Mason, grandson of Alec Mason from RF:G, and he has more personality than his grandfather. He can be hilarious at times, especially when interacting with his S.A.M. (Situational Awareness Module) A.I. The theme of revolution is still here, although not as it was in previous games, you'll see what I mean. The campaign last for roughly 15 hours.\n\nAs for gameplay, it's really fun. Geo-Mod is still here. My main gripe is the removal of open-world. That's really a step back. It could easily have been implemented here. An underground open-world? That would have been great. But I like the new weapons such as the Magnet Gun. It allows you to latch magnets between two objects making one move towards the other. Upgrades are nice too. Taking out the baddies is really fun. What I really didn't like is how the game holds your hand. Not only do you have an objective marker, but also an arrowed path telling you where to go, leaving no room to find where to go on your own. And during boss fights, there is an icon telling you where you shoot, such as weak spots. Too-much hand-holding! As for Infestation mode, I haven't really played it yet, but it's a Horde mode, where you fight endless waves of enemies. Sounds fun.\n\nIn the end, RF:A isn't bad, but it could have been better. Back when it was released, it would be worth a rental, but buying it now wouldn't be a bad idea, since it's relatively cheap nowadays. Now, Nordic games has control of the franchise, and they have promised a new game. Well, let us see how that turns out...","September 28, 2015","true","18.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It isn't totally bad but the story is uninteresting, the gun play is meh, and a boring coop component come together to form a 4/10. If you can get it on the cheap it might be worth it just to see the great environmental destruction. However if you want a game with destructible environments I'd recommend Red Faction Guerrilla. Also the game is on the short side, in about 9 hours I was able to beat the campaign on normal and play some of the coop.","November 25, 2013","false","8.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But they did it all wrong. The atmosphere is (supposed) to be creepy, theres scary ambiant noises, coupled with moments of dead silence that is supposed to build the "What the ♥♥♥♥ is going to happen to me next" mindset. But as a player playing through the game, you gave me weapons that make me feel invincible. So I don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about those scary noises! Which makes me feel more like "Bring it on!

Armageddon still has the wonderful knocking down of buildings, and the magnet gun is incredibly fun to play with, but it just feels like puttering around with little point, compared to the fun of kicking over a UEF hornets nest, trying to desperately knock down a barracks before you are overwhelmed by soldiers or are forced to make a desperate getaway. It was too much of a feeling of being a corridor shooter, after having gotten used to the open and large scale of the previous game.

Instead, this game is a hallway shooter and mostly underground, no less. Sure, you get to destroy\nsome equipment with a couple rather nifty weapons (and repair them in case you're a drunken idiot and dissolved that one catwalk you needed to cross) but its all within the confines of a dank, uninteresting atmosphere. You'd have more fun going down into your grandmother's cellar and knocking a shelf over.\n\nThere is what's known as Ruin Mode where you can run around and turn the map into a parking lot but that becomes a snorefest eventually.\n\nThe story is borderline laughable. Not cringeworthy but it's like the vice president of the company's son wrote it for his drama class.\n\nThis isn't a horrible game. Get it if it's on sale. If you have a choice, get the very first Red Faction and Guerilla. Skip the 2nd.","September 5, 2014","false","10.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

When you make a game that is a smash success it has to be hard to replicate that success in the form of sequels, which were obviously created, but were a major bust in the eyes of people who actually followed the games since day one including myself.\n\nVolition's fourth attempt in the series is coined Red Faction: Armageddon. Now the subtitle may be a reference to where the story intends to go within the game, but it would also be a good way to describe the game itself. The story begins on Mars in the distant future; just like all others have before it. You play as Darius Mason; a Red Faction member and the grandson of Alec Mason who was the protagonist in Red Faction: Guerrilla in the year 2120. 50 years have passed since the liberation of colonies from the Earth Defense Force. As Darius, you must face off against a new enemy who is trying to destroy stability on the planet and make it uninhabitable to humans. By using terrorist attacks on the Terraformer which provides oxygen and atmosphere to the planet, he is slowly succeeding. The man responsible for all of this is known as Adam Hale. Adam is a cultist leader for the Marauders. This group of mercenaries was converted by him into his own personal army.\n\nAfter the attack on the Terraformer, you are led to believe that Adam was killed during the explosion which brought the Terraformer crumbling to the ground. Everyone with common sense or awareness of the cliches which are in nearly all movies and games can already tell exactly where this is headed within the first 10 minutes of play. Everyone has been forced underground as a result of these events, which have made the surface of the planet a wasteland. Violent storms, lack of oxygen and mega tornados are what greet people at the surface so obviously a great deal of this game will take place in a linear underground environment. While all the population of Mars is being forced under the surface, a deadly plague strikes which is killing everyone. It is your job to find out what has caused this and who is responsible.\n\nIn terms of the story, it is hardly anything riveting or interesting for that fact; and leaves you wondering why you are even playing the game at all. From the beginning, you know exactly where things are going, no suspense, no mystery, just destroy everything and kill everyone until it ends. If you have played the original Red Faction, you will find yourself again questioning this game. What does this really have to do with the first game? Why are people still on Mars if everything has been so terrible three times before? The last but not least; why is everyone trying to either destroy the planet or control it in a totalitarian fashion? Obviously it has worked out so great three previous times why not give it another shot; 4th times a charm right? This series has become a joke. They took something pure and perfect then ruined it by changing the formula until nearly every identifiable shred of the original game no longer existed.\n\nThese problems started mainly with Guerrilla, carry over into Armageddon, which added a few more to boot. For the love of god choose a camera and stick to it. The series went from First Person, to a Third Person 360° viewable camera to now a Third Person shoulder locked camera; like I said earlier, formula destroyed. Geo-Mod 2.0-2.5 are again a step in the wrong direction, in the original game you could destroy practically everything, including terrain to make your own paths or find ways around obstacles. This has been severely dialed back, and I am not even sure how it can be dignified with a version 2.0 or 2.5 branding aside from it being the engine name. The only things which can be destroyed are man-made objects, no terrain. While the destruction is impressive, it is all ruined by shooting a wall and not even a scratch showing up.\n\nHold onto your pants because the bad does not stop there. Where are all the vehicles you could pilot in all previous games? There are vehicles all over this game but none you can drive? Really? It's kind of a slap in the face to be honest, but this comes back to changing the formula. However, they did make a wise decision and reverted back to the roots of the game being linear. The whole Red Faction/Grand Theft Auto open world concept that Guerrilla attempted to do was just too weird and turned a lot of people off; that would explain their logic for Armageddon.\n\nAfter reading all that is wrong with it let's get to some things which are good and alright. The game looks fantastic in nearly every way, crisp textures, DirectX 11 effects and amazing use of physics on the destruction, the presentation is overall great. With the nice boost in visuals you will also notice some new modes, features and an updated arsenal of weapons. There are two new modes, and they are incorporated very well. The first mode is Ruin. You have a set time to destroy the most structures possible and must obtain a certain score to achieve the next level. There is some replayability to this, but it is stunted by the lack of total levels. The second mode which has been incorporated is Infestation, it is similar to Nazi zombies in CoD and Killing Floor.\n\nYou must kill wave after wave of enemies on each level. Some are purely survival and others are defense so you must protect structures from being destroyed. Each level has up to 30 waves to survive. This works out great and is a fun way for friends to play whether it be through the Internet or Lan; there is a lot of replayability here. Conventional multiplayer is something that has been scraped completely, for how this game is I think that was a smart move. If it were still a first-person shooter it would need this to compete with the others; but as it stands it's not something necessary.\n\nThe game play is fun in its own right. Very standard Third Person Shooter combat mixed with a Gears of War type cover system. What it does, it does fairly well but the mediocrity of it makes you feel as if you have played this game before. The mix of weapons keeps things pretty interesting. You have a choice of about 10 weapons ranging from just your standard shotgun all the way up to a singularity cannon which creates black holes and engulfs nearby structures. Using the varied weapons can be fun and finding new ways to kill or destroy with them is mainly what the game is about.\n\nProbably the biggest highlight to the entire game is the Path to War DLC. This takes place hours before the events which bring down the Terraformer. The great thing about this is it allows you to actually use the vehicles and play as both sides. It definitely gives a fresh perspective to the game. I would recommend playing this before starting the campaign. With about 45 minutes of game play this makes for an overall nice addition to the game, but I don't think it is exactly worth the money.\n\nAll in all, Red Faction: Armageddon is not a terrible game on its own. I hope that is not something I conveyed here. It is a terrible game in terms of it living up to the original which can be said about Red Faction 2 & Guerrilla also, but for what they all do, comparisons aside, they are interesting gaming experiences on their own. If you are looking for a game with deep story, gameplay which is enthralling from beginning to end or something that you will have fond memories of as you get older; this game is not for you. If you want a game which is fun to jump into and blow things up periodically for 20 to 30 minutes at a time without paying attention to what is really going on; this is absolutely for you. Consider it a destruction simulator with a cliched and somewhat boring story to go with it, and you will have the time of your life.","November 28, 2013","false","7.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Not to mention, many other games were coming out at the time so I was worried about my time being spread too thin between games.  Unfortunately THQ decided  to can the Red Faction series and move Volition Inc. onto a different project.  This was mainly due to the fact that the sales for the game were abyssmal.  Personally, I was part of the crowd that didn't get the game and I will say that anyone who is a fan of the FPS genre needs to give this game a try.  Most people say that this whole series ran on a gimmick but honestly, which game doesn't in some fashion?  At least Volition tried something different in terms of destructible enviornments.  Maybe they will revisit that decision later.  For now, this game is fun and blowing things up is even better.

The reason why i don't recommend it is the folowing : to me it is not a Red Faction Game nor story.\n\nMore an Half-Life-like than a Red Faction Game. The universe is quite the Red Faction one (you're on Mars, underground), but the concept is not the original one. Will have to fight against bugs-like E.T.. About 10 different types of ennemy, weapons are quite new too compared to the first Red Faction. An upgrade system based on the Red Faction : Guerrilla one, with metal to pick up and spend is available, but upgrades are about player and the nanoforge abilities, not about creating new weapons. The Nanoforge is a great change on this Red Faction episode : giving you some powers, such a an impact pulse crushing what is in front of you, a shield, or a shockwave. But the first and most important one is the repair ability : Red Faction has always been know by its physics and its incredibly destructible environment. You can now repair everything. your stuck in the way ? Destroy the path to get out and repair it to continue. No more shelter to protect yourself againt enemy fire ? Rebuild them where they were.\n\nConcluding, it's a really nice TPS, in the spirit of Red Faction, but this is not a Red Faction game.","June 2, 2014","false","58.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plenty of new and interesting weapons make that happen. Stomping around in a suit of power armor is just pure fun.\n\nFans of the earlier games will find plenty of callbacks, especially to the 1st game. The alien bugs especially look awfully familiar to creatures found in a certain insane scientist's zoo. Not really any connection to the much unfairly maligned 2nd game but then that game was a big of an odd one out.\n\nThis will unfortunately probably be the last Red Faction game we will get for awhile, thanks to poor sells and THQ going belly up, but still if you are a fan of the series its a worthy ending to it.\n\nHighly recommended.","February 1, 2015","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

None of the guns seem to do a lot relative to hurling chunks of scenery around with the magnet gun (lifted from Half Life) so they're rarely used. The combination of repetitive gameplay (walk round a corner, horde of bugs spawn from empty space, slaughter them) and uninspiring, underpowered enemies makes the act of thinning their apparently limitless numbers a bit of a dull distraction from the scenery-chewing. A bit unfortunate in a shooter.

Great effects, destruction, and cool tech make the short campaign enjoyable.\n\nRed Faction: Armageddon Review (Spoiler Free)\nStory\n\nA mysterious cult destroys the Terraformer, thus destabilizing Mars' atmosphere and driving most inhabitants on the planet underground.  Five years after these events, protagonist Darius finds mining work anyway he can, having left the Red Faction after their failed attempt to retake the Terraformer.  He accepts a contract from a group of shady Marauders and unwittingly releases an entombed alien race.  He is eventually ousted as the the one responsible and forced on the run.  Darius encounters old allies though as he runs and eventually begins the laborius task of driving the aliens back and finding the true identity of those who tricked him.\n\nGameplay\n\nArmageddon is played in third-person similar to Guerrilla.  The campaign is single player only, but there is also an online co-op "horde mode" for up to four players and a sandbox/score attack destruction mode for you to fool around with solo.  Environmental destruction is one of the game's attractions.  At the start of the game, you are given a special tool that allows you to rebuild destroyed structures and objects.  Whereas a broken staircase in another game would prevent you from moving forward, in Armageddon you can literally rebuild the stairs.  Enemies can also make a mess of the environment.  A hulking alien can smash through every wall you put between you and it.  Tentacles will snatch fallen debris and throw it at you.  Destroying buildings is really fun just to watch them crumble.\n\nThere is a a good variety of different weapons to use that destroy the environment in different ways.  Most of the time you will use these weapons to fight various classes of aliens.  Aliens frequently swarm you so your build tool also has some AOE attacks (such as a shield, anti-grav, and force-like push) to create some breathing room.  You will also get to pilot some pretty awesome vehicles.  The story plays out as you would expect it but what you'll be doing in each mission is highly varied.  The campaign never got dull for me and I was excited to play through it again on a harder difficulty.  Co-op is sparsely populated.  Although you can play it alone, it really is not as fun as the campaign.\n\nDesign\n\nThe aliens in Armageddon look amazing.  Their are multiple varieties of creepy crawlies each with their own color scheme, behavior, and on-screen effects.  All of them are very well animated.  Sound and lighting are also very nice, giving you the claustrophobic dread of being trapped in the dark underground.  All of the environments look nice too, whether they be vast caves, undeground towns, or surface camps in the middle of a lightning/sand storm.  Voice acting and cutscenes are great and the cast is alright for what the game is.  Music choice is appropriate though nothings really stood out to me.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nRed Faction: Armageddon is a fun game to play through on your own a couple of times.  Fun gameplay, straightforward story, quality design, and environmental destruction are the reason to get this game.  Try to get it on sale if the short campaign and lack of multiplayer options deters you.\n\nCan you find Mr. Toots?","December 9, 2014","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, it does nothing but remind you of how much better it's predecessor was. There are walls that cannot be destroyed in this game. That might not sound like a big complaint but in RFG, everything was destructable. This breaks immersion right off the bat. Going from an open world to a linear style seems like a step back. There's only one way to beat every stage, just point and shoot at the enemy until everything is dead. It's dissapointing coming off of the last game thinking it's success may lead to a more fleshed out, higher quality follow up. This game looks pretty, and is an ok third person shooter, but isn't nearly as good as the one before it.\n\nA lot of people say it's unfair to make the comparisson between the two games. I feel it's unfair to sell a game based on the success of the first and then tell everyone not to make "unfair" comparissons. The bottom line is if it were a better game, no one would be making a fuss.\n\nThis game is certainly worth checking out if you like third person shooters and cheesy action sci fi stories.

It’s probably one of the best that I own.\n\nHowever since I was looking for a game that improved upon Guerrilla, I was very disappointed.  The first few RF's had been decent FPS's and the move to make Guerrilla open world had been a vast improvement to the RF franchise.  If RF had of stayed a FPS format for Guerrilla, then I would had thought that Armageddon was a huge success.\n\nBottom line the game feels like its lacking something.  Is it just my disappointment that it's now open world?  Probably...But what if Saints Row or Gran Theft Auto moved to a strictly FPS?  Disappointment would be evident and voiced loudly.  Granted RF isn't as big as those two titles, but I loved the story and world behind RF and with this step backward in the series I just cannot find myself approving of this sequel.\n","January 2, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And for the first few hours everything seemed good, but after that it all starts to fall apart.  The story starts to become boring, with little to keep you interested, the characters are not memorable, and by the end of the game you just don't care what happens.  Halfway through the campaign everything starts to feel drawn out and some objectives fell like they were put in just to add extra play time, you actually reach a point where it would make sense for the game to end and wrap things up, but the game pushes on, and it does that 3 or 4 times in the closing stages.  The last 2 hours of the game had me fustrated that it hadn't ended, it was annoying to continue playing, and don't think you're rewarded with a brilliant ending.\n\nThe combat also takes its toll the longer you play, the destructable items and terrain become a pain, occasionally you get stuck on areas and have to rely on random jumping to get you out of situations, you end up constantly reparing the way you need to go as AI seems to shoot at that more that you.  The magnet gun which pulls terrain from one point to another is fun to use at first and probably the most effective gun in the game, but no othe weapon brings anything different to the table, which means using those make this anothe generic shooter.\n\nOverall this game is boring as hell.","July 6, 2014","false","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The cool thing about this game is that there's a device that can actually reconstruct something that you broke (except explosive barrels , oil tanks etc.) right before your eyes! Say you have to get upstairs to go to your objective but you accidentally blew up the stairs during a firefight, just hold down the middle click which is the default button and aim where the stairs used to be and a brand new staircase will recontruct where it used to be and there you go. I'm not even halfway through the game yet but this game is just amazing and i reccomed it to everyone. There's even a mode made solely for blowing ♥♥♥♥ up! I haven't tried the multiplayer yet , but im not that interested in it either. Pick this game up and start blowing ♥♥♥♥ up and whacking people across he map with your AWESOME sledgehammer that can break buildings and structures down as well.","October 6, 2013","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It completly takes you by surprise what the game is capable of and the amount of fun that you ca have with the tools provided. No the game doesn't have a stunning story line or brilliant character development but what it lacks is easily made up for in the sheer amount of fun and stress relief that can be gained through the constant destruction of the games enviroment. Some of the weapons provided make you feel like an overpowered god with the power to destroy and create at your fingertips. The rebuild beam is my favourite feature in this game and that may seem like a weird thing to say in a game solely based around the destructible enviroment, but the fact that you can then rebuild that enviroment back to what it was just to then blow it up again makes the gam that so much more fun. The magnet gun is another of my all time favorite things about this game. If you have heard anything about this game chances are it was the magnet gun. If you havn't all I'm going to say is you can bring a building down on top of an enemy. Both of the weapons i've mentioned have unlimited ammo/uses and while that may seem overpowered when using them in game they arn't. Neither fell overpowered in any way and they fit in nicely with the game in general. Ruin mode is one of the best modes of this game and one of the most outstanding and fun features. I definatly recomend this game if you enjoy stress relief through destruction and sheer power. So go get it and have fun.","July 26, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is fun and like all RF games, RF:A continues with great and innovative weapons.\n\nSadly, me and countless other RF fans expected this sequel to be more akin to RF: Guerilla, where the game is an open-ended sandbox game similar to a GTA style. This RF:A is more like a corridor action game fused with scripted gameplay.\n\nThe story is very average-ish and could've been better. Even if he game feels rushed, it gave me a few hours before reading the credits. My biggest disappointment is while RF:A wasn't a poor game yet not a kickass one, I'm very saddened that this game is the last of the RF franchise.\n\nMaybe Volition will get permission to reboot the franchise someday? I hope so and while at it, how about making a true sequel to Guerilla, in an open-ended gameplay?\n\nOverall, I'd give this game 7/10. I got it on a steam deal, do the same!\n\nPS: The DLC "Path to War" is decent. It provides you  2 extra hours of gameplay.","November 13, 2011","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took them 4 games to create the engaging, visceral, destructive experience they were going for here and with the culmination of all of the lessons they have learnt, Violition has managed to create the most empowering third person shooter ever. Stasis in this game makes Isaac Clarke look like a noob, it not just stops enemies but drains their health and replenishes yours. The Mechs from F.E.A.R. were awesome? Nope, they cant quite charge through a wall, crush all the enemies in the way and cause the building they just went through to collapse. What's a gravity gun again? The Magnet gun is my favourite gun ever (along side the Portal Gun). This is the power-fantasy any crazy like me has been waiting for. Sniper shooting at you? Shoot a magnet at the base and another at the roof. The base flies upwards into the roof and the whole thing implodes and then collapses. Survive that! Boss fights consist of throwing the boss around the enviroment or pieces of the environment at them until they are impaled by debris and their body parts scatter with a gratifying splat. The campaign does get tedious towards the end though, with one long mission underground with no destructible environments and the story takes itself more seriously than I can. But Horde mode and a free form destroy everything 'Ruin Mode' provides some online fun. Valve better start working on Half Life 3 or everyone is just gonna rip off the old games and forget about them. R.I.P.

The storyline integrates the original game's history and builds off of it to produce a compelling and interesting single player that kept me engaged all the way through the game. I liked the combat mechanics as well. In my view, this game was much better than Red Faction Guerrilla because in Guerrilla I always felt lost, and didn't really know what I was doing or for what reason. I also got the cartoony feeling of "bam-bam" because of all the destruction, especially with the hammer and super human strength. This game has that aspect too, but you are more guided and feel like you know what you are doing and why. That being said, Guerrilla was somewhat of a free-world-exploration game while Armageddon was more limited to the current path game. In Guerrilla, I had to force myself to engage the storyline while in Armageddon I was enthralled by the storyline and had a lot more fun with Armageddon. If you're looking for a game with a good storyline that is very smooth in terms of mechanics and gameplay to keep you entertained for a couple of hours, Armageddon is a good game to grab on sale.","November 13, 2012","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It has a great campaign, and also a nice addition of a co-op survival mode. The destruction is just as good as it was. Play through the story, you'll know what I mean.

When you beat the game you also unlock one of the most badass weapons possible, Mr. Toots.\n\nOverall I'd give this game an 8/10, the only bad part was the immense audio problems - maybe its not really worth 50$ though, so wait for a sale ;)","July 3, 2011","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The campaign is enjoyable the entire way, with no point dragging on especially long, but at the same time it's not amazing.  The last hour or so is rather anticlimatic and just happens, but it wraps things up nicely, leaving no real room for a sequel (something rather rare in today's industry).\n\nWhat really makes this game stand out is the insane levels of physics fun you can have with the world.  Making buildings collapse and slamming enemies into stalactites with the magnet gun is something I can do all day.  There's also plenty to do in the sandbox mode.\n\nThe game is short, and if you have the attention span to put into it you can easily beat it in a single day.  Thankfully the amount of content and fun you'll have destroying things makes it a rather replayable experience, even if you one of those people who find sci-fi stories of a generic bad-♥♥♥ on Mars fighting aliens to be a cliche and dry.\n\nDefinitely go for this if you're looking for something random and fun to play in an afternoon.","August 17, 2013","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I paid a fair amount for the bundle since it was going to a good cause, so I can't exactly say that I don't care about the quality of the games that I've purchased. That being said, this was definitely not a game worth playing or owning.\nTo say the least, the story is very boring. If you've played any other shooter or adventure game, the first 10 minutes will immediately feel (too) familiar.\nGameplay and story are hackneyed, originiality is thrown out the window unless you LOVE destructibility (everything can be destroyed).\nHonestly, I felt like a 6-year old could've beaten this game considering the game's tone, ease of gameplay, and overly simplisitc plot. Blow up all those guys with your super powers! Walk ALL the way over to the otherside of this large space! Rinse and repeat! You can kill everything with your magic and giant gun!\nAt the point where I couldn't handle the repetition of a linear game levels, I did an ALT-F4 and never opened the game again.\nIt now lays cold and ignored in my steam library.

The reason why i don't recommend it is the folowing : to me it is not a Red Faction Game nor story.\n\nMore an Half-Life-like than a Red Faction Game. The universe is quite the Red Faction one (you're on Mars, underground), but the concept is not the original one. Will have to fight against bugs-like E.T.. About 10 different types of ennemy, weapons are quite new too compared to the first Red Faction. An upgrade system based on the Red Faction : Guerrilla one, with metal to pick up and spend is available, but upgrades are about player and the nanoforge abilities, not about creating new weapons. The Nanoforge is a great change on this Red Faction episode : giving you some powers, such a an impact pulse crushing what is in front of you, a shield, or a shockwave. But the first and most important one is the repair ability : Red Faction has always been know by its physics and its incredibly destructible environment. You can now repair everything. your stuck in the way ? Destroy the path to get out and repair it to continue. No more shelter to protect yourself againt enemy fire ? Rebuild them where they were.\n\nConcluding, it's a really nice TPS, in the spirit of Red Faction, but this is not a Red Faction game.","June 2, 2014","false","58.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So one day I decided to download it because I wanted to play something different and of course wreck things. The game looks really good, the physics are awesome and what is in my opinion the best thing about the game - it really understands when to deliver new content to you as a player. Small interjection - you have a huge maul to kill people and destroy buildings, so in case you are not convinced imagine yourself jumping around Mars (gravity is way lower than on Earth!) delivering head smashes to your enemies. The game features variety of weapons, enemies and upgrades. The story is logical and well-tied together, it is funny and maybe not greatly engaging or original but it can defend itself good enough.\nAll in all I recommend this game for everyone who a) wants to destroy stuff for the sake of destroying stuff b) wants to be surprised about what the game lets you do c) is looking for a non-open world game d) wants to play the game like he wants with the tools he is given, not boxed in with two alternatives\nGame says I spend 6 hours 37 minutes in campaign mode on Hard.

It completly takes you by surprise what the game is capable of and the amount of fun that you ca have with the tools provided. No the game doesn't have a stunning story line or brilliant character development but what it lacks is easily made up for in the sheer amount of fun and stress relief that can be gained through the constant destruction of the games enviroment. Some of the weapons provided make you feel like an overpowered god with the power to destroy and create at your fingertips. The rebuild beam is my favourite feature in this game and that may seem like a weird thing to say in a game solely based around the destructible enviroment, but the fact that you can then rebuild that enviroment back to what it was just to then blow it up again makes the gam that so much more fun. The magnet gun is another of my all time favorite things about this game. If you have heard anything about this game chances are it was the magnet gun. If you havn't all I'm going to say is you can bring a building down on top of an enemy. Both of the weapons i've mentioned have unlimited ammo/uses and while that may seem overpowered when using them in game they arn't. Neither fell overpowered in any way and they fit in nicely with the game in general. Ruin mode is one of the best modes of this game and one of the most outstanding and fun features. I definatly recomend this game if you enjoy stress relief through destruction and sheer power. So go get it and have fun.","July 26, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is very captivating and I love the large array of weapons that you can choose from. This game seems to always keep me on my feet, shooting aliens here, one there, it is constantly making me energetic. I have only put 2 hours into the game and I have only reached 20% of the entire story mode, which means that there is a fairly long story. Even after I get done with the single player campaign, there is 2 OTHER multi-player modes that I can play. The graphics look very crisp and nice. I like how (most) the world is fully destructable, using my Maul I can tear down walls or any various obsticles that stand in my way. I will probably find myself playing this game when I complete it again because this is a very nice title. I am concidering playing the other Red Faction games because people have said that this was the game that ruined the entire series. I don't know what made this game so much worse for the Red Faction series. I like to play shooters and adventure titles, this was a very nice game for me to pick up, it is a 3rd person action adventure shooter title that takes place in the future years. I am not extremely far in the story yet so I don't exactly have a really good standpoint as to what's going on in the game's storyline. I would reccomend this to someone who hasn't played any other Red Faction titles because it seems to me that Red Faction players seem to hate this game. The game really doesn't seem that repetative to me, but sometimes it can be. It's not as bad as Dead Island but it can get that way sometimes. I don't die normally, I have only died once and that was on accident. I have the difficutly at Normal setting so if it were me, I'd set it to hard or something above Normal for someone looking for a little harder AI to fight against. I'd give this game a rough 8.9/10 it's a great title if you want a 3rd person shooter kind of like Gears of War.","February 9, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've never played any of the other Red Factions, and am told that some of them (if not all) had a more open world feel compared to this much more linear adventure. However, I think its average metacritic score of 70 odd suffers from these sorts of comparisons, as it's a pretty enjoyable game in its own right without any previous experience with the rest of the franchise.\n\nThere are a decent range of weapons that can float different people's boats, but I settled into my favourite four pretty quickly - the magnet gun, sniper rifle, mace (for up close and personal squishing), & a heavy damage weapon (which was the plasma cannon for a long time, rocket launcher, and then finally the singularity cannon). The best thing about the game however, is how much of the environment is destructable. It can break from enemy attack, your own attack, or you can even use it to harm enemies (particularly with the magnet gun). It's honestly one of the best features of the game, and using your particle repairer, you can build up most of the destroyed environment to destroy or throw at enemies again!\n\nReplayability may be a little sticking point however. Like I mentioned the single player is quite linear though can obviously be replayed. However, there are another two gamemodes, one of which can be multiplayer. The first is ruin which is essentially using all your best skills at destroying as much of the destructible environment in the map you're put on. There's a short time limit and points are earned on how much damage you do and at what efficiency. You essentially need to destroy X amount of points to complete the few different maps they have and can continue to try set bigger scores. However, it feels like just the addon it is rather than a completely different game mode. The second is Infestation, which is essentially defeating waves of enemies which get progressively harder (up to 20 waves per map). You can solo this or play with other people, with some similarities to that game mode in Gears of War. I'm not sure about whether or not you spawn more enemies when you play with other people compared to solo though (as I haven't played multiplayer), but I'd hope so given I was able to handle most things solo with just the magnet gun and a decent position on the map playing it smart. The better of the two additional gamemodes for sure, but only extends replayability a little bit more.\n\nWell worth the money I paid for it in a humble bundle. The entire red faction collection (which this game is included with) is still available both from the Humble store and here on steam (I think).","November 19, 2013","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game major flaw is that there is nothing more then combat, you'll play the entire campaign feeling that the only thing that you accomplished is that you killed tons of aliens.\n\nThe story is cliche as can be, the characters are extremely forgettable. The voice acting is ok, but the lines are very cheesy.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, the weapons, enemies and mechs adds an Alien 2 (movie) feeling, wich was really cool if you're a fan like me. You can destroy almost every building in the game, and you have a super technological reconstruction tool that is really cool, but I feel like the game almost never made me use like I wanted, I used only when the game asked me to repair a bridge or an elevator, not in combat to repair cover or in a puzzle (that is because there is no puzzles in this game)\n\nThis game is not going to win any prizes, but overall was a good experience, I wont play this game again, but the time that I spent playing this game was fun","March 24, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I clocked at 8,5 hours. Not counting the extra gamemodes and getting all achievements, plus playing the multiplayer which I will not cover.\n\nRed Faction: Armageddon is a linear third person shooter, with the destruction mechanics of the previous title Guerrilla.\nYou play as a member of the famous Mason family, getting into trouble. This trouble is a new kind of alien life form hidden in the planet Mars. You will use different futuristic weapons of personal destruction to get things done.\n\nFrom melee to rocket launchers, from ground to air vehicles, all is a fun way to do what Masons do best.\n\n|Good stuff:\n-Well optimised.\n-The graphics are beautiful. Environments are well designed to fit the mood of that current level.\n-Geo-mod is back in good shape with better optimised performance when there is allot of detailed destruction around.\n-Main character has more personality than his ancestor Alex Mason in the previous game.\n-Support character for Mason (also seems to grow with the main character).\n-Repair the environment when you need it, or use it against enemies (to make cover etc).\n-Collectibles.\n-Level variation (big and small levels).\n-Enemy variation.\n-Weapon variation.\n-Upgrade system.\n-Decent length singleplayer.\n\n|Not really:\n-Story seems to have plot holes.\n-Could Bastion not have been a hub to get upgrades etc?\n-That's really it from what I can remember.\n\n|Rating:\n8 of 10 should be good (for singleplayer only).\nThanks for reading. Hope it will help you get to an idea about the game from my perspective.\nAt first I was sceptic about the whole game not being open world, because I played every title in the Red Faction series.\nWhere the first is my favorite (PS2 at the time), than Guerrilla and Red Faction 2 the worst.\nPlaying through Red Faction Armageddon removed any negative thoughts before playing the game and had allot of fun.\nThat's it for now.","December 15, 2014","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game continues the "Red Faction" story, but there is plenty of thing I consider awesome and some are not that much. I'll try to make it short.\n\nGood stuff:\n\n-Things still go boom as in previous parts of this saga and it's fun to watch.\n-I liked the weapons selection in this part of the game even more than in "Guerrilla".\n-Good interface and as always, so is the music.\n-Nano-forces are sometimes unnecesary, but the "Repair" one really helps a lot.\n-I liked the ambient of this game.\n\nMeh stuff:\n\n-You have to listen to your AI all the time.\n-No jetpack. Where is my jetpack? It's not really essencial in game, but it wouldn't hurt to have one.\n-Main story is pretty meh. This game series is about fighting for your freedom and not about killing aliens. There is "Dead Space" series to do that if you are feeling like it. And you'll spend most time of the game doing preciselly that... Killing aliens. It's getting a bit boring after some time.\n-Coop is a good idea, but... It's a big meh in this game, considering it's all about blowing stuff up or killing aliens.\n-Escort missions... Who wouldn't like these, right?\n\nSucky stuff:\n\n-First of all and this is very important... If you are looking forward into roaming the Mars freely, blowing stuff up and doing secondary missions from time to time like in good old "Red Faction: Guerrilla", you ain't getting that in this game. Armageddon is completelly lineal, from start to the end and it's ruining the ambient badly. Yes, I know... First and second (Second is pretty bad, by the way, just ignore it's even existed) parts of "Red Faction" are lineal as well, but these games give you some space for improvising freely, at least. You still need to get from point "A" to point "B", but at least you are not held by invisible hand of the developer, pushing you constantly to the point where you should be. "Guerrilla" was a revelation for me, a masterpiece, a demolitionman wet-dream. This game failed to deliver that.\n-Glitches, bugs and crashes. Not really constant but you'll identify one immediatly if you see it.\n-Your guns are unmoddable. You can just use salvage to give yourself some passive skills... Yeah.\n-The stupidity of main character amazes me deeply.\n-Point 5, because other 2 colums had 5 points. Actually point 4 isn't needed as well, but it's a fair point.\n\nSo, in my personal opinion, the game itself is enjoyable and fun for some time... Untill you'll get tired of smashing bugs and playing as a poopoo-head of main character, blaming yourself for the stupid things he is programmed to do. So... It's a solid 7/10.\n\nAnd by the way... When THQ went bancrupt, "Nordic Games" bought the rights for "Red Faction" series. I don't think they'll ever get to read the reviews on steam and less, my reviews (Even I don't care about my reviews), but guys... PLEASE... Please do the right thing and when you'll work on next "Red Faction" game, make the world free to explore. Every gamer in the world would masturbate furiously on that, I can assure you that.

It's very linear compared to it's predecessor RFG, but it maintains much of the destructibility of the scenery, with even more awesome guns like plasma cannons, lasers, and even a black hole generator.\n\nThe plot is simple and predictable. Approximately 0 feels were felt throughout any of the story, and just as many craps were given as to what would happen next.\n\nSometimes you need to play a game that involves getting in a massive alien walker and going on a destructive rampage across an alien planet.\n\nThe aliens are hardly innovative, with little Zerglings rushing you, Hydralisks throwing spines from far away, Nydus Worms sending hordes of monsters at you until you kill them, Ultralisks that rush you and smack you around until they blow up, and Spore Cannons that spread Creep that buffs all the aliens while shooting giant balls of Kool-Aid at you. Not to mention the Queen who has several weak points that you have to hit while dodging adds, fire breath, and grabbing ammo from all the guns that just happen to be lying around.\n\nGraphics? Pretty damn amazing.\n\nReplayability? Nah, you unlock pretty much everything one time through.\n\nI recommend this game, but I'm absolutely on the fence.

First of all its not open world, you are stuck in some hellhole fighting ALIENS?! In the previous Red Faction games you had to fight or defend a corrupt government: the EDF. But now some aliens... Secondly it is sooo linear, you HAVE to do the objective properly! The only thing that made me have more than a half hour on this game is the rebuilder and the magnet thingy. Volition you have dissapointed most of us with this game. Can you at least change it's name to: Underground Aliens or something please. I mean even the title say "Faction" in it.

The gameplay is linear once again, breaking away from the open world of Guerrilla.  The destruction element is still there, but less so than any other Red Faction game I remember. You still get to tear down buildings, but now it seems that many of them are mission objectives that are placed intentionally. The weapons are fairly creative and fun to use, I really liked the gravity gun.  Storywise, I didn't feel like it tied into any of the other releases in the franchise, like they could have easily taken all the Red Faction names and characters out of the game and it wouldn't have changed things at all.

The design of Armagedon  feels very old school, not many cutscenes and the levels actully give you a bit freedom to explore areas  unlike in most games nowaday, it also features a great variaty of weapons, from guns that shoot mini black holes to giant laser rifles which can burn an entire building down.

Again, because of the B-level of the Red Faction franchise as a whole, I suspect players and reviewers went into Armageddon already thinking it was going to suck. Well, that's the wrong expectation to have if you want to enjoy something, and, quite frankly, it doesn't suck. It just doesn't measure up to Guerilla, due to it being a linear Third Person Shooter that takes you to the opressive caverns beneath the surface of Mars. So, no, it's not better then Guerilla. It is, however, much better then Red Factions 1 and 2, and if you were engaged in Guerilla's plot and have seen the Origins film that ties these two games together, you will have sympathy for the Mason family and their plight, and will enjoy the game that much more. At a basic level, it has an array of satisfyingly destructive weaponry and even allows you to reconstruct destroyed buildings with the NanoForge device- so you can blow them up all over again. There's also co-op survival.","February 13, 2012","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure you can upgrade your weapons and your super awesome wristband fixer ♥♥♥♥ and also you can break stuff around you with Volition's awesome Geo Mod 2.5 physics engine and see things break and explode to pieces and then fixing it all up, but other then that the characters are just not interesting enough to even care about them.

But it has some memorable parts like a Red Faction 1 references like there's this one time the main character will talk about some Martian Revolution or the Miner Uprising and Ultor the head of the mining complex and some other ♥♥♥♥ like that, bring back some pretty good memories. But you just can't beat the first Red Faction not even Red Faction Gurilla or Red Faction 2 can beat the first Red Faction but Red Faction 2 ain't all that bad but still can't beat Red Faction 1.

It took them 4 games to create the engaging, visceral, destructive experience they were going for here and with the culmination of all of the lessons they have learnt, Violition has managed to create the most empowering third person shooter ever. Stasis in this game makes Isaac Clarke look like a noob, it not just stops enemies but drains their health and replenishes yours. The Mechs from F.E.A.R. were awesome? Nope, they cant quite charge through a wall, crush all the enemies in the way and cause the building they just went through to collapse. What's a gravity gun again? The Magnet gun is my favourite gun ever (along side the Portal Gun). This is the power-fantasy any crazy like me has been waiting for. Sniper shooting at you? Shoot a magnet at the base and another at the roof. The base flies upwards into the roof and the whole thing implodes and then collapses. Survive that! Boss fights consist of throwing the boss around the enviroment or pieces of the environment at them until they are impaled by debris and their body parts scatter with a gratifying splat. The campaign does get tedious towards the end though, with one long mission underground with no destructible environments and the story takes itself more seriously than I can. But Horde mode and a free form destroy everything 'Ruin Mode' provides some online fun. Valve better start working on Half Life 3 or everyone is just gonna rip off the old games and forget about them. R.I.P.

This does away with all the sandbox elements and sticks to a more linear campaign based shooter. This works very well, the destruction is much more fun as sometimes its required to progress and your primary in buildings rather then standing outside killing everyone with thermobaric rocket launchers. The guns are very fun, the upgrade system is great and it has a horde type up to 4 player co-op wave mode.

The player can tear down any building he so wishes and in this new (and perhaps final) iteration of THQ's long running franchise, buildings can now be restored. But is this gimmick enough?\n\nManipulating buildings isn't the sole gameplay at work here. Armageddon is a third person shooter that plays similarly to any typical third person shooter in the market. Even more generic is its plot that revolves around the uprising of an alien species that threatens human life on Mars.\n\nMy biggest grievances though are the removal of Guerrilla's open world. As a consequence, Armageddon is a very linear affair. That's not to say it isn't a blast, but more freedom might have made the game much more engaging.\n\nArmageddon isn't "Game of the Year" material, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't fun.

On its own its a "good" that's plenty of fun to play, as long as you forget about Red Faction: Guerilla. For me RFG was a defineing moment in gaming. I would pend hours destroying buildings and repairing them (with a mod). Its open world of Mars was well done and a sequel was something I wanted very badly. Sadly, it never came.\n\nArmageddon is literally the opposite of RFG. Set in tunnels and completely linear. That isn't a bad thing in itself, but following its open world cousin, its just a constant reminder of what was. The major issue with the linear, enclosed nature of the game is that Geo Mod just didn't work as well as it did in an open world setting.\n\nBottomline, its a linear third-person action game and in that respect its fun. Those who prefer that to an open world game I definitly recommmend this game. If you in anyway wanted a sequel to RFG, Armageddon is still fun, but depressing at the same time. Its not a bad game, just not the game RFG fans (like myself) wanted and it goes to great lengths to remind you of that fact.\n\nI have to be fair and recommend this game, but in truth I am on the fence with it.","December 22, 2013","true","55.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is very captivating and I love the large array of weapons that you can choose from. This game seems to always keep me on my feet, shooting aliens here, one there, it is constantly making me energetic. I have only put 2 hours into the game and I have only reached 20% of the entire story mode, which means that there is a fairly long story. Even after I get done with the single player campaign, there is 2 OTHER multi-player modes that I can play. The graphics look very crisp and nice. I like how (most) the world is fully destructable, using my Maul I can tear down walls or any various obsticles that stand in my way. I will probably find myself playing this game when I complete it again because this is a very nice title. I am concidering playing the other Red Faction games because people have said that this was the game that ruined the entire series. I don't know what made this game so much worse for the Red Faction series. I like to play shooters and adventure titles, this was a very nice game for me to pick up, it is a 3rd person action adventure shooter title that takes place in the future years. I am not extremely far in the story yet so I don't exactly have a really good standpoint as to what's going on in the game's storyline. I would reccomend this to someone who hasn't played any other Red Faction titles because it seems to me that Red Faction players seem to hate this game. The game really doesn't seem that repetative to me, but sometimes it can be. It's not as bad as Dead Island but it can get that way sometimes. I don't die normally, I have only died once and that was on accident. I have the difficutly at Normal setting so if it were me, I'd set it to hard or something above Normal for someone looking for a little harder AI to fight against. I'd give this game a rough 8.9/10 it's a great title if you want a 3rd person shooter kind of like Gears of War.","February 9, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, you can transfer abilities from the story over to the multiplayer!\n\nThe amount of weaponry and gear at your disposal is awesome, and the fact that you can not only interact (destroy) your environment, but you can then repair the environment too with the Nano Forge and the help of S.A.M (your Situational Awareness Module). Another point to raise is the fact that the Nano Forge, weaponry and armour are all upgradeable which means there is no linear path to follow, however you can choose which path to take.\n\nIf i was EVER to give a game 10/10, this is it.\n\n10/10.","January 3, 2014","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think it's better than Guerilla, but there isn't an open world. It's a linear Third Person Shooter, but great all the same.","May 21, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one is trying to be like Gears Of War.

The Destructable enviorment is an amazing concept but they lost some steam with swapping from streamlined story in the first two then sandbox in guerilla then back to streamline in armageddon. Has amazing storyline even if some parts can be a bit expected. Excellent use of multiplayer and is at least worth one playthrough","January 5, 2014","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

FPSs with checkpoints ♥♥♥♥ me off.  Story is muddy, boring, didn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the characters or setting.  Protagonist is the same generic, square-jawed, tough-as-nails spare-me-the-nerd-talk-lets-just-kick-some-♥♥♥ machoman that has been the norm for these kinds of games for the last ten years.  Game encourages you to explore and find goodies, but then slaps you if you wander too far with popups such as, "WARNING: YOU ARE LEAVING MISSION AREA RETURN IN 3..2.."  Expect myself to eventually just turn on all cheats and then run around blowing everything up until I get bored and shelve the game or beat it, whichever comes first.","December 13, 2012","false","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is incredibad, and the characters are all pretty tired archetypes. There are moments where the game is pretty awesome, mostly when it lets you play around with destroying stuff. If it's cheap, go ahead and grab it.","April 20, 2013","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
