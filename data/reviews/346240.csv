I really been looking forward to seeing a tycoon in this area for some time and for a short time the game is a neat idea. But thats the theory. This game has quite a few problems that is unknown if they will get fixed.\n\nOnce a day every day (It's hard to know if its by day, basicially its whenever the daily quarter is over) you will have stacks of skiers go to the top of your staging area, only to go all the way back down to the bottom and exit the park through any terrain imaginable. Plus there is not very many things  to build (Why no hotels? Bus or airports? Taxi service? Multiple kinds of vehicles for each building type?)\n\nAt first you are confused, and if you like me start off in sandbox, you will probably (maybe not all will) need to go to campaign and try a few missions to understand the basics. You won't learn much, the tutorials are rushed. Each map designed is poor, no random generating maps so you will have to pick the same maps over and over if you play the game for some time (low replayability), skiers look bugged (If you place a lift wrong the skiers will take the lift downhill and attempt to slide down the hill upwards which makes them stuck), and you make little income from the skiers. Charge too much, less will come.\n\nIn some games this might just be the challenge, but after some time you realize you can't afford what you need to run the park in the first place. So you constantly restart in the hopes you attract more customers. But then you realize all of you skiers are stuck in one spot so you let them stack up hoping they will die only for the next day they magically decide they can go through four mountain passes on skis and snowboards through forests and nothing but dry land and pulling out your hair wanting to grab your screen and throw it across the room while yelling "Stop SCAMMING ME". Yea, sorry,  pro and cons.\n\nPro\n\nPotential\n\nQuite a few maps and some hidden bonus ones apparently\n\nCons\n\nSmall maps (Lower graphics requirements should mean bigger map capability in todays age)\n\nBugged Skiers\n\nBugged lifts\n\nNot many building options\n\nMust spam same buildings (What, I need fifty small 10 car garages in the same spot)\n\nNeed more ways to make income and attract tourists (HOTELS)\n\nSlope creation mechanics look barbaric (Looks like something a child would draw.)\n\nNot enough information sometimes to determine why you are not getting or losing customers.\n\nLow graphics (This can be turned into a pro but at this time and stage the game is just so limited that it should have been put on better graphics. Now if the game is really expanded than I would accept the game in this condition but really, it does not deserve to be placed higher.)\n\nRandom bugs (I think the game has issues running on more powerful machines but so far no crashes for me, just random error messages every once in awhile.)\n\nMap scrolling issues (sometimes in tutorial or when starting a new map the game prevents you from zooming out very far so you see a very small stretch of map that you have a hard time doing anything with. Trying a different map fixes the problem.\n\nThe game has a few issues that are difficult to reproduce so the bugs are not really a problem the developers will have a easy time fixing. But it should be run a little bit more before releasing.  Also I played this game for a couple of hours. The game personally should be played in small doses. I would not recommond this game unless you love tycoon games and want to catch them all (oops wrong game).  And for those who want to bash me for not playing more for the review, well, I'm sorry but the game is just too simple. It's not like dragon age, in this game you see all your options in the beginning of the game, not halfway through it. You don't research new things. You don't craft. You just build a few buildings and hope for success. Simple\n\nAlso, how come there is no town interaction? Or even town growth or anything that we can do in that line that would increase our customer growth?","February 4, 2015","false","1.9"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","27","36","0","0"

Black screen at startup, BUT the game works well in WinXP SP3 Compatibility Mode!\nI can recommend this to anyone who likes building and managing ski resorts and can give an old-style tycoon game a chance, which takes maybe 1-2 hours to learn. Tutorial worked not so well or was I too dumb - so I started sandbox mode (you have achievements though) an read everything I needed in the well-detailled Help-menu,\nGraphics are nice, Controls are a bit strange and not configurable - e.g. inverted mouse-wheel for zomming in/out of the map. The Sound is a boring elevator-style track - please add some kind of ski-resort-like music. On the other hand absolutely no severe bugs.\nGameplay is ok, but sometimes you are doing nothing but running 4x speed + watching the hourly changing statistics (which have the right measure). 8x or 16x Speed option would be nice for that reason.\nThe economy system is another matter. The right number of Parking lots is extremely important for the balance -especially at the beginning of a game- as they cost a very huge amount of money per hour and can so decide if you win or lose money. They also limit the max. amount of visitors per day. This is okay if you know it, but quite strange. They should definitely be bit cheaper in the easy mode. Then there is the bad reputation value, which seems to be a horrific multiplicator for any small problem in the resort. Furthermore the Grooming Garages are preparing too small spots on the slopes, so you need very much of them, there should at least be a bigger garage available with multiple  vehicles.\nBut I have some fun with the game, really!\nBuy a cheap key or here at discount, for â‚¬ 5 you get great value!","October 21, 2015","true","19.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It took me a few tries to get a hang of things, but once I was finally able to get a park up and running and was able to make a profit, I was hooked. There are a few things about that game that can be a little bit frustrating at times such as "finishing" a slope or selecting a specific building or lift in order to check stats or build slopes.\n\nFor only $10 I think this game is a great Ski Park simulation and I hope that one day we see an upgraded version game of this type.","February 6, 2015","true","12.4"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

First of all they should add terain parks it would be great if they did that frestyle and halfpipe are auch a big part of skiing now. Second of all i would lov if the snow were more realistic like 5 inches of snow comes down its still dirt after mltiple snowfalls you basicly have to rely on snowmaking. Third of all please add hotels it would be great so more people could come to you resort. Overall fun game but add terain parks.","March 6, 2015","true","97.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You can design your own resort, how you like. There are very little restrictions unlike many other simulation games. If you like skiing and or tycoon games, then this is for you. The game is simple and easy to use and well worth the cheap price.\n( The game can be confusing at the start so here are a few tips:\n- Skier happiness is key in a profitable resort, this should be your number one priority\n- Food, shelter and Rest are essential to skier happiness, make sure skiers can get all 3 at every lift station\n- Keep the lifts and restaurants at under 20% of people saying they are too expensive\n- Make sure lift queues are not long mid day (there will always be queus at the start of the day)\n- Close lifts and restaurants with very few/no customers until more skiers arrive to cut costs\n- Upgrade service quality and you can charge higher prices for the same running costs\n- Follow these steps and you can't go to far wrong )","December 29, 2015","true","4.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I would definetely recommend to anybody that has a love for skiing or just designing a resort.\n\nPros\n1. Unlimited Mode is very fun\n2. All around great game that has no severe bugs that stand out\n3. Free Ride is an excellent feature that allows you to enjoy the resort\n\nCons\n1. Campaign too hard\n2. Skiers get stuck in some situations and all go into a huge clump\n3. Lifts don't have realistic range and they can't go over blocked terrain, in most cases\n\nThings to Add (In order of importance)\n\n1. Ski Patrol needs to be improved\n2. Unlimited mode unlocked from start\n3. Map Editor would be very helpful, or just a tutorial on how to make your own and put it into the files yourself\n4. Add more lifts such as a Triple Chair, High Speed Quad, and High Speed Six. Also add mid-stations and down-loading for gondolas and such\n5. In unlimited mode, skiers cannot fall and get injured\n6. Can choose whether terrain is blocked or not\n7. An option to make the run colors Green for beginner, Blue for intermediate, and Black for advanced/expert\n8. Make unlimited mode available on the addon maps\n9. More run types (Double Green, Double Blue, Double Black)\n10. More buildings such as a lodge, a sit-down restaraunt, hotels, cabins, stores, and walkways\n11. Make bridges to allow runs to go over or under a road\n12. Terrain Parks\n13. Exposed rocks to make realistic chutes and an option to make a bowl (A zoning tool to drag and area that is a bowl)\n14. In free ride, you should be able to actually be on the lift, not just zipping to the top of it\n15. Ability to create more roads\n16. An option before starting a game to have the map full with trees, some trees, or no trees (I love trees and I have to fill the whole map with them so I can have the trees :)\n\nOverall, awesome game. You did a really good job on this and I wan't to see this game do really well. Thanks!!","March 28","true","62.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

What I really like about this game over others is that there is very little bothering about with the village, fiddling about with hotel prices is not what I want. It isnâ€™t though only based on the slopes as restaurants and shelters need to be built to be successful. What I also really like in this game is that instead of people appearing at one point in the map isnâ€™t in this game. Instead each map is generated with roads and car parks can be placed at any location flat enough to do so. 90% of the people then spawn at one of these car parks with the rest thought the day. Another thing I really like is the proper animations of people getting on and off chair/drag lifts (cable cars donâ€™t have any animations) instead of teleporting. Personally I really recommend this game to anyone considering it. For anyone wondering about play time I now have 60 hours on this game, I have finnished the campign for the game and am about 20% of the way through the seperate senarios. There are also some addons (senarios but with real world locations) which I havnt even started on.","February 10, 2015","true","336.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","3"

It sadly is not even as good as that one and it is many years older than this.  The graphics are very weak.  The controls are flaky at best.  If it had solid game play, I could look past all this.  The campagin lacks depth and imagination.  You do the same thing over and over.  I' ve really enjoyed tycoon games.  Sadly, there has not been a good one to come out in years.  The theme of this game has so much potential.  Think about snowboard courses, lodges, ski lesson booths, ski rentals, etc.  So many possibilites and not once has it been tapped.  I was hoping this would be a gem in the rough, Sadly, just a rock.","February 20, 2015","false","5.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

No one should have to downgrade their nvidia card driver. This game should be taken off steam until it is fixed. With that said I did change the card driver. This game has very little to do in it. There are very few buildings and you take a very small role in creating a lift chair and adding slopes. The create slope mechanic is straight forward but very limited. Trails need to go from top to bottom starting at the end a chair lift and ending at the start of a chair lift. Due to this alot of terrain is wasted. The role of the player in maintaining the resort is very limited as well. You can add a snow gun and place a snow cat garage. The maps you work with are also small.\n\nOverall there is potential here but the game just misses. For $10 I would not recommend this game, for $.99 - 5.00 you will get an hour of almost fun out of it.","February 14, 2015","false","1.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"
