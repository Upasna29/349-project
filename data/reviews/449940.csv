That ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Is Trying To Steal Our Gold ! (Or "That ♥♥♥♥ Trying To Steal Our Gold", the developer can't even decide the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ title) is one of worst titles Steam has offered in a long time.\n\nWonky controls, repetitive music that never changes and a laughable option menu are the symptoms that you simply regret buying this game.\n\nThe levels offers nothing impressive, it's just a small map with the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ background where you have to obtain all "Gold" (Whatever these are) pieces and then return to where you came from. Sounds similar to what Battleblock Theater does with the Diamonds but this one is much, much worse than that (I can't believe I'm comparing this game to Battleblock Theater.\n\nIt's worth noting that the developer has released other titles as bad as this one yet at least placed more effort than this. But I still can't believe how these games get released from Greenlight when other worthy titles are stuck there forever.\n\nSeriously if you just want to have a good time buy Battleblock Theater instead.\n\nP.S: The developer added an announcement about having brain cancer and asked people to buy this game, moments later he deleted it due to backlash reaction from the community. Luckily, you can read the whole message if you own the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=663256503","April 10","false","0.8"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","23","25","3","2"

Figure out how to use the dynamite to get all of the gold and then try to make your way back to where you started. The slow paced music doesn't help things either. I got this off of a bundle so I wasn't expecting much but the regular $2.99 going price sure doesn't look worth it.","April 23","false","0.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

This game is basicaly an add on to CS:GO which is already a decent game, but this game tops it. This game is probobly my favorit shooter ever. Just saying but this game helped me not kill myself and helped me stop cutting. Now that I own this game my parents respect me living inside of their basement. Also top sountrack ever, I think this game should get a game of the year award for best concept.

They were more concerned  about  calling those  who thought the game was okay.  I  wasn't sure whether to believe the  story the developer had posted on the  sales page, but purchased the game  anyway as I do like  platformers and it was  very cheap at only £1.99\n\nContrary to the  naysayers (one of which thinks anyone who likes this is  basically a simpleton) I enjoyed playing it for well over an hour.  It's pretty basic graphic wise, with a retro feel to it and there's no bells or whistles included.  The basic premise is to steal  gold from the Leprechauns dungeons (I though the  gold  looked like  golden delicious apples), picking up extra dynamite  on the way.  Once you've collected everything you then need to  escape the level through it's portal.\n\nTo access many of the gold sacks you need to blast away at the  walls and floors/platforms that block your way but the   levels become    increasingly  challenging as you progress.  The dynamite needs to be used sparingly; even with the extra sticks  Care needs to be taken when using  the dynamite when  destroying walls  to gain access to the gold because you may destroy your only  way to  gain access to  your escape route.\n\nFor me it had everything   I needed to enjoy the game,  that is  challenging  levels (apart from the early ones), no  fuss graphics and dynamite.  :)\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI22oaQ5Up4\n\n\n\nI will add more   once I've played the game   for a few more  hours (maybe soon maybe much later)","April 5","true","1.8"," 15 of 44 people (34%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","34","15","44","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/negationix/recommended/449940/","negationix","Negationix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/negationix/","738 products in account","Pretty basic platformer / puzzler game, dime a dozen really. Best part for me was the nice, unobtrusive music, although it's a bit repetitive. Goal of the game is to steal gold (which looks like apples, like so many other has pointed out) and clear path with dynamite. Since you have only limited amount of dynamite and have to return to starting position after collecting all the gold, you can't blast everything in level. With some planning you'll be able to clear enough blocks to reach all the gold, while leaving still a path back to starting position.\n\nGraphics is pretty usual, 3d with a little bit lighting thrown in the misc. Reminded me a lot of early 2000 platformers. Controls aren't as solid as they could be, but good enough that you can navigate around the levels without too many problems. Lack of time limit makes the game perfect for relaxed playstyle and I suspect it's easy enough to start the game and play couple of levels now and then. Pace is slow and new elements aren't introduced too quickly.\n\nNot my favourite game, and I got bored really soon. A little bit polish and it could be decent.","May 1","false","0.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","1"
