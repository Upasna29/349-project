I liked how it moved me in the direction I was looking ever so slowly.  It's worth the money if you enjoy self-meditation, as I do.  The latest update allows it to work on both Oculus and Vive.  UPDATE:  In response to Cyrix, I'll just say that time seems to slow down when you're in Gravity Compass.  6 Minutes feels like 60  : )","May 10","true","0.5"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","1"

It says "Level One" when you start but I have no earthly idea how to get to level 2.  I floated to every galaxy I could find but nothing happens.  I play as many galaxies as possible by looking at as many as I can and still nothing.  I'm not sure what's supposed to happen here (if anything).  Some guide or expectations should be set in steam so we know a little of what's to expect.  I'm not sure if I can consider this a game really.  Maybe I'm missing something...","May 14","false","0.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","7","9","3","0"

I did have 2 issues with it.  1. the dot didnt go away once the game was started which broke the immersion a bit always having a white dot exactly where I wanted to look and 2. I was unable to change the graphics beyond 1176x664 even tho it appeared like I should be able to run the slider down to select higher values, the selector dot just went behind the slider bar and did not affect it in any way.  I was able to change down to 640x480 or anything inbetween the two visible extremes, just couldnt get it to scroll down for higher values.\n\nBoth issues seemed like easy enough fixes, so no points deducted for them :)\n\nThe visuals are very nice and if your looking for something calming for people to try who otherwise might not want to venture into shooters or scary games this is a good deal for 2 bucks.\n\nThis is a sit down game that uses the keyboard/mouse according to the description, but I was unable to use the keyboard and mouse to do much (and I tried the mouses scroll wheel to try to change the resolutions and the arrow keys with no luck.\n\n","May 13","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Anybody who ever watched the media player visualisations to music will be familiar with the  premise. If you've watched the sequence in 2001 a Space Odyssey with the space ship approach to the majestically spinning space station (and if not why not?) this is probably for you. Its pretty and relaxing - but it goes nowhere and does nothing - while I can see the appeal of walking through a galaxy of stars, this is a sit down simulation, so not sure what the point would be in VR. I think you need to go somewhere, be taken on a journey through those spiral arm galaxies and feel like there might be a destination, like watching the galaxies birth.  I confess to not being keen on the music provided. Vangelis music for Cosmos from the Heaven & Hell album or something classical feels like it might be a better fit.  The ability to switch the music for something trance like of your choice would be a future improvement I'd make.  On the plus side, it ran wall without stutter and the mouse can guide your path but you can't speed up or slow down the gliding motition. Cons: it needs to be higher res. (I ran it using my monitors native resolution and it made the white blobs a bit intrusive.) Well worth it for the money as a relaxing way to chill out at the end of a stressful day light some fragrant diffuser candles and go and lay on the bed and watch it would be my advice.  will be interesting to see if Nova makes more levels and what they do with them.  (And undersea journey? A flight through the clouds from dawn to sunset? From earth through the  clouds and into space and beyond our galaxy? The possibilities are endless!) This is officially my new favourite waste of time!","May 14","true","0.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

Worth a try with this music:)\nI would even have added some sort of "autopilot" mode, where you could just sit and watch, riding from galaxy to galaxy...\nThe technical side looks good, the images, colors, shapes, effects are beautiful, low on frame rate, very smooth with no stutter. Use it on a standard monitor, no VR yet, but had to struggle a bit because of the default resolution (320x200) way too low, that makes the texts unreadable (using Win10). Everything Ok after setting 1920x1080, but tricky to find the way when texts are unreadable:)\nNow, I would say what all other comments state also: what's next ?\nThis is a good conceptual demonstrator for such kind of galactic immersion, but it lacks some sort of story or mission, which is still to invent. Curently, difficult to categorize it as a game, a simulation, a relaxation tool ... or something else ?\nLet's wait and see what the designers will propose next, but I find it to be a good entertainement driver for the moment.","May 15","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
