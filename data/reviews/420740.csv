You spend the first part of the game wandering the house and talking with your family while searching for weapons to use for the murder or for evidence to plant, and then after taking two items you move into the murder phase, in which you use the items you picked up to try to set up a murder that pushes the blame away from you. It's a simple game, but the different items and locations do just enough to lend a bit of creativity to it. If you just go for a successful murder and leave it at that you'll probably finish the game fairly quickly, but the fun of it is doing various things just to see what happens. You can challenge yourself by trying to get away with killing your sister with your bare hands, or see what the inspector says when you show up to the interview with things like your sister's underwear. It's not the deepest or the longest game, but for $1 The Deed is a pretty neat little diversion.","January 3","true","1.2"," 35 of 45 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","35","45","4","0"

Basically your job is to try to engineer the perfect murder without getting caught. You do this by exploring the home for items you can use to implicate others in the murder. Who you choose to speak to, what you say, where you go, etc all have consequence on the final outcome.\n\nProsWell-made - Good production values and plays well.\nNice graphics - You do get a sense you're really in an old mansion exploring the rooms.\nFun - Very immersive and enjoyable because you are eager to see whether you get away with things.\nMany different configurations - E.g. Choose whether or not to talk to different people, what to say to them if you do, what weapon to use, what evidence to plant, etc.\nMany different endings - E.g. Do you end up in jail? Or frame your father for the murder? Or maybe the maid? Etc.\nFresh premise - How often do you get to play a game where the objective is to kill someone you've always hated and frame someone else for it?!\nSome good exploration - Interact with items to experience flashbacks on some.\nConsGets repetitive - After the first play, it sort of loses its charm, and your sole purpose becomes engineering a different ending from what you initially got.\nNot very logical - Real-life murders aren't really solved like that; the investigating officer never considers that evidence may have been planted by someone else.\nThe butler looks too young - He's supposed to be near retirement age for god's sake, but his picture makes him look 30 at most!\nToo short - 10 minutes. What can I say?\nStory too sparse - Could've done with more content, more characters, more possibilities.\nI grabbed this at S$0.67 (~US$0.47) so no real complaints. At least the quality of this game was good, and the overall experience was enjoyable. I wouldn't pay more than US$0.50 for this though, as it's just way too short.

Son, Arran, soon to be disinherited (usurped by his sister) with murder on his mind.  Father, Malcolm, violent tempered, oppressive, abusive.  Mother, Gloria, in deep and utter denial of the dysfunctional Bruce family.  Sister, Jennifer, violent, cruel, insane and about to die.  Dunshiel House staff: one butler and one maid/cook.\nA classic "who-dun-it" from the murder's point of view.\n\nStoryline:  Estranged Arran Bruce returns home for his father's 50th birthday with the sole purpose to murder his sister, Jennifer.  Motive: Money, of course.  The father, Malcolm, is about to disinherit him in favor of his sister.  The question is: How to commit murder and still walk away a free man.  10 murder weapons, and 5 other people who can take the blame, assuming one does not get caught.  Of course, there is always the "mysterious" intruder too. (Lizzie Borden will have good company if one manages that.)\n\nOne ending and multiple ways to get there.\n\nBasic gameplay:\nStart the evening by arriving at Dunshiel House and briefly chat with the maid.  (Remember everything one says to anyone, now and later, can and will be used against them.)  Keep the coat or give it to the maid.  Talk to the family or ignore them.  Talk to the servants or ignore them too.  Relive some memories or not.  Choose the weapon, find the evidence then go to dinner.  Make a scene, be cordial, make pointed observations.  All in preparation for the murderous deed.\n\nAfter dinner plant the evidence then commit murder.\nNote: Game mechanics only allows for one murder weapon plus bare hands and one piece of incriminating evidence to be planted somewhere in the house.  However, if the player choses bare hands the "murder" weapon will still be on their person.  Nor does evidence have to be planted which also will be found on their person when the Inspector arrives.\n\nDuring the interview, there is a physical search, so if there is a weapon or evidence still on their person there had better be a very good explanation.  After the interview the verdict is handed down, and the player discovers if they got away with murder or not.\n\nTwo brief scenerios from my own gameplay:\nMy favorite scenerio was having both a murder weapon (the fencing sword) and evidence (the tawse) on my person when the interview began and still framing the father for murder.  (I framed the father often and usually inherited everything only for Arran to somehow develope a huge conscious which made everything bleak and despairing.)  (Well murder is wrong and framing someone else even more so, so I guess the developers did not want the player to forget that.)\n\nMy best and most apropos scenerio was the sister's "suicide" with a mirror shard.  Reason: unrequited love for the maid.  That was a bit tricky since if done incorrectly the unassuming maid was framed.\n\nHas all the makings of the board game Clue ,,, only in reverse.   A clever game with a clever premise and multiple ways to get away with murder.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/420740/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","The Deed is a RPG Maker game with a traditional murder mystery setting. The story revolves around Arran Bruce who recently discovers that his abusive father removed him from his Will in favour of his cruel sister to inherit the family belongins. Furious about this, he decides to eliminate his sister in order to restore his own, rightful, inheritance.\n\nThe gameplay is all about getting away with the murder of Arran’s sister and trying to blame someone else for it. The player has the choice of who to talk to, what topics to discuss in conversations, which evidence to plant, the method of murder and how to handle the interview when interrogated at the end. Consequently, the paths chosen influence the final outcome (e.g. the ending), and that is all there is to its very minimal gameplay. Generally, a single playthrough takes roughly about 20-30 minutes at normal pace with all rooms fully explored and every possible conversation exhausted. In other words, it is all about solving the one single puzzle: getting away with murder. As a result, the game has a replayability value until the player discovers all the possible methods of committing the crime (while being undetected and without people being suspicious) and various endings. Likewise, this is good news for any achievement hunters who want to achieve 100% completion as it is very easy to accomplish it.\n\nAdmittedly, the writing is nothing terrific, and most of it is forgettable anyway, but it is enough to provide context for the puzzle. The very few set-pieces such as the flashblacks are a nice touch since they provide some backstory, aside from simply talking with other people, but that is as deep as the story can get, which is not a lot. Then again, the game’s length is extremely short after all, therefore there is hardly time to expand the story. Ultimately, The Deed is clearly not a purely story-driven game. As mentioned previously, it is all about solving the one puzzle.\n\nThe visuals are on par with what anyone should expect from a RPG Maker game. Thankfully, the game does not bluntly rely on stock assets which makes it stand out amongst the majority of half-hearted RPG Maker games out there, but as a whole it is clearly not as stunning as something like To The Moon, as far as RPG Maker games are concerned. It does a somewhat effective use of the dark tone and browny colour pallet to create at least a creepy atmosphere, even if there is nothing remotely creepy or even scary about it. Furthermore, there is no voice acting (as per usual with most RPG Maker games) and the sound effects used are minimal and rather uninspiring. The soundtrack is unmemorable, much like the writing, but does an adequate job in setting up the mood.\n\nIn conclusion, The Deed has a simple but interestingly fun little concept despite everything about it being fundamentally way too basic. The game has clear shortcomings which could have been easily avoided in the first place. For instance, the length could have been greatly improved through the use of more elaborate ways of committing the crime and the atmosphere could have also been enhanced by using eerier sound effects. Evidently, there has been a missed opportunity on expending the story due to both the writing and length letting it down. However, considering the price tag, all of these shortcomings are tolerable in this case since anyone can easily purchase the game for “free” by selling any marketable items in their Steam inventory, thus eliminating any notion of a buyer’s remorse. In actual fact, the game should have been (properly) free in the first place. For a fun fact, I bought the game for 7p during a sale by selling a Steam emoticon.\n\nIf you fancy the concept at least and can lower your expectations, I recommend giving The Deed a shot as it can be fun figuring out a way without being caught, but also mainly because of its price tag. Possibly the shortest, yet forgettable, fun you will ever have in a game.","February 5","true","1.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The game is short (around 15 minutes per run), but figuring out how to frame each member of the family gives it a fair amount of replayability. Given the low price and the short time investment, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone with even a slight appreciation for murder mysteries.\n","January 21","true","2.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/420740/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","The Deed is a puzzle game in where you are tasked with murdering your sister and finding evidence to incriminate one of the house's other residents. You are a disowned son of a wealthy family and you take the opportunity of your arriving to your father's 50th birthday in order to be allowed into the mansion again. As you can tell right off the bat this is a rather grim and serious title with pretty much no humor to be found. The atmosphere of this 1945 era mansion is pretty eerie but in this case you are the monster which is a cool twist to most games. You are given various dialogue choices throughout the game leaving it up to you whether to be a jerk or a seemingly calm, well-mannered person. Be careful though, your choices do have consequences and remember that you are here to pull off a murder so even being too nice is suspicious. Upon entering the house you are able to explore your surroundings and chat with its inhabitants in order to better understand the situation of the house and the tensions between people.\n\nExploring the mansion you will find lots of objects that can be potentially used to murder your sister with like shotguns, glass shards and rope as well as potential evidence like panties or diaries. This is where one of the game's more annoying aspects come into play. Whatever you do don't collect two items as that will automatically teleport you to dinner even if you still need people to talk to or are not ready. This game is separated into three phases, first is the exploration phase afterwards it is the planting evidence and finally the investigation phase. Most of your time will be spent in the exploration phase as that is where you need to figure out the best methods of murder with a two item limit as well as meeting everyone in the house. Everything you do in this phase will have an effect later on even the seemingly meaningless things like what rooms you entered and who you talked to. There is just so much chances to manipulate the situation that is about to occur that you can't help but thinking about all the little flaws that could potentially come back to haunt you, making it a pretty intense and thoughtful experience.\n\nThe second phase is by far the shortest and has you planting your chosen evidence somewhere in the mansion and then murdering your sister afterwards. The final phase has a very observant detective observe the crime scene and you must outsmart him during his interview session with you. All three of these phases combined should take you about 10 to 20 minutes to complete depending on how thoroughly you think things through making this a very short game. The replayability is very high however, since the possibilities of how to evade this murder and gain your inheritance are quite numerous. After completing the game you just can't help but wonder what would have happened if you did things differently or framed someone else that before you know it you are scheming up another plan and restarting the game. It's not randomly generated so it does have a limit to its replayablity since nothing will change if you pick the same options but where the preset items are placed lends to making this house feel lived in and real so random generation may have done more harm than good.\n\nDespite this being a mansion it is really small in game featuring nothing more than a basement and a second story that can very quickly be explored. One small nitpick I have is how far away you are from the doors when entering though that is such a minor detail that you'll stop noticing it in no time. One not so small nitpick is that this game is heavily letter-boxed and most of your screen will be nothing but black while the game itself only takes up a small space in the middle. Some option to stretch to full screen would have been appreciated. Moving on from the technical side of things, your family are all terrible people which is unfortunate since it would have been rather interesting having to murder someone that did you no harm, making you feel like more of a monster. There is no blood or anything of the sort here, when you murder her it just goes to a black screen and a short scream plays out. This is a pretty dark game no doubt and one that really gets you thinking pretty hard on the best way to murder someone which is pretty creepy in itself actually. The Deed was definitely a unique and memorable experience that I'm glad I stumbled upon and at a price point of less than a dollar it is one game I'd recommend to anyone that has the slightest interest in it.","February 28","true","2.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

In fact, my only complaint is that there is nothing left for me to do in-game, and I haven't earned a single card drop. ;)\n\nI picked it up because, why not, it was 49 cents, and the idea of a Clue-esque video game tickled me a bit. Finding the right evidence to plant (and where to plant it) as well as the appropriate murder weapon can take a bit of tinkering, but honestly, the inspector gives away a lot of information during the interrogation. After two or three playthroughs, you'll have a pretty good idea of what implicates who. (Although, it was by chance that I found out that having something on you while you're being searched can be really helpful. You'll feel so smart when you figure that one out. -grin-)\n\nObviously I wish that the game had a little more variance in dialogue, some much-needed mouse/WASD recognition, and a few other small things that would really add some polish. But it's solid as is, and if you have the extra change to toss at it, I would suggest you do so.","December 31, 2015","true","4.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

There is a plethora of weapons to do just that - and a number of items of evidence you can use to pin the crime on members of your family or their staff. There are a number of endings based on if you were successful in your crime, and with what weapons you used and what evidence you placed.\n\nIt gets to the point where if you rush (which is more likely if you're going for multiple endings and you already know the dialog) you can complete the game within five minutes. This is very short which I feel is this game's only downside; but for what you're paying it's no huge deal - it's still a bargain for what it is. I would love to see an extended version or sequel, as I really enjoyed the experience and there's not nearly enough games in this genre.\n\nI recommend this game.","January 24","true","4.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You play a guy who comes from a rich family and you have major problems with your abusive dad, and your psychotic ( and also abusive ) sister. Your dad cuts you out of the will, so on his fiftieth birthday, you return home to see him and celebrate. Only its a ruse. Since he cut you out, your sister is the one inheriting everything. So your goal in this game is to kill her, and not get caught. Whether you blame it on someone else, make it look like a suicide, or get caught on purpose either for the achievement or just for giggles, is entirely up to you. The actual game is only about 10 minutes long but its worth AT LEAST 3 play throughs for someone who will get bored of it quickly, and close to 3-4 hours for someone who wants to experience everything in it. The only real fault I see in this game is that you cant really get a good ending. It's a story where you're FORCED to kill your sister ( theres talk that you can have her put into an asylum, but I havent done this or seen anyone else do it. just heard you can so i wana mention that ) and no matter which of the endings you get and no matter who you frame your character always ends up sad and miserable. Wouldve liked one additional ending that was really hard to get but you end up happy because of it. He finally got revenge on his abusive sister. And if you frame the dad, He got revenge on him too, AND your mom who let the abuse happen for years, as she dies alone now. Not to mention the fortune and mansion he inherits. But thats really the only negative. For its $0.99 price tag, ( it's $0.66 on sale right now ) This is a damn good game. 8.5/10.","January 26","true","4.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The truly novel approach here is that you will play the perpetrator and with limited time and information at hand, go about committing "The Deed" of a perfect murder. Think of any classic dinner themed murder mysteries, where your actions and the careful selection of "planted evidence" and "murder weapon" is an endeavour to both commit a perfect crime and frame someone else with your actions. Where generally you would be investigating the crime in a game of this type, the handy switch here has made for a game that is a standout in an otherwise crowded market and some might say, tired genre.\n\nIn a sense this is little more than an advanced version of paper, scissors, rock, simple enough but with enough scope to have you thinking of all the possible combinations and how they might play out. At about 20 minutes in length for a play through it is more than likely you will be playing this one many times over to get the perfect or just most interesting result!\n\nAt this price or indeed the even further reduced sale price that I picked this up for, it is almost a no brainer purchase for anyone who enjoys a mystery themed adventure game, or indeed just anybody looking for a short but entertaining distraction.","January 9","true","1.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

To do this you have to to interact with the characters to learn new opportunities and plant 'evidence' around the house and choose an appropriate murder weapon.\n\nYou'll be suprised on the details the game picks up on during your first few playthroughs. For example I used a knife in the kitchen as the murder weapon, but I talked to the maid in the kitchen, so the police investigator picked up on that deducing I could've potentially taken the knife. After doing the same and not talking to the maid, the police investigator was oblivious to it, only suspecting the maid.\n\nOnce you've played through it a few times and learnt how to manipulate the events of the game, framing your target and minimising suspicion is simple and satisfying.\n\nSome flaws include repeated dialogue getting tedious during your multiple playthroughs.\n","November 25, 2015","true","2.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Your sister's murder. It is played as a sort of RPG from a top-down view in which you are given freedom to explore the large house and collect items. However, in the effort of keeping realistic, you are only allowed to pick up two things, and only the sort of items that a person would actually be able to conceal.\n\nIt is a unique scheme that makes for a fun game. Unfortunately, after several playthroughs, it turns out that it's actually pretty easy to get away with murder. You'll discover what types of objects you need to combine to succeed.\n\nFor example, not quite a spoiler but if you want a hint: If you hide a piece of evidence involving another person, and use a weapon relating to them, they will be successfully framed every time. One such choice would be to hide love letters to the maid in her room, and then use glass from her broken mirror to commit the crime.\n\nI would need to play further to be 100% sure of this, but I do think your dialogue choices matter. In example, I'm pretty sure if you threaten the family then the inspector will make you for the crime regardless of the evidence you plant. However, these dialogue choices are fairly limited and it is usually obvious which one you need to select to seem the least suspicious.\n\nDespite this game being very short, there is definitely a good amount of replay value here. Given that the game is only $0.99, I'd say it is priced quite fairly. I've played many indie games that are just as short as this one and have no replay value, that cost far more.\n\nI recommend it.

I wouldn't know by playing it except for the menu and stuff.\n\nYou Pick two items and from each one has context. This will effect how you can plan to arrange to kill your sister! Example, the shotgun is your father's. Then there are non-weapons which belong to others too and have their own context. You can only pick two, which when chosen immediately goes to the Dinner section.\n\nThe game has four stages: 1:Pre-Dinner Item Collecting, 2:Dinner, 3:Planting Evidence if you want, and killing sister 4: Post-Mortem interview.\n\nThroughout most stages all taking place in most of the same place you interact and this impacts your game. If you don't tell your father Happy Birthday it's not a huge problem but it is suspicious. Each conversation or lack of has some minor or major impact later. In the interview after you plant evidence if you want, and kill your sister [via weapon or hands] you are interviewed by police. I won't spoil this beyond it's funny if you forget to plant evidence or don't use a weapon.... Though you can sometimes get away with it.\n\nGreat game, not long, though worth the price and some good fun replay value especially if you wanna try out specific plans in game to see what happens.\n\nDon't forget what you do! And remember that after you kill, depending on how, you get a limited set of seconds to go to another area and it might be a little difficult knowing where you are when the body is found. Try to learn where the rooms are and their names.\n\nI put rat poison on the sisters after dinner snacks. Forgot to drive her suicidal evidences full on and kept evidence to support it. Still didn't go to jail.\n\n5/5 good art style, great concept, perfect execution, saves anywhere anytime [mostly], and worth the pricing.\n\nJust a bit short if you don't wanna play a bunch of times to experiment.","February 1","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a novel premise with a lot of potential and a good atmosphere brought by the writing and the graphics (which are simple, but have a very well-realized aesthetic). The characterization is solid, and the tone is dark as it should be.\n\nIt's fun to try the different ways to get away with "the deed", and the game uses the choice it gives you in a good way. It's extremely short the first time, but you can try different things for a much longer time until getting bored. Unfortunately, you have to repeat dialogue you have already seen, and there's not that much variation at certain times. After a while, the system behind framing and getting caught becomes more obvious, and if you try to 100% the game, it can become a monotonous task by the end.\n\nAll in all, it's very cheap and gave me a reasonable time of entertainment, so I reccomend it without reservations.

I think thats a pretty good deal. Its a fun little solo game that you can replay here and there on a rainy day. It feels like someones first attempt at a game, or maybe just something they did as a hobby. If it were 5 years ago this would just be a free flash game on Newgrounds or Kongregate or similar, but as it is I'd still say its worth it if you have eighty three cents in your steam wallet and want to play a little something.\n\nIt feels almost like a board game. You make some choices, they play out at the end, and you get a different little ending depending on what you did. Theres a degree of strategy and a degree of luck and chance, and especially your first time through you'll probably muck something up. But its fun. The game tells you exactly what you need to do, and its surprisingly easy to feel somewhat empathetic to the protagonist after a bit. The design of the house is fun and easy, through the character portraits look like something you would see on geo cities while browsing netcape, and a more "drawn" artstyle would surely have served the game better imo.\n\nFun through.

Easy to play and doesn't take long to master.  It is very much like the classic board game "Clue" in that you are in an old estate and there is a murder to be solved.  The only difference is, you are the murderer, trying to get away with the perfect crime.  Numerous weapons allow you to vary your crime and there are various types of incriminating evidence that you can plant in various rooms to pin your heinous crime on any of the NPC's you encounter, including the victim.\n\nYour first few playthroughs can take 15 minutes each as you try to find every little secret in the estate, though each subsequent playthrough takes 5-10 minutes tops.  The replay value is limited to about 2-3 hours though, as that is about how long it should take you to get all endings, and all achievements.\n\nI encountered no bugs or gameplay issues and there is controller support.  My only complaint is the the dialogue is a bit stiff, but it is still entertaining.\n\nFinal Verdict? Because of the low price point, and expectations, I can easily recommend this game.

On the night of his father's birthday party, Arran pays a visit to his parents' manor with the mission to kill his heiress sister and inherit the family fortune.\n\nThe player is given access to the entire mansion with the ability to interact with all NPCs and most objects, with the night progressing through four phases: one to find murder weapons/false evidence/NPCs, a second to eat a birthday dinner with your family, a third to plan and carry out the murder, and a last to answer a detective's questions about your actions and "what you saw". These gameplay elements come together to present a game bearing features of puzzle, social simulation, and exploratory gameplay, all fleshed out and elusive, encouraging the player to experiment with what they say, where they look, and so on. I will say, though, that I wish the game's achievements showed more ingenuity (and less interface spoilers).\n\nThe Deed also shows commendable ambition in its characters, fairly well-developed for a cheap quasi-whodunit cast. More unique than the standard flat caricatures common to the genre, these characters offer concise, vibrant backstories, as well as hidden vulnerabilities to exploit when attempting to relieve your character of culpability. As a character-focused narrative, the game's story benefits greatly from this depth. The Deed is distinguished from other games of its ilk in this regard especially. Unfortunately, this ambition is not without its downfalls; the game's many attempts to be subversive can be hit or miss, and the ones that fall flat, fall flat hard. One prominent example: literally every victorious ending. No matter what the player does, Arran will be haunted by nightmares and feelings of regret for the rest of his life. Topical? Deep? Maybe. Unsatisfying and pretentious? Definitely.\n\nAll in all, The Deed pushed the limits of the murder mystery formula, and left a flawed but satisfying taste in my mouth post-completion. It's a pulpy, casual adventure rich with poisoned food and pointed fingers, with the quality and price of a candy bar. I say try it out!","January 18","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You have to do this by using the correct murder weapon, hiding evidence in the right place and - most important - draw the Police officers attention to one of the family members by directing conversations into the right direction.\nThe game always ends with you being interrogated by the police, and during this interrogation you get a lot of feedback about how the things you did and said during the game influence the outcome of the investigation. This information is vital to do things better the next time, until in the end you will be able to frame the person you want or even let the murder look like a suicide.\nWhile the playtime is very short (you could finish the game in a few minutes), you will most likely play it over and over to find out all possible conversation lines and to find out how far your different behaviour will change the things that happen later.\nThe author has put a lot of work into the conversations and their impact on the investigations, and there is a lot to try out, provided that you are the type of gamer who likes to replay conversations to see how they impact the storyline.\nIt took me 3 hours to find out most (or all?) of the endings and get all achievements, and they were well spent.\nSo for this price I can only highly recommend this game.","February 29","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The one where no one suspects you and you get what you wanted, the estate? You can live out that dream in The Deed, a game where you plot to kill your sister to try and get your father to give you the estate instead.\n\nDespite how short The Deed it, and the fact it is Built RPGMaker, it's a suprisingly good good. The story is quite good and gets the point across, and you also get a good look into the backstory of your character. Figuring out what you need to do to get away with the murder can be tricky, and I still don't think I've seen the "best" ending (I got the estate but the butler and maid quit). In the time I've played it so far, I beat it 4 times, with one of those getting a decent ending. It does get a bit annoying playing through the opening sequence constantly though, and I do wish there was a way to skip it more easily.\n\nConsidering how cheap the game is, The Deed is more than worth what you pay.

The game sets itself up with the bare essentials and it is up to you, the player, to explore further into the game's story. Now what makes this game stand out is how this is optional and how it feels much like a board game such as Cluedo, or even a choose-your-own-adventure book. You have the characters, the premise, the 'clues' and methods. There's multiple ways to approach each event that takes place throughout the day.\n\nWith this, The Deed indeed gives off a natural fruition of replayability and it's unlikely you will succeed in committing the crime the first couple of tries. You should note who you talk to, when you do and for what reason - but be careful - revealing the truth of why you did to any NPCs can alter your chances of being caught or not as they may seem suspicious of your behaviour. Given the natural conflict you have with your father, even being kind can give your purpose away. It truly, truly feels like your choices have actual, permanent changes to both the NPCs and environment.\n\nIt's amazing how a game less than $1 can offer so much fun, replayability and investment from an immersive and interesting point of view and do so much right more than AAA modurn gaemz (especially from the overrated joke that is Telltale Games and more recently Life is Strange). This game proves you do not need top-tier voice acting, explosions, quest markers and a mini-map to spoon-feed the player into being artificially interested in the game's world.\n\nAs I said, this brings me back to the days of board games and choose-your-own-adventure, not many video games can do that for me nowadays so it's refreshing to see one that does it - and does it right - for a criminally underpriced price. I strongly recommend this game to players who love choice and freedom, board games, RPGs and detective stories. I understand the simplicity in nature, the questionable 2D art style and lack of dudebro shooting will put alot of people off, but I feel given the price of the game it doesn't matter if you don't even like the game as you'll probably just refund it anyway.\n\nA couple of things I want improved however, is perhaps a real-time on-screen inventory system as opposed to the default JRPG-esque inventory menu, more original sound effects to boot and an in-game clock that you can view anytime. Perhaps with the grandfather clock. Aside from that, I would like to see more games of this nature by this developer - more scenarios in different environments?","November 25, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game is fairly straightforward; you find a murder weapon, you find some "evidence" you can plant, and you make (or not make) conversations with the residents of your home, before killing your sister, and trying to convince a detective that it most certainly was not you.\n\nThere's about an hour or so worth of content, if you factor in replays, as you most certainly will fail to get away with it on your first time, and a couple of endings.

It's a simple rpg-maker style game that feels more like a choose-your-own-adventure than an RPG. There isn't that much to do but for a self-contained 15 minute story it does a good enough job.\n\nYou play as the villainous son returning to the family estate for the sole purpose of murdering your sibling so as to claim the inheritance. Each playthrough includes dialogue and a couple of choices (murder weapon, planted evidence), allowing for some replayability as pretty much everyone in the house can be framed for the murder (or no one, depending on decisions made by the player). I felt bad when I accidentally framed the maid. Sorry, hotcakes.\n\nBut once you play through a few times to see how the choices change the ending it becomes apparent that there's not much variability. Also it does feel a bit icky to play as such a little ♥♥♥♥ of a character, even if some of the other characters are also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and he seems to get a bad ending no matter what. But, again, I liked it for the price and time spent.\n\nUpdate: I started messing around with the game a bit and am slightly disappointed at how unimpressed the inspector is when he searches me and finds (A) a loaded shotgun and (B) my sister's initialed underwear.","December 6, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Ostensibly drawn home to celebrate your father's 50th birthday, in actuality you return to settle a score with your family. It would seem that your domineering father has disinherited you, giving all to your mentally unbalanced sister. To set things right, you have decided for  an "intervention" to remove your sister from this dysfunctional community, and regain your rightful place as legal heir. All that remains is to set up someone to take the blame for your sister's death. Will your nefarious scheme succeed? If so, will it be the maid, the butler, your mother or your father who spend the rest of their days behind bars? Or will it be a "suicide"?\n\nSo far, alas, I have failed to lay firm suspicion upon anyone else but myself!\n\nThe game relies on fairly simple graphics to map out the ground floor, cellar and upstairs of a well-to-do, but by no means extravagant, home in interbellum England. The music and sound effects are artful, evoking at time a nostalgic feeling akin to a BBC-funded detective series, and at other times a discordant melancholy feeling. The maid's scream upon finding the body, and the earlier dinner bell, are used to signal the transition from one set of scenes to the next.\n\nThe mechanics of the murder are simple, yet elegant. Upon arriving at the house, you interact with its five denizens by selecting from branching text responses. While short, these subtly reveal the tension within the family, as well as between the servants. Add to this the various vignettes in each room which conjure up the protaganist's wretched past, and collectively the player understands that the son's motive for murder is for more than just pecuniary gain.\n\nHow is his twisted vengence enacted? Before dinner, you as the son can search the rooms and acquire one clue and one murder weapon (Hint: the clue should be placed before dinner so as to lead suspicion onto one of the five denizens). While it is possible to acquire two clues or two murder weapons, the second clue or murder weapon cannot be discarded, which doesn't look good when the inspector arrives. While I suspect this inability to discard the second clue or murder weapon is an intentional design feature, it prevents more elaborate plots such as love triangles. However, it probably also makes the story branching more manageable, and has the added bonus of disciplining those of us with packrat tendencies in our gaming.\n\nThe game benefits from repeated playthroughs. In this way, it is similar to NEO Scavanger in that repeated failed play-throughs reveal the possibilities for success through a process of elimination.\n\nIf you are somewhat devious, you will love this game.Perfect for a 30 minute break.","December 14, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The Deed is short and sweet what with it being well written, engaging and highly replayable at the low price of 99 cents it may be worth picking up. Now that I've gotten my praise out of the way I just need to bring up some minor nitpicks. The game still has RPG Maker sounds which I found jarring and also uses an RPG Maker asset pack. That said it fits so well that I cant really fault the developer for using it in the first place. There are no graphics options which is a shame because not even pressing ALT + ENTER could get it to go fullscreen for me meaning I had to play it in a small window the whole time which would have taken me out of the experience if the game wasn't so engaging.

Picture a story in your head of how she dies using the items lying around the house, and put it into action. That is defiantly the strongest part of this game, everything is incredibly logical and the game throws no off the wall curve balls at you. Your plan is not going to be sabotaged by some BS variable that seemed irrelevant, but instead by your own clumsiness, or the things you said. Due to the games incredibly short length, getting all of the endings is a very doable task and gives you plenty of room to play around.\n\nThat said the game does have some faults. While watching the detective piece your crime together is fun, he is not very smart. It can be alarmingly easy to get him off your back on certain issues which should raise more suspicion. Like saying you kept your coat on to stay warm, despite it being drenched by the rain. Or accusing him of asking you a leading question about your behavior, yet when he asks a leading question about your father immediately you play along with it. It makes it kind of obvious that he follows a point system to reach his verdict.\n\nWhile the characters feel realistic for the most part, I did feel the sister's dialog was a little cartoony. I know she has a disorder, but she really showed no redeemable qualities and did not really have a reason to hate you as much as she did.\n\nI also felt the flashbacks were a wasted opportunity, they are kind of interesting at first, but only tell you things you already know.\n\nDespite the few nitpicks I had with the game, I did not regret playing this. The aesthetic reminded me of Clock Tower, and the fact that everything you say and do has consequences is truly impressive, and I will keep an eye peeled on this developer if they should ever construct bigger projects.\n\nAlso the game costs as much as a bag of potato chips, so there really is no excuse not to try it.\n","November 27, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I really like the characters and the setting but you really can get everything you could possibly get out of the game in two hours. As I write this is is only 66 cents and for that price I think it is Just worth it.  The game is kind of like a reverse game of clue, where you have to murder your mentally ill sister and try to cover up what really happened. The game requires a little strategy and is interesting in the different ways you can accomplish this. Personally I think it might have been more interesting if the time after the murder was prolonged. It is an interesting idea that I feel like could have been expanded on a lot more and is a game that I think maybe someone with a much larger vision might get inspired by one day.

It takes about 15-20 minutes to complete the game, but there are so many endings that are dependent on every choice you make, from the incriminating evidence you keep on your personage, to the murder weapon you choose (there are so many options), to the people you speak to and even every choice you make. This is a fantastic example of a game where choices matter. The environment in the game is dark and creepy, giving it a freightful tone, perfect for a murder.

It is a game constructed with the RPG maker and it is downright gorgeous. You are a jung man visiting his family in their estate for your father's birthday. Your sisters mental state has declined to a point where you just want to put her out of her misery. You arrive at the estate with just this simple tought of killing her.\nThis is where the plot starts and you are in control of how to go about your business of doing the deed. There is a vast amount of options you have in reaching your goal with lots of murder weapons and blame going around, including the butler, the house maid, your parents or yourself. It is up to you who is going to have to stand trial, just be careful how you do it or try to manipulate a desired ending for one of the featured characters. It all depends on what you do, to whom you talk or how you behave upon your arrival - and, of course, how you are doing during the investigation.\nAnybody who is into crime stories and also people who are grabbed by point & click adventures should give it a try. Most of you are not going to be disappointed by this short, artsy game.","February 9","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The primary objective of the game is to murder your sister. Sounds simple, doesn't it? Wait until you play the game.\n\nThe first thing that really jumped at me was the atmosphere. The game has a really old and musky feel to it, which is great for this particular game. It seems to pull off the atmoshpere that it tries to create, and I really did get involved in the game/\n\nSecondly, there are numerous dialogues in which you choose what to speak, and they seem to offer great choice honestly. I, of course, could not help but make lewd comments at the maid. Which was a lot of fun. The dialogue with the police guy was extremely well done\n\nThirdly, the gameplay itself is entertaining. The characters may look a bit blocky and walk funnily. But overall, with all the various items and murder weapons, the game was great.\n\nThe only con that I can think about is that if I finish the game, and succeed in murdering the protagnist's sister, I probably would not play this game. So the most I will play the game is approximately 2 to 3 hours. But hey, I got it on sale, and bought by trading steam cards, so it was a win-win situation.\n\nIf you can muster up the money, which isn't a lot really, I highly recommend this game. It is a fresh game with quite an impressive atmosphere.","February 12","true","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The father of the player celebrates his 50th birthday and you have to kill your sister and leave enough convincing evidence to blame someone for the deed, because otherwise the player never inherits the mansion of his family.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple and the game unfortunately only lasts for about 30 till 40 minutes. Through the several different potential murder weapons and motives of the characters there is a bit more of replay value. Nevertheless it is quite unlikely that you will spend more than 5 hours or so in exploring all possibilities. I have got it at a steam sale for about 30 cents, which is extremely cheap. You can gain all trophies quite easily and there are even some trading cards included. In consideration of the price and the nice idea behind the game I give it a clear thumb up.\n","May 22","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vinhzuka/recommended/420740/","vinhzuka","Ambrosius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vinhzuka/","66 products in account","Like many others, I found this game interesting, as well as unique. The prospect of the game is how and who do you have your sister killed and framed for, as titled,–"The Deed"–it's quite dark, bringing in the question to not only the main character, but you. Why? Was it worth it at the end?\n\nThere are multiple ways in killing your sister, and a couple of people you can frame. The way you plant false evidence, the weapons you choose, and where you were. Honestly however, the game is quite short, with it only lasting around 10-15 minutes. But with the variety of ways to kill your sister and who to frame, I would say you would be able to squeeze out at most 2 hours. There is minimal dialogue because of this, so you don't really know much about the character and his "life away from his family" other than that they are dysfunctional and your sister is "mentally insane" (but for it's length it's a lot) which makes it straightfoward; find someone to frame, find an evidence to plant, find a weapon to use to murder, and run to a place.\n\nHowever! The dialogue is actually quite an interesting feature in the game. What I mean is, depending on how you plan to interact with your family, the butler, and the maid, may or may not bite your butt back during the inspection, which can consequently make you suspicious. Most games, tend to overlook this, which would of made the game more unique to you.\n\nPros:\nInteresting genre of a game\nAtmosphere is fitting and nice\nMany ways of doing "The Deed" resulting in multiple runs\nDialogue affects outcome\nIt reflects on you at the end, was it worth the inheritance?\n\nCons:\nI have not much to say, other than it being short and maybe a lack of voice acting.\n\nAll in all, the game is an interesting experience, and for a buck for 2 hours is highly worth it.\n\nEdit: Added a gameplay video below\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=562554689","November 25, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The atmosphere is there, the artwork is well-crafted, and exploring the various options for how to murder your sister and frame it on someone else, or make it come across as a suicide, is thrilling in a slightly 'creepy' way. You need to 'set up the pieces' correctly not only to get away with the deed, but to divert attention from yourself so that your father still leaves his inheritance to you. Not only your choice of murder weapon, but also who you talk to, and the directions the conversations go, are important, as a police detective will scrutinise your actions after your sister's death.\n\nThe Deed is a short game, but what it delivers is solid.

Game probably isn't too good but the developers wanted some profit." Boy, was I wrong.\n\nI agree with others saying they regret buying it on sale because it definetly is worth full price.\n\nThe game has a Clue feel to it, except you are the murderer rather than just a mere house guest. The game has great variation in execution (yes, pun intended) and I wasn't expecting even the slightest social cues to have a pull in the game, but they did and it was rather fun to play around with. The backstory is also interesting, since it is read mostly through dialogue, but if you take the time to explore you'll hear and see the stories in a natural-feeling flashback.","April 7","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Apart from being a game which forces you to be clever (in an anti-detective way so to say), it is also a piece of art by its finely wrought narrative, which showcases personalised characters and an environment which fits the sombre main thread. The story really makes you feel terrible for what you do and, even though insufficiently developed due to how short the game is, it does show you what it means to be in the mind of a killer.","April 2","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The mapping is good and the music nice and well-chosen, even if there probably could've been a bit more.\nYou have some possibilities on how to arrange your murder and the achievements motivate on trying everything out.\n\nI bought it in a Sale, but I can definitely recommend getting it for the full price.","April 15","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
