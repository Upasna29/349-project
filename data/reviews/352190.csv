I like Miniatures games and this is a mini's game simulation complete with a tabletop.\n\nIt's a WWI era turn based combat game, similar to Advance Wars for you younger guys. The intro makes War World 1 history acctually sound interesting, and the game play was pretty easy to understand.\n\nCould use a little QA work. There's some language issues with the tutorial screen. I suspect the devs do not speak english as thier native langauge.\n\nTL;DR:  Not bad, worth $10.","March 12, 2015","true","0.2"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","44","54","2","0"

But since this is not possible, i will recomend it for some hours of fun, IF you can get it for a cheap price.

It's sin is the lack of a skirmish mode right on the menu. It could previoulsy reward the player with that sensation of fast satisfaction that us, players of strategy games, have when defeating an AI. After all I believe in the team that made it and that they are going to make it possible in the future. It's a beautiful game, and EVERYONE that's a fan of Advance Wars and its alike games should buy it!!

This game can be tricky in some levels but if you keep trying new strategies you can persevere. I also like the historical dialog at the start of the game and each level.

Annoying little things like the screen not centering upon unit selection, the maps all looking almost exactly the same in each scenario, the A.I not being particularly smart, and sadly the occasional game crash made me decide to uninstall this and concentrate on other things as time is too precious a resource! This game is okay, its 6/10, but given its price and basic gameplay, there are better hex based strategy games out there.","March 15, 2015","false","2.1"," 24 of 46 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","24","46","2","0"

"The Great War: 1914 - 1918", as stated in some of the reviews. Though look & feel (and some of the rules) seem familiar, it lacks the depth of its spiritual predecessor. "Sprit of War" has an awkward interface, ugly graphics and the price is way too high. Besides, the game has some small, but pesky bugs.\n\nI cant understand why anyone should recommend this game.
