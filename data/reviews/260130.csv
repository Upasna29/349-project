They get attacked by the armies of darkness during this assignment and after repelling the attack Sieghart finds a girl cornered by a sort of lesser god a "Larva" he proceeds to rescue her but gets mortally wounded. In his last moments the girl asks him if he wishes to live and grants him power healing his wounds. This newfound power was more than enough to defeat the weak Larva.\n\nAs a prequel the game has lots of references and assumes you know most things about its lore, I would recommend playing Agarest: Generations of War first if you plan to play this one, though not necessary as after ending the game you can make a new game+ in Extra Mode which allows you to play a digest version of the first game and you unlock profiles which enlighten you further.\n\nThe game's art style is quite good, though some of the female characters have provocative clothing, it is far from what most people seem to describe. There is some fan service though which is completely secondary to the game, which are the CGs, appart from some that might be a little awkward, they are all very well done and are a nice little bonus.\nThe voice acting and the translation I am not able to review thoroughly  as I don't know Japanese, but since I've watched enough anime (and asked the opinion of a few friends who understand Japanese) I'd say the translation is good apart from maybe a few exceptions. The Japanese voice acting like in most JRPGs is nice because it usually beats any english dub.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as the first:\n- Turn based combat, in each turn you have a move phase and a action phase.\n- The party consists of 1 to 6 members.\n- Each turn you gain AP (action points) which allow you to move or attack.\n- During the move phase you are allowed to move your characters up to their move stat by spending 1 AP per square.\n- During the action phase you are allowed to attack (and be attacked) spending AP or both AP and SP for special attacks (called Ex Skills).\n- SP is gained by attacking, getting targeted, slaying an enemy or having a party member slain.\n- The order in the action phase is determined by a character's AGI and remaining AP for both party members and enemies.\n- There are also Extended Areas, which are different to each character, when you link characters through these you can strategize in various ways as they allow you to make combos with more than one character and attack monsters that would otherwise be out of the range of certain characters/attacks.\n- As you progress through the game you unlock fields, different fields have different sizes and different bonuses/penalties.\n\nI recommend watching a few gameplay videos or a video of the tutorial (if existant) as it would be much easier to understand.\n\n\nWhen compared to the first game, Agarest: Generations of War Zero has several improvements:\n- The game is slightly shorter which made part of the community happy (on the other hand it lost generations (from 5 to 2) and it has less characters, though you can still have Ellis, Dyshana, the protagonists and the heroines of the first game in Extra Mode and the others by DLC).\n-  Vacation Days which are events where you can interact with your party members in order to raise affection levels or unlock certain bonuses/secrets.\n- Costumes which are literally costumes for every female character which change depending on their affection level, these will only appear in Vacation Days unless chosen otherwise in the options menu (I regret to say that after unlocking the costumes it isn't possible to chose which one appears it will always be the one that corresponds to the affection level).\n- Card System, now this in my opinion is the best improvement you can costumize the first main character making him much more versatile than the one from the first Agarest.\n- The portraits are no longer static and are considerably better.\n- Beach scenes!\n- Vashtor in white armor, 'nuff said.\n\nIgnoring the last improvement, in all seriousness, the game is enjoyable (In my case I'd say a lot of fun as I've also played it before in PS3 and I'd say the PC version is better as I found it more fluid).\nPersonally I just thank Ghostlight for porting JRPGs to PC since it has few when compared to consoles.","April 18, 2014","true","395.9"," 131 of 150 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","131","150","0","5"

The Generation system is vastly improved from the original, and the affection system adds its own level of stratagy. The gameplay, while at first glance appears simple, is, in a word, "Multi-Layered". Mastering Esoterica and Combination arts is key to not only surviving some of the most difficult battles, but also recieving some of the best items in the game. With that in mind, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Agarest Wiki that contains truely invaluable information on the game itself.\nWhile i love the game, I have to mention two dissapointments I have in concern to the actual game itself. First, the monster capture and combination system can be a boon to any player. If only for the Title System and the High End items you can get by using it. However, capturing monsters can be a chore sometimes, and often feels like a waste of time due to the grind required to max it out.\nSecond, the blacksmithing system has one infuriating element that i wish they had eliminated from the origional. That is the Random Item system that occures while smithing. On occasion, while crafting items, instead of the desired item you recieve a random craftable item instead. This still uses the materials, and after 3000 craft attempts, I only recived one item I cared about, or was useful. Instead you generally recive items that are either utterly useless, or are low level and already abundant.\nAs to the Steam download, it has one major glitch i was unable to remedy. Unfortunatly, there is a glich where on many characters in both conversation scenes and in the gallery, the characters images are obsucered by all the other alternate appearances being layered over eachother at the same time. This takes away from the character and story driven expreance that is essential to any JRPG.\nOn a possitive note, the Steam DLC is absolutly fantastic. Without it, many cassual gamers may find the baseline grind to level up and aquire both Gold and EP to be a daunting task. After purchasing the DLC it was almost like starting a new game + without ever having to have played the game.\nI would recomend this series to anyone who enjoys JRPG's or RPG's in general. For a more epic experience I suggest playing the original and then loading over the completed game data to Zero.\nAll in all, I'd give this game a solid 9 out of 10.\nAs a simple footnote I would suggest that due to suggestive sexual content in this game, parental supervison is advised.","October 17, 2014","true","164.9"," 63 of 71 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","63","71","6","5"

The combat system is really interesting and cool. the character designs are great. The characters themselves are pretty cool. The storyline and setting are great.\n\nIt's really repetitive. It's really repetitive. I'ts reeeeaaaallllyyyy repetitive. Every battle is basically the same throughout the whole game, just with different monsters. I know, a lot of games are like that. But you really start to feel it with this game. It's really repetitive. After a certain point in the second generation, the game has a huge upspike in difficulty, meaning each battle takes longer to do. I hate how it can take some of the greatest warriors in the continent, working together, a 20+ hit combo to kill a single slime. I'm 50 hours in, and I haven't even been grinding or anything and I've become bored. Maybe I'll finish it, maybe I won't.

I've played about thirty minutes or so thus far, but I will keep updating this review as I come across more parts of the game.\n\nAgarest is a fantasy tactical role playing game, much like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem. Straight out of the heart of Japan with its flashy style and exaggerated character designs, this game drew me in right away with its setting and characters. It leads to a slow start; the game making sure that it introduces the characters and teaches you about the combat for thirty minutes minutes before FINALLY getting into the good stuff in regards to the story and character creation wasn't a good call, but it lays the groundwork for the story ahead.\n\nThe real problem isn't the length of the opening in and of itself, though. It's the tutorial segments. The tutorial is drawn out and doesn't teach you anything you wouldn't know from playing any tactical role playing game. The characters and writing are on full display as you're taught the mechanics, making sure that you're at least slightly entertained, and they give you what you should well expect: flashy and fun attacks with all of the functionality you should expect from a game like this. But it's only exactly what you'd expect, and if you're going to demand total attention from the player like this, you need to be introducing things that players wouldn't know off the bat, and it just doesn't have any features like that in that first segment.\n\nEventually, it does get into some new features, but at the time of writing, after going at this game for nearly an hour, I'd only just finished the tutorial and I'd only learned two things from the game that I wouldn't have known otherwise from playing other ones. Just two. When this game says 60-80 hours, it means it, but if this is the way that they're going to stretch out the playtime, I'm a bit wary. Still, they were able to cram a good bit of story in that time, too, and I actually rather enjoy it so far!\n\nThis is a story-driven game, and make no mistake, it shows clear signs of the style it was drawn in.  From only being voice acted in Japanese, to the tropes that are made evident from the first moments of the game, it is made clear from the get go that this is a game that's going to follow the trends of anime in regards to its story and characters. If you aren't fond of that, you may be better off looking elsewhere for your fantasy tactical role-playing game fix.  But I am, and trust me, you have never seen a game that makes you think that you're watching an episode of anime more when you get past that tutorial and start the first boss fight. It's surreal to watch.\n\nFrom what I can tell, you're going to be in for an anime style game with stylish combat and a kickass story. If the story doesn't grab you, you're going to be waiting a long time for gameplay to kick in, because you have to go through a LOT of dialogue, but the gameplay itself is solid , and I can already tell the combo system is going to lead to plenty of fun down the road.\n\nFirst impressions? Grab it.","April 17, 2014","true","1.9"," 71 of 101 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","71","101","0","0"

People who played the old Agarest will find that a few things have changed.\n\nStarting with the good improvements. A fast-forward option during dialogue, fully turn-based dungeons with no more analog crawling or suprise encounters, and a slightly more informative esoteric book. A simplified version of the original Agarest is build into the game, and can be unlocked if you play NG+ on hard. As long as you get True End in the Zero universe, you will unlock True End in the Agarest vanilla universe automatically. You can unlock various vanilla characters and combine them into your zero party for maximum choice.\n\nThere are bad points too. For one, there are only two generations instead of five, although unlike Leonheardt who was stuck with a sword, you will have some control over Sieghart's weapon. The True End mechanic is also different, it being dependent on relationship scores and less than a handful of crucial storyline choices. You will not unlock the true ending unless you are familiar with dating sims; it is possible to get all nine women in the group to love you maximally, but unless you get somewhere close to that you won't get the true ending. The game is faster-paced due to less generations, but not fast-paced enough to warrent repeated crapshoots on the dating sim mechanic only to find out that you fail true end again and again. If you follow the True End guide for Zero on Agarest Wiki to a tee, it is a linear process and you can unlock it. But then Sieghart/Leonis will not feel like they have any consistent preference or personality. It will just be hardcore pragmatic metagaming.\n\nOn an important tangent, this game may be a little bit less friendly to female gamers than the vanilla game, because of the much more increased emphasis on the dating sim aspect. Women-to-women conversations in this game are also more superficial than vanillla. Female gamers can consider themselves warned.\n\nIt is a game with pros and cons, but if you liked the original Agarest then you might as well get Zero because it comes with a simplified version of the original game plus the interface improvements.","September 20, 2014","true","160.0"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","0"

This game is similair to fire emblem combat system, and has a cliche but an entertaining story. There are several events, and incorporates the oh so common dating sims the japanese love as well. One of the best part of the game is without a doubt, the creation of your character, where it is a tarot card system, which randomizes your character in the vague direction you build him to be.\n\nSynopsis: Record of Agarest War Zero is the prequel to Record of Agarest War. The tale follows Sieghart, an army commander who gains magical powers from a strange woman named Mimel. Blossoming from this setup, Record of Agarest War Zero is a slow-paced tale treading on familiar territory: the world is in danger and it's up to a small band of warriors to set things right.\n\nCombat: Record of Agarest War Zero's shining light is combat. Moving characters into position like a chess board is a challenging undertaking, but a rewarding one. Depending on which square characters occupy, they can link to other characters to unleash joint attacks with powerful results. But it's the calculated movement of sprites into position that makes exciting battles. While the terrain is flat and backgrounds repetitive, the environment is still a non-factor like the original Agarest War. The strategic requirements of success are fulfilling for all strategy fans. (Battles dish out experience like candy, yet money feels constantly tight.)\n\nGameplay:  The Agarest War series is different from other strategy games is that the story is split over multiple generations. When the curtain finally closes on Sieghart's side of the story, it's his offspring with the maiden-of-highest-regard that carries on the tale into future years. You are also forced to progress along a fixed path, forced to stop at each dot along the way for a battle. These often have no bearing on the plot and are simply there to make the journey from one chapter to the next take as long as possible.(although if the battle does indeed get too tedious, pressing q will turn on auto battle. A word of advice is use it on enemies you will dominate, due to the fact that the auto A.I is not the best.)\n\nOverall, i love this game, while it may say i only have 10 hours or so, i have the rest of the series on my ps3, with a total over 200 hours, a great game focusing on turn based strategy, and dating sim like playthrough.","October 4, 2014","true","11.8"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","24","28","0","0"

Just not my thing, and I love these type games.\n\nI'll be honest and say that some of this is probably due to my only 4 hours of play time.  But for starters, ingame it is rather poorly explained what the differences between the skills are (why use blast instead of rush, what are my miss chances, is regular damage the same as break damage or is that only for filling the break meter, that sort of thing).  The details screen you can pull up really explains very little.  I could live with this really.  What lost me though the linking system.  I just really don't like this mechanic, makes fights feel far longer and less tactical than they should.  Felt like I spent all my time looking for glowing squares for linking people and trying to maximize the number of combos in the action screen I could pull off than trying to outsmart/outposition the enemy and make use of terrain.

It was published in Japan by Idea Factory on June 25, 2009 for the PlayStation 3 and published by Aksys Games in North America on June 14, 2011 for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. It is the prequel to the 2007 game Record of Agarest War.\n\nLong before Summerill and the gods of darkness were defeated in Record of Agarest War, another battle was fought across generations to save the world from evil. Record of Agarest War Zero takes you back to that ancient time… The war between the forces of darkness and the forces of light, a conflict already many years old, has been fought to a stalemate. In the nation of Kraltarla, the forces of light hold back the evil hordes of darkness spilling from Findeste at the Scarred Mountains, but only just. In a desperate attempt to gain an advantage that could change the course of the war, the generals of the armies of light dispatch their loyal servant Sieghart, whom fate has seen fit to grant a strange and awesome power. Sieghart’s mission takes him across Kraltarla to gather the components for a magical tool that can free the imprisoned blacksmith of the gods, so that he might forge magical artifacts of great and terrible power for the forces of light.\n\nI love this game <3 The story is interesting.

Thankfully, they made it easy to figure who to place where to maximize your combo efficiency in battle, plus learning new Secret Arts through trial and error has been a blast!\n\nThis is technically the first game in the series, chronologically, but the second game to have been made. This one is a lot more forgiving than the first by means of getting the True Ending, as there are only two generations, so a lot of the original content from the first game that you had to be forced to do to get the True Ending has been streamlined for the second; giving you a lot more time to enjoy the story at a more natural pace.\n\nMy one little problem lies in the fact that they seem to reuse character designs and even come close to reusing names as well; namely, the character "Alice" is extremely close if not identical to "Ellis" in name and design both, right down to having a larva as a bodyguard. Sieghart also appears to be in close relation to the main characters of the first game, not to mention a few of the female leads seem to be borrowed concepts, as well.

But this game is a lot of fun. A lot of the wandering around has been cut out and the game is basically streamlined from one combat point to the other that takes you to all your quest objectives as well. The real meat of the game is inside the combat where you are encouraged to use more force then needed to achieve "overkills" in which additional items are dropped. The story seems very typical of what I know of the genre. Gods and Demons, end of the world, everyone fighting everything...over and over again....forever. But I am having fun fighting these things. On a side note I find myself smiling a lot of the mixture of 2d sprites laid ontop on hi res enviroments, even the larger "boss" monsters have been rendered in hd. Its pretty neat and for 6$ on the steam summer its worth every penny.","June 21, 2014","true","19.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Specifically that it promoted grinding while discouraging grinding through it's system of "Turns" (# of battles) - too many turns prevented certain events or hindered later progress - which created an absurdly unfair game without any DLCs. However, in Agarest Zero the Turn system was completely removed. In addition, there are not as many random battles from Event to Event, unlike the first Agarest, making Zero a bit more shorter (which is usually bad, but better in this case) - to top it off Zero only has two generations instead of five. Albeit all of this, in the end, Zero feels just like a really long DLC than a new game. Much monsters from the first Agarest, exact sprites and sound, have been recycled throughout the game. Also, the majority of bosses are rendered in 3D and misreably fails to blend in with the 2D sprites. Furthermore, the UI is identical to the first game - a convulted mess of getting around. I'm all in for a green Earth, but this is just too much recycling. If it didn't work before why repeat the same mistake? Agarest Zero, above all, is just Agarest v1.5 with better packaging. Not necessarily a bad game but neither is it a good game. 5/10","April 18, 2014","false","7.2"," 32 of 54 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","32","54","0","0"

I actually buy this just to support Idea Factory xD It is one of the few companies who make my kind of simulation games after all xD I have only played this for a while and I have never played the first game either... so this is just a quick note for everyone!\n\nPros:\n- Japanese voice acting (I'm a sucker for it xD)\n- Cool tactical combo chaining. If you'd like to chain a lot, you'll need to learn how to use this properly! I find it interesting because of the different layout of Extended Areas for each player and that where they are facing affects it. For those who love to challenge themselves and see how far they can go... this is for you!\n- Different areas that you can choose where to fight? Not bad!\n- The animated sprite (Motion Portrait) makes it a tad bit life-like as they talk.\n- Anime-style handsome guys and pretty girls =P\n- Free DLCs! Yay!\n\nCons:\n- The tutorial is soooo long TT Well it is good for those who are not used to tactical games... but for me who have played quite a few (e.g. FFTactics, Tactic Ogres, FE), it is one chunk of boring part right at the start. Be patient!\n- DLCs right from the start! You become too OPed right from battle number 1 that the last thing to do is saying good-bye to that fun ~ So I would suggest turning off the DLCs or just don't use it!\n\nWho is this game for?\n- Those who love Love SImulation games, Tactic battles, Combo chainers, Anime-lovers, or those who, like me, loves Idea Factory!","July 15, 2014","true","5.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Theres also a digest mode where you play the original Agarest (which means, you get to play with 2 characters from the original and you'll be playing through 100% of the story).  Features remain the same, same Attacks, Spells & Items.  Totally different story, Its kinda pointless playing digest mode unless there was something missing from the original.  What makes digest mode hard is that it has you only fighting major battles, not the minor battles.  Back to zero, the game itself can be long and difficult for the 2 generatiions, after you get done beating this game, you might think, d@mn, the story was short, but the battles are crazy hard (1st time you play).

I like my JRPG's to have combo systems, it adds a little bit of flavor to the game.  The tiled fields are not by any means extremely large, so positioning is rather important when trying to corner enemies or create an eleborate combo that will excessively damage the enemy.  I would like to say that the gameplay very much reminds me of Disgaea.  For those familiar with Disgaea, you may recall positioning characters in certain directions to obtain minimal damage and best damage output, same features here.  The actual playing field is not as elaborate by any means though (no elevation).  You do gain "field" options though which can influence the party and the enemies on the field.\nDifficulty wise, this game does encourage leveling and item grinding.  Without properly leveling characters, you will meet a swift defeat.  The amount of damage the monsters give and take is comparable to your own MC.  It's quite a bit.  Grinding monsters also generates technical points and money, which can be used to buy weapons, new smithing techniques, alchemy items, and the like.\nAn actual downside to the combat system is the camera system.  It is extremely rigid, offering only about 4 angles of the field.  While you eventually learn that you can click whichever tile you desire despite the UI and direction of the camera, I find it bothersome that the camera system is not more flexible.  The combat system does not also offer many options aside from using skills, standby (thus generating action points for skills), no defense option, items, and reminding yourself which combo-able skills are available.  Depending on how 'intricate' you enjoy combat games, this could be somewhat off-putting.\nLastly, the DLC which I tested on my characters absolutely break the game.  I can absolutely disregard how much damage I am taking or giving, because it simply does not matter.  It's a bit of a snooze fest when it comes to beating up monsters, even bosses.  Even so, it is important to level the characters so that they may obtain new traits and skills.  An overly equipped lvl5 offensive mage will still fall prey to a group of lvl6-7 monsters if not careful. Of course, I've managed to negate that.  I can simply focus on grinding levels, items, and the story at this point.\n\n\nStory and Characters:  Not incredibly difficult to follow.  Nothing really wow'd me in regards to plot.  Your a relatively distinguished soldier, who dies, is revived by a mage, and proceeds to take a journey to save the world.  As you proceed through the world, you do come across a variety of members who join the party.  Most of them female.  The female characters have an affection system which is affected at various "events" and your decision during them.  Furthermore, the Oracle can "predict" your offspring and their stats based on your current relationship and stats.  The male characters don't impress me anymore than the females, but the chemistry between the cast as a whole flows rather well.  As of my progress in the game, there is no character development.\nI would say the most interesting aspect of the MC's stats are reflective of the choices you make at the very beginning of the game.  You choose particular class which is followed by several "sub" stat categories.  These influence a particular stat that will be easier or harder to increase as you level up the MC.\n\nAll in all, the game is decent and worth killing time over if you're willing to sit down and take a journey.  The flaws are there, but nothing to fret over.  I'd give it a 7/10.","April 26, 2014","true","12.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Even the harem of wanton anime chicks you gather on your forgettable escapade do nothing to make the experience less excruciating.\n\nWhat's even more painful is how obvious it is that the game wants to be some intense strategy RPG. Agarest is a prime example on how flashy combos and special attack portrait cut-ins don't make a game exciting. In fact, the game punishes you for being halfway proficient at it. Keep animations turned on and you have to wait minutes at a time for combos to complete. Turn them off and you're playing Watching Damage Floaters: The Game The RPG.\n\nDon't get this game","August 13, 2014","false","1.5"," 23 of 44 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","23","44","0","0"

In my mind a generic JRPG genre means you get to move freely and engage in combat. This game however, is more visual novel style and you only get to control your characters during combat. Travelling is done via selecting dots on the map. The story focuses towards relationship between your members.\n\nCombat is very satisfying as they can be challenging and strategic with the wide arrays of spells, abilities, items,  equiptments and combos.

When you figure out how you like your party, then strategy becomes key. Characters can actually die if left alone too long without revival (and you can't get them back, really) and they each have very awesome and amusing dialogue inbetween! The game even follows a sorta-visual novel path, and allows you to make choices for the main character.\n\nVery amusing, very challenging (easy at first, but beware later on!) and very addictive.

Agarest, is a game set in the world of Agarest. Simple, right? It is a world ridden with war between the Evil and the Light gods. You start the game in the middle of this war as Commander Zeeg~ (Sieghart.) Who soon finds himself at the feet of an evil Larva, a minor god. Events unfold and Zeeg~ is given the power to defeat this foe.  I am not going to spoil much, but it is almost exactly like what happened to Leonhart from the first game.\n\nAgarest is a SRPG, Stratagey Roleplaying Game. The battle system is turned based. So if you do not like turn based games well, I am sorry. This game may not be for you. This title also introduces several new features its predecessor didn't, like the Free Intention system and Extra mode. Extra mode is for people who have played the previous installment in the franchise, Agarest: Generations of War and the Free Intention system is another relationship builder. It will sometimes give items, new CGs, and costumes for your party to use. Also they added in the Action Animation System that allows the characters to move their lips during cutscenes. It is pretty neat for the time the game was actually released, 2009, but for todays standards it is pretty mediocre.\n\nIf you were expecting to have 30+ characters like in this first game you will be disappointed. This game only contains two genertaions unlike the previous five, and there are only fiften members that you will be finding in your party. However I do not think this detracts from the game in any way whatsoever. The game is still 80+ hours, like its predecessor and the story is very immersive.\n\nOverall - I really enjoy playing the game.

It DOES NOT only contain the story of the so-called prequel, but also a digest version of Agarest: Generations of War, which is 2.5 times longer than the 60 hour of the original prequel. So, if u are not ready to invest at least 300 hours into this game, you may stop right here.\n\nThe reason why i discourage anyone to buy this game is simply because it really becomes tedious (excluding those fanatic JRPG fans) when you finish the story of a generation. Why? Because 1. the battle repeat themselves incessantly, 2. THERE IS NO STORY! I would just say that, even after finishing the entire prequel, i found only piece-by-piece information about why the hell was i fighting at all! Mostly it was only about doing everything your bosses or some random girl on the road told you to do, which might well involve hours of meaningless and random exploration of the world. It is nothing more than boring. And dont even mention the horrible battle music which repeats itself without a single twitch throughout my entire 30 hour gameplay.\n\nTo put it short, simply mark my words if u would: a RPG without a good story is just crap, if not a piece of sh*t.

Am I disappointed? Yes.\n\nThe storyline is bland and generic and offers nothing intriguing or exciting to the player. At this stage I barely know what my goal is (other than looking after Mimel and picking up more (female) characters to add to my party) and I've no desire to find out. The parts that talk about the storyline are tedious and bland at best and ultimately unfulfilling for the player. A solid RPG should have the player wanting to know what the next twist in the game is; Agarest fails to deliver on that aspect. Considering playing on feels like a chore that I want to avoid doing at all costs.\n\nThe tutorial barely gives you the bare bones of combat which is simple enough to pick up despite being poorly mapped, and the character creation part is totally left uninformed. The player absolutely doesn't know what to do without the help of a guide and to be honest I have no idea what on earth I picked for the MC, Sieg. Combat gets boring and repetitive quickly. If you're a player who dislikes grinding there's no worry as you're forced to grind and play through fights just to get anywhere on the map.\n\nSpeaking of characters, the characters of the game are bland, dull and boring with predictable, mundane personalities. There's a womaniser without a hint of charm, a little mysterious childish girl and then there's the MC who is the equivalent of bread without butter. The voice acting and somewhat pretty character designs aren't enough to carry the personalityless characters through with the bland script. Another part of the game which is a little more fun is the dating aspect where you woo the ladies you pick up for your party. However, Fire Emblem: Awakening offers the same kind of game as Agarest but with a better script, a easier to follow plot and interesting characters.\n\nFor the most part, Agarest has a lacklustre script and a poor combat system which ultimately lets the full game down. A much more interesting story with more engaging characters is the minimum this game would need to carry it through with the current combat system. The pixel graphics are somewhat charming, at the very least.\n\nMy overall opinion? I wish I could refund this game and would do so in a heart beat if I was able to.","November 14, 2014","false","6.3"," 34 of 69 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","34","69","2","5"

I did pre-order this, and to be honest I got what I expected.\n\nIf you've played Agarest: Generations of War, this game won't surprise you at all. If you haven't, but you have played almost any tile based strategy RPG before, this game still won't surprise you.\n\nThe story is... also pretty generic, and this Agarest has only two generations. You are Sieghart, a warrior of the light on a mission to collect the fragments of a magical item with which you can save the world. Sound familiar?\n\nAgarest Zero brings minor refinements from the formula for Generations of War, but otherwise has the same strengths and weaknesses as the latter. It is not hard to learn if you haven't played an SRPG before as it really has the standard fare for turn based strategy combat, with no elements that are particularly esoteric. Which also happens to be it's weakness. It has no special uniqueness to it.\n\nThe art is more or less identical to Agarest: Generations of War. A great deal of detail put into environment and dialogue characters but little to no effort at all put into the character sprites. It is also worth noting that this game uses the Active Animation Adventure system used in Trinity Universe and Hyperdimension Neptunia rather than the manga styled dialogue the first game had.\n\nOverall, I think I would give this another 7/10. It is definitely worth the cost for the entertainment value, but the game just isn't improved enough to deserve a higher score.","April 18, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This makes battle much easier although it can get harder because if you aren't focused, you've probably cut the link with other party members so character placement and direction are very important aspect in the game\n\nMarriage system and divided by generations is what attracts me to play this game. With a bit of visual novel aspect, they implement it so your social skill is vital for your main character and future bride to gain a better generation in later part.\n\nTRUE END is in the game. Heck, every game I play (JRPG) has true end and this drive me to get the better ending for the game. I don't care if I have to replay the game but I sure want to see the true end (just what I did with Mana Khemia and similar JRPG.

You basically move from dot to dot on a map with very little variation. Each dot either represents a fight, a village or event. Oh, and I guess there are some quest dots you enter into that just contain the above. There's a solid amount of customization, but it doesn't seem to serve much purpose. In almost 10 hours there hasn't been one fight that required any effort.\n\nThen there's the story itself. It feels like it could be interesting, if the characters weren't so cookie cutter and bland. You push through the drawn out fights to get to an event and you get terrible dialogue and hardly any real background on the story. Now I know 10 hours isn't enough to see the whole story, but it's more than enough to get the feel for the game.\n\nSo if you like repetitive battles, boring characters and ZERO exploration, this is for you.

Get disappointed.\nFirst, the character creation had many choices, but little explanation, so in the end I just pick random options. After 9hrs of game I still don't know what was the result of those options.\nThe skills equip system is cool, but it's very restricted to what skill you can equip on an item.\nThe battle system is very interesting. If you place you characters in a certain way you can pull large combos. But the great problem is that the characters move after attacking, so you need to change their positions each turn, so you spend more time thinking were to put the characters than attacking the enemy. It's like playing chess. I like chess but I think the battles should be faster, since you have to fight many of them until the story progress a little.\n\nI have no problem with cliché characters. But the characters in this game are just boring, and some of them looked like they personalities are swapped. There's a childish girl with big boobs dressed like a dominatrix, and a cute catgirl that gives orders all the time.\n\nThat is the kind of game a really wanted to like. But I can't.

The maidens of the pillar seem to get the short end of the stick.\n\nAnd I suppose this would be all right if the script was interesting, but I've played some of each game, and not only is the translation weirdly archaic, but the script is absolutely lacklustre.\n\nThere's a psp game called Ragnarok Tactics, known to many as one of the most mediocre jrpg's ever, and that STILL had a more compelling script than this game.

That however , fails to keep up the motivation long enough to endure its biggest downside. of the 78 hours i played , 90% of the time were spent in battle. Not "ever changing", challenging battles , that make you curious for more though. It is the same , boring strategy of the same long battle over and over trough the whole game, one hundred times fold. one fight may take 10-20 minutes , the number of fights between the bits of storry parts grow from just 3 to monstrous 15+ , and with monsters getting more hp and numbers, its only getting longer , but hardly more challenging or refreshing in any way. Further more , unless you paid for the DLC for a nice cut down of battle durations, you will likely end up forced to grind for materials - which are needed to craft the newer weapons and skills , because they can NOT be bought from the shop just like that. Unless you want to run around with your lvl 1 sword trough the whole game , you'll be forced to go repeat some dozen times of the battles you're sick and tired of anyways. Note also , that with those 78 hours i did not grind , because the addons came with a sale package.   At first , i was motivated to make no use of them , however... the frustration with the sheer amount of time spent doing boring, long and repetetive battles ended up changing my mind. Note also , that after nearly 80 hours , i have about 20 more hours of gameplay ahead. If this game is played without resorting to DLC weapons , you're in for 120-140 hours of torture. about 14 hours of those are enjoyable content with storry and challenging boss fights. All the rest feels like a horrible content stretching mess , meant to make people pay extra money for DLC packages with proper weapons.\n\nWhile i can't possibly know, wether you will not enjoy this extreemly unballanced ratio of mental torture and occasional fanservice,  i can say for sure that i did not. For a game heavily relying on time spent in tactical battle , it lacks tactical variety.","July 3, 2015","false","78.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Mix 1 part FIre Emblem and 4 parts visual novel and you have a recipe for a click fest game. The story is an integral part of the game, but I don't feel invested enough in any of the characters to care. The main character is as bland and boring as hat of any visual novel and the old style speaking with modern clothing doesn't blend together. The battle system is fine, but the relevance of various symbols is unexplained, so you have to figure out how the game works. Designing your character isn't explained well, all your choices are uninformed, you've no idea how it will affect you later. For reference, if you're looking for a game that will let you move about, this isn't it. You're led from one battle to the next with some dialouue in between if you're unlucky.

I've been finding it hard to continue to play since the characters and story either so bland or so over the top that it is difficult to care. I find myself dreading any 'events', but then also found myself starting to dread the combat since it was becoming so repetative.\n\nAfter reading other reviews it seems like at some point this game will take a sharp turn with the difficulty and tactics, but if you are looking for a great story and a great combat system right off the bat, I would maybe look elsewhere, or at least remember to stay away from using the DLC gained items until you need them.","December 28, 2014","false","6.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

You go from one dot to next dot on the map doing battles.  Each battle generally takes 15min or so to complete so yes, this is a long game.  Don't get me wrong or anything, the battles are nicely done with good mechanics but each move has a drown out animation.  Flash over function.\n\nThere are other things to do besides the main story quest but they are basically trophies, titles and monster hunts (which the monster hunts are far more difficult than what they need to be.)  The titles do give you some nice gifts for completing them so its not a waste of time.\n\nI wasn't impressed with how your second generation comes out with stats.  It doesn't matter how much you level your first gen up, the stats don't chance for your heir.\n\nI'm normally not one to care to much about a story as most story plots have been played out in all the previous games so you sort of know whats already going to happen but I don't remember a single thing about this one...at all.  For me, as long as they make it sort of interesting I'm ok with the story.  This one wasn't interesting at all.  I can not tell you a single thing, after reading the dialogue of what this one was about.  To sum it up:  Someone was attacking and they needed something to stop it.  No twist, no turns.  That's it.\n\nAll in all, it isn't a bad game but there are so many better out there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fuzen777/recommended/260130/","Fuzen777","Fuzen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fuzen777/","149 products in account","To me, this game is awfully bad. The only point that I find quite interesting is the art, and it is the one that decided me to buy the game.\n\nSo basically, Agarest Zero takes some element of the classic turn-based RPG and some other of the average heroic fantasy Visual Novel in order to offer its content ; in the same way as Kamidori Alchemy Meister for instance. (Alas, Agarest is well worse than this one…)\n\nAt the moment, I didn't play much but for what I have played… not once have I had fun.\n\nSo, firstly, the RPG aspect of the game :\n— The turn-based gameplay is interesting with it's mechanics but most of the strategic part of the game is left behind by the fact that the fights are heavily gear-reliant.\n— The battles are repetitive ; if the few first one can make you think about some strategies, you quickly make one or two that will work in most occasions. In the end, the lack of diversity and the massive amount of “long” battles transforms the battle in some sort of torture sessions.\n— The character creation is too confusing. Firstly, you have to choose between three classes (warrior, battle mage, sorcerer) which is quite understandable even if nothing tells you what these classes are really about. Next… you have to choose five cards that will determine the weapon you'll use and your stats growth. So… for the weapons, you have two icons on each card so you can more or less guess what weapon you will be given. Now for the stats… NOTHING actually tells you what these cards does. In other words, if running countless tries to get the char you want is your thing… this game is for you. Otherwise… well… Good luck.\n\nSecondly, the VN aspect :\n— The story is quite common for what I have seen. Basically, it's just a way to put the game in context but chances are you won't find it more than just average. It's not bad but we have seen way much elaborated stories in the RPG genre.\n— As I said earlier, the art is well drawn. Backgrounds are well detailed and the fact that characters are not fixed during dialogs makes the game in itsel a bit more living.\n— The one thing that I hated: the affection system. It… follows absolutely no logical rule. For example, I made some choice with a character, that got me +1 in affection with this one BUT on the other hand, I got -1 with another one that was not even here and that had nothing to do with this choice. It's as if it were totally random…\n\nI'll probably update this review later if I progress in the game but for now, if you are seeking a JRPG/VN game, I could only recommand you to search elsewhere.","November 17, 2014","false","15.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Thus you can chain your entire team and perform long ♥♥♥ chains to take down enemies. Moving costs AP (action points) which you also need for the action phase to attack.\nThe action phase is where you select commands for each character eg. heals, magic attacks, physical attacks or special moves, which have different AP costs.\nI found it extremely boring because I have played alot of gmes with similar mechanics and they all did this better. The only reason I didn't give it a zero was because you could combine different skills to create combo moves which was mildly entertaining - for a while.\n\nStory: 3/5\nStory is the usual good vs. bad struggle, there aren't any interesting plot twists like you can find in other JRPG's like Final Fantasy.\nWhat caught me by surprise is that you could marry and get a son.

That high price of the DLC is a bad trademark of the entire series to be honest.\n\nAll in all I give the game a solid 7.5/10 I have to make a few points off for the lack of variance in the battle arenas, thee awkward camera controll, and the high cost of the DLC and game.","May 1, 2015","true","55.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great tactic game and a great storyline.\n\nA little bit too easy if you use all the free dlc items you get from buying it on steam, so sell everything or turn of dlc if theres a option somewhere to have a more challenging playthrough.","November 3, 2015","true","54.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
