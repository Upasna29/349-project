It might start out with a hand on your shoulder and some encouraging words to help you along, but before you know it you find yourself thrown off the metaphorical cliff as you reset the same stage for the twentieth time in order to bypass the same obstacle, while the game gives you a patronizing pat on the back and asks if you don't want to just give up already.\n\nPretty game, the visuals are a work of art, but the level designers were a band of sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s beyond compare.","October 30, 2014","true","19.3"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","35","38","9","5"

Reaching certain Lum targets can earn extra "Electoons", which unlock new levels and characters.\nBesides of jumping Rayman learns new skills such as hovering, swimming and shrinking, bringing a compelling variety to the action, and testing your dexterity to the limits.\nOn your way you have to cross floating platforms, dissolving platforms, platforms that twist and turn, that bounce you into the air or slowly fall and fade.\nRayman: Origins has impressive graphics, the backgrounds are beautifully drawn and has multiple layers of action.\nThe levels vary from familiar takes on platforming staples – cloud levels and underwater levels – to such oddities as a world based on didgeridoos.\nAlongside the standard platforming levels, there are boss encounters, and scrolling shoot-'em-up challenges in which you leap on to a mosquito and fly through formations of angry birds and spiky puffer fish.\nRayman Origins features drop-in/drop-out cooperative play for up to four players at a time and as long as one of you stays alive to free injured players from bubbles in which they become trapped when hit, progress through a level remains possible.\nEverywhere there is humour and whimsy, every screen a feast of bizarre scenery and weird inhabitants.\nRayman: Origins is one of the best platforming experiences you are going to have on Steam. The game is crafted with so much love, so much humor, and does so many things right, that it is impossible not to have a blast.

But their snoring disturbs an old granny from the Land of the Livid Dead. She sends out an army of Darktoons across the Glade of Dreams, who capture the Electoons which inhabit it. You, as Rayman and his friends, must go out across the world and free the Electoons to restore the Glade.\n\nAlthough the story is great, the game's aesthetics and soundtrack is where it really shines. The beautifully crafted world, accompanied by the brilliant musical score, is what really sucked me in. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, and the soundtrack is superb.\n\nGameplay is excellent too. The animations are fab, and the game overall feels very fluid. I am not a huge fan of platformers, the gameplay usually fails to entertain me, but I absolutely adored Origins. You start off with just the ability to run. But as you progress you unlock more abilities, such as wall-running. There are also certain levels in which you ride a mosquito. You can either shoot enemies or suck them up to fire them.\n\nThe game comes with 4-player local co-op. This is great, but it would be even better if it included Online play too. This is the only downside to the game.\n\nOne of the best PC games to be released in 2012. I recommend this to both those who adore platformers, and those who do not.","March 21, 2014","true","20.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrizSteam/recommended/207490/","FrizSteam","Friz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrizSteam/","203 products in account","One of the best platformers I have ever played. The Donkey Kong Country series was the one I always considered the best, until I tried this one. The main thing I like about this game, is that you move at a much faster pace, compared to something like the DKC games. There are optional challenge levels that will test just how good you are at controlling your character at its max speed. If you can complete those, you earn the right to play the Land of the Livid Dead level, which is the most challenging stage in the game.\n\nAll the secret/bonus rooms in a stage, have their own unique platforming segments that you must get past, in order to get the reward from it. I enjoy that a lot more than how the DKC bonus/secret areas usually are (just collecting the bananas). The boss fights are also a lot more difficult and better designed. The art and animations make the boss fights look so good and those water stages also.\n\nThe difficulty is also great. Nothing is cheap and unfair. Everything stays the same for a stage and you will never feel like it was the stage's fault for dieing, but your own. The game also has fast respawns for when you die and automatic checkpoints per stage. You will never have to start back at the beginning of the stage (unless you die there) and you will get to keep everything you have collected so far.\n\nThe game will last you 10+ hours, if you plan on trying to unlock all the levels. If you like this game, then check out Rayman Legends, which I think is even better.","April 16, 2014","true","9.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It has a sort of party atmosphere, with its bright colors, upbeat music, and surreal shenanigans that keep it charming almost all the way. Almost. The graphics are probably some of the sharpest 2d environments seen in a platformer, with a bizarre cartoony look that's not like much else.\n\nAt its heart, Rayman is a collecting platformer, where you try and collect thingies (lums) to free thingies (electoons), though there's a secondary thingie (skull teeth) you can collect in special challenge levels to unlock another thingie (an extra hard series of stages). As such, if you want to hit every note, you'll be repeating stages to make a better time or to collect more thingies, and your opinion on that may very. Overall, though, you don't have to sweat that too much, and those that can put their collection impulses on hold can charge through the game for the most part.\n\nWith a variety of moves and skills to unlock, most of the levels become a breezy delight, hovering, running up walls, bouncing off of enemies, etc. In my opinion, it comes very close to dethroning the kings of platforming, save for two issues: the levels can be long, and towards the latter half the game can lean towards being surprisingly tough. Seperately neither of these would be an issue, but together they can deal out some real frustration towards the end of the game. The long levels mean it can lean on being repetitive within a larger world, but each world is varied and often come up with some really great gimmicks, floating through updrafts or sliding down waterfalls. (Note to the developers, though: ice levels where you slide everywhere are not fun.) Annoyingly, the game has a tendency to ask you if you want to switch levels if you die too many times, which it will do over and over - some of the final levels had that pop up occur six or seven times, and when you're just trying to progress, it's rather irritating. An option to turn that reminder off would have been pretty welcome. Contrary to that, though the challenge levels can be similarly tough, their short length and breakneck pace thankfully turn them into one of the highlights of the game. At its best, the game has you charging through areas in a fashion you'd expect of a AAA theme park game, while at no point holding your hand.\n\nUltimately, though, whether you just get a taste or collect every bit, Origins is worth your time. If you can affort Legends, it's a better game that mitigates many of Origins' flaws, but since Origins is often available for just a few bucks during the seasonal sales, it's absolutely worth it. For those with a distaste for UPlay, you can also relax in the fact Origins doesn't use it at all. It's a rare "pure" sort of game from a big developer, with no DLC shenanigans or anti-piracy measures. (This may also be due to the fact it got a government grant for its development...)\n\nGive it a shot, you should at least get a smile out of it.","August 8, 2015","true","17.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The graphics, music and level designs range from good to amazing, that alone makes it well worth playing, but... (There's always a but.) The controls and boss designs leave much to be desired. Bosses move in completely fixed patterns that are pretty unforgiving and extremely boring once you know the patterns. In other words, bosses are trial and error until you've learned the patterns. That gets tedious real fast --- especially so on the final boss, where the bad controls and poor boss design clash in such a way that it's actually possible to go too fast and die because of that, which seems counter-intuitive when you're chasing the bad guy. The same thing goes for a few other levels, where you can build up enough momentum that the game can't keep up, which is extremely sad to have happen in a platformer. And then there are the controls that don't really feel tight enough for many situations that you are put in. Constantly I caught myself thinking "this wouldn't be a problem if it was Super Meat Boy or Mega Man". It's not that the controls are downright bad, they're just not good enough.\n\nIf you can overlook the flaws, it's a very good and extremely entertaining game.","July 7, 2014","true","13.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The asthetic of the game is striking to say the least and it is impossible to mistake for another game. Brown and grey are simply not colors that exist in this worlds pallet and it makes everything feel bright and alive. For the proper enjoyment I would abandon the "gotta go fast" mentality that plagues many fans of the genre, and take a slightly slower pace to enjoy the lovely atmosphere and music. Also avoid the power ups that double your electoon count unless you really like listening to the same 12 note song every 20 seconds of game play.\n\nTo put it simply: It is a nice game with a nice pace that doesn't outstay its welcome with an undersated soundtrack and visual design.","June 25, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It features more than twenty hours of longevity thanks to its 60+ levels, full of detail thanks to the wonderful job of the artists at Montpellier. It is a breeze of fresh air in the market of platforming games as an alternative to Mario, Sonic, etc. This game also supports cooperative gameplay. Chances are low that you will regret purchasing this, just check by yourself by playing the free demo!\n\nAs a Rayman fan, I honestly think the game had many potential to be better. The game suffered significant changes during the development, ending up in something that wasn't quite "promised" back in the E3 of 2010. Keep in mind: "Origins" for the 2D side-scrolling gameplay (like Rayman 1), not "Origins" for the backstory of the most important characters. Don't expect the existence (and especially a coherent) of a story, since this pretty much lacks it. The levels are too linear and easy to overcome  especially if you have a sharp dexterity from Rayman 1. While the artwork is impressive, I think the artists were chosen bad for the background treatment, with just one or two exceptions. For me it is the least good Rayman title out of the four currenty existent, and after finishing it you won't wish to replay it very soon. In short, it is a good game but not as fantastic as the other main titles released before.\n\n","August 9, 2013","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Unlike many in this genre, players won't bounce off of each other, or generally get in each other's way.

There are no limits to lives - as long as any single player is still alive, the other players can continue.  You only need to restart the level if everyone dies at the same time.  This makes it possible for widely varying skill levels to still have fun together.

The animation and artwork is incredible, and you'll constantly be amazed at how well everything looks when in motion. The soundtrack is a bit crazy - the game uses a made-up babbling language for both its characters and the music, very reminiscent of LocoRoco's and still extremely catchy (though not nearly as mind-wormingly irritating long after playing). The platforming mechincs are extremely simple, and expand as you continue into the game. Environmental hazards, however, vary how you'll approach each stage, especially when you start attempting speed runs.\n\nSpeaking of speed runs, one unfortunate omission is a lack of Steam achievements.  Though the game rewards certain tasks throughout the game, there are a lot of unique challenges missing from within the game that show up in the game's console counterpart. Regardless, the challenges are fun and the game as a whole does not hold back on difficulty.\n\n5 out of 5 foxes.","September 15, 2012","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I sometimes found myself repeating one little section of a level a dozen times until I started to get aggravated and cursed at the screen... but It happended rarely and because of a lack of concentration mostly!\n\nEvery level can be completed by just making it through, or by collecting a certain number of collectibles to get the maximum number of medals for that level.\nOne can also try to beat a certain time to get a speed run medal which is asking for precision platforming.\nThen there are the crazy treasure chest runs which are levels in which you chase a treasure chest and have to be as fast as possible.\nThese levels require a lot of practice and trial and error progression which could bother many, I liked them and found myself more frustrated with some of the standard levels and bosses... but that might be a question of individual taste.\n\nI beat the game in around 11 hours and it will give you at least 15 to 20 hours of gameplay if you target 100% completion.\nI personally felt the game was a little too long, halfway through when you think you have completed the game, 4 new worlds pop up with a boss in each of them, these bosses are mainly fun but can get a little frustrating sometimes because of trial and error pattern learning on the players part.\nThe leveldesign got better the further you progress in the game, I felt, but still it seemed a little stretched for my taste and schedule but most people would probably disagree.\n\nConclusion\nIf you like challenging platformers and the Rayman art style you will definitely enjoy this game a lot!\nIt’s not on par of course with SMW. It’s not on par with Super Meat Boy although that is a bad comparison for many reasons.\nBut it’s certainly the best platformer I played since Super Meat Boy and I will definitely play through the follow up Rayman Legends when I get the chance.\nLast but not least, the game supports up to 4 player local co-op which is really fun!\nI would recommend this game (I even gifted my little niece a copy for her 3DS last christmas, so there you go)!\n","March 14, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Why? Read this test to learn more!\n\nFirst of all I want to talk about the atmosphere. You play in different worlds and their "Dark" World types. The worlds are completly different (Forrest, African, I won't spoiler more...) and have their own music and graphics. You see  Dust flying up in the African styled maps and after a time this even becomes a part of the Gameplay!\nThe Graphics are just awesome. Hand-made worlds create a feeling of really being in the Rayman World. Together with the fitting sounds and music, this creates a very good atmosphere.\nAlso: When I played the first levels of Rayman, it made me really happy. I played and was happy. I even had to stop myself from playing too much, because I did not want Rayman's adventure to go over too fast!\n\nNow to the Fairness and sticked with that: The Controls.\nThe Controls are intuitive and easy-to-learn. After some times, you get new abilities, which though do not make the game confusing. You understand them and they stay in your brain.\nThe game is pretty easy if you just want to play it through. You just have to get through the levels with the (sometimes not so many) checkpoints. But if you want a challenge, ok: Collect over 300, or even 350 points in the level, complete it with the best time possible or even find all of the hidden emoticons!\nAnyways, sometimes the not so good spreaded checkpoints are a little annoying or the unlimate pro times in the time challengers mode. You have to complete the level in a certain time (may sometimes even be 3 minutes!) AND not die AND be as fast as somehow possible. This is sometimes annoying, but I mean: it is optional, so...\n\nI already talked about the Gameplay a bit: Different worlds, different challenges, new abilities, time trial,...\nThe most fun though is exploring the level. If you just up in the "wrong" way that you should and then do a bit of this and that...Hey! There is a mini game for an emoticon! And if you try to just go under the collapsing bridge...50 points in a coin! Nice done, Ubisoft!\nAlso, you unlock new characters and racing levels with the emoticons. The characters are just for the optics, but the races are really fun! With the pursuit soundtrack you run behind a running Chest around a collapsing level, split up, come to him again, etc etc. It is just like a much better time trial mode!\n\nAnyways, the Longness is not so long if you just play the game through without secrets, time trials and so on. You can be through in 7 hours. If you do the time trials and the other stuff, Rayman can take like 25 hours. This is up to you. For this huge difference there is a minus in the points rating though...\nThe Multiplayer is the only thing I would critise in the game: You may play local Co Op, but there are no Local Co Op levels, and in a time in which everything is connected to the Internet, an Internet Multiplayer is actually a must-have...\n\nTL;DR: If you want to play a platformer which makes you happy while exploring wonderful levels with atmospheric music, you should buy this game! Just if you need a Multiplayer at all costs though, you should think about getting the game.","December 21, 2013","true","16.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is nonsensical if the hitbox of the character reactivates after half a second, so you have no time to understand how to save the situation.\n\n3) Hitboxes of the character, enemies and dangerous environment is not clever at all.\nThere are tentacles that hit you far under the bottom of the drawing and far under the upper; thunders that have a giant invisible hitbox; enemies that I still don't know how far to hit them.\nDrawings are very pleasant to see but deceive you from their true collision box.\n\n4) The controls and the physics are not good for a platformer game:\nMaybe, here it'd be appropriate a "last but not least".\nNow, I know that lots of people agree that controls are very good and movement are precise and the overall physics is cool.\nI think here, maybe, is just a matter of opinion, but at least I want to give a reason to my opinion.\nMovement is super smooth, even when not on ice, even when you are in the middle air, and this makes it very imprecise when jumping on platforms.\nRunning movement is ambiguous: you can start fast and get your movement even more slippery especially in the middle air when you have no more chances to strike a floating platform.\nJumping is decided by the time you press the button, but it has only two values, a high jump and a not-so-short jump, that does not give you the possibility to jump quickly between platforms while running.\nWhen becoming tiny, all the physic changes and gives you a very hard time: lateral attacks are always charged, jumps are even more not precise and you are like constantly on ice.\nGliding with you hairs almost instantly cut down your speed to a constant value, that you can adjust but still with slippery controls. Also, you can't instantly reactivate the gliding, making the flying parts very painful.\nRunning on curved walls seemed a cool feature, but there are too many parts in wich you must jump to another wall and continue running. I never understood that system as more of half of the times the character started falling down or going backward (on upside-down running).\n\nWithout any doubt, this has been one of the most slippery platformers I've ever played since years and those 4 points are why the game should have deserved a bad vote.\nAnyway, the work with graphics, music, humor and cuteness saves this game.\n\nAnd now, let's install Rayman Legends\n\n\nUpdate:\nI'm playing Rayman Legends and it's absolutely 100 times better than Origins!\nAll the negative aspects of this title are wiped away, collectibles are fun to take and movements are very precise.","July 10, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/recommended/207490/","Saleck","Saleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/","650 products in account","Rayman has been around since the mid 1990s but the rapid success of the spin-off Raving Rabbids had left the main character behind and stuck in the background. But then one day, original creator Michel Ancel decided to bring the character to give the team a break from developing Beyond Good and Evil 2.\n\nThe return of the character as well as its return to its platforming roots has been very much celebrated. This is probably as good as platformers are ever going to get. The game has a fun, cartoony look and atmosphere to it, it doesn't take itself seriously at all and it completely blows away anything Sonic and Mario have done over the last 10 years.\n\nThe difficulty is spot on, no lives system here you just keep going, with checkpoints that are places so the game remains challenging without being frustrating, you'll never be wasting more then a minute of your time getting back to the point where you messed up.\n\nThe level environments and music are so well created its surreal. You can revisit any level you want to play from the game menu and the flow of the levels are so smooth. The game is long too, expect it to take a good 10 hours to get through, if you pace yourself.\n\nHighly recommended if you love great platforming, wacky fun humour and a great art style to fit it all together with.

Sadly, the game is meant for kids below the ages of 12. This is not a negative per se but I find that I am unable to appreciate the prepubescent cuteness. I loved the idea of the extra levels, each level is revisited again to find the King of the land. However, I would call this a non-priority game. Why? There is no excitement that constantly makes me want to keep on playing. I use this more as a filler game when I'm free.\n\nPROS\n1. Hidden Levels\nLots of them to find. They aren't hard to find but it's worth looking for.\n\n2. Mini Games\nThe mosquito level was very interesting. Being able to fly a mosquito with a vacuum proboscis was fun.\n\n3. Pig Latin\nI didn't see it at first, but then I saw that the language used was Pig Latin or Ig-Pay Atin-Lay.\n\n4. Revisiting\nIt's nice to see that they place another set of levels on top of the original set, so you basically get 2 separate copies of the same zone. 1 easy mode and 1 hard mode.\n\nCONS\n1. Hard to keep my attention for long\nI don't know how to put it, I wanted to play the game a bit at a time.\n\n2.

Basically, what I thought was this:\n\n- Music and graphics are really, really amazing! Top-notch stuff, really.\n- But everything else is meh or bad. Gameplay is so boring, really repetitive, and the game is insanely easy. Infinite lives? C'mon... There are only 2 challenges in the game (getting gold medals for colleting enough fireflies, or whatever they're called, and the trophy for time trial), but even those aren't too hard.\n- I haven't tried co-op mode, but I think it would be even easier.\n\nSo basically it's a bland game that relies solely on a trademark and on aesthetics.\n\nBut, wait, it gets worse!\nAfter playing for about 8 hours, mastering 3 worlds, the game crashed (not for the first time) and that crash affected my savefile! So, basically, I lost all my progress.\nAnd you know what? This has been a known bug FOR OVER 2 YEARS, and not the only game-breaking bug I've found in the forums.\nFrom Steam Support's page for the game, I get a link for an official website that doesn't exist anymore, and a link to a support center that offers no support for this game. (and I'm currently requesting a refund for this game, because I've paid for a complete game).\n\nI think that this game should be removed from Steam, or at least feature a big label, saying "THIS GAME IS A BROKEN AND ABANDONED BY UBISOFT! BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!"\nWhat annoys me the most is that this is a game from a big franchise in a big company. There should be no excuse for such huge mistakes.\n\nAnd what really, really puzzles me is how can it have 956 positive reviews as of now, totalling 95% of the reviews. This game is mediocre at best without the game-breaking bugs, and doesn't even get close to living up to its franchise name, so DON'T BE FOOLED BY ITS COVER and avoid it entirely.\n\n(Also, as I protest, I refuse to even give Legends a try.)\n\nEDIT: To top it off, after a long series of annoying Ubisoft support (in which they repeatedly tell me to run an antivirus), they tell me they can't make the proper tests because THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE GAME!!!","December 27, 2015","false","8.3"," 24 of 53 people (45%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","45","24","53","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/recommended/207490/","ksempac","Ksempac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/","303 products in account","It's a Rayman game (I loved the first one on PS1), it's often good, sometimes great... so why I am so bored when I play it ?\n\nTwo expressions come to my mind to try to get to describe the feelings i have regarding this game: "Soulless" and "Paint-by-numbers".\n\nMany of the levels feel empty. You go from platform to platform, you meet some enemies, but most of them are immobile, or even sleeping. They don't feel like enemies at all, they are not here to hunt you, they don't care about you at all. They completely lack personality. Good platformers have enemies that have an interesting behavior that give them personality. Even Goombas in Mario are memorable with their mean looking eyes. In Rayman, in many cases, that's not the case. It's so bad that sometimes it's hard to tell if something is here to help you or kill you (i made a few mistakes that way).\n\nStory-wise it's the same. It's full of holes. After a hilarious 5 min cartoon intro, the game tells you "ok you have to fetch electoons again. Go for it". It's almost like there is no relation to what you just saw with what you have to do. Most of the characters you will meet have no name, and will usually don't utter more than one sentence. Sometimes it feels like there are 2 distinct stories and none of them was completed.\n\nThat's really disappointing, because technically the game is top notch, with colorful environments and very nice animations. And sometimes, the Rayman's magic is back. In a few levels, (particularly the water world levels), enemies actually have personality, the environments are full of life, and the music nicely complement the action.\n\nNowadays AAA studios have mostly abandoned platformers to the indie scene. So i was happy to get a new Rayman from a big Ubisoft studio. I suspect many of you feel the same.\n\nHowever, I can't forget nor forgive the fact that, after 2 or 3 levels, i usually quit the game because i was bored. Worse, i also used the "skip level" functionality several times when i didn't feel like completing that level right away. That's not things i would get in a good game. I did finish the game, including the awesome bonus level (by far, the best level, and really enjoyable), but i really had to force myself to play many of the levels (particularly the wind world).\n\nSadly, there are too many boring levels where I'm just going through the motions. "Been there, done that", was a recurring feeling. Most levels felt like the 1000th iteration on the same stuff from countless platformers. There are too few memorable/good levels for me to recommend this game.\n\nMaybe some of the problems come from the added multiplayer. I only played the game solo, and i guess with friends, it would get more chaotic, but also more fun. Maybe that would alleviate some of the issues i had with the game. It would explain why the levels sometimes feel empty and the enemies are too passive: with 4 players it must already be very hard to get to the end with everyone. But I'm unable to test that theory.\n\nPS : For achievements hunters, be warned that the game doesn't include Steam achievements, even though the console versions have them.\n\nPS2 : Regarding difficulty. Some reviewers state that this game is the toughest game they've ever seen. That's not my opinion. 2D Platformers have often been challenging games. Considering that fact, i think that Origins is not easy, but it's not hard either.\n\nIf you just want to see the end, as well as unlock the bonus level, Rayman Origins is way easier than many platformers from the 90s, like the SNES platformers, or Rayman 1 on PS1. It's also way easier than some modern titles like Super Meat Boy. If you're familiar with platformers, you should be able to finish it without issue.\n\nTime trials are probably trickier, but i wasn't interested in trying them so i can't give you my opinion on them.","January 18, 2015","false","21.3"," 14 of 34 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","14","34","0","8"

Then there are tight and responsive controls which should make a enjoyable platformer, but Rayman Origins lacks something that makes you want to see the next stage.\nAfter three hours it seems that you've already seen everything and you will go through the same kind of levels in different scenarios again.\nFirst platforming, then mosquito flying and in the end you will get a new skill. And when you have enough collectables you will go back to earlier worlds to race a treasure chest.\nWhen I finally cleared all worlds and thought I was going to face the boss the game opened more passages to extended stages of the prior worlds.\nAnd again I went through the same procedure again. Jumping, Flying and rescuing nymphs for the final assault.\nOverall it was very repetitive (gameplay, animation, screen and the end of every stage) and I literally was so bored that I almost didn't finish the game.\nThen there were some bugs that didn't make the game scroll to the new area when I went through portals or doors. The only solution was to restart the whole level again.\nBecause the game becomes very challenging in the end ('Super Meat Boy'-esque),  this can be very frustrating and makes it definitely not a game for kids, although it's artdesign\nand it's humor, which didn't really get me, makes you think so.\n\nI really wanted to play Rayman Legends afterwards but my experience really made me reconsider.\n\nUnfortunally It's not a Mario or a DKCR (obviously the game's original) for PC ...\n\n6/10\n\nPS: The last levels were cool though ...","January 24, 2014","false","11.7"," 23 of 55 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","23","55","0","1"

It could be a combination of a few things: the music is not great (simple beats, but nothing moving, or interesting to hear), the character animations are good, but get old quickly.

A few mechanics beyond running, jumping and attacking are unlocked as you progress - swimming , wall running, flying - however they're mostly only used in the world that you unlocked them in.\n\nThe combat is very simple, most enemies die in one hit, apart from the bosses which have some originality, but like much of the harder portions of the game, the bosses just need lots of repetition to get muscle memory and knowledge of attack patterns.\n\nEach level has a few "electoons", which are mostly quite easy to acquire. The fun part in getting these is in the little challenge each section presents, but due to limited game mechanics, I can't remember any distinct ones.\n\nThe hard parts, such as bosses and the levels where you chase a treasure chest for a secret *thing*, are like quick time events without the visual cues - and if you're just a moment off even though you made a good recovery, the design of the game forces you to play again, getting a microsecond closer to the speed they want you to get to.\n\nThe visuals are quite nice, but you only notice them in the calm before the storm because otherwise you're too busy running around or trying to not die, which is a shame.\n\nThe music was unique, but the loops caused by dying repeatedly mean that any nice melodies are quickly forgotten.\n\nThe sidescrolling shooter parts are fun and a good challenge, and there aren't too many, which means you can accept that they didn't give the separate costumes (oops, I mean characters) distinctive playstiles.\nAs far as I noticed, even in the walking part of the game, the different characters did nothing either, apart from help you identify you and your friends apart.\n\nWithout co-op I probably wouldn't enjoyed this game enough to bother going very far. Co-op mechanics were decent and allowed for coordination and teamwork, however guacamelee did it better - in fact, I think Guacamelee did everything better, apart from on incomparable things such as artstyle.\n\ntl;dr unless you're a big Rayman fan, play Guacamelee instead.","June 22, 2014","false","20.6"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","2","17","0","0"

Everything is too soft and sluggish. Attacks often interrupt flow rather than contribute and I frequently felt like I didn't have enough control of the character.\n\nThe difficulty also seems slightly mistuned. I think I'm pretty good at platformers (I have 100% in Super Meat Boy) and I found myself consistently missing the par for each course by only a few points. This makes replaying levels a tense affair as missing a single Lum can fill you with dread that its just cost you level's medal and you have to start the whole dreadful business over again.\n\nI got excited in my playthrough as I finished the final island - hoping that the game was nearing its end - when it was revealed that I then had to revist every location again to beat the game. As if this didn't crush my sprits enough, my hard drive crashed and I lost my save.

That part was REALLY hard. I even went online to find solutions and I tried all of them. I'm not going to spoil it for everyone, but it involves **SPOILER** making sure your controller is plugged in before starting **SPOILER**\n\nAnd I'm STILL stuck trying to configure my gamepay. Holy ♥♥♥♥ this is a tough game. I really like the design so far though, the EA into and the music is really jazzy, and I feel like if I get any further in the game I'm really going to have a blast, even more so than where I am right now.\n\nI guess if there's anything I'd fix with the game, it's that you can't seem to get it to recognize your XBox360 controller. I mean DANG, I'm not the only one with the problem, patch this already so we can keep playing, Ubisoft! ;)\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this game though. It's really short and so far all I've been able to do is enter the options and that's about it.\n\nI'm sure the rest of the game is great though, but it might be too hard for noobs like me. I mean, if I can't get any further than that, just two minutes into the game, I guess I'm going to have a really hard time in the later parts.\n\nAnyway that's it for my review. Oh, and here's some extra points:\n\nGraphics 4/5 - Crisp and really great, iconic design. Good intro animation.\nSound 4/5 - it gets repetitive after a while, and there only seems to be one song so far, but it's catchy!\nPlot 3/5 - The game's really got me stoked to find out what those little things flying into the EA symbol in the beginning are.\nControls 1/5 - While technically I haven't been able to play with my controller yet, the mouse can open menus really well!\nChallenge 5/5 - Only play this if you are a PRO! I mean it!\nOverall  3.5/5 - Hopefully there's going to be a LP that'll show me how to get past the control puzzle soon.","February 13, 2014","false","0.5"," 4 of 24 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","4","24","0","0"

Smooth, challenging, and utterly worthwhile. Rayman Origins, unlike most of the games in the series, is in touch with its roots, and recovers the same qualities that made the original Rayman such an excellent game. On the other hand, it isn't trapped in the past - this is no mere nostalgia trip, but its own distinct thing with its own unique playstyle and art style.\nIt's not quite as expansive as the original Rayman, but still rewards exploration. and offers multiple objectives in a given level to make multiple playthroughs worthwhile.\nSkill-wise,it gets reasonably tricky in the later levels, approaching Super Meat Boy in terms of difficulty. The level design has an excellent sense of flow. It's also pretty imaginitive, and evokes the feel of the original game's setting without copying it.\nThe only criticism I have is that it feels very slightly unfinished in places - missing animations, boss fights that are a bit shorter than expected, a somewhat abrupt ending. Nothing that really hurts the game, one just feels that they could have given it another month or so of polish before release and it wouldn't have been a bad idea.\nIf you're looking for a platformer, this is an excellent choice!

And the later levels are very challenging, so it doesn't feel like you breeze through the game.

Smooth, challenging, and utterly worthwhile. Rayman Origins, unlike most of the games in the series, is in touch with its roots, and recovers the same qualities that made the original Rayman such an excellent game. On the other hand, it isn't trapped in the past - this is no mere nostalgia trip, but its own distinct thing with its own unique playstyle and art style.\nIt's not quite as expansive as the original Rayman, but still rewards exploration. and offers multiple objectives in a given level to make multiple playthroughs worthwhile.\nSkill-wise,it gets reasonably tricky in the later levels, approaching Super Meat Boy in terms of difficulty. The level design has an excellent sense of flow. It's also pretty imaginitive, and evokes the feel of the original game's setting without copying it.\nThe only criticism I have is that it feels very slightly unfinished in places - missing animations, boss fights that are a bit shorter than expected, a somewhat abrupt ending. Nothing that really hurts the game, one just feels that they could have given it another month or so of polish before release and it wouldn't have been a bad idea.\nIf you're looking for a platformer, this is an excellent choice!

You may think its going to be a crappy console port, but suprising it is very well made and does not suffer from consolization at all.  Don't let the cartoony graphics fool you, this game is not a kiddy adventure that holds your hand and lets you win.  Some of the levels are rediculously hard and several times I was at controller throwing levels of frustration.  In terms of difficulty its right up there with the best platformers.  The music is great and the animation really drives the games humor which is suttle, and never takes itself to seriously.  The biggest selling point is the game is HALF the price of the console version, and will probably go on sale in the future.  All around a good buy if you like old school 2D platformers.","May 2, 2012","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rayman is living proof of this; Rayman Origins has to be the most inventive, most hilarious, and most "feel-good" game I've played in a long time, in any genre. This isn't a game you can just breeze through, either, since it's extremely challenging and will seriously put your platforming skills to the test, especially in its later half. And if you want to reach the very most definitely last world, you'll have to get all ten Skull Teeth from some of the most challenging and fast-paced sequences, which give Super Meat Boy a run for its money (which is a great thing).\n\nIt has a large, phenominal soundtrack; a wacky sense of humor that doesn't feel forced at all; it controls like a dream; and its low system requirements mean that just about any computer can play it flawlessly while (also proving that demanding specs don't make good games). And on top of it, the graphics are absolutely gorgeous and shows just how lush and colorful hand-drawn graphics can be.

BUT it still didnt surpass Mario Land: 6 Golden Coins for the gameboy(I also recomend playing it in an emulator, It's still the best mario game IMO). But that was a long time ago!\nFastforward to today... and i can say without a doubt Rayman Origins is THE BEST platformer game i have ever played.\n\n\n\nGood:\n+4 player local co-op!\n+Awesome visuals, Rayman in HD looks great!\n+Great animations\n+A LOT of levels with diferent ways to play them (time trials are awesome, but hard!)\n+Good old Rayman humour :D\n+The game starts really easy but gets harder with each level you unlock, after getting all 246 electoons and beating  "The Land of the Livid Dead"	 i felt like a badass xD\n+The game is 100% DRM-Free! You dont need Uplay or Steam to play.\n+Sountrack is really good\n\n\n\nBad:\n+/-The graphics options only allows to change the resolution, however the game is well optimized and runs great.\n-No achievements... why ?!?!?\n\n\n\nFinal Verdict: 10/10 If you like hard games, platformers or games with local coop, buy this ASAP! Its worth the price asked even when not on sale.\n\n\nMy Game Progress: 246/246 Electoons and 10/10 Skull Teeth, still have some gold ribons missing.\nGame difficulty: Getting all the 246 electoons can be frustrating, because those timed levels get harder and harder! The skull teeth are easy enough once you know the levels.","November 2, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timebolt/recommended/207490/","timebolt","Timebolt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timebolt/","70 products in account","With rayman origins being the first rayman game since rayman 3 released in 2003 I was understanderbly nervous that this game would not meet my expectations especially with it's coop.  I was afraid that it would be a coop only game or a game that had features locked behind a coop wall.  Thankfully this is not the case.\n\nRayman Origins is a game that you don't need a friend to play.  It'll make your life much easier in the latter half of the game sure but it isn't required (and honestly on a computer playing with a friend can be rather cramped especially if there's going to be four of you in total).  Unfortunately the coop system is local meaning you can't play with friends over the internet.  This is silly really because I know a couple that want to play this game with me but as I said playing at a computer desk is cramped.  You can always wait for a steam machine but you might as well get this game for a console if your going to do that.\n\nThe game itself is very difficult in the latter half.  If your inexperienced with platformers you may rage quit.  There isn't any lives in this game so you won't be getting any game over screens like in mario but your patience will be tested to the limit.\n\nThe levels themselves aesthetically look beautiful you'd be hard pushed to find a game that looks better (not counting the sequel Rayman Legends).  With many hidden objects to locate you'll having a lot of fun if your the completionist.  If your not a completionist and just want to get from start to finish each level then your not going to have much luck seeing as in order to unlock bosses you need to collect a certain number of electoons.  The electoons aren't hard to find if you look but if you don't like playing hide and seek you can always collect a certain number of lums per level to get electoons or beat the level under a time limit.  There are other rewards if you go out of your way but they are only for bragging rights.\n\nI would like to point out that the game support gamepad support, kinda.  You see connecting a gamepad isn't enough for the game to register it.  You have to calibrate the button mapping which is something you really shouldn't need to do with a platformer and it's a shame because the game is easier if you have a gamepad.\n\nIn terms of story it's...enjoyable however there is a rather large plothole that comes at the end of the game that ruins it a bit for me.  Now the story is very bare bones.  The glade of dreams gets invaded by the land of the livin' dead after Rayman and the clan are snoring too loudly and thats really all you need to know.  The story doesn't go much further after that but my problem is at the end.  I won't spoil it but lets just say it raises more questions rather than answering questions.\n\nI reccomend playing the demo first to see if you'll like it.  Be warned the actual game is much harder than the demo and the graphical settings are no where near as in depth as they are in the demo (not sure why either).\n\nPersonally I think this game is the best in the franchise but I am yet to play Rayman Legends.  If you want a comparison to other platformers then I would have to say it is better than the original sonic games for the mega drive.  This game is worth the full price.","June 28, 2012","true","83.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By the time I realize what I must have missed all these years. If the predecessors are as ingenious as Raymann Origins, then I have much to catch up.\n\nThe game is a brightly colored, insane action-platformer. Whether alone or with up to 4 players, you roll through the highly innovative game sections. Your main task is to collect wobbly stuff, fly through side scrolling sections and defeat sick bosses.\n\nThe presentation is plain fun. Even after several hours of play, the eye doesn't get tired.

I played many other bright and colorful platformers over the course of my childhood but once I reached adulthood almost no one was making these kinds of games anymore. It was just Call of Duty and Fallout 3, good games but also good examples of the "gritty realism" so prevelent in todays AAA games.\nRayman Origins is surely the greatest evolution the platforming genre has seen since Mario Bros. The 2d graphics are amazing. High resolution, beautfilly animated, joyously designed. The game is a visual feast.\nThe gameplay is simple yet deep. You can learn to play in five minutes but it will take months to master. Controls are precise, moves are varied, this is approaching the height of platforming game design.

It didn't take long for me to get hooked on this great game. Wonderful animations, artwork and music all come together to make this one of the best 2D platformers I have had the pleasure of playing. The Co-op is also fantastic in that it allows a seasoned gamer play with a 4 year old and not get held up, in fact, the co-op is set up in such a way that having an inexperienced gamer can still assist in progressing through the game.\n\nGraphics:\nGraphically the game is flawless running at full HD and it runs great even on my work laptop with Intel graphics. The animations are smooth, artwork is amazing and the controls are responsive and natural.\n\nSound:\nThe game has a great sound track and the sounds are interesting and varied.\n\nOverall the game is great, the only issue I have is with the steam overlay, it is best to disable it in the game properties. If you bring up the overlay in game it can cause a player to join and run to the left which can be a real pain.","January 24, 2014","true","26.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very smooth and fluid, with gorgeous animation and design to the characters and environments.\n\n1 thing I dislike the most:\nThe shmup levels. Very cluttered, probably too much, and with no surefire way to keep your eyes on your charcter with multiple enemies and players all over the place. They are seemingly the longest type of level, and though they are by far the easiest the medals for (there's 3 for each level instead of the standard 6), I feel like there's not enough checkpoint spread throughout all that length.\n\n1 feature I would want added:\nSimply being able to switch costumes with a menu during the world map screen, instead of having to enter a costume/rest area, which you can't exit immediately. You have to go to the far end of the last room to get to the exit door. Can get people who change outfits regularly ever slightly so annoyed.\n\n1 feature I would want taken out:\nThe "coin collected" type medals. Makes completing every level with all medals tedious; I gave up after realizing I wasn't having fun. Replace with a "beat the level without dying" challenge or something; you'll still be restarting, just a whole lot less.\n\nWhat I want improved:\nThe Boss fights. A mixed bag, really.

Boy was I in for a surprise.\n\nThe game is so much fun. Gameplay is your standard 2D platformer fare. You run and jump towards the end of the level, collecting yellow "lums" for a high score, and defeating enemies by jumping on their heads, or slapping them silly. Nothing out of the ordanary.\n\nWhat makes this game stand out is just how joyful and fun it is. The graphics have a beautiful hand-painted look that call back to the old hand drawn Disney films. Levels are all unique and colorful, with environments having distinct feels. The music is catchy, with a mix of orchestral symphonies, and western country banjo playing. Levels are difficult and may take a few tries, but are nothing compared to the unrelenting difficulty PC platformers like Meat Boy usually ask. But most of all, the game is just fun to play.\n\nTL;DR: This game is New Super Mario Brothers, but on the PC.","July 12, 2012","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you loved loose and crazy platformers post-Sonic and as far from the Mario formula as possible then Origins is exactly the game you want. Michael Ancel makes GREAT GAMES (read: Beyond Good and Evil) and jesus man he just nailed it with Rayman Origins. This is the most fun I've had in a game in a long time.

At times, there are levels that are too intense, and that's due to either the areas getting too dangerous and cramped for you to dodge and jump, a lot of enemies and obstacles getting too crowded, or everything at a fast pace. This makes it even harder in cases like the boss levels, as you try to remember the pattern on how to defeat them, the Treasure Chest chasing levels, and for those who want to complete every level with the highest amount of Lums and Electoons. This will make you want to retry/restart the level simultaneously, if you want to achieve perfection on this game.\n\nThat is from my experience. But don't let this discourage you.

Some areas are more detailed than others, the first being one of the best, but even the simpler ones still give an amazing feel.\n\nThe music stands out with some really catchy tunes, but in a number of instances focuses a lot on childish sounds and themes that may become irritating to some people after a while.\n\nThe story, at least the part told directly in the form of cutscenes and dialogue during gameplay, is extremely simplistic, childish and minimalist, but hides lots of details and connections to earlier games in the franchise for whoever decides to look for extra material on the internet.\n\nI felt a few pacing problems around the 60-80% mark, where the game was starting to feel longer than it should be, but after that it got me glued again until I finished it.\n\nHighly recommended!","September 20, 2015","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At times, there are levels that are too intense, and that's due to either the areas getting too dangerous and cramped for you to dodge and jump, a lot of enemies and obstacles getting too crowded, or everything at a fast pace. This makes it even harder in cases like the boss levels, as you try to remember the pattern on how to defeat them, the Treasure Chest chasing levels, and for those who want to complete every level with the highest amount of Lums and Electoons. This will make you want to retry/restart the level simultaneously, if you want to achieve perfection on this game.\n\nThat is from my experience. But don't let this discourage you. If you're a fan of the Rayman series, or you like a really creative, or challenging Platform game, this is definitely worth looking at.","September 8, 2015","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedyspikes/recommended/207490/","speedyspikes","SpeedySpikes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedyspikes/","21 products in account","I've had Rayman Origins on the PlayStation 3 since it first came out, and it's given me hardly any disappointment. It's a fantastically fun game!\n\nThere's no need to complain about the lack of a story simply because this game is emulating the good ol' days where it was just about the gameplay and fun and not necessarily about the story.\n\nRayman Origins is a 2D platformer, and the control in this game is very smooth and responsive. The game boasts 60+ levels of awesomeness, and players get new powers from the nymphs as they go along. Yes, you have to win the power of punching and kicking. But that's a callback to the first game! And the third! The levels are differently themed. You will travel through jungles, oceans, mountains, frozen tundras, musical lands and even an infernal kitchen! The game is designed to be relatively easier to just get through, however the game does get a lot harder as you progress. Plus, the major challenge in the game comes from gathering the collectables. Electoons can be found in cages or won by collecting hundreds of Lums, which can be found scattered throughout the level, obtained from defeating enemies or finding Skull Coins. The Tricky Treasure levels provide the second-biggest challenge in the game, as they are frantic chase-the-chest levels where the stage pretty much falls apart even worse as you keep going, and you earn Skull Teeth from these. The boss fights are not as difficult as I expected them to be, but they still provide a good challenge. However, once you complete the game there are a few very interesting twists that I will not reveal. Play the game to find out. :P The hardest challenge, of course, comes from The Land of the Livid Dead, a level that is unlocked after gathering all 10 Skull Teeth.\n[EDIT: I have played this level, and GOSH DARN IT is it hard! I lost track of how many times I died just trying to complete one section of the stage, but it's a lot of fun, and worth it, too. :) ]\n\nBut it all gets a lot zanier and crazier if you bring some buddies along! Up to four players can play this game at the same time. I've only done co-op with one friend at a time (I only had 2 PS3 controllers), but even that gets nutsy after a little while. The players have free reign to slap each other without directly hurting each other (however that won't stop you from accidentally launching your buddy off the cliff or into a trap). I have, however, done a whole bunch of friend co-op in the game's sequel, Rayman Legends, and if that mayhem was any indication, you're gonna have a great time with this one!\n\nThe Windows/OS X port was done pretty well. The only gripe I have is that it doesn't appear to be optimized TOO well, as occasionally it will skip a frame or two. It's nothing terrible, but to me, it's noticeable.\n\nNow, people may want to draw parallels to Legends. Is it better? Well... To be honest, I found Legends to be a little too easy. Origins packs more of a challenge from what I could see, and, honestly, I kinda prefer the cartoony art over the more realistic rendering of Legends. And it had an anti-climatic ending that wasn't funny like this on--\nIn fact, screw it. This game is miles better than Rayman Legends. To be fair, Legends has more content, but something just feels...off about that game compared to this one. This game has lots of character, bright environments, upbeat and fantastic music and, well, the entire game is amazing!\n\nIf you love platformers and/or Rayman, GET THIS GAME. You will NOT be disappointed! As you can see, I had no problem buying another copy of this game, so even if you have this game on a console already, get it for Steam.","December 11, 2015","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fantastic graphics that ooze with charm, with a soundtrack to match them, Rayman's world feels rich and completely developed. The learning curve is rather fair too, and ends up being a devilish challenge that avoids rage quit with plentiful checkpoints.\n\nSuch a shame that despite perfect execution on the game part, there is literally no story here. Im not expecting something deep or meaningful, it's Rayman after all. But from the developer or Beyond good and evil, how hard would it have been to throw in a similar whimsical story that propels the action along. Would have been a perfect 10/10 if it had that, but as it stands a very solid 8/10.","December 22, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Platformers should have as close to precise control as possible, especially one as unforgiving as Rayman.\n\n* On that note, collecting every last collectible bit is a nightmare as many of them are one chance per level. No going back. If you miss it you pretty much have to start the entire level or section over again. Combine that with sluggish, floaty controls and you end up with a game that feels more like a chore than a good time.\n\n* Slow. The pacing of the entire game is slow. Load screen... level.... tally score.... load screen... map... next level. After seeing it again and again, it starts to feel like a grind.\n\nNot for everyone.","July 1, 2015","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art is gorgeous and the music is impressive. In general, this game is casual and suitable for players who are not good at action games. Certainly, skilled players can also find some tricky and challenging levels such as boss fight and time race.\n\nI recommand this game for some other reasons listed below:\n+ Multiplayer game has so much fun! This game supports up to 4 players to local co-op.\n+ This game is quite replayable. It is still interesting for you if you have played it through.\n+ No Uplay to bother your gaming experience.\n+ Control is simple and most players can master it after hours of game play.\n\nSome drawbacks are listed below:\n- No steam achievement and cloud. You have to manually backup saves.\n- Some minor bugs are not fixed for a long time. I remember there is a bug on one stage of Mountain World which may make you stuck on that level (You have to restart that level.

You can easily discover every secret in this game, as they're all very clearly hidden and far too frequent. The later levels and challenges while fun, kind of come down to memorization in the end. You can skillfully figure out the solutions to the difficult running segments, but sometimes it's a very annoying process. There are many specific things you have to do in this segments, and remembering all of it can be a little obnoxious. I personally think that it's better to make a game difficult without the requirement of trial and error, or level memorization. I don't know if this remains true, but my controllers would not work in this game in the past. Back when I played this game, I had to configure them using joytokey to get my controllers working.\n\nThat being said, this game forces you to think on your toes and act even faster. Music is great, the art is fantastic and I think it's far better than anything Ubisoft's development teams put out prior. If you're looking for a fun and mostly simple platformer that's just as fantastic solo as it is with friends, you should already own this game. What it lacks in complexity, storytelling and any discernible feelings other than enjoyment, it more than makes up for with it's core gameplay.","June 2","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
