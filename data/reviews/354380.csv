The art is nice and the gameplay is fun (plays well with mouse/keyboard). Unlike AC Unity, this game is worth the hard earned money I paid for it. Happy.\n\n-- Update --\nSince my review got a significant amount of views, I will add some helpful information.\n\nThere is no in-game facility to change the keyboard/mouse controls. To do this, you go to your AC Chronicles China install location, specifically the config. Mine is "I:\Steam\SteamApps\common\Assassins Creed Chronicles China\ACCGame\Config".\n\nOnce there you are looking for a file called "DefaultInput.ini". Please make sure to make a backup before making any changes to this file.\n\nIn here you should have options for PlayerInput (gamepad) controls or Keyboard and Mouse controls. I haven't tested everything but you should be able to change the key name for each action to another of your choice.\n\nAs an example I changed the following line:\n+Bindings=(Name="C",Command="Button bBButton | Button bCounterButton | DetachRope")\nto\n+Bindings=(Name="LeftAlt",Command="Button bBButton | Button bCounterButton | DetachRope")\n\nIf you are not sure what your keys are named, visiting the official Unreal Engine wiki might help: http://wiki.unrealengine.com/List_of_Key/Gamepad_Input_Names\n\nI hope that's helpful! :)","April 21, 2015","true","3.8"," 703 of 875 people (80%) found this review helpful 140 people found this review funny","80","703","875","140","22"

It's the same thing as in Unity how everyone speaks with an English accent even though it takes place in France. I just don't understand why this is the case with a company that makes as much money as Ubisoft.\n+ Similar to the previous criticism, the Chinese names aren't pronounced correctly, which just takes away from the immerson for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/354380/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","As a game originally inspired by Prince of Persia, the Assassin's Creed series might be coming full circle with Assassin's Creed Chronicles, a series of 2.5D platforming action games that tell tales that aren't necessarily related to the ongoing storyline of the main series. Chronicles: China has greater depth than similar side-scrollers, along with an art style that gives it a unique personality of its own. While it suffers from a few quirks, it is a remarkable experience that livens up the series.\n\nThe first adventure takes us to 1526 China, where players relive the memories of Shao Jun, the last living member of the Chinese Brotherhood. It's a time of great turmoil, as the Ming Dynasty starts to crumble and the Templar gain control of the country through a puppet emperor. She's on a quest for vengeance and to help the downtrodden people of China... but mostly vengeance.\n\nMade to look like a living painting, the art style of AC Chronicles is nothing short of stunning. Perhaps climbing up structures in the Forbidden City or running across the Great Wall of China might be more impressive as a full 3D game, but Chronicles does an excellent job representing the historic period in 2.5D. That extra half dimension means a lot, because the map may rotate as Shao Jun climbs alongside buildings. Or she might run along a path that takes her deeper into the background or foreground of the level. Getting through a level involves a lot more than just going from left to right like traditional side scrolling adventure games.\n\nThis adventure is essentially a stealth game. It doesn't dock any points for killing guards, and will reward you for taking them out without being detected, but greater rewards are given for killing only the intended targets. To this end, Shao Jun comes equipped with a number of different tools, such as a rope dart for climbing up onto ceilings, or firecrackers to temporarily stun guards. She also has a number of skills that will help her move from cover to cover without being detected.\n\nPlayers can see the sight lines of all the patrolling guards. Getting through is a matter of leaping, running, and climbing without being seen. Here is where the limitations of the platforming game start to show. You can't always find a place to hide a body, and you can't drop them into water or toss them off a wall like you can in the main series. Invisible walls often keep you from stashing your handiwork. Fortunately, you can leave a body out in the open so long it's just outside of the remaining guards' sight range.\n\nThat's not to say that players can't fight should the need arise, since she carries a sword for that purpose. The problem is, Chronicles has a terrible combat system. Shao Jun can parry attacks, then follow-up with strikes, but it isn't very responsive. It's alright for taking on one guard, but you might as well restart from a checkpoint when two or more come after you. One of the least entertaining parts of the game comes when you're forced into one-on-one combat with a boss character. While the lackluster combat system might seem unfair, Chronicles works best as a stealth game. Slipping past guards is like a big puzzle, and there are multiple ways to solve it. Whether it involves silently killing everyone in your path or sneaking past them is up to you.\n\nEven as the threats start to escalate, and guards wizen up enough to start checking ceilings and ledges for your presence, the challenge never seems to be too overwhelming. However, I did run into a few frustrating bugs and quirks. In one instance, a guard with acute senses was able to detect my movements, even though I was well out of his range. One scene has you running for your life while an entire city burns down around you, yet a group of guards would rather stand around and fight you than run for their lives.\n\nDespite its issues, Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China is one of the most entertaining experiences I've had from the series. It's nice to take a break from the increasingly convoluted plot of the main storyline with a straightforward tale of revenge set in a historic corner of the world that often doesn't get a lot of attention in Western video games. This might not be the Assassin's Creed players asked for, but it's one that I'm thankful to have.","October 17, 2015","true","48.9"," 168 of 192 people (88%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","88","168","192","10","0"

From ancient times to the present, China has been a mysterious place that everyone want a piece(that's why we got rekt in modern history ;X)\nAlthough i m happy that Ubisoft finally realized there were two assassin agencies under the leadership of the eunuch in Ming dynasty, the  epic stories behind this huge background cannot be perfectly expressed----especially in 2d graphic.

Having played more of the game, I would like to revise and expand my review a bit.\n\nMy biggest gripe was, and still is, the terrible keyboard controls. You cannot rebind the controls unless you want to mess around in the .ini files. The default key choices are absolutely baffling considering the gameplay. Let me add that I've played every Assassin's Creed game to date with keyboard and mouse and never had any problems. I don't intend to and shouldn't be expected to buy a controller for one short DLC sidescroller.\n\nAs for the art style, it is beautiful, but honestly I expected more from it. The best bits, graphically, are by far the static cut scenes, which are done in a traditional Chinese watercolor style. The gameplay has a few nice artistic touches, but not enough to make it truly unique, like something like Okami. The art style just isn't impressive enough to make me forgive the gameplay problems.\n\nOn the whole, the game feels like an odd entry in the AC series, considering much of the gameplay goes against everything the franchise is known for. Instead of a vast, open world with lots of NPC interaction, emphasis on social stealth, side missions and freedom of movement, Chronicles: China is surprisingly limited. The series' trademark - being able to climb anything that looks climbable - is notably absent. Shao Jun is only able to climb along red-painted planks and netting. She also has no traditional hidden blade but relies more on her sword and martial arts. The game is entirely linear, the only "side quests" involve completing optional objectives like saving hostages, but the only thing you get from these is extra points. Combat feels like a chore, perhaps on purpose to encourage stealth, but these games have always been about allowing players to choose their own approach. If I want to fight my way in, I should be allowed to do so, but the terrible controls make longer fights nearly impossible to win. Social stealth is limited to maybe 2 sections, where crowds are essentially just a re-skinned hiding spot, instead of a dynamic element that reacts to your actions.\n\nIn short, the game feels nothing like one would expect an Assassin's Creed game to feel.\n\nIronically, despite being developed by a separate studio, the game does manage some gameplay-hampering glitches in true Ubisoft fashion. In a game where being detected essentially means having to start over, sometimes having to repeat long stretches, glitches can be seriously annoying. Sometimes Shao Jun refuses to assassinate a guard from a hiding spot, sometimes guards get stuck in "Alert" mode, sometimes their guard patterns get thrown out of whack, making it impossible to sneak past undetected etc.\n\nTutorials only allow you a set number of attempts to master a new move before disappearing forever. There's no way to review them if you get stuck or forget the controls, not even in the main menu.\n\nIf you're into old-school difficulty, the game does offer a reasonable challenge, at least if you care about high scores and achievements. If you don't, there's no reason to go back after finishing the game once.\n\nChronicles: China is pretty 'meh' as an Assassin's Creed experience. It's linear and limited, with nothing original to offer. You're probably better off playing Mark of the Ninja.","April 22, 2015","false","26.7"," 329 of 472 people (70%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","70","329","472","28","16"

YES!!!     Oh wait...it's not the usual style of Assassin's Creed game...?\n\nPersonally I had been craving for an Assassin's Creed game set in China, and I was very excited to see Chronicles release but it's not the usual AC game style that has previously been released, this is a side scroller, parkour run and jump glorified assault course in effect.  While this was disappointing initially, it was a refreshing change.\n\nThe art style, while not the most detailed looking game ever, it does look nice. There are some beautiful background landscapes throughout the story. Character models are very basic; at times it even looked as if some of the enemies didn't even have faces.\n\nEach of the levels are nicely set out, you have various optional objectives to complete in each stage for extra rewards, and I would highly recommend aiming to do these as it pads out some of the story so you can get further immersed in this world.\n\nAt times the difficulty of China is very easy; there are no major stumbling blocks to be found along the way, the hardest parts for me were the melee, but since this is a stealthy assassination game, you shouldn't really be aiming to take enemies on in melee fights anyway.\n\nThe only thing that let China down would be the game length; I was able to complete the whole story mode in just less than three and a half hours. I would at least expect a five or six hour story mode from Ubisoft here.\n\nSince the only negative point I was able to find was the game length, I would recommend China, since it is still only ¬£7, 99, you could possibly wait for sale season to start to get a bit more of a bargain.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Ever since Assassin's Creed Embers I've wanted to see her back but didn't expect much from Ubisoft.

I really dig the art style which adds perfectly to the overall ambience of the game and it actually creates more of the original AC feeling than especially Unity failed to.\nOne point for this is that AC China rewards you for being sneaky. You get a much higher rating if you stealth your way through a level and kill no one. Also, the combat is challenging, or has been at least for me. One enemy, mabye two, totally fine to take on, but anything above three seems more like suicide.\nThe soundtrack isn't overdoing it, especially in the action sequences, and there are subtle notes woven in that must be from Jesper Kyd's ACII OST, and now, guess what, I wanna replay that game.\nIt took me about 11 hours to finish because I wanted nothing as bad as not being seen and I applaud myself for managing that (in most levels).\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy this game, buy it once, buy it five times so you can give it to your friends which is a much better investment than buying Unity.","April 26, 2015","true","16.0"," 54 of 71 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","54","71","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/recommended/354380/","slothyexistence","The Slothful Existentialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/","952 products in account","The first entry in the Assassin‚Äôs Creed Chronicles trilogy is China, and for the sake of all that is good about Assassin‚Äôs Creed, I sincerely hope India and Russia are as visually satisfying, fun and overall enjoyable as this one is.\n\nChina is a fairly befitting setting for the assassins‚Äô style, the only thing is that there‚Äôs only one of them (Chinese brotherhood members) left: Shao Jun.\nWho is Shao Jun? Well, remember that Chinese girl who went to see Ezio during the last of his days in that short film titled Assassin‚Äôs Creed: Embers? Yep! That‚Äôs the one. She went to see him to learn how to lead and rebuild her Order. Ezio is probably the best choice for that.\nAfter being trained by none other than the legendary Ezio Auditore da Firenze himself two years prior to the start of the game, she is returning to China in 1526 amidst the crumble of the Ming dynasty and seeks vengeance upon the Templars who annihilated her brotherhood and plans to restore it.\n\nThe game is noticeably different than most others in the franchise, instead of being open-world the playable areas are offered in sections. It is also 2.5D (literally 3D but with side-scrolling platform gameplay), with some aspects of 3D gameplay, as one can sometimes access the Z-axis, which makes the gameplay interesting and adds a third dimension to otherwise two-dimensional levels. Obviously there‚Äôs free-running, climbing and parkour all over the place, and it all feels extremely fluid. The gameplay is heavily based on platforming, stealth and combat. There are hiding spots almost everywhere, and if there isn‚Äôt you can always cause distractions by cutting a rope with a Throwing Knife and dropping hanging objects, or using the Noise Dart to lead a guard away, or stunning them or simply whistling to distract a guard. The hiding spots are cleverly implemented into the level design, and when you‚Äôre in a hiding spot close to another one you can switch to and from quickly, avoiding guards and progressing faster.\nBut of course, things don‚Äôt always go as planned so the combat is actually pretty well executed; there aren‚Äôt counters like in other games in the franchise, instead you block a lot more and roll over enemies for strategic purposes. There‚Äôs a soft but fast hit, and a slow but hard hit. Depending on the weapon your opponent has also results in varied ways of blocking/dodging. The combat is purposely difficult, as the game‚Äôs true core gameplay lies in being unnoticed, but one can still carry out assassinations without being noticed, some of which are pretty amazing.\n\nAs for the visual aspect of the game, I can‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs extremely intense or detailed, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs not a beautiful looking game in its own right. The world looks like it‚Äôs been hand painted, and filters or motion-blurring is in perfect balance with the art-style. Adding NVIDIA Physx also added to the visual fidelity and blending of everything into a seemingly alive environment that grabs you, immerses you and does not let go.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDXtGujtbsQ\n\nNow, this isn‚Äôt as hard-core a game as the rest of the franchise, it‚Äôs difficult, and it does require a certain level of skill and awareness, but I can‚Äôt help but feel that it‚Äôs a bit more on the casual side. That doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs not fun and enjoyable though.\n\nIn conclusion, it‚Äôs a very entertaining game, you play as a character that was barely known but trained by the probably-most-known character in the entire series, which adds a little spice and keeps things fresh. Also, come on, who wouldn‚Äôt wanna kick enemies in the face with a hidden shoe-blade. She used it in the short-film, and she uses it now.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebjrZkCxHg","May 3, 2015","true","7.5"," 51 of 69 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","51","69","2","2"

This is obviously very different than the original series which uses 3D based worlds. Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China is part of the spin off series set in early china (Ming Dynasty ~1500's).\n\nJust like the original games, the story is based on parts of real history of the Ming Dynasty but different than the original game because it is also based on the past history of the previous Assassin's Creed games. You play as Shao Jun(main female protagonist) who had been taught by Ezio Auditore da Firenze(sound familiar?)\n\nBut of course the best part of this game and the whole reason you should get it is because of the concept of 2.5D stealth that his game implemented. It is a very innovative concept that really has not been used by many games and really should be used more.\n\nAnother great point in this game is the art style. It is very traditional as it models paintings from old Chinese empires and really brings out beautiful visuals.\n\nThe creators of this game also made Shao Jun into a very interesting character having started from nothing as a concubine to becoming one of the coolest assassin's in China. (who can deny that awesome looking red cape she wears?)\n\nNow the biggest problem in this game is the controls. I wouldn't be complaining about this if it was possible to change the controls in the settings, but that is not possible. The controls are not balanced between the right and left hands - the left hand has a lot more buttons to press than the right. And this is especially frustrating on the escaping sequences/levels that are in the game where you have to run(hold shift) while using the WASD keys to move around, as well as jumping(space) and ducking(left control) and killing guards as you do all this parkour (right/left mouse buttons). As you can tell, there is definitely some inbalances here in controls.\n\nOther than that, this game is amazing and beautifully done. The price for this game is a good price and is definitely worth it. And yes there definitely needs to be a full scale Assassin's creed game done in China.","January 30","true","10.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","19","22","4","0"

Also since you mostly have merely a single plane to vertically traverse, plus an impressively long jump, there is absolutely no reason to actually walk or run in this game. Why run if you can basically fly? The downside to this: Inability to take the gameplay seriously, even less serious than the game itself. And especially here on steam we all know: Gaming is serious, not just for fun.\nOther than the aspects above AC Chronicles is pretty adequate content-wise.\n\nEven though this title does not quite fit into the franchise (It can be considered an additional storyline, independent from the main series, comparable to Liberation), it does not at all, as it may seem on the first glance, ruin the franchise, like for example Unity did. lel  SICK BURN\nTalking about Unity..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/354380/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","A great game thus far.\n\nThe story is rather basic good rogue guys taking revenge on evil superior guys stuff being closest to the original AC and AC2 in this manner where Alta√Ør and Ezio had similarily "primal" reasons for acting.\n\nBut the settings are interesting and believable (well, as far as I can tell as a non-Chinese) and the gameplay is a lot of fun. You traverse lenghty, visually impressively and technically cleverly, diverse and constantly refreshingly designed levels in highly asymmetrical ways (directly or by climbing, covering the X, Y and Z axis and utilising various tools and dimensional movements like pressing yourself against pillars, hiding in specific spots or dashing between them). At their core the levels are linear but often offering multiple paths and approaches around obstacles and towards your goal. This is a 2.5D game that probably can't get closer to a 3D one. With this change it at first glance deviates greatly from the open world AC titles I've played previously, and yet it stays very faithful to some core recipes of the franchise and to the feelings that make them enjoyable.\n\nThe animations are fluid and great, as was to be expected. Even the stealth lovers should try to fight at one point or another to see Shao Jun's combat animations. Movement is fun, I think they projected the parcouring/freerunning very nicely into the 2.5D world (as best as I could imagine, at least). Stealth is rewarded, but not mandatory. Most levels can be "ghosted", being neither seen nor killing anyone (at least one level starts with permanent alert, rewarding you for getting through it as swiftly as possible instead). Primary and some secondary targets must be killed but they don't count into the rating you get after every small level portion and at the end of each map.\n\nCombat is more difficult compared to the main AC installments. Could you block most attacks in them by simply holding down one button you now need to time your blocking with the attacks of your enemies instead. This isn't too difficult, it's a mechanic I know from other brawlers, you can get used to it and there are indicators that usually tell you about immediate incoming attacks. But when there are two or more enemies engaging you from both sides - meeleing and/or shooting at you from afar and some possibly placed on elevated spots you can't climb right away without exposing yourself - you can get overwhelmed. Your weapon arsenal is heavily limited: Basically just your sword. There are throwing knives but I don't think I've ever actually killed someone with them, their numbers are strongly limited, they don't kill (alerted) guards in one hit and thus they are more useful to interact with certain level elements with. You are given a good deal of moves like parrying and performing roll-over/side-changing manouvers and your blocking ability has no cooldown, and if you play smart you can get your enemies into less pressing spots, but your health is fairly limited and sometimes the enemies take a few swings that aren't indicated as well. This is why it's sometimes a bit harder to brawl your way through than to stealth, actually, but at the same time it makes every kill more rewarding than how they would feel in the main AC games.\n\nNot just stealth but assassinations and direct combat is rated a bit too, giving you a "style bonus" if you stick to roughly the same course per level section it seems. Still, being a ghost who won't touch more than she has to appears to get you more bonuses.\n\nWhat can be irritating is that the A.I. of the enemies usually won't see past their own dimensional plane and that they are utterly unable to climb even the smallest gaps (which is intended maybe, not to overcomplicate the gameplay). What can make (some) sense for guards who are in passive mode (maybe they are very tired and their helmets block their peripheral view?) looks a bit silly when those on high alert turning around and around to desperately find you are basically just one or two meters standing away from you in plain sight only on a different dimensional plane thinking you had miraculously vanished into thin air.\n\nThere are some collectibles which give some incentive to pay attention to your map and to roam the levels a bit more. Animus shards and high level-end ratings unlock health or gear upgrades (carry more tool ammo) or shorten the time needed for specific actions. I am not the most genuinely interested one when it comes to such unlockables, but roaming the levels is fun and thus I like trying to obtain them as well. From what I've seen some collectibles require you to kill non-mandatory targets however ruining your otherwise clean stealth rating. This can be circumvented by simply getting yourself killed shortly after to reload the checkpoint just before (it seems you retain the collectibles then). Treasure chests contain short texts that tell what happened before the game starts and what lead to the plot that plays out, which I find to be the more interesting collectibles because they give you some historical context and are fairly interesting to read even if the plot itself isn't too complicated. There are the usual "animus database" entries too, giving brief info on some historical outlines, people, enemy types and locations.\n\nSome other reviewers complain a bit about the key voice actors having British accents apparently rather than to sound genuinely Chinese. I'm no expert there. The unnamed guards in the game speak Chinese. Shao Jun may not sound Chinese, but that doesn't make her voice acting bad per-se. It can break a bit of immersion for some players, but unless you are riding this badly or unless you are Chinese yourself you probably won't notice as much. I like to hear Shao Jun's voice actress even though she isn't giving massive amounts of lines.\n\nSomeone criticized the cutscenes are comic-like rather than being properly animated (as can be seen in the launch trailer). This is correct. But for a 10,00 EUR game I didn't expect groundbreaking CGI bombs. The comic-ishy scenes fit (they have the painting-ishy look/share the art style realized within the game engine) and they tell what needs to be told.\n\nWhat bugs me a bit: Ezio is there as seen as an old man in AC: Embers mentoring Shao Jun. But they gave him a different voice, one I find rather odd and not as striking as the one he had in his own games. So, perhaps it's for the better he only appears in Animus training sequences.\n\nAlso, Ubisoft needs to be more creative with the Templar motives. The first one you kill gives you the same uninspiring kind of speech they've all been telling you since the first game.\n\nSadly the game apparently isn't the most stable one. Mine sometimes crashes when loading checkpoints or in the middle of the game, but since my graphics card has been troubling me in some ways lately I do not necessarily blame the game. Numerous people in the game hub however seem to get a crash right when they start it, possibly related to NVIDIA cards in particular. There appears to be a player-discovered solution to that, but still. Some complain about the keyboard controls and little to no graphical options, but I don't have issues there because the game per default runs like a charm on my rig performance-wise and because I've been playing this with an Xbox controller right away.\n\nJust to be safe I recommend creating regular backups of your savegames, which can be found in the  Uplay folder, and to occassionally check if the files within are up-to-date with your latest ingame auto saving (not by alt-tabbing though because this may add to the instability some people have with this game). Maybe people should disconnect and reconnect with Uplay after each few hours or so too. I haven't had any save game losses thus far in this game but I was gravely branded by experiences of that kind in Child of Light and far more heavily in Black Flag.","April 25, 2015","true","9.8"," 38 of 67 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","38","67","4","1"

I will say though, the biggest problem is they didn't test it out enough to fix the controls to a point they work perfectly as I had repeated issues where crouching broke the game. I do find it a bit odd they put more emphasis on avoiding enemies completely rather than quietly killing them, but considering how the controls were at times, you never want to get into direct combat anyways...\n\nFavorite things definitely included:\n- dropping crates on enemies (wanted to do that more)\n- hidden blade in shoe (finally!)\n- use of noise rather than visuals: squeaky floors, noise makers, etc","April 26, 2015","true","12.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

At least I think it does. (Present-story ties notwithstanding). It proved to be a pretty good choice, becuase I was pleastly surprised by this side-scroller. It's probably the game where I felt most assassin-like. Although the moves become easy to remember, there is nothing like stringing a whole bunch of moves together that make you look like a true assassin. The story unfourtantely falters as it does not further the plot or provide insight on any story threads. It's a short game that took me about 4-5 hours to beat (although Steam for some reason clocks my playtime at 2 and a half hours). It's definetly worth a buy on sale and if you have the patience you'll reward yourself with what is likely the most stealthy Assassin's Creed yet.\n\nSome notes\nI played this on a i7, GTX 970, Windows 10 Computer\n\nI watched Assassin's Creed Embers before this, which at least helped me understand what exactly the character was after half the time.\n\nI did not bother with 100 percenting this game in the slightest, but I might do it in the future.","March 17","true","2.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Since you lost the 3rd dimension you can now move up and down multiple layers of two dimensional platforms. This is called a 2,5d view.

I had to do some way more often than I'am willing to admit and had to do some climbing over and over again for that.\n\nThe graphics gave me a little motion sickness in the beginning, but I got used to it.\n\nAll in all the game lacks in atmosphere in the beginning and the levels are a little bit too little story based and feel repetitive sometimes.\n\nCompletion time on normal in about 6 hours without any collectibles and most of the side quests.\n\n","May 22","true","6.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are almost always several paths to reach your goals and the game ramps up the difficulty pretty well by introducing new types of enemies and skills.  The controls are solid and towards the end you will need to be comfortable with them to get through the areas without being detected.  If you are a perfectionist you can restart a segment almost instantly and if you want to switch from stealth to fighting (you got detected for example) its very smooth.\n\nThe fighting mechanic is decent, includes timed counters and other Assassin‚Äôs Creed flourishes, except you will go down fast so it isn't brain dead easy like in the main games.  With stealth though you can easily avoid all fights, and most of the enemy types only affect combat- people with shields, etc who you can still one shot if you use stealth.\n\nThe voice work is rather bland and there are several "run towards the right while being chased" sequences that devolve into memorization.\n\nTechnically the game is a bit of a mess - changing resolution requires a restart and anti aliasing has to be set by editing an ini file.\n\nAlso the game has Leap of Faith into haystacks.","May 1, 2015","true","11.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","0"

That's really annoying by times, especially if you're the type that feels like you've failed and that you need to redo a stage if you weren't able to stealth through everything. It is what it is - you either enjoy stealth or you don't, and this is really no better or worse than a typical stealth game. Also, it's uplay,\n\nThe UI can't be turned off; the information widgits at the four corners of the screen are rarely relevant, but they can neither be turned off nor set to a contextual mode. The story is razor thin; the game gives very little reason to care about any the characters or events without greater knowledge of the Assassin's Creed series or thorough reading of the game's codex. The graphocs options are minimal; this looks to be designed for consoles first, with PC as an afterthought.\n\nDespite that, I had fun. When I was stealthing successfully, I was death incarnate, taking or sparing lives at my whim. The graphics are fantastic, beautifully designed to look hand-painted in a Chinese style. The score may be the best of any Assassin's Creed game yet, a wonderful blend of the familiar themes with a far east influenced style. Some of the levels are truly awesome; one level in particular is one of my favorite moments in video games this year, and after beating it I immediately retried the level so I could so I could do it again.\n\nI cautiously recommend the game.

However, in 1526, the Ming Dynasty was actually far from crumbling under the rule of her 13th emperor.  It was not until year 1586 when the 15th emperor of the Dynasty started his 30 years of absence from taking care of his empire, which was the beginning of the crumbling of the Ming Dynasty.\n\nIt is also saddening to notice the use of simplified Chinese on certain objects, for example on the flags. Simplified Chinese did not systematically exist until 19th century and it is truly a disaster for the game developer to over-look such crucial historical factor.\n\nThe settings of different stage and different sections of each stage does provide freshness with a variety of foreground objects and background sceneries. However, it is starting to get repetitive when you see the same skin of your enemies being reused. Even with various types of enemies, they are pretty much the same if you can perform a successful assassination.  The higher ranking enemies are just warning signs telling you not to engage them in the open.\n\nStory:\nUsing the background story of the fallen brotherhood, being destroyed by the Templars in China. You are set off to take revenge and to restore the former glory of your order. However, as good as it sounds, this is all your adventure is about. You are not given much details of what was going on during that time of the Ming Dynasty, the historical importance of your assassination targets and what is the main cause of your action in this part of history. All you are being told is to kill someone with a Chinese name and that he is a bad guy.\n\nGameplay:\nThe combat in this game is clumsy and very punishing. Once you are being spotted, you have a high chance of being desynchronized as the dodging and blocking key combinations are just too clumsy to handle in the heat of a fight. Not to mention, how fragile our Shao Jun is. However, the sneaking and assassination part of this game is still able to shine. Being able to try different ways to achieve a gold assassination ranking is still a satisfaction.\nUnfortunately, there is a lack of character customization and the AI of your opponents are yet again inheriting the illogical behavior from all previous Assassin‚Äôs Creed making you able to exploit with a set formula. It sometimes makes you wonder how these fools could outsmart the assassins in the first place.\n\nIn summary, Assassin‚Äôs Creed Chronicles: China is a game that is based on history, yet failed to tell the history that it was built on. The art style is a nice attempt to overcome the lack of fancy graphics yet the repetitive gameplay is not fluent enough to support the momentum to get player addicted to progress into the already unappealing and inaccurate story.\n\nPresentation: 6\nStory: 3\nGameplay: 6\nPrice vs Value: 5\nAverage: 5\n","April 22, 2015","false","4.7"," 45 of 86 people (52%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","52","45","86","6","1"

You've got a few interesting moves, but nothing you might not expect. It introduces the shoe blade, but honestly, it's just a different animation.\n\nUbisoft, if you're reading this, stop teasing us.

To help show what the game actually provides I‚Äôll give you some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-Rewarding Stealth gameplay as getting ‚ÄòShadow Gold‚Äô is not such an easy feat even on the easiest levels at times and with more points per level you unlock better rewards in that area that will help you later on in the game.\n\n-Areas demand some forethought and trial and error to get past as the AIs are, although predictable, competent enough to check down ladders and around the area (but can‚Äôt see into marked hidey holes the game provides) and Eagle Vision is very helpful to figure out how each enemy‚Äôs pathfinding works if you get unsure of what they will do.\n\n-Combat can be really fun once you get used to the controls as the ability to roll over enemies after counter and some fun sprint slide assassinations make more aggressive gameplay at least somewhat interesting.\n\n-Gadgets are interesting and useful for some amusing combos during stealth as the environment can be used a bit in certain areas to your advantage.\n\n-Controller support is present making the gameplay more feasible for people who love playing with their controllers.\n\n-The parkour system works fairly well except at times the controls can get a bit confusing but that can be remedied with time and gameplay.\n\n-This game runs perfectly fine on most rigs and computers that barely meet minimum settings may have fps issues at times but nothing too unmanageable.\n\nCons:\n-No way to alter controls (I play with the mouse in my left hand making precise actions difficult at times but a controller does help remedy that issue if you have one.)\n\n-Graphics are simplified to only V-sync, Full screen, and Resolution while the ability to alter anything else is unavailable.\n\n-Restarting at checkpoints that have cut scenes will force you to watch it over again which will happen frequently if you try to get Shadow Gold on all checkpoints.\n\n-Hit boxes are a bit touchy and sometimes the game doesn‚Äôt react fast enough to commands causing precise movements to sometimes miscalculate and cost you Shadow Gold especially on a long period without at checkpoint.\n\n-Dogs are a massive pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• if trying for Shadow Gold, they‚Äôre effectively unpassable blocking pickups if you‚Äôre attempting stealth. (One way you can actually get past them is to just collect the shard than restart, you‚Äôll be sent back but you‚Äôll keep shard.)\n\nThose are the main points I‚Äôve had to deal with a majority of my gameplay through the game. I can see how this game could be fun to people and for a relatively cheap price of 10 USD makes the game worth the try at least. Who knows, you might find this type of gameplay might be really fun for you or not.\n","April 21, 2015","true","2.6"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","50","13","26","7","0"

The Assassin/Templar aspect seems like an after thought. Both the keyboard & controller had awkward controls. Combat was difficult for me (like a block+roll is A+B and my thumbs are too small for all that so I can block all day but I ain't rolling no where). Checkpoints seem to be in the most awful places, so you have to deal with a big group of enemies all over again if you are just trying to figure out a tricky spot down the way a bit or want to backtrack for a secondary objective. There isn't enough ammo early on, so I find myself conserving but still end up running out b/c you can't always be sure how the guards will react, where they will look, etc. I know you can get more ammo later if you get enough points in the levels, but starting out a game should make you want to keep playing, and I just really, really don't.","June 27, 2015","false","3.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While I was slightly disappointed that they didn't make a typical AC game out of her story, I'm happy to see how this turned out. It focuses much more on stealth than any other AC games. It even gives you more points for not killing anyone (although I found this a little strange for a game titled ASSASSIN'S Creed). It's a satisfying 2.5d stealth game.

In this game you play that girl trying to free her people that were enprisoned and she will kill anyone that stops her.\nIf you liked the original assassin's creed you probally won't like this unless you are a fan of sidescrollers I didn't really like the game it was fun to play, But I just don't think it lives up to other great Assassin's creed games It does not really have what the others had which is why I warn yous to probally stay away from this game unless you like sidescrollers. Overall the game is pretty well done and I was looking forward to a continuation of Embers since I really enjoyed the animation.\nBut yea it is worth the price for only $11 and it will last you a pretty good time. So if you were interested in buying it, buy it don't let anyones review tell you what to buy cause sometimes like in 1, 2 and 3's case it could just be someone that is new to them and played blackflag and syndicate first and never experienced the old ones till now.\n\nIf you see anyone saying how this game doesn't fit in with the "series" is cause it doesn't it is in the new 3 part series called Chronicles so Please never say that T-T\n\n--Would just like to add I actually have 5 hours on this game I played through Uplay directly--\nLink to embers film : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npaG_au4ov4","January 8","true","0.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Know why? Because it's short, to the point, and actually encourages you to use stealth like an assassin is supposed to. I love the level design and how it gives a 3D like feel at some parts, where you can hop in and out of different planes of the environment. I love the hiding spots akin to Mark of the Ninja, the parkour parts, and the art style.\n\nThe combat is a little wonky, as heading face to face with an enemy is awkward and stiff. I'm used to AC combat being smooth and cinematic and it didn't have to be cinematic in this, but I wish it still ran a bit smoother than it is in this game. I guess it's a way to force you to only use stealth as in the bigger budget AC games you can dive into combat and easily take out 1000 guys no problem. Just hold guard and hit counter. HERE though the timing to block an attack is just...‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• poor awful. You really are better off using stealth kills.\n\nI commend this game more than any other AC simply due to it's simplicity. I couldn't wrap my head around how vast they TRIED to make the higher budget AC games. The stories seemed to drag instead of take me along with them. Although the plot in this game is simple, I believe that less is more. There isn't too much going on, there's no future person you get to see hooked into the animus and so the game has more focus on the actual time period.\n\nAm I weird or what? Little 2D game > high budget, high res 3D sandbox games? I think one thing that kills AC for me is the amount of sidequests you get that don't offer much to the experience. I've always wanted an AC game that had more focus on a linear and main story arc such as AC Chronicles: China.\n\nI would like to see more games like this with the 2.5D environment and smooth parkour elements and stealth. If they tightened up the combat, the voice acting, and in-level side missions for the next game, it would be perfect for me.","December 28, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's beautiful. The voices are so far really well done, and the game play is pretty fun. It's not like your typical assassins creed, but there are still a few ways through each encounter, and enough hidden items to keep you explorig. I'll update if necessary as I play more.\nI highly recommend if you like stealth games, weather or not you have played any assassins creed before.\n\nThis is the type of setting I wish the main series would go to. . . much more interesting than rehashing the same but slightly differend settings.\n\nSo far the main negative is that you need to play this through Uplay. I wish any game I purchase through Steam would not require other game engines. I found Uplay to be the main thing crashing my AC Unity install for four months.","April 22, 2015","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

AI is clever enough to look up and down from time to time, detect moving brush. (i know its programed but u cant see all of these feature in any previous AC dont you? of course u can ignore all the stealth stuff and go hack and slash ur way through the guard (good luck with C+D and C+A anyway) but u will recieve less reward which is a good way to keep people stay stealthy.\n- well as for repetitive, cant we say 'styx master of shadow', 'shadow of modor' is a AC ripoff? these game is a 'stealth' game it's their genre !their category they share some similar trait!\n\nThis game is a true 'stealth' game AC franchise needed. i hope the new AC will follow these feature. i heard AC syndicate already feature. multiple approach assassination like AC1 already.","September 2, 2015","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't recommend buying it, but not because it's "this" episode specificly, more because of it's core gameplay engine that is not going to change in the other two either.\nMy expectation was a sidescroller, sometimes 3D stealth based linear game, and having played many great games in this genre I can say Chronicles is a medicore-at-best entry with a selling franchise name burnt on it.\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly slow, restrictive and forces your hand to play on predetermined paths and methods. Most of these type of games do the same, but they either do it way more seemlessly or in a much more engaging satisfying way. Perfect example would be Mark of the Ninja, which achieved both and gave some freedom of creativity with the different types of ninja suits allowing different tricks. Here however, your playthrough is set in cement, every centimenter of your movement in the blank level design just constantly makes this thought linger: "the devs want me to hide there. The devs want me to jump over that". Obviously, since it's linear, but the sluggish (definitly feels it was made for handheld consoles), constantly autocorrecting slow glue controls and movement paired up with the incredibly dull level design just pushes this to my face constantly because there is nothing else worth to pay attention to. Almost all of the game is with constant emply, blank rocks and (cave-)walls as a background, which is where 2D sidescroller games usually excel at but Chronicles definitly is the worst at. There are some beautiful ones aswell, but... you know, they had to have something attractive in the trailers. And those are all you'll see (or even less, because one of them isn't even in the game).\n\nStealth mechanism is dull. Not only compared to Mark of the Ninja, but compared to This War of Mine aswell. Basicly it's "guard shows his back, you are invisible". Noise, shadows, enviromental cover, nothing you can play with. But you can! Liar! You may say. Pay attention to the wording - PLAY WITH. When I have to go through a 50 meter long tunnel with one or two patrolling guards and there is an absolutely GIGANTIC black hole on the wall that from a kilometer away you can tell "yes, the devs want me to hide there and this is the only way to go through", that's not PLAYING. That's something that makes me feel like I'm treated like an idiot. And that's EXACTLY where Chronicles goes wrong in every minute and every second of it, because these types of stealth games shine when they achieve the feeling of "almost comfortable" challange through smart gameplay in creative enviroments. Chronicles... almost writes on the screen for me to "go there, pull that, go there, shoot that, go there, hide there AND ONLY THERE because there is nowhere else to hide - we placed it there only for you so you can pass this part, and go through... and win! Congratulations you are an epic skillful master assassin! I feel like this game is treating me like it's a logic test for babies where they must push the triangle object to the box through the triangle hole, the ball through the circle hole etc, with the smiling devs constantly watching over not to ever possibly harm myself, offering a lollypop for success. Except the lollypop here is "for the brotherhood! For revenge! I'm a shadowy cool assassin now! Because I'm told, not because I feel like one".\n\nThis, is not what I'm looking for in Assassin's Creed.\nThis, is not what I'm looking for in any stealth game.","January 14","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/exofreeze/recommended/354380/","exofreeze","eXoFreeze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/exofreeze/","1243 products in account","I'm a sucker for AC, and I often find myself playing the games and aiming for 100% completion despite their flaws.\n\nI was interested when I first heard about this smaller digital games. As a child I remember the magic of playing Prince of Persia with it's precision timing, jumps, and sword fighting. I figured if the game could simply live up to the standard sset by that 30 year old game, then what could go wrong.\n\nAnd that is the problem with the game. It technically doesn't do anything wrong.... but it doesn't really do anything right either. So I'm having a difficult time deciding whether or not I can reommned the game.\n\nI'll start with comparisons to Prince of Persia (I'm talking the old DOS game here, not the PS2/Xbox era game). While AC Chronicles China is not as unforgiving as PoP, it is also not as accurate. Similar to it's 3D big brothers, your assasin has a bad habit of going in directions you didn't intend. This can lead to countless "restart checkpoints" if you are aiming for higher scores. The running, jumping, sliding, and other movment mechanics are pretty good. My favorite levels often invovled skill runs through a collapsing environment. On the othe rhand, the combat sections are simply not fun, and I think the developers knew that, which is why you are punished very heavily score-wise for getting invovled in sword combat. Considering charatcer upgrades are tied to your level scores, this means you are heavily pushed towards silently moving through levels unseen. And if you have to kill, don't be seen while doing it.\n\nWhich leads me to wonder why the bothered with so many combat mechanics. Blocking, countering, rolling over enemines, light attacks, heavy attacks, are all mechanics that, if you play as the game encourgaes you to, will never actually be used. It reminded me of the older splinter cell games that gave you 20 gadgets to kill a man, and then penalized you for killing.\n\nThe story itself is fairly shallow. Precursor artifact? check. Crumbling assasin brotherhood? check. Gang of evil templars in a convient order of importance? check. Assassin that doesn't listen to their master and causes trouble? check. This is all familar territory. and it really only serves to set up the flimsiest of reasons as to why we are killing all these guys.\n\nAs this is the first game in a 3 part series, it is hard to tell at this point how much lore the series will ultimately add to the AC universe. At this point it very well could be a throwaway story, or the precursor artiofact mentioned might end up being something rather important.\n\nThat is honestly where the developers should be focused at this point. The AC universe is dense and can be somewhat convoluted. There are fans who understand everything about the lore and many more who know there are artifacts and ancioents, but aren't really clear on what their deal is.  Smaller games like this are the perfect opportunity to flesh these things out. Define the artifacts. Define the background stories of people who have met or heard about.\n\nSo far, these games don't feel like they are going that route. Rather they had a list of lcoations from a brain storm meeting on where the next big AC game should be, and someone took the scraps that got lef ton the table and decided to make this series based on them.\n\nUltimately, the gameplay is serviceable and I had moments where I felt pretty badass. Sliding from hiding spot to hiding spot with only split seconds to spare is pretty awesome. That is until you go to jump into the next spot and your assassin instead decides to jump on a guards head and then just stare at him while every enemy in the area lights you up.  If the game had a better story, then based on the gameplay as it stands, I would have gone ahead and given a thumbs up. Unfortunately the game could literally have been called anything, because other than name dropping Ezio and mentions of the artifact, there is nothing else Assassin's Creed about the game.  And for that reason, I can't recommend it. There are better action platformers out there. And there are enough other AC games that have more variety, better gameplay, and more substance that are worth your time and money.","January 14","false","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

YES YOU READ ME, TO COUNTER A ATTACK YOU HAVE TO HOLD D+C FOR A ENEMY ON YOUR RIGHT AND A+C FOR A ENEMY ON YOUR LEFT!!!\n\nWooden shield guys are ok not difficult you have to use a heavy attack 3 times or 2 on their shield to break it and once you finish the game you can get a upgrade to only need to hit it once.\n\nvanguards are stupid too but not brokenly hard like masters.\n\nand...the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing HEAVY CROSSBOWMEN...If you get hit ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing once actually you can dodge the first bolt, and then you will get hit 5 times by the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•er and you will be dead. Again like the handcannon guys if your seen then your COMPLETLY ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ED!!!\n\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND THE GAME WITH THE STATE THAT IT'S IN!  THEY BETTER MAKE THE NEXT ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING CHRONICLES GAME HAVE REMAPING AND NOT THE BROKEN ENEMIES!!!\n\n*Sigh* *inhale exhale* Now...that doesn't mean I hate it, I do enjoy some of the missions, they're ok but it's the last mission and a couple others where they ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you over. This makes speed running nearly impossible you have to be picture perfect and now the patrols and map and everything.  And it adds some need to be sneaky which is ok.  If you want to buy it I'm ok with that, just know that the controls will make things impossible and some "memories" will be cheatingly difficult. But if you think this is a game where you have to fight straight head on combat then your going to die a lot. You actually have to be sneaky and stealthy to WIN.\n\nI commend this game a 4/10.","April 27, 2015","false","11.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

Die Story ist zu vergleichen mit Assassins Creed 2 nur um einige Universen schlechter, dass ist aber auch nicht beabsichtigt. Nach knapp f√ºnf Stunden war ich mit dem Spiel durch, die Steuerung fand ich jetzt nicht soooo geil, aber das ist auch nur eine subjektive Meinung. Das Spiel ansicht macht meiner Meinung recht wenig Spa√ü und das hat nichts damit zu tun, dass es nicht wie Unity oder die anderen Teile ist. Es kommt einfach kein "feeling" r√ºber. Das Spiel ist richtig gut designed und sieht auch wirklich genial aus... aber mich hat das Spiel irgendwie sogar gelangweilt, weswegen ich es auch schnell durch haben wollte.\nEs ist quasi... t√∂te den.. dann den und dann den.. am Ende noch den... und das Spiel ist durch. Das Spiel erz√§hlt einem nicht wirklich etwas. Ich wei√ü jetzt nicht, ob das von den Entwicklern beabsichtigt ist oder meine Erwartungen einfach "zu hoch" waren... aber am Ende gab es auch kein Gef√ºhl, wo ich sagen k√∂nnte "es hat sich gelohnt!". Man kann es sich kaufen, wenn man hin und wieder spielen m√∂chte oder wie ich ein Fan der Reihe ist... aber sonst lohnt sich das nicht.

There's something about the AC series that translated really well to 2.5D. I'd long since abandoned the franchise (way back when they released 5001 add-ons to Ezio's story) and this was a welcome re-entry for me.\nRunning through the beautifully-designed and vibrant levels honestly makes me smile. The bright red blood spatters when Shao drives her 'Toe-blade' into a Templar's skull is a really satisfying feeling. It's quite the treasure of a game, and for the price of ¬£7.99 (or your regional equivalent) it is well worth your time and money.\n\nTo view my full review, visit my site.[tundragaming.wordpress.com]","April 22, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

They tried something new here, and to me I find it to be awful. I played a couple hours of Mark of the Ninja and it takes its inspiration heavily from that game.\nFirst of the controls are the worst controls I've seen in a while, If I want to block a sword attack I expect to push (B) not hold forward and hit B and then you end up countering with a kick half the time doing minimum damage when I would like to get a sword swing in, but She is so slow at attacking its a joke. You get like 1 or 2 shots and you die, there is little to no room for error.\n\nSecondly the story is lackluster, this game looks like a sh(indie) game from the cut-scenes to terrible story writing. I do not care for her vengeance on the Tiger tribe (Templars I guess) what so ever. The environment and alternate pathways are a little interesting and fun to parkour around, but the gloomy overtones and poor textures lead to an unfulfilling experience.\n\nI respect them for trying something new, but they really need to stick to their rich story telling, flawless voice acting and beautiful atmosphere. If I didn't know this was Assassin Creed or an Ubisoft title I would be like what a terrible indie game. Assassin Creed fans can pass this one for sure, If you like Mark of the Ninja then maybe you can give it a go but to me it is about a 2 out of 10.

A result of this is that combat feels clunky and overall unpleasant.

So, for the actual review:\n\nVisuals:\nOne thing that really stood out for me in this game is the visuals. It looks like an animated Chinese painting, you can see some details really looks like it was hand painted, and some even crudely drawn, but it adds more artistic style to it, I think. The atmosphere of the game reminds me of Child of Light(which I also love), where it's like you're in an interactive storybook so this automatically rose up in my rank of favorite games.\n\nGameplay:\nNever have I seen two guards who are so into their conversation they never notice anything else, like, say, an assassin creeping up behind them, climbing up the wall, up the ceiling, or hell, even dashing from column to column. Not that I don't like that, I just find it hilarious. As for fighting, I really love it when Shao Jun uses the hidden blade in her shoe to finish off an enemy. Also, the fact that avoiding killing and drawing unwanted attention plays a big part in this game is somewhat fresh for me. If you do kill a guard, better hide the body fast or all hell will break loose.\n\nOthers:\nMusic:\nWill there be an OST release? Because I definitely want one. The main theme is pretty much a variation of "Ezio's Family" from AC2, but mixed with traditional instruments. I stayed idle for a while during a certain sequence because the music was really nice. If you like traditional/ethnic type of music, then you're gonna love this.\n\nI'd be really happy if this game becomes like the other AC games, or something like Liberation or Freedom Cry. I think it'd be cool to see Shao Jun in full 3D action.","May 5, 2015","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because the game looked worth playing, what I did was treat using the hardwired WASD keys for movement, C for action, etc. as something of a puzzle-within-the-puzzle game -- and it worked. Once I got the keys down, the game was actually a lot of fun. Stealthy, a generous checkpoint system, responsive, great-looking.

But then there are plenty of PC games here on Steam that advise, and even require, this e.g. Dark Souls. I don't see people complaining about that franchise's need for something other than a keyboard and mouse.\nSecondly, yes you do need a Uplay account. This is annoying, I know, but they do have some good games in their library. If you're looking to play Chronicles China then chances are you're already an Assassin's Creed fan and gamer, and so you already have a Uplay account, so why complain?\n\nPros\n-Wonderful water-brushed art style that immerses you in 16th century China\n-All the traditional elements from the AC series: eagle vision, syncing view points, leaps of faith into conveniently placed hay carts, assassination and distraction gadgets, lots of wall climbing, etc.\n-Good, fun, and challenging gameplay that gives you the option to complete a level in a variey of different ways (remain invisible, execute stealthy assassinations, or charge in with your sword drawn) thereby giving good replay value.\n-Great looking, and good feeling assassinations. Instead of having the traditional blades under her wrists, Shao Jun has blades on the tips of her boots. This combined with her martial arts skills makes for some very satisfying  face kick stealth kills.\n-Combat has always been a problem with the AC games, but this one has the best melee combat by far, in my opinion. It's simple yet fun and effective in producing fun gameplay, although I wouldn't want to play the whole game as a hack and slash affair. My only gripe with the combat system is that Shao Jun's throwing knives are massively underpowered, used only for interacting with the environment. So the enemy can engage in ranged combat but you can't - not really. With a skilled martial artist assassin, like Shao Jun, it should be a case of 'one throw, one kill'.\n-The best stealth AC game in the series. You really need to formulate good strategies using the envirnoment, your skills, the enemy type, and your tools, and plan your timing if you want to succeed at being an assassin and especially as a 'shadow' - remaining unseen by guards and not killing any of them.\n-Nice upgrades to unlock, and it's satisfying when you do get to use them.\n-Excellent speed run levels where you have to race against the clock to escape from the level. These are good fun and help to provide some nice variety to the game.\n\nCons\n-They could have made a few more levels, especially the speed run ones.\n-Controls can be a little unresponsive. I've had to press the controller buttons several times before Shao Jun picks up a dead body or rope climbs to a ceiling. On several occasions this delay has caused me to be detected and then I've had to restart the checkpoint to make sure I get the perfect 'gold' achivement. But then this wouldn't be an Assassin's Creed game without control issues, now would it?\n-AI issues on rare occasions. One time a guard was looking down off a ledge and somehow he managed to see me up above him - wtf? Then another time a guard managed to detect me through a wall at a distance. I checked and double checked and there definitely was a wall between us. Rather buggy!  But hey, this wouldn't be an Assassin's Creed game without bugs, now would it?\n-The voice acting could have been a little more passionate espeically considering that the story is supposed to be emotionally charged with a lust for revenge. Moreover, considering it's set in 16th Century China, all the Chinese characters have surprisingly good English accents!\n\nAll in all, I'd give it an 8/10. It would be a 9/10 if they fixed the minor AI and control issues, and I would happily have paid twice the asking amount for this great gaming experience. I'm now coming to the end of my third playthrough and I'll then be starting a fourth - mixing up all of the different playstyles and routes through the maps. I really can't wait for them to release the next two upcoming games in the series, and I hope they make a "regular" AC game out of Shao Jun's story. I'd love to run around historical China.","October 28, 2015","true","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As it has been stated over and over again this game plays a lot like a mark of the ninja, a game I have personally loved and 100% in the past and in its story it involves ezio auditore's times, which mark the best games in the main series in my opinion. So far nothing that may interest newcomers to any of the two franchises, but that probably make this game earn extra kudos to those who do.\n\nGraphically, I believe everybody has to agree that the game looks gorgeous, the setting almost does it a favour and the visuals in cutscenes are beautiful. Not so much the models, which look worse and are repeated throughout the enemies of the entire game, but you are going to be looking at them from a distance anyway, so unless you want to get nittpicky, it shouldn't really be much of a problem. Animation does the job and it is really fluid, so nothing to complain about in that respect.\nThe music and sound are astounding, just like a major studio like Ubisoft should offer and has done so, at least in the past, here the setting helps again and the atmosphere is set from the get go with great music and sfx.\n\nNow to what I dislike about the game...\nSo, you are not going to be watching pretty cutscenes and listening to music the whole time, what you will be doing is using a controller to control a somewhat intuitive level design, which by the way sometimes likes hiding things from you with the 'annoying camera syndrome that won't let you find collectibles we only hide from you in a lazy manner' or you will be hoping you haven't played up your time to refund this game because you don't own a controller. Yes, the keyboard controls are BAD, so bad that i can't recommend this to anyone who doesn't own an Xbox controller unless they hate themselves to the point of playing dance games via hitting the dance mat with their heads.\nIt's not use even trying to use keyboard because by the time you get used to the controls, the game will have ended, and this is my second grape with the game. The game is not too long, and if you are not planning on finishing it while getting the achievements or the collectibles, you can finish the whole game in a longer-than-average sitting. I know this might be the cause of this game being as cheap as it is, but I think that at least some replay value, which is pretty much non-existant wouldn't go amiss.\nAnother thing regarding the gameplay and killing the replayability of the title is the fact that, inevitably, this game is compared to Mark of The Ninja, a game I stated before I love, and this is really unfavourable to this title. The levels are sometimes linear, there are considerably less items to use to distract the guards and there is nothing like the masks in Mark of the Ninja that complete overhaul the gameplay and the decisions you take. On the other hand, if you were spotted in Mark of the Ninja, you would just sit down and swallow bullets, as you wouldn't get any good amount of points that way whereas in this game you can fight your enemies in a system unique to this game. It's not as simple as other titles and you must be in control of enemies both in front of you and behind you, because they hit hard and you can take less hits than a piece of biscuit.\nFourth and last, the Uplay thing... yes... I know someday Ubisoft will get the fact that noone likes their service, but until then we get to eat sh*t and download Uplay.\n\nOverall, the experience i had with the game was good, and even though it got tedious and frustrating near the end trying to collect all shards, controlling Shao felt great (after i got hold of a controller) and the whole product is of good quality. For the price I would recommend this game if you either have already played Mark of the Ninja and want something simmilar but with more of an action gameplay or if you like the AC vibe and want something fresher and cheaper than the rather duller 3D games.","August 29, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead 2D platformer, this game SHOULD be a full Assassin Creed game. Therefore, I suggest you think twice before purchasing this game because there are better Assassin Creed than this (Rogue anyone). I have to make choices then my decision is no. I better skip the game for other Assassin Creed game.\n\nPros\n\n+ The game have a unique design. I heard that the design are inspired from China drawing style. When you play the game, it feels like you are hearing or reading a story book.\n\n+ A very challenging game. You will be thinking a lot when you play this game, and also expect to die a lot.\n\nCon\n\n- The freedom of movement is a double edge sword. There are times when you actually got confused with so many choices, actions or path that you can make. This is a 2D platformer, it should be simple and straightforward. If the developers wants to create a complex game, they should do what I advise on the first paragraph.","May 16, 2015","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, for the actual review:\n\nVisuals:\nOne thing that really stood out for me in this game is the visuals. It looks like an animated Chinese painting, you can see some details really looks like it was hand painted, and some even crudely drawn, but it adds more artistic style to it, I think. The atmosphere of the game reminds me of Child of Light(which I also love), where it's like you're in an interactive storybook so this automatically rose up in my rank of favorite games.\n\nGameplay:\nNever have I seen two guards who are so into their conversation they never notice anything else, like, say, an assassin creeping up behind them, climbing up the wall, up the ceiling, or hell, even dashing from column to column. Not that I don't like that, I just find it hilarious. As for fighting, I really love it when Shao Jun uses the hidden blade in her shoe to finish off an enemy. Also, the fact that avoiding killing and drawing unwanted attention plays a big part in this game is somewhat fresh for me. If you do kill a guard, better hide the body fast or all hell will break loose.\n\nOthers:\nMusic:\nWill there be an OST release? Because I definitely want one. The main theme is pretty much a variation of "Ezio's Family" from AC2, but mixed with traditional instruments. I stayed idle for a while during a certain sequence because the music was really nice. If you like traditional/ethnic type of music, then you're gonna love this.\n\nI'd be really happy if this game becomes like the other AC games, or something like Liberation or Freedom Cry. I think it'd be cool to see Shao Jun in full 3D action.","May 5, 2015","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since Mark of the Ninja doesn't seem to be coming out with another (or at least anytime soon), this fills a nice stealth void and for a great price!  Its fairly simple, so runs well unlike AC-Unity and some others, still have to deal with Uplay tho!\n\nAlso, the controls can be very stiff so it can be a VERY ANNOYING at times not being able do things quick and smoothly when it requires precision in limited time. Some things they could of done without too, like the races while things are on fire, if you can get caught up on ledges and have to repeat it many times for silly reasons after instant death. Some I had to just repeat dozens of times until you get lucky once or something is not fun, but annoying as the old days, but frequent checkpoints are good!  The rest of the game is pretty good.\n\nFor $10, I rate it 8.5/10.\n\nUpdate: Recently got AC Russia-India for uplay at $5 each on sale. Russia has some unique aspects like the wrench to bypass grates and sniper rifle to change it up a bit more than just visual settings. It can be difficult and frustrating at times, but is a nice 2-D steath experience.","April 22, 2015","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By the way, I`m using a steam machine with a xb360 game controller. I have never had any controller issues with any other games before, but in this game, the most terrible thing should be the button's dislocation, and I found that there was not even have a controller patch on Uplay, which made me feel very difficult to make an appropriate action when I was playing this game.\n\nSecondly, about the story, there only have a few dialogues with pictures, otherwise, nothing.  I was wandering, are they really serious about to write this story?\n\nAt last, the style of this game is simulated Chinese painting.

Once I got the keys down, the game was actually a lot of fun. Stealthy, a generous checkpoint system, responsive, great-looking.

Weird thing is it's 2.5d (not really 3d, but not quite 2d either). A few frustrations about this game: As with most auto-save games, sometimes the game will save too far in between, so if you die, you have to do everything all over again.  Also, the moves are too fancy. As a result, when we play, we have to remember and execute those buttons. The enemy can also discover you in the time that you're doing those fancy moves. It's best to stay hidden in this game, because combat is a very difficult thing with all the buttons and commands, if you get discovered. Yet another con to the game: the points scoring. When games score by the amount of stealth that you use, you have to do things exactly as the game would want, or you get docked a lot of points.","May 7, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I better skip the game for other Assassin Creed game.\n\nPros\n\n+ The game have a unique design. I heard that the design are inspired from China drawing style.

As a Chinese, I feel pleasure that the story of assassins comes to China finally, although it‚Äôs not a traditional Assassin‚Äôs Creed game. However, after I played it I still can‚Äôt recommend this game. Designers intended to create an eastern assassin‚Äôs experience through this game. Some factors are good such as graphic effect and parts of the level design. But other disadvantages lower the quality of the game, including repetitive level pace, terrible key controls, and so on. I will try to evaluate and give some suggestions about the aesthetics and mechanics. By the way, there may be expressive problems because I am still learning my English :).\n\nAesthetics\nThe Chinese watercolor style art really impressed me, which is beautiful and working well toward the Chinese theme. But the static cut scenes are half-hearted, lots of them are similar except the name of enemy on the subtitles is changed. It‚Äôs a kind of bonus for players who have passed a level with difficulty, and also an expectation to pass next level (as the players will expect to see the next cut scene if it‚Äôs wonderful). Every time I saw the same static animation I just wanted to skip.\n\nIn the matter of sound effects, the details of audio are pretty good, as all kinds of concealed weapons and hints of danger are presented well. But the voice actors seem to be impassionate, as their voices make you sleepy. The dialogues switch between Chinese and English, which really takes away from the immersion. I think using the same language, especially Chinese, will be a better choice. The dialogues between the guards are boring because of the repetition. Actually it‚Äôs a good point to show the world view of the game through their dialogues. In my view, if guards talk more about anecdotes about the eunuchs, that will be more interesting.\n\nMechanics\nControl System: The inconvenient keyboard control is a disaster for this action game. It made my left hand cramped, and I never got good judgments in the parkour level (I got almost all the Shadow:Gold[1] in normal level). Too many buttons are controlled by my left hand, but my right hand is free at most of the time. To a certain extent, more key controls mean more actions players can take (such as in this game players can jump, hide, slide and use gadgets, etc). Moreover, more actions mean possible to create different choices and experiences in the game. For example, in some levels of this game, I can dash between the hiding places to pass the guards, or just confuse them by gadgets. I can get the Shadow:Gold in these two different ways, and the different choices have become a kind of enjoyment in this game. These different options are built on the actions players can take. But it‚Äôs a pity that they gave us a bad default control system, and never try to optimize it or let us to rebuild it.\n\nIn my opinion, the controls can be optimized in two aspects. The first one is to simplify the key controls. For instance, now we ready gadgets by key ‚ÄòF‚Äô and active them by ‚ÄòG‚Äô, but why not use ‚ÄòF‚Äô only? While the ‚ÄòF‚Äô key is down, it means ready, and up means cancel. When we want to active gadgets we can press the left mouse button, it‚Äôs a more natural and convenient way as we take aim through moving the mouse. Secondly, I suggest we can just abandon the mouse in this game, so that we are able to balance the keyboard controls by both hands, such as attacking by ‚ÄòJ‚Äô and ‚ÄòK‚Äô, crouching by ‚ÄòN‚Äô(this area is control by right hand). Further, there‚Äôs no problem to take aim by the direction keys, known as ‚ÄòWASD‚Äô.\n\nLevels: The design of some levels is pretty clever, especially the space design. In certain houses, we can stay inside the houses, or hand on ledges, or hang on the roof. It seems that we are in 3D space but it‚Äôs a side-scroll game. But the pace of levels is too repetitive, as it‚Äôs always hiding and running. In fact the game developers had tried to explore the games storyline deeper by using collectable scrolls, however this wasn‚Äôt effective since most stories were uninteresting. Although some escape levels were added, the exciting play experience was reduced by the unreasonable key controls. What‚Äôs worse, the fighting with boss, which should be the most exciting part of a game, was designed wearily. All the players need to do is to approach the boss and kill him, without any Kung Fu fighting or animation. In conclusion, the levels are boring.\n\nHelix: In this game we can active a special Helix state‚Äîwhich allows dashing between hiding places invisibly. Besides, it‚Äôs impossible to active this skill outside hiding places. This can be achieved through collecting Helix fragments to fill the Helix bar. In the difficult levels in latter part of the game, this skill offers us the opportunity to rest and change the pace, and pass a hard checkpoint smoothly. In my personal experience, it‚Äôs embarrassing to keep the bar full for a long time when there are no continuous hiding places in the level. I think it will be better if we retain the existing Helix state, but adding more features on it. For example, we can active Helix at any places, and assassinate guards won‚Äôt affect the judgment of current checkpoint [2]. That will increase the chances to use this skill and adjust the levels‚Äô pace, which makes Helix more valuable.\n\nTo sum up, the Assassin‚Äôs Creed Chronicles China is unsatisfactory because of the impassionate voice, the bad control system, repetitive levels and imperfect special skill, etc. Personally, I hope that the legend of assassins will be staged in China again, but next time we should not only be surprised at ‚ÄúWOW! The leading role is a pretty girl!‚Äù","August 4, 2015","false","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was fascinate about the china theme, and i really want to play this game after a long day of work i enjoy a good night playing. I tryed to play it this morning to see if i can open the game but still, i can't connect to uplay or at least make new account if the problem was my old uplay account(didn't work) i hope i can do a positive review... but how i can do it if i can't even play it!?\n\nOk, i finally played this game after 20 hours, the game is not bad, the controls are stiff, for the animation of the character, whenever she starts to walk or run, she needs to start with animation and so, the controls is like a little slow. this same problem hapens when she turns(while movingo or not) and the jump animation is always the same, high speed, doesn't have a dinamic jump. is very strange for a platform game. But the truth is not a totally platform, is more like a puzzle game, but still mess with my mind. IS NOT DINAMIC, IS MORE LIKE A MECHANIC PLATFORM.\n\nI play with xbox one controller, the character moves with the joystick, is a little odd for me because i always played platform with the dpad. You can't remap the buttons, so yeah... but the modern game is normal to move the character with the joystick i supose.\n\nAnyway, the game is entertaining, for 10 euros is not a bad deal, runs well, but i think they can put more effort in the graphics, and history, this could be much greater.\n\nI run in a:\nwindows 7 64bit\ni7-2600 3.4gh\nGTX760 4GB RAM\n16GB RAM\n\nI do not recomend only for the uplay platform, the game is entertaining.","November 4, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But then there are plenty of PC games here on Steam that advise, and even require, this e.g. Dark Souls. I don't see people complaining about that franchise's need for something other than a keyboard and mouse.\nSecondly, yes you do need a Uplay account. This is annoying, I know, but they do have some good games in their library. If you're looking to play Chronicles China then chances are you're already an Assassin's Creed fan and gamer, and so you already have a Uplay account, so why complain?\n\nPros\n-Wonderful water-brushed art style that immerses you in 16th century China\n-All the traditional elements from the AC series: eagle vision, syncing view points, leaps of faith into conveniently placed hay carts, assassination and distraction gadgets, lots of wall climbing, etc.\n-Good, fun, and challenging gameplay that gives you the option to complete a level in a variey of different ways (remain invisible, execute stealthy assassinations, or charge in with your sword drawn) thereby giving good replay value.\n-Great looking, and good feeling assassinations. Instead of having the traditional blades under her wrists, Shao Jun has blades on the tips of her boots. This combined with her martial arts skills makes for some very satisfying  face kick stealth kills.\n-Combat has always been a problem with the AC games, but this one has the best melee combat by far, in my opinion. It's simple yet fun and effective in producing fun gameplay, although I wouldn't want to play the whole game as a hack and slash affair. My only gripe with the combat system is that Shao Jun's throwing knives are massively underpowered, used only for interacting with the environment. So the enemy can engage in ranged combat but you can't - not really. With a skilled martial artist assassin, like Shao Jun, it should be a case of 'one throw, one kill'.\n-The best stealth AC game in the series. You really need to formulate good strategies using the envirnoment, your skills, the enemy type, and your tools, and plan your timing if you want to succeed at being an assassin and especially as a 'shadow' - remaining unseen by guards and not killing any of them.\n-Nice upgrades to unlock, and it's satisfying when you do get to use them.\n-Excellent speed run levels where you have to race against the clock to escape from the level. These are good fun and help to provide some nice variety to the game.\n\nCons\n-They could have made a few more levels, especially the speed run ones.\n-Controls can be a little unresponsive. I've had to press the controller buttons several times before Shao Jun picks up a dead body or rope climbs to a ceiling. On several occasions this delay has caused me to be detected and then I've had to restart the checkpoint to make sure I get the perfect 'gold' achivement. But then this wouldn't be an Assassin's Creed game without control issues, now would it?\n-AI issues on rare occasions. One time a guard was looking down off a ledge and somehow he managed to see me up above him - wtf? Then another time a guard managed to detect me through a wall at a distance. I checked and double checked and there definitely was a wall between us. Rather buggy!  But hey, this wouldn't be an Assassin's Creed game without bugs, now would it?\n-The voice acting could have been a little more passionate espeically considering that the story is supposed to be emotionally charged with a lust for revenge. Moreover, considering it's set in 16th Century China, all the Chinese characters have surprisingly good English accents!\n\nAll in all, I'd give it an 8/10. It would be a 9/10 if they fixed the minor AI and control issues, and I would happily have paid twice the asking amount for this great gaming experience. I'm now coming to the end of my third playthrough and I'll then be starting a fourth - mixing up all of the different playstyles and routes through the maps. I really can't wait for them to release the next two upcoming games in the series, and I hope they make a "regular" AC game out of Shao Jun's story. I'd love to run around historical China.","October 28, 2015","true","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a Chinese, I feel pleasure that the story of assassins comes to China finally, although it‚Äôs not a traditional Assassin‚Äôs Creed game. However, after I played it I still can‚Äôt recommend this game. Designers intended to create an eastern assassin‚Äôs experience through this game. Some factors are good such as graphic effect and parts of the level design. But other disadvantages lower the quality of the game, including repetitive level pace, terrible key controls, and so on. I will try to evaluate and give some suggestions about the aesthetics and mechanics. By the way, there may be expressive problems because I am still learning my English :).\n\nAesthetics\nThe Chinese watercolor style art really impressed me, which is beautiful and working well toward the Chinese theme. But the static cut scenes are half-hearted, lots of them are similar except the name of enemy on the subtitles is changed. It‚Äôs a kind of bonus for players who have passed a level with difficulty, and also an expectation to pass next level (as the players will expect to see the next cut scene if it‚Äôs wonderful). Every time I saw the same static animation I just wanted to skip.\n\nIn the matter of sound effects, the details of audio are pretty good, as all kinds of concealed weapons and hints of danger are presented well. But the voice actors seem to be impassionate, as their voices make you sleepy. The dialogues switch between Chinese and English, which really takes away from the immersion. I think using the same language, especially Chinese, will be a better choice. The dialogues between the guards are boring because of the repetition. Actually it‚Äôs a good point to show the world view of the game through their dialogues. In my view, if guards talk more about anecdotes about the eunuchs, that will be more interesting.\n\nMechanics\nControl System: The inconvenient keyboard control is a disaster for this action game. It made my left hand cramped, and I never got good judgments in the parkour level (I got almost all the Shadow:Gold[1] in normal level). Too many buttons are controlled by my left hand, but my right hand is free at most of the time. To a certain extent, more key controls mean more actions players can take (such as in this game players can jump, hide, slide and use gadgets, etc). Moreover, more actions mean possible to create different choices and experiences in the game. For example, in some levels of this game, I can dash between the hiding places to pass the guards, or just confuse them by gadgets. I can get the Shadow:Gold in these two different ways, and the different choices have become a kind of enjoyment in this game. These different options are built on the actions players can take. But it‚Äôs a pity that they gave us a bad default control system, and never try to optimize it or let us to rebuild it.\n\nIn my opinion, the controls can be optimized in two aspects. The first one is to simplify the key controls. For instance, now we ready gadgets by key ‚ÄòF‚Äô and active them by ‚ÄòG‚Äô, but why not use ‚ÄòF‚Äô only? While the ‚ÄòF‚Äô key is down, it means ready, and up means cancel. When we want to active gadgets we can press the left mouse button, it‚Äôs a more natural and convenient way as we take aim through moving the mouse. Secondly, I suggest we can just abandon the mouse in this game, so that we are able to balance the keyboard controls by both hands, such as attacking by ‚ÄòJ‚Äô and ‚ÄòK‚Äô, crouching by ‚ÄòN‚Äô(this area is control by right hand). Further, there‚Äôs no problem to take aim by the direction keys, known as ‚ÄòWASD‚Äô.\n\nLevels: The design of some levels is pretty clever, especially the space design. In certain houses, we can stay inside the houses, or hand on ledges, or hang on the roof. It seems that we are in 3D space but it‚Äôs a side-scroll game. But the pace of levels is too repetitive, as it‚Äôs always hiding and running. In fact the game developers had tried to explore the games storyline deeper by using collectable scrolls, however this wasn‚Äôt effective since most stories were uninteresting. Although some escape levels were added, the exciting play experience was reduced by the unreasonable key controls. What‚Äôs worse, the fighting with boss, which should be the most exciting part of a game, was designed wearily. All the players need to do is to approach the boss and kill him, without any Kung Fu fighting or animation. In conclusion, the levels are boring.\n\nHelix: In this game we can active a special Helix state‚Äîwhich allows dashing between hiding places invisibly. Besides, it‚Äôs impossible to active this skill outside hiding places. This can be achieved through collecting Helix fragments to fill the Helix bar. In the difficult levels in latter part of the game, this skill offers us the opportunity to rest and change the pace, and pass a hard checkpoint smoothly. In my personal experience, it‚Äôs embarrassing to keep the bar full for a long time when there are no continuous hiding places in the level. I think it will be better if we retain the existing Helix state, but adding more features on it. For example, we can active Helix at any places, and assassinate guards won‚Äôt affect the judgment of current checkpoint [2]. That will increase the chances to use this skill and adjust the levels‚Äô pace, which makes Helix more valuable.\n\nTo sum up, the Assassin‚Äôs Creed Chronicles China is unsatisfactory because of the impassionate voice, the bad control system, repetitive levels and imperfect special skill, etc. Personally, I hope that the legend of assassins will be staged in China again, but next time we should not only be surprised at ‚ÄúWOW! The leading role is a pretty girl!‚Äù","August 4, 2015","false","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was fascinate about the china theme, and i really want to play this game after a long day of work i enjoy a good night playing. I tryed to play it this morning to see if i can open the game but still, i can't connect to uplay or at least make new account if the problem was my old uplay account(didn't work) i hope i can do a positive review... but how i can do it if i can't even play it!?\n\nOk, i finally played this game after 20 hours, the game is not bad, the controls are stiff, for the animation of the character, whenever she starts to walk or run, she needs to start with animation and so, the controls is like a little slow. this same problem hapens when she turns(while movingo or not) and the jump animation is always the same, high speed, doesn't have a dinamic jump. is very strange for a platform game. But the truth is not a totally platform, is more like a puzzle game, but still mess with my mind. IS NOT DINAMIC, IS MORE LIKE A MECHANIC PLATFORM.\n\nI play with xbox one controller, the character moves with the joystick, is a little odd for me because i always played platform with the dpad. You can't remap the buttons, so yeah... but the modern game is normal to move the character with the joystick i supose.\n\nAnyway, the game is entertaining, for 10 euros is not a bad deal, runs well, but i think they can put more effort in the graphics, and history, this could be much greater.\n\nI run in a:\nwindows 7 64bit\ni7-2600 3.4gh\nGTX760 4GB RAM\n16GB RAM\n\nI do not recomend only for the uplay platform, the game is entertaining.","November 4, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By the way, I`m using a steam machine with a xb360 game controller. I have never had any controller issues with any other games before, but in this game, the most terrible thing should be the button's dislocation, and I found that there was not even have a controller patch on Uplay, which made me feel very difficult to make an appropriate action when I was playing this game.\n\nSecondly, about the story, there only have a few dialogues with pictures, otherwise, nothing.  I was wandering, are they really serious about to write this story?\n\nAt last, the style of this game is simulated Chinese painting.

Mechanics be used well. It ain't expensive. Terrible controls if you're using a keyboard.\n\nStill good though. Haven't played much of it, but what i have played, I enjoyed. But hopefully you never have to fight anyone, because the controls for stealth/exploration and the controls for combat are almost separate. If they wanted to get   a 100% rating from me, they would simply add the ability to change controls. It really isn't that hard considering how much they did do. Overall... I'd give this game an 80/100. Good, solid platformer stealth game. But seriously them controls... *shiver*","May 20, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The way the games want us primarily to stealth rather than kill (means that only kill the selected targets) is a nice way to ask people to get 100% (complete secondary objective) completed for each sequences.

It stands alone as a modest but entertaining platform game. The game is quite short, but that is what you should expect from an installment such as this, or else it would become too boring. The length is also adequate for you to be eager to play a story in a new location, such as Russia or India. The visuals are beautifully drawn, with excellent watercolor cutscenes that will keep you hooked up for a few hours.","April 3","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is like if the sword fighting in Monkey Island was more fully realized, and instead of talking and object puzzles, it's all about hiding puzzles. Really, the game does play more like a Monkey Island action puzzle game than your standard issue side-scroller beat 'em up. This AssCreed is sort of like Trine with sneaking. Sometimes the stealth aspect gets overplayed to the point where it doesn't feel like a stealth game anymore, it just feels like a mashup of side-scroller elements that has you on a forced track and always requires sneaking. The game lacks that openness of games like Deus Ex or Dishonored that, while they may strongly encourage you not to "storm the front," they still let you, adding meaning and thrill to doing things stealthily.\n\nGphx:  6/10\n\nSound: 7/10\n\nGameplay: 6/10\n\nOriginality: 7/10\n\nFun Factor: 5/10\n\nReplayability: 5/10\n\nA good game to get on sale.","April 24","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
