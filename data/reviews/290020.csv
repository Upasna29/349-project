However you do need knowledge in computer logic.   Though you can learn the basics of NAND, OR and AND logics.   It is steep learning curve to combine so be prepared for frustration getting things right.   If you put the time effort in its rewarding to see your bot achieve the goals.   Its also tricky in the build as it can be little tricky to align the wheels I found even with the help.","September 22, 2014","true","26.1"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","36","38","0","0"

I myself found myself very confused throughout the hour I played and only managed to do the first mission in career mode but the tutorials are very well explained.\n\nI give the game an 8/10 for being challenging, confusing but well thought out, it doesn't have the best graphics but it's not meant to, it's meant to deliver a realistic (in a sense) robot building experience and I think it delivers so far.\n\nYouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcn71xCoIM8","September 24, 2014","true","1.4"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

Not because this game is better than every other game I have played, but because I feel like there needs to be more people playing this so that it can really go far.\n\nThis game (if you can call it that, more on that later) might be in Early Access, but it is one of the most complete games I've played in early access. I have only ran into one bug that happened twice in my first 10 hours of game play. That bug being that it crashed when starting the simulation. Otherwise everything works as expected.\n\nThe reason I would maybe not consider calling this a game is because it’s not designed to be some easy pickup and play. It’s a robot simulator, well maybe not even that. It’s a circuit simulator that happens to have robots.\n\nIf you don’t understand Boolean operators, AND, OR, NOT, or XOR then this game might not be for you. This really did take me back to basic circuit building.\n\nThere is only a sandbox piece to the circuit building. To use the robots you have to play through all the levels and unlock the components. Another downside is there is almost no community around this game as of this writing, so if you get stuck on a level your SOL. At least for now, I really hope that changes and we see a bigger community.\n\nGo play it! Have fun building and then re-building.","September 28, 2014","true","13.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Hope an improvement later will let us compare our data for each level with other players!\n\nAnd according to developer, there will be in a futur a level editor which should give an infinite duration to this game.\n\n","October 3, 2014","true","2.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

In a way its a successor to the old gem "Mind Rover", where one built bots to do various tasks in a similar manner.\n\nTh basic premsie is, using boolean logic gates, sensors, motors and various widgets, to accomplish a series of puzzles with robots. The graphics are simple but serviceable, but the audience for the this game is probably not gonna be swayed by the graphics much anyway.\n\nIts a fantastic teaching game for those new to propositional logic, and great for all the tinkerers out there. My only complaint, and rumor has it its being worked on, is the interface is a bit clunky. But, for an early access game its remarkably polished, Ive only run into one minor bug so far where it got confused after I deleted a sensor.\n\nAnyways, its a great game and logic/teaching toy and I can't wait to see more come out of it.\n\n","October 5, 2014","true","7.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Do It Yourself hobbies are on the rise and climbing faster everyday. Leading the charge is the world of electronics. I myself am a relatively new inductie. About 8 months ago, while plugging in my phone charger at work, staring at the powerstrip under my desk it occurred to me that I don't know very much about electronics. I consider myself a learned guy, college grad with a degree in philosophy and a view that an education carries far more worth than it's potential monetary value down the line. And I LOVE all things science so to not know much about something so pervasive as electronics didn't sit well at all.\n\nTwo weeks later, two dozen books later with 1000's of various components bought online and I was well on my way to learning everything I could. The end result, cutting a long story short is that I just finished my first semester back in college working towards a second degree, a B.S. in Nanoelectronics and all this stemming from my plugging in my charger. I mention all this because this game has been exactly the kind of game I've been dreaming/searching for ever since then. I just finished taking DC Circuits, C++ programming and well Chemistry tho that's less applicable here, but after 4 intensive months, I still managed to learn something new within the first two tutorials. But what's more is that it's really damn fun.\n\nI, and I'm sure I'm not a lone, have my fair share of guilt whenever I spend more than a reasonable amount of time, (however we each define it), playing games when I should be learning something, anything. So to have a game that not only challenges/works out our critical thinking, problem solving, analytical reasoning skills, introduces concepts found in electronics, engineering, physics, and programming and is a really fun puzzle game to boot is a win win...win.\n\nI especially enjoy the set up to each challenge. "Here's the course, the problem, challenge, puzzle or what have you, now go make a robot that can maneuver the challenge". And you're off building, testing, rebuilding then putting together circuit boards utilizing  boolean based logic gates and the like,  having fun all the while. This is the kind of game we should support.\n\nLet's be honest, for many of us, gaming is an escape from the world beyond our monitors. And there's nothign wrong with that (in moderation). I admit that's why I game. But we all have to return to the larger world sooner or later so why not taking something away from our time spend in escape? That's my two cents anyhow","December 22, 2014","true","21.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

This is a sandbox simulation where you get to build autonomous robots to multiply and do your bidding. The core gameplay is a huge set of 'levels', each with several potential goals. You review your objective(s), then with a set budget and assortment of bot-bits and coloured wires you set-out to custom-build a bot-to-order. The construction requires both the physical conformation as well as a circuitboard with the logic-gates that define how your bot's inputs manipulate it's outputs. Once you think you've got the right mix of form and function, you press a button and the simulation takes over: your assembled bot is thrown into the level and left to it's own devices.\n\nEach level's 'sub-quests' will futher challenge your imagination as you work to improve your bot and are forced to dream of more efficient and clever ways to achieve your goals. If you want to play socially, it's fairly easy to export/import your bots to share with friends - the game generates a PNG thumbnail and XML text file that makes it a snap.\n\nAlthough this game is still in 'beta' it has kept me challenged and engaged for hours on end. While there is a steep learning curve for a person like me, the challenge doesn't become stale. I've always been a fan of sandbox games, so I'm sure I'm a bit biased, but this game has huge potential. The developer is active in the Steam Community forums (Fall 2014) and very responsive to feedback.\n\nUndoubtedly worth the current $20 buy-in if you enjoy games that challenge your mind.

I enjoy these type of games, and this one has potential but with one major turnoff in its current state, the same turnoff that made Bad Rats a bad game... you can run the exact same robot with making zero changes what so ever and get three entirely different results. It seems the calculations are tied to the frame rate, but when VSync enabled still bounces the frame rate between 60-61 (200+ with Vsync disabled) that 1 FPS bouncing back and forth at different times ends up making the same robot without being modified at all do different things each time.\n\nIf they can get the Bad Rats issue out of this game I would fully recommend it, but when a game about making minor tweaks to fix issues can not even keep the same results when running the same thing over and over it makes it more of a game of luck then of actually making the perfect tweaks.\n\nIt has potential, it is fun even with that issue, but I just can not recommend it fully until that gets sorted out.","October 25, 2015","false","3.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
