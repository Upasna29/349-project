There isn't a story and even though the music fits the game, it's the same few scores over and over. Amazing Adventures: The Lost Tomb is for those looking for a challenging hidden object experience. They really cram a ton of items into each scene and many are well hidden. I guess they don't call it hidden object game for nothing. :p  So the game is basically just many many HO scenes with puzzles inbetween each one. Jigsaw, Memory Tiles, and Spot the Differences. The game gives you 20 "missions" and each one is an ever increasing number of said HOs and puzzles. At the end of a mission, you'll get a fact about Egypt and part of a manuscript. I'm assuming you assemble the manuscript at the end of the game. I haven't got there yet. I still have 10 missions to go and I have a feeling it's going to take awhile. One thing about The Lost Tomb that I REALLY like is the bonus you get if you find a scarab in each of the 21 HO scenes. You'll then be able to play each scene and find EVERY item. (When you find an item on the list, a new one will pop into its place). There is a huge satisfaction in completely clearing a scene. I wish other HO games had this feature. So in closing, only buy this if you're up for a challenge, don't mind the lack of a story, and can deal with some repetition. It's a good game for HO fans who need a break between other things. :)","September 11, 2015","true","12.1"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","25","25","0","0"

This game pretty much is NIGHTMARE difficulty, most games have a way of knowing the shape of the object your looking for, not here.  You will need a masters vocabulary to even know some of the words used to describe objects, other objects like some games are described such as "wall Walking" which means a foot print.  The game is 20 missions long, but each mission is 6-7 puzzles with a total of 21 areas.  I stopped at about 11, since they just recycle the areas.  I play this on mute as the sounds and music if you can call a 3 second loop music suck.  There is a GREAT bonus if you find the hidden scarab at every location that unlocks the map and you go to each area and find EVERY item a few at a time, very fun I wish more puzzle games had that mode.  NO new player to hidden object gaming should buy this, they will just end up frustrated and rightfully so its uber super majoryly difficult.\n\nPeople new to hidden object games:  Rating:  0/0  Value:  $0.00\nVeterans of hidden object games:   Rating:  10/10  Value: 9.99","October 25, 2013","true","8.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

Its a simple game that involve you looking past everything and just look for the little details of the pictures you are seeing. You have to find items in the picture that are listed on a list at the bottom of the picture. This game deals with ancient Egypt and finding stuff in lost tombs. Its a fun game to burn some time with and can get addicting to play and want to find everything in the pictures.","March 28, 2011","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's random objects cluttered on a still background image, and they ask you to find 10 of the items by clicking on them.\nThe items stay the same place in every map/location but everytime you replay it they ask you for different things.\nYou're given a 12-15 minute time limit on each run, randomly clicking 4+ times gives you a point/score penalty.\nYou get a score multiplyer by clicking the objects you're looking for sequentially, so taking the time to observe multiple targets rather than clicking on everyone you find is key if you want more points.\nAlthough you can pause the game which doesn't block the image so you can continue search for the items without worrying about the timer.\nThere's a Hint button as well, which points out a general location where an item you haven't found is, which costs $4,000, while every item you find (on it's own) gives you $2,000 so you don't loose too much.\nSometimes a hint is really needed when the item it asks for like 33 RPM really means a vynyl recond, like 33, okay but why the RPM that confused me? As well and other items they vaguely put up that has mutiple meanings for.\n\nThere's also different puzzle solving than the I-Spy kind, like a match game, a Spot-The-Difference game, and a puzzle piece game which adds to a good change.\n\nThere's a golden scarab per stage and if you find all 21, then beat the game, you can replay any mission without having a time limit.\nBut beating the game requires you to play the SAME damn maps at least 10 times over, which gets really repetitive... so I ended up quitting after spending the amount of time I did on it and only getting 8/20 "stages" done although I played around 35 "levels".\n\nI would highly reccomend this game if you love the I-Spy books, and it's great for when you're bored and have nothing else to do!\n\n8/10","January 9, 2015","true","5.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

These are quite horrible Popcap games. There's a few i actually really enjoy, but this series of HOG games is nowhere near. It has even more annoying music, just so bad that i can't listen to it. It's all so similar between the different HOG games they have and just so repetitive you grow to hate it. I turn all the audio settings off and use my own music to try and make the game a little more bearable. The gameplay is just as repetitive, just this time around it's a different 5 scenes, that you play over and over again.\nThe actual game, to finish it, is even longer than the first one, which i thought the first one was bad enough. Which makes this one impossible to finish. I just couldn't get through it all, it's too darn boring. I gave up, deleted the local content and had done with it. Which is saying alot for me, i usually have to complete games before i move on. Not even my OCD tendencies wanted to put up with this one.\nDon't buy these. Out of all the hidden object games i have, because i actually love the game genre, these are by far the worse. I only brought the second one after playing the first one, because i usually want to buy all of the series if there is one (that's those tendencies at play). But this is a series of games i wish i didn't bother with. Especially because popcap games never go on sale, so you have to pay full price for this. If you could get them in a bundle for dirt cheap, i'm sure i wouldn't be as hard on it.","April 16, 2013","false","7.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Hidden Object Game Number 7 I played through.\n\nFlavor of story of this game: You're looking for a lost tomb in Egypt. That's where you'll be all of the game long. 21 locations, 20 Missions split into different levels, endless hidden object level after finding all scarabs (one for every location).\n\nThat's it. Nothing more to the game.\n\nI'm done. I need... I need something mindlessly funny.

This is set in Ancient Egypt and the search for a rare artifact. The objects are all very well drawn and easy to see. Quite a compelling game and one that's fun to play even more than once. You can play the main quest and after you've finished it and collected two special objects per screen, you can then play a 'find all objects' mode where you empty the screen of every object. Very well implemented and a nice game to go back to when you want to just chill out and find objects.","April 16, 2015","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a lot of levels, but they reuse the same 20 locations.\nSo, if that's what you want this is the thing for you.\nAs a UK gamer, some of the names of the objects were unfamiliar american descriptions, but you soon get into the swing of it.","February 20, 2015","true","33.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How about those "Spot the Difference" games in the comics section of a Sunday paper? How about a "Jigsaw Puzzle", one of the oldest toys created? This game is pretty much all of those things put together. I personally only played this game while listening to podcasts, which worked out really well, but I couldn't tell you how it stands on it's own. All of those things I mentioned aren't exactly well known for being the pinnacle of entertainment, but they are good time wasters.
