You're cruising through the level until you reach the first triple spike. After the first few fails you feel that you now got the jump mastered. You're now 100 attempts into the level. You're determined to beat this level even if it kills you. Finally, after 1,000 tries, you make it over that final triple spike and you beat the level. It feels like you have just won an olympic gold medal and the millions are chanting your name. You feel as if you can conquer everything in the world now. You then proceed to play one of the level's from the level packs. Then it suddenly hit's you: the level you just completed isn't ♥♥♥♥ compared to these other levels. You then rage quit and cry yourself to sleep only to spend more hours and have thousands of attemps just to be dissappointed that you will probably never beat these levels.\n\n11/10 would jump over spikes and on blocks again.","May 8, 2014","true","8.2"," 363 of 401 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","363","401","3","6"

We get to do regular daily activities, we have 3 meals a day (All cooked on site, full courses) and we do get to spend time with other patients should we be having a good day. My room itself is fairly plain; 4 walls, 1 window, a bed, a sink with 2 taps; and recently I've even been allowed a few photos on my wall and a carpet!\n\nA normal day consists of going to the mess hall for breakfast at 8am sharp. Well that's the case for my group, anyway, as not everyone is allowed to eat at the exact same time. The doctors say it's because it could be unsafe having that many patients in a room together. After breakfast we have classes for certain activities. My favourite is art because it allows me to express both my personalities, and expel my rage without causing damage to another human. I like to draw pictures with orange squares, black squares and blue triangles, because I see them in my dreams. My group has lunch at 1.30pm. After we have lunch we are taken to the medical wing where we undergo evaluation physically and mentally to assess our progress. Sometimes, depending on how we've done, we have to go for more rigorous tests, otherwise we just move onto the next part of our day. After our evaluations we're allowed to go out into the yard in small groups to have some fresh air. We can play sports with the assigned trainer for that day, or just relax in the sun. When we've finished in the yard it's time for dinner, at 6pm. We tend to have dinner in bigger groups because there are more staff to help out at that time. Anyway, after dinner we do group reading, in which we have to talk about the books. My group leader says it's to help with communication with others. It's nice, I really like it. Finally, at 8 o'clock pm, we're allowed to pick a book and take it back to our room so we can read if we wish to at night. It helps a lot of the patients keep calm when the lights go out.\n\nTreatment here is really nice, although sometimes if we start to show increasing signs of instability or anger, the doctors and nurses can and will use a straight jacket or sedation depending on the situation at hand. I haven't had this happen to me a lot, only when I have the bad dreams of the orange and black squares and the blue triangles.\n\nOccasionally my family come to visit, to see how I am. I like seeing my family, although I miss my brother. My last memory of him was sitting at my computer playing a video game, I think it had the word 'Impossible' in the title, but I can't really remember. It's all blurry. My family normally come once a month and sometimes they just seem upset to see me, but my personal nurse assures me that it's just me worrying too much.\n\nI really like it here, although I can't remember much from the real world anymore. My nurse says that I will have to stay here for possibly another decade, but I'm okay with that because everything in here seems normal to me now. All I can really remember from my old life is playing video games, but ever since I got admitted I suddenly didn't miss playing them. I'm not sure if there's a connection there. I don't think so.\n\nOverall that is my life in a nut-shell now. It's not a glamorous life, but it's quaint and quiet and it's my life, what it is and what it is going to be for the next decade or so.","May 8, 2014","true","4.5"," 375 of 429 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","375","429","7","13"

Game is played to the beat making it a lot easier though (still incredibly hard). With 5 levels and an all new level editor. The game should keep you addicted for a while. Practice Mode is also there for those who can't win (allows you to place checkpoints anywhere but with the downside being the music replaces with some slow song). Fun game that I reccomend for fans of super hard 2D platformers (Super Meat Boy, Electronic Super Joy). The games soundtrack should also be familiar to any Newgrounds users. Considering all the music is from the greatest songs list on Newgrounds. Really simple yet hard game. Got it for 3 bucks on Humble and it was worth every penny.

This game is the evil brother of Thomas.\n\nThis game is just ... impossible to win without hours of practice and tuning your mind into a state that allows utmost concentration and remembering all the jumps and holes.\n\nThe graphics are simple, the music is best and the gameplay is more than challenging. You are a square that moves from left to right and you have to avoid colliding with the obstacles. You jump over triangles and jump on or over other squares. For 1-2 minutes and then the game is over. If you get so far that is. I don't have the patience and time to finish this, so I took the easy route by placing checkpoint flags that let you start from your specific point in the run. Even then it takes some time to finish a level.\n\nAll in all it is a nice game to have fun with for a while, until you had enough and go for some easy achievements. Or go for gold.

Why? It's because this game is not as impossible as the one on the iPad. When I was playing on the iPad, it shows a hard challenge, and that you must be precise where you jump, and is more fast-paced. But in the Steam version, they make the game easier. For example, in the Original Level, there's this part with 2 pathes, one leads to death, and the other continues. They removed that path, which disappoints me. The jumping in the game also seems to be higher, making it easy to jump through triple spikes, but also easy to over jump a block (which doesn't matter as much). Also, in Level 3, Heaven, they make the spacing between triple spikes bigger, making it way much easier get near the end. And because of this change, I also noticed how that the jumping is higher, as I thought the game was rigged. Made easier, I would say that the Steam version of The Impossible Game should be made cheaper. A decent $3 could make it alright, and the level editor is not much, since you have to include your own music. But in the end, it's your choice of buying The Impossible Game, not mines, but I would not recommend it at this price and at this difficulty.","June 3, 2014","false","3.1"," 31 of 53 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","31","53","0","1"

Also amazing is how well designed the four levels are, every jump feels like it requires precise timing and the music syncs up to them fairly well. And even if somehow you manage to complete all of the levels, there's still the infinite amount of custom levels created by the community ready to be downloaded. The level editor is a little tricky to work with, and syncing music to your track is easier said than done. Plus, the only way to test your level with the music playing in the background is from the very begining. Because of this, if you have one specific part you want to test to see how well it plays with the music, you have to play through the entire god-damn level to figure it out. I would suggest a "Test from this point" button of some sort added in. Other than this though devs, you have yourself a great port!\n\nALSO ♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ING GAME AND IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T IT ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS MASSIVE ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ I HATE THIS GAME JESUS HENRY CHRIST IT'S SO HARD GOD.","June 25, 2014","true","4.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

An orange square has to complete a sequence of jumps over spikes and abysses in a quite high velocity. Unfortunately the square is not controllable in the air. That means wrong started sequences lead to dead in the end. And all your progress is lost. Tho you must play every level with starting/continue flags, but then also the complete level without using any flags. The jump sequences are quite risky and each mistake kills. There are also mean mechanics where you must jump downstairs on blocks without a chance to estimate how much millisecs or millimeters you will loose on each jump. That would not be such a problem if the rendering was so laggy and the controls were instead superprecise. But that isn't the case.

(Not very common).\n\nAnd with not much more to say about the game because it's just so simple i must conclude with my verdict.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe Verdict for my review on The Impossible Game is a solid 6/10.\nDo i recommend this game? Yes but only to Platform Gamers or people who like a Challenge.\n\nWith it's good Soundtrack & generally simple & somewhat fun gameplay it does make for a good game to get just for something different & challenging, it's not exactly a game for everybody especially if you're not a platform gamer you won't like this but i do recommend picking it up for it's cheap price & interesting gameplay and if not for that then at least for it's Soundtrack.\n\nThe PC version of this game doesn't feature anything over the top brilliant over it's Console or Phone version but it does have a much larger Field of View so you can easily see what is coming next before it reaches you unlike in the Console & Mobile versions. So if you've got a large enough screen i'd recommend this version over the others.","May 11, 2014","true","3.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/251630/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","Probably my favourite game in the list of hyper-difficult platformers on Steam, The Impossible Game uses a simplistic art style with equally simple mechanics which work well together to create an enjoyable, addictive and challenging game, it also holds the "excellent soundtrack" trophy like many others of the same genre. The PC version also comes with a level editor which is a really nice addition and gives the game some more playability.\n\nThe objective is simple, jump, clear and doge oncoming obstacles and reach the end of the levels without dying. Sounds easy enough, but the short time window which you have to make your decision on whether or when to jump or not makes things incredibly difficult, though sometimes equally frustating.\nThe ability that you a trialed on the most is your reaction speed, a split second or blinking at the wrong moment is enough to cost you your progress in some cases. Honestly, this can sometimes feel unfair and gets annoying after so many attempts, but that's pretty much the name of the game, it's clear enough what you're getting into when you play something titled "The Impossible Game".\n\nIn some cases, but not frequently, the object you are controlling sometimes bugs out causing you to die and go back to the beginning for something that wasn't your fault, such as accidentally jumping twice. ignoring your jump command altogether or interacting with the obstacles the wrong way. This is the only thing about this game that I dislike, like which has been stated in many other reveiws. There is nothing more annoying than losing progress for something that isn't because of your own faults.\n\nSo with the occasional bugs aside, this is definitely a game to add to your collection if you are a fan of difficult platformers, it is definitely up there with Geometry, Super Meat Boy, Electronic Super Joy, Bit Trip Runer etc, it also has one of the best soundtracks around, so if this goes on sale, don't miss it.","March 16, 2015","true","18.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

You are a square and you try to avoid any obstacle in your way, if you touch anything you are not supposed to, you die and get back to the start of the level.\n\nThe game itself ist that hard as the name states, you have a set pattern of objects, since you cant stop, you are probably die the first couple of times you go trough them, but after you memorize them, its pretty straight forward.\n\nIt does have however, artificial difficulty, very noticeable when switching from auto jumps to manual jumps. The game adds some obstacles where you only have half of a square to land and some (a lot of) times it does a slide to your death instead of jumping. i can differenciate when i ♥♥♥♥ up and when the controls didnt responded.\n\nIt has some neat music that set you in the mood.\n\nI guess its allright, i can recommend it since its fun and cheap but by no means its more fun or harder than super hexagon.","May 11, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It constantly treats you like crap and laughs in your face as you fail over and over again. But for some reason, something deep inside you makes you keep playing this simple, bare-bones platformer over and over again.\n\nHere's a video of the game if you want to see just how impossible this is. If you would rather read, then just continue below.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/iaEb4gAWnxY\n\nSo what is this game about? You play as a hot-blooded cube determined to propel itself forever to the right, and it will stop at nothing until it reaches the end. Spikes, walls, and pratfalls are you're only enemies. But they are a mighty force to be reckoned with. Timing is the key factor to avoid instant death, and the only thing your hard-boiled cube can do is jump. But damn is that jumping satisfying. Everything relies on your split-second reflexes, and when you do make it, it feels good. Real good.\n\nBut let's talk about more of the game's features. On the top of the screen is a counter that will surely go up for ever time you die. But don't fret, your cube is swiftly reborn, better, stronger, and wiser than the last. Well, just as long as you don't make stupid mistakes. And everytime you retry, you will slowly inch your way closer to the end goal of beating the impossible game.\n\nThere is a total of 5 levels you can play, each one with challenging mechanics like flipping the screen or falling blocks. There is also a level editor you can use to make more impossible levels if you ever do the unthinkable and beat the game. But for simple cubes like myself, there is a system of putting down flags that restart you from where you set them down, which allows steady progression towards the end instead of having to begin all over again. Sure it might be called "practice" or "weenie" mode, but it's still difficult enough just reaching the end one jump at a time.\n\nIf I had to list some negatives, the one thing I could say is that you can get this game for cheaper on your phone or ipad, since it originated from there. The basic controls make it quite apparent. However, $4 on steam and $3 on the humble bundle is not asking for a lot. Even $5 when it goes off sale. So if price is an issue, just wait for this to go on discount in the near future like always.\n\nSo to sum everything up, I say this game is well worth the money spent. It's mindless fun, and you can even have a beer or eat a hot pocket while you play this game. And what a beautiful thing that is.","May 8, 2014","true","2.1"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

Defenetely not impossible. More like "The Very Hard Though Totally Fair And Extremely Frustrating Platformer-Type Game" or TVHTTFAEFPTG for short. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Scratch that part. I guess they couldn't fit that name on the title screen.\n\nThe game itself has responsive controls and music good enough to make it into my music library. The graphics aren't anything to brag about. There is an anoying blur on everything not fixed on the screen. It can make your eyes hurt after playing for a longer period of time. And when you die while in the air, there is a bit of flickering when you respawn. Also, my friend LeBretarm had some problems with the fullscreen option. But these are minor issues.\nThe levels are about 1 minute 30 seconds long which can be a long time if you're new to the game. But once you get the patterns down you will quickly start feeling the joy of completing an insanely hard level like it was nothing.\n\nOverall i think this game is defenetely worth a purchase. It gave me more entertainment than some of the $10+ games on steam.","September 16, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The levels take a long time to beat. I've spent 15 hours (as of this review) on the game and have only beaten 3 - 5 levels. The obstacles for each level are unique, for example: tracks building in front of you as you play and jumping on platforms upside down while dodging spikes. You can also create levels with your own music.\n\nThe game's music can get quite repetitive and the practice mode's music is even worse. I have witnessed a couple minor bugs (especially on the last level) which make you jump higher than you're supposed to. Other than that I have no complaints.\n\nIn all, only get this game if you are patient.

This game will crash every once in a while so dont expect it not to.

Proves that overly simplistic games can still have insanely engaging difficulty. 11/10 soundtrack (paragonX9 is my main man).\n\nMy only complaint is that the PC port seems to be a 're-hashed' version of the mobile port. There are numerous bugs such as the game freezing or every object in the game disappearing happening pretty often when I play, and I'd hate if I was almost to the finish line and it froze on me. Progress stats doesn't seem to work either, except declaring that you have beaten the level. This may be a personal perspective, but triple spikes seem to have gotten significantly easier to jump by.\n\nNonetheless, I still recommend this wonderfully !!FUN!! game. If you have a mobile device however, I'd suggest you buy that version instead since the game seems to bug out less/feel better on my ipod touch.","September 6, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/251630/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","The Impossible Game is a short but challenging platforming-type game where you control a cube trying to make it through the end of an obstacle course full of pits, spikes, and non-existant gravity.\n\nThis is a very fun game, and that's primarily because of it's difficulty and great soundtrack. All you can do is jump. The only thing to aid you is the sound of the music as the soundtrack mostly goes with the course. You'll die again and again, but you'll keep coming back for more because you want to beat that stage, and hear the entire song. You get an amazing feeling of satisfaction when you accomplish it, let me tell you. It's a test of your memory and reflexes. Play to win.\n\nThe game's length can depend on how good you are, but the level selection is rather short. It's only 5 levels long, and the length of each stage is around 2 minutes. The replay value comes to just simply beating the level. The only other thing you can do is create levels of your own in the level editor. If you like that kind of thing, then by all means, go for it.\n\nOverall, The Impossible Game is an addicting, very hard game with a very upbeat soundtrack. If you love challenge and reflex games, then buy this. If that's not your cup of tea, you might not find much enjoyment out of it.\n\n7/10","June 28, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Yes it includes the level editor and custom maps, but if you are on specific video cards this game with have horrendously random lagspikes. It is not 100% optimized and because of it being a game where you absolutely critically need constant frames to play, the occasional half-second freezes will end up causing you to fail out of a level. I've played the mobile version of this game on my phone literally thousands of times and it is more stable than this version. Do not get me wrong, the game almost always has a constant fps, but there are these annoying lagspikes. And no before anyone says it, I am not on a bad computer. There's just something wrong with the game itself loading/deloading it's elements (the obstacles).","December 29, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unless you want to start spawning flags to bypass this (by entering practise mode), and practise each section by itself, whilst losing the cool music in the process, then you must endure this slog each and every death.\n\nI mean, games like Super Hexagon have similar issues, but this is a puzzle platformer. So the level -never changes-. An easy game with randomly generated terrain at least keeps the player awake, but a long puzzle platformer frustrates the beginner, only to bore the intermediate before only finally pleasing the master (who has to make the starting journey once or twice).\n\nThe music is pretty good though, but the practise mode music is rubbish. Also changing the rhythm on the player by changing the track between practise and 'real' mode is unhelpful at the least.\n\nThe game is also slightly glitchy (the player doesn't start on the ground after death, and at one point my character just vanished from the field).\n\nReally, these games can be enjoyable for a time, but I wouldn't pay money for them (or, at least, again). Find a flash variant of the same thing on Newgrounds or some other Flash game user-submitted portal.\nAnd this one isn't particularly 'impossible' or special or even mechanically or graphically better than these Flash games, just long with a limited field of view to force your death many times, until you finally memorise everything.\n\nI might pay money for the music though, if it were in standalone form.\n","August 11, 2014","false","9.5"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

But here goes.\n\nI am a huge fan of this game, I poured hundreds of hours into the iPhone version then the Xbox version, I even have it on Android it's that much fun to me. However this version has some bugs in it that make it hard to play on my computer, and here they are:\n\nWhen the background colors change, the game's framerate drops, I tried playing a custom level that's provided with the game called Doom and I can't advance very far because the framerate keeps dropping.\n\nThe game also pauses on me at random points, I keep failing some levels because the game keeps pausing.\n\nOccasionally the game will also snap out of focus and the game will pause itself making game progression difficult.\n\nSometimes the cube will go into other spots spontaneously making you fail and start over, happened to me twice in one game session\n\nThose are the only bugs that I have found so far even though I bought it only yesterday. As the game gets patched, and as the bugs get squished, I will be upating this review, for now it's a 7/10","May 16, 2014","true","11.4"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Nonetheless it's still a good game. Unless you're extremely hardcore and can master these levels in a few attempts, this game may take you awhile to finish, even though there aren't that many levels (5 to be exact, which is fine). Great music is in synch with the levels and it sounds amazing. it's weird how hard games usually get amazing soundtracks. I would recommend the impossible game to anyone looking for a challenge. Be warned though, as some people may throw fits of rage after dying so many times. There are a couple of small glitches, but nothing that will troll you. I owned the ios version of this game and i noticed that this version seems a tad slower than the ios version. I don't know if thats only me, but its not bad. also, when i made it about 65% or 75% through heaven (level 3) the obstacles come up a bit too close for comfort. I had a bit more time to react in the ios version. Again, not bad, it just makes heaven a bit harder. FlukeDude, if you could fix these glitches, I would appreciate it. either way, the game is still playable and I like it a lot.","December 31, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For those who have played the mobile version, get ready to cry a river of tears because they changed this game alot. The bugs and what-have-you do inhibit the "fun" factor of this game a lot, making it seem absolutely unfair. You blame the game and not yourself because the game does glitch a lot. Unlike the mobile version where you have to hone your skills and feel achieved once you beat the first level because you know you beat the game through skill and not pure luck. However they changed the fundimental game mechanics (jump distance/height) to make the game "easier" for beginners. In the mobil version however, they made the game difficult at the very start by using a smaller jump height and smaller jump distance. Now that the height and length of the jump was increased, all of the countless hours playing the damn mobile version mean nothing. Now you have to play at a completely different rythem counteracting the one that was drilled into your head. For those just getting into this game, you are going to learn how easy this game is and then play the mobile version only to die on the first drop....I will wait till this game updates and hope to see it in a different light.

A ton of fun, but at the same time, an irritant. This game features a stupid little smug square that explodes when you screw up, trying to jump over some stuff and make it to the end of the level, sounds easy enough, right? Not really. It is a challenge. You have to have good timing, memory, and a fair amount of not being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ helps.\n\nThe game features 4 levels (5 including the original) each with its own soundtrack, basically a rave style techno song, that accompanies the level and makes it awesome.\n\nSo if you're up for a challenge, play it.","July 4, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I play on an old-ish macbook with 4 gigs of ram and a pretty lame graphics card. It's not a gaming computer at all, so if you want, just disregard everything I'm about to say and blame my computer, which could be the problem, although I really don't think it should matter for a game this simple.\nBasically what I think you should know about this game is this: It is a simple but fun game, the music is epic, but the bugs are just TERRIBLE. First of all, the framerate sucks and there is often delay when you try to jump. Along with those, you have a bunch of other annoying things that can happen, and do happen frequently Sometimes when you die the game gets out of sync and the music isn't synced to the course, which is very annoying. The most frequent thing is that almost everytime you die, the cube will lag around for a second before settling at the beginning of the level, which wouldn't be a problem if it didn't happen every 15 seconds. Those are two of the most annoying things, but there are plenty of other little bugs and annoyances, which again wouldn't be a big deal, excpet there are so many of them.\n\nOverall, I would say get the game and spend the 5 bucks if you think you'll play it enough - I'm glad I did - but be don't get your hopes up too much about the smoothness of the gameplay.\nHope this helps!","July 30, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you get the 500 attempts achievement, you're crazy. Or hunting for achievements. Either way.\n\nThis is a game you pick up when you need to clear your brain for five minutes. The game DEMANDS your full attention and is great at clearing the cobwebs and refocusing yourself between tasks. The repetitive nature of the game makes it relatively easy to learn a level over time and see steady but slow improvement in your good runs, which means you'll keep coming back for more. By the time you beat all the levels, you'll have gotten your money's worth and then some.\n\nOn the other hand, if you adopt the idea that you MUST beat the game and get obsessed, you'll find that the long term learning curve pales to the short term frustration-induced failure rate.

The bugs and what-have-you do inhibit the "fun" factor of this game a lot, making it seem absolutely unfair. You blame the game and not yourself because the game does glitch a lot. Unlike the mobile version where you have to hone your skills and feel achieved once you beat the first level because you know you beat the game through skill and not pure luck. However they changed the fundimental game mechanics (jump distance/height) to make the game "easier" for beginners. In the mobil version however, they made the game difficult at the very start by using a smaller jump height and smaller jump distance. Now that the height and length of the jump was increased, all of the countless hours playing the damn mobile version mean nothing. Now you have to play at a completely different rythem counteracting the one that was drilled into your head. For those just getting into this game, you are going to learn how easy this game is and then play the mobile version only to die on the first drop....I will wait till this game updates and hope to see it in a different light. But for now 5/10....","June 21, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I play on an old-ish macbook with 4 gigs of ram and a pretty lame graphics card. It's not a gaming computer at all, so if you want, just disregard everything I'm about to say and blame my computer, which could be the problem, although I really don't think it should matter for a game this simple.\nBasically what I think you should know about this game is this: It is a simple but fun game, the music is epic, but the bugs are just TERRIBLE. First of all, the framerate sucks and there is often delay when you try to jump. Along with those, you have a bunch of other annoying things that can happen, and do happen frequently Sometimes when you die the game gets out of sync and the music isn't synced to the course, which is very annoying. The most frequent thing is that almost everytime you die, the cube will lag around for a second before settling at the beginning of the level, which wouldn't be a problem if it didn't happen every 15 seconds. Those are two of the most annoying things, but there are plenty of other little bugs and annoyances, which again wouldn't be a big deal, excpet there are so many of them.\n\nOverall, I would say get the game and spend the 5 bucks if you think you'll play it enough - I'm glad I did - but be don't get your hopes up too much about the smoothness of the gameplay.\nHope this helps!","July 30, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay wise is not for those people who to like have some fun and be happy but more towards those who likes to challenge their dexterity and mental memory. The music is incredibly good which makes you want to beat the game even more just to listen the entire awesome soundtrack.\n\nThe only issue I had this game is that their are some frame skipping or jerking when playing which can make the game a bit harder but less likely to ruined the game. The other problem from this game is that it is not Dxtory friendly which sometimes cause the game to crash if played to long while recording and frame rates tend to be unstable when using Dxtory since usually 2D games should be more stable when recording then 3D ones.\n\nOverall, This game is good for those who like challenges but not for those who always had a bad day.\n\nAnyway, if you guys interested you can watch my gameplay video on the game and see me how frustrated I was playing this game. http://youtu.be/y-9zwapUgYo\n","June 29, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm sure you have seen this game from Achievement Hunter/Rage Quit, but the instant I saw it I kew I had to buy it. The trouble was that I didn't have an Xbox.\n\nAnyway, to the gameplay: It's rather simple-you're an orange square, with no control over horizontal movement. The game moves to the right for you. The only control you have is to jump, and place checkpoints if you wish. There is one simple goal: get to the end of the level without touching the side of a block, a pit, or a spike.\n\nDispite its simplicity, this game is FIENDISHLY difficult. I am still having a hard time on Fire Aura, the first level. Yet for me, at least, it is addicting as heck. I have gone up to hundreds of attempts and I'm still playing it. And I dare to say that it beats Flappy Bird by a LONGSHOT. Plus, it has an editor to make your own levels. Nothing beats that.","July 9, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay wise is not for those people who to like have some fun and be happy but more towards those who likes to challenge their dexterity and mental memory. The music is incredibly good which makes you want to beat the game even more just to listen the entire awesome soundtrack.\n\nThe only issue I had this game is that their are some frame skipping or jerking when playing which can make the game a bit harder but less likely to ruined the game. The other problem from this game is that it is not Dxtory friendly which sometimes cause the game to crash if played to long while recording and frame rates tend to be unstable when using Dxtory since usually 2D games should be more stable when recording then 3D ones.\n\nOverall, This game is good for those who like challenges but not for those who always had a bad day.\n\nAnyway, if you guys interested you can watch my gameplay video on the game and see me how frustrated I was playing this game. http://youtu.be/y-9zwapUgYo\n","June 29, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm sure you have seen this game from Achievement Hunter/Rage Quit, but the instant I saw it I kew I had to buy it. The trouble was that I didn't have an Xbox.\n\nAnyway, to the gameplay: It's rather simple-you're an orange square, with no control over horizontal movement. The game moves to the right for you. The only control you have is to jump, and place checkpoints if you wish. There is one simple goal: get to the end of the level without touching the side of a block, a pit, or a spike.\n\nDispite its simplicity, this game is FIENDISHLY difficult. I am still having a hard time on Fire Aura, the first level. Yet for me, at least, it is addicting as heck. I have gone up to hundreds of attempts and I'm still playing it. And I dare to say that it beats Flappy Bird by a LONGSHOT. Plus, it has an editor to make your own levels. Nothing beats that.","July 9, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The impossible game isn't impossible, but requires a large amount of pacience to beat. It's an "endless" runner type, only with geometric shapes. You basically jump to avoid spikes and land on platforms. There's only 5 levels that lasts around 90 seconds each, but it'll take some time to beat them without flags. Flags are checkpoints that you can use to practice the harder sections. It has a minimalistic design, but the soundtrack is awesome. This is the roots of the also excellent Geometry Dash, but if you can i recommend you to also try this game. The level editor is also clean and easy to use.

If you liked this on XBLA or ios, then this is a great way to play it on a more accessible device.  If you're new to this game, it's a tough, muscle memory based game that tests your reaction ability through 5 levels (including the original level).  Each level is around two minutes, but failed attempts can drive the seemingly short 10 minutes to hours of gameplay.  This isn't the kind of frustrating faliure though, as it provides music that accompanies the gameplay excellently, unless your the type of person who plays on practice mode.\nThe level editor also works wonderfully, and allows you to create your own levels with no need for a guide or tutorial.

I've always loved these kind of (impossibly) hard reflex kind of games. This game pretty much nailed it, it's very fun and incredibly hard! Also, the controls are real smooth which makes it relatively 'easy' to play. The only point of attention are the glitches, for some reason the game spaces out every now and then causing you to randomly die, which is extremely frustrating in these kind of games in which there are no real checkpoints.\n\nPros:\n- It's (Impossibly) Hard\n- Makes you want to retry and win\n- Smooth controls\n- Simple but fitting graphics\n- It's a lot of fun\n- It has hours of gameplay for the achiev hunters\n- Has a Level Editor\n- Has a Practice Mode\n- Cheap (let's not forget that one :P)\n\nCons:\n- Only 5 levels (Level Editor slightly makes up for this though)\n- Glitchy from time to time\n\nOverall I'd really recommend this game as it's generally just a lot of fun.

The repetitive nature of the game makes it relatively easy to learn a level over time and see steady but slow improvement in your good runs, which means you'll keep coming back for more. By the time you beat all the levels, you'll have gotten your money's worth and then some.\n\nOn the other hand, if you adopt the idea that you MUST beat the game and get obsessed, you'll find that the long term learning curve pales to the short term frustration-induced failure rate.

The impossible game isn't impossible, but requires a large amount of pacience to beat. It's an "endless" runner type, only with geometric shapes. You basically jump to avoid spikes and land on platforms. There's only 5 levels that lasts around 90 seconds each, but it'll take some time to beat them without flags. Flags are checkpoints that you can use to practice the harder sections. It has a minimalistic design, but the soundtrack is awesome. This is the roots of the also excellent Geometry Dash, but if you can i recommend you to also try this game. The level editor is also clean and easy to use. My only complaint is that the game freezed randomly after a while in every game session. It was annoying, but not game breaking.","January 29","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe the thinking that if you keep going that you will beat the game....HA, Thats a laugh.

I hate to be that guy, but this game needs to run at 60 fps, but seems to be locked at something lower (I'm guessing 30, though it may be 24). This seems to be a mobile port and doesn't run at a good frame rate for a game based on reactions/timing. That being said, during a sale, this game worth it based on its soundtrack alone. It's amazing, and insanely satisfying to be able to hear a song all the way through by beating a level. Frame rate issues aside, it is a great game.","February 12","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Audio desync is a constant problem, as is "jerky" motion. And sometimes the game just stops rendering anything at all and then crashes.\n\nThis was originally a positive review but I've had to change it to a negative one due to the extremely blatant and problematic jerkiness. For a game that's so about rhythm, it doesn't actually have one when it runs. It should be smooth but it's not.","June 5, 2015","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
