The game is advertised as a “short, narrative driven game” - that being quite literally all it is. I could say I wasn’t really impressed with 4pm, but that would be quite the understatement. Disappointment is all I really got from this title.\n\nOverall the game is incredibly poor. With no replay value and such a short experience on top of a fairly poor execution, it will leave you wondering what you really played it for in the first place, that is, if you haven’t thrown up within the first five minutes due to the fuzzy and wobbly, low FOV camera. Perhaps if it had a little more polish, such as fixing the camera and not messing the player around with false choices, I might have been able to recommend it a little more as one to watch out for in a sale, but at the end of the day, the flawed design decisions are just too off-putting to recommend at all.\n\nEDIT: And before anyone complains about the gameplay time (as that is normally critical in reviews) the game took 22 MINUTES to complete. The extra time was looking for different 'choices' but as shown in my review - there are none.\n\nMore information can be found in the video review which allows me to explain some technical points much easier, as well as the basic summary below. Hope this helps justify my opinion on this game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_7a6Cv0L-A\n\nSummary:\n+ Storyline has SOME engaging moments.\n- Blurry and fuzzy camera can cause nauseating effects.\n- Choices aren’t real “choices”.\n- Game is incredibly short with no replayability.\n- Poor design decisions throughout with no gameplay elements.","July 6, 2014","false","0.6"," 208 of 272 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","208","272","0","13"

Along with the trailer and screenshots, (that admittedly look pretty good), and a low, low price point, it seems a promising option among the rest of the junk that regularly pops up on steam. And that is where I must give the developer his due; he’s made a really good sell. And that’s the best I can say, because the game itself is a laughable experience, and for literally every wrong reason there could be.\n\nFirst, the entire game is put through a ridiculously prominent fuzz filter, one that is evidently absent from the store’s trailer and screenshots, likely to better entice you into wasting your money. The filter itself is used to try and mask the horrid graphics underneath, but it doesn’t succeed. It loads slowly for no apparent reason, breaking up the many short mid-scene jumps with even longer loading freezes. Worse, the actual animations of the cast, particularly their faces, makes any attempt at creating an emotional resonance with the player fail miserably. Instead, the poor acting and bug eyed reactions will likely give you the same reaction as I had: loudly laughing your head off at the sheer stupidity at every attempt at “drama”.\n\nAnd what little attempt at a story there is, happens almost entirely at the end. “The big reveal” that occurs near the end of every good drama is shoehorned in with only a couple minutes of ♥♥♥♥ poor dialogue, with virtually no real exposition or story prior. The absolute pretentiousness of it all is positively palpable throughout.\n\nDespite how utterly trash this game is, I recommend it to a specific brand of person. Anyone who enjoyed the previous King to the Pretentious Kingdom, Dinner Date, is in for a real treat. Where I found DD to be comparably boring, 4PM offers several moments of gut wrenching hilarity, particularly during mid-game, where gears shift from pretentious slop to White Girl Simulator 2014. The entire thing lasts little more than around 25 minutes, and most of that time will be occupied wondering if something is ever going to happen. When something finally does, the credits come not 2 minutes later, and you’ll be left wondering how a single developer could create such an experience, let alone reach his keyboard, with his head so far up his own log cutter.","July 23, 2014","false","0.7"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","36","41","5","0"

This was loosely a story about alcoholism and suicide, but not really, since the ending is so vague that who knows what the real message was, other than not lying to yourself. The gameplay, such as it was, wasn't terrible. Obviously it was lo-fi in every way, but it wasn't so relevant since all you do is walk from point A to point B, pick up a few objects along the way, and listen to some tired dialogue. All of that would have been forgiven if the story was better, but it wasn't. It was sparse, uninspired, and lackluster at best. Also, edit your damned text. Seriously, I get that people don't seem to know the difference between lose and loose, but don't let that sort of thing make the final cut.\n\nYou know, I've played far worse, but these uninspired games that should be better really aggravate me a bit. This clearly meant something to the developer, and yet he/they couldn't be moved to write a better script?\n\nAnyway, I wouldn't spend money on this other than as part of a bundle, which is how I got it. Normally I would say to see for yourself, but this time, I would just take the reviews to heart. Not the best first foot forward for the developer. Hopefully, he/they learn from this and put something better out next time if there is a next time.\n\np.s. 4 gb file!

Although the whole story took approximately 20-30 minutes to complete, it fills you with feelings of negativity and sadness (basically makes you feel like absolute ♥♥♥♥). If the game explored these topics differently or sought to overcome these issues through empowering people, then it would have been recommended. However the player controls a character who consistently drinks, careless about their job and participates in scandalous relationships.\n\nPersonally, this game doesnt seem to be solving the problems explored, it is simply depicting the lives of people who endure through these tough times :(\n\n✿ ❀ ❁ Hope these individuals gain the strength to overcome these problems <3","March 8","false","1.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","3"

First off the game is very short, in fact I'll probably spend more time writing this review than I did actually playing the game.  The game ultimately comes down to a five minute segment at the end which makes up the meat of the gameplay if you can call it that.  You pick a few choices and the story finishes from there.\n\nFor it's five dollar price tag I wouldn't recommend it, this is more or less something you would find as a tech demo to a much larger game.  Heck I would expect to find something like this as a student thesis.\n\nThe positives of this game are it deals with subject matter that is very rarely ever touched in video games, alcoholism, divorces, suicide, but it's done in such a short span that you really don't care one way or the other about the main character or any of the supporting characters....\n\nIf you want an interactive Sunday school special like we saw in the 80's, this may be the game for you.  If you want gameplay, graphics, a comprehensive story, or generally a game, this probably won't be for you.","January 6, 2015","false","0.4"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","21","27","2","0"

Its a short film animated and made to be interactive. The only part that I don't see as very true in the desciption is the "Change the Outcome of the Game" part. I mean there are 2 different endings from what I found but until the end I found that the wrong choices just result in a fail, in which they just put you right back at the point of the game where you made the decision, pretty much making you choose 1 path until the end where it actually matters what you choose. I played through it 3 times. It is a pretty good story though and the ending is quite a shocker. The graphics are very blurry at times but it is that way for a reason, and once you start playing, you figure out why. It is definitley something new, I've never played anything like this before and I am a fan of short films so I actually enjoyed this. There is a note at the bottom of the store page stating that this is not a game of intense action, free roaming, or leveling up, and you shouldn't expect to log very many hours on it. That statement is very true so please take this into consideration before purchasing and crying about how short it is.

It promises to be a high fidelity experience, but due to some poor textures and facial animations, it doesn't quite live up to it. The game also tries to emulate the human experience by tossing in an over abundance of head bobbing. At certain segments of the game, the bobbing can get so nauseating it could induce motion sickness. The biggest issue with 4PM is it's length, I've finished the game in under 45 minutes, I've heard others doing it under 30, coupled with the lack any replayability,  to say the least, 4PM is a short game.\n\nDespite the game's glaring issues it is priced appropriately. At $5.00, it's not a large admission fee, and if you are curious to the game there are things to like about 4PM. The game is full of little details that help immerse the player, from playable mini-games on your computer monitor, to peelable stickers on the back of a cabbie's seat.

I also understand that this alone does not make it immune to criticism.\n\nMy thoughts are mixed. The game was short, and conveyed a powerful message. Succinct, and direct. But the dialogue was not particularly inspired, and felt forced.\n\nThe story being played over the course of a day I did like, and the revelations at the end were also thought-provoking. However, these high points are truly offset by the fact that the game is entirely played while the camera is criminally defocused. Yes, I recognise this does convey the feeling of someone who is 'defocused' in the head, as it were - the same with the unresponsive controls. I GET IT. That does however make for a vastly frustrating gaming experience. Enjoying a video game isn't always about having fun all of the time - some of my favourite games are true heart-wrenchers - but sadly due to the fact that this particular game has all of the right ingredients, but frustrating execution means that I really had to force myself to finish it. Any longer and I daresay I'd not have had the patience.\n\nHeadache-inducing. Lose the defocus - at least some of the time - and tighten up the controls a little more, and by the GODS I cannot recall how many times I tried to escape the office and failed.\n\nI can't recommend the game in its present state, sadly. A bold effort, and a commendable and noble cause, but it doesn't quite get past the finishing post.\n\nI do hope the developer isn't disheartened. It's a little sad to see the 'Note' in the game's 'About' section on Steam, about how he enjoys all of the negative comments. Take heart, and if there's an overwhelming negativity to a game, muscle through it, and find out where the constructive criticism is, and do your utmost to fix the issues. Or - produce something better next time around. This is how we learn and grow. By saying you're enjoying the negative press, all you're doing is feeding the fire, and ultimately alienating your players.

The fragmented storytelling worked amazingly well as trying to remember the night before the day after can be a struggle but as a player we never felt we are being withheld information as we know our character is a drunk and we know drunks have a hard time remember the night before so going along with Caroline as she tries to remember is a worthwhile experience. A film franchise did very well off this very idea.\n\n4pm will split opinions but it’s just a shame at what it does well is let down by technical issues. The blurry camera works for me because we see the world through a drunk’s eyes or as Bunk would say “Soft Eyes” but other aspects that a period of polish would fix is obviously lacking.\n\nDon’t be afraid to hate this game just don’t hate it for obvious reasons.

While I love traditional gaming, I'm always interested in trying something unique, and it was the apparent uniqueness of 4pm that made me want to try it out right away.\n\nBut even with those caveats, the game is slight. It takes maybe 20 minutes to complete, though I bet someone could do it in 5 minutes a second time through. Your interactivity with the game world is limited to walking forward and clicking on a small handful of items, like answering machines and doors. The story is entirely linear until the finale when you're presented with a series of choices, which I assume changes the ultimate outcome.\n\nSo since it's not much of a game in the traditional sense what we have left is the story, and it is an interesting one, albeit clumsy and brief. Without wanting to give too much away your character appears to be a 20-something party girl, and the story is a parable on alcoholism and memory, which is a refreshing change from the constant barrage of orcs and guns and blue haired lolitas that constitute much of gaming.\n\nSince Steam only offers a thumbs up or a thumbs down I'm not recommending it because it's just a little too sloppy in both story and gameplay for 5 bucks, but on a 5-star scale I'd put it more at a 2 or 2.5, worth a go if you find any of the aforementioned elements interesting.","July 11, 2014","false","0.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

I like story-driven, artsy, pretentious games because I think they're interesting. Dear Esther, Gone Home, and Kentucky Route Zero are among my favorite games, so when I heard about 4PM I had high hopes. Unfortunately, 4PM just doesn't deliver. I play story-driven games to be told a good *story*, and 4PM's is just... bad. It stars an incredibly unlikeable, unrelatable (at least for me) protagonist. The whole 20-minute experience exists to deliver the twist at the end, which ends up not being particularly exciting. There are a few parts where you can make choices, but they end up not mattering at all. If you choose wrong you essentially get a game over and can start again at the decision. The whole story is cliche.\n\nI wasn't sure whether the negativity around this game was just people hating on walking simulators (user reviews for Gone Home are bad too, but I loved that game) - but no, even if you like artsy story-driven games, this game really is just that bad.

But, I like "artistic" games; I've enjoyed such works as 9.03m so I decided to try it. The "0.5 hrs on record" you see above is my total play time, from beginning to end, beating it.  Plot aside (there is one, but it's not very well fleshed out), the execution of this game fails on every level. Optimization is poor, response is sluggish, interactive items only work when it's time in the "story" for them to work, character models look at least ten years old, voice acting is mediocre, and even the subtitles are poor (for example, "lose" is misspelled as "loose"...twice). One "stealth" section of the game is laughably (and worse, frustratingly) bad, and all of these things get in the way of what should have been an interesting and meaningful experience about alcoholism and depression.\n\nIt's hard to believe this is a 2014 release. "4PM is a high production value, cinematic experience aimed at people interested in interactive story-telling,"  the game's press release reads. Yes, all those things would be true --if it were 2004.

In 4PM you play as Caroline a complete drunk and essiantly the game is about her trying to pull her life back together. So how is 4PM ? Its absolutly awfull. The game barely works and half of the time its too boring to push to the end. So lets begin with the good. Great premise. The story is great and sometimes moving but thats pretty much it. The games controls are bad and the graphics are bad. But from what i understand its to simulate a real life drunk person. The game barely makes sense on what you need to do so pretty much all you is press on random things and hope it works. The game is also confusing to navigate. The Voice work is abysmal to say the least. This game is also incredibly short around half an hour and im incredibly dissapointed in this title. So overall 4PM is a poor excuse to make a story driven expierence and its not really worth your time. Bad graphics, Horrible controls and overall its not good. I give 4PM a 2.5/10","August 1, 2014","false","0.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

As far as I'm aware it was his student project at the National Film and Television School in the UK. That's so blatantly obvious throughout my stint with this game.\n\nIt's 30 minutes long, with bad writing and voice acting. The two gameplay sequences are frustrating with most of my playtime coming from failing them a few times. The story's premise isn't inherently bad but the short length forces it to unfold in a half-baked way that just seems absurd and the "twists" are unearned. By the time the credits were rolling (which are actually probably one of the best parts), I was just laughing at how completely inane at what transpired in the past half hour.\n\nVisually there's a decent aesthetic with this almost-blur but it's ruined with quite low quality and badly designed assets. It's an indie game, I know, but the character models are so deep in the uncanny valley it's kinda scary at times (seriously that boss guy aaaaa). Sound quality varies but voice acting is middling to terrible. Sound effects sound mostly stock so they rarely sound like they actually fit. The subtitles have grammatical errors in them occasionally which is nitpicky but come on.\n\nThere's a decent message hidden under 4PM, and some interesting themes. It's just not a well made product. Give this man more money and a more talented team to produce a longer story and he'll be miles better than David Cage. That's faint praise, I know.\n\nP.S. Press Q to be a white girl and go "WOOOOOOO WOOOOO WOOOOOOOOO".

Although the camera may be awful and the fact she keeps moving all the god damn time is a pain the story is nice and offers a deepish story line that ends in a sort of dramatic reveal. There are some fun random things you can do an interact with in this game such as the computer where you have to type up a market report. It doesn't matter what you write but in the moment it's a nice touch.\n\nOverall I give the game a 6/10 for being much too short, animations being awful, camera being terrible especially with the FOV. But the game makes up with this with a decent short story. But this game shows that this company knows what they are doing with this type of game so if they can sort out they issues and make the story longer then I can see them making some great games in the future.\n\nVideo: Coming soon!","July 18, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yu serious?\n\n\nNegative Points:\nStory\n- Way too short. The credits are the longest part of the game.\n- Had potential but they did nothing interesting with their scenario.\n\nChoices\n- They seem to be pretty pointless (at lease there are different endings).\n\nGraphics\n- Bad especially the blurred vision.

The beginning of the game seems to imply a pivotal moment for the game's protagonist, with the remainder encompassing the player living out the events that potentially contributed to this conclusion.  Instead however, one potential decision veers the entire story onto a different track, whereby the life of another individual begins to occupy the forefront of the story.  Decisions for potential courses in conversation ultimately become elusive as a few options (i.e. "agree" or "disagree") result in statements that elicit specifics that could not have been predicted given the ostensible implications of the options themselves. And while one of the endings may be designed to terminate the story on a lingering cliffnote, the conclusion in question is not only abrupt but lacks a true sense of finality, not merely leaving the player to speculate about a potential ending, but innumerable different scenarios in which the conversation in progress might ultimately proceed, not to mention a wide variety of potential events to follow.\n\nFurthermore, although I acknowledge that this particular mechanic is designed to emphasize the pathetic nature of a rather tragic individual, there's something inherently frustrating about being ellicited mission objectives that the player knows are detrimental to the character's well-being.  In essence, these involve being tasked with actions triggered by the protagonist's alcoholism and thus self-destructive nature and it feels more than a little ackward when the goal of the game is to make the character's life even more miserable in both the short- and long-term spectrum.\n\nWhile the game is built around a unique mechanic that takes the player through more down-to-earth events, reminiscent of real world problems, and boasts attractive lighting and set designs(not to mention a very low price-tag), I ultimately can't reccommend it for purchase.\n\n\n\n","July 10, 2014","false","0.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It really could. But the only promise it shows is at the end, which makes me believe that this is what the rest of the game was build around. And it's simply not good. You go from one short scene to another, have to bear with horribly blurry graphics (that are strangely absent from the promo material displayed here), jarring cuts, and voice acting that can be hard to make out.\nAnd what gameplay does it offer? You walk around, interact with a few objects and make choices in the end. All of which takes you about 24 minutes.

I love story-driven games, and I had a good attitude at the beginning. I thought that graphics are nice for an indie game (they're not, that's just well adjusted lightning), story seemed to be fine (it is not, it's dull. If it were a short film etude author would be laughed out).\nBut the worst thing is - this is the most terrible optimalisation I have ever seen. 3GB for that short game? Constant crashes?! I could not see the ending because game has crashed! And the "sneaking out of office" part was sooo frustrating.\n\nDear devs - fix your game and I'll change my opinion, because there is potential in it, buried deep behind software terribleness.","September 23, 2014","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a short, somewhat interactive machinima about walking around in an alcohol-fueled haze.  So I guess that's not very ironic.  Oh, and it's also about the ways people deal with guilt.  Honestly, I liked the mysterious beginning, and I could empathize with the main character's dread of "the office".  The character models could've been better, though, and some of the animations seemed a bit dated.  As an experience, it was interesting - in a student project kind of way.  To pay $3 for it, though, meh.  I think there are better ways to spend your money on Steam.","February 15, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
