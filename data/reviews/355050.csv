The graphics are nice, the controls are responsive, the soundtrack is catchy. The gameplay itself is nothing terribly special - the format has barely changed since at least the Raiden series, back in the 90's - but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's a format that works.\n\nUnfortunately, like so many games these days, Sky Force mistakes repetition for content. It becomes apparent very early on that grinding for cash is a necessity; either you suffer through later stages where your armaments are too weak to kill half the enemies before they fly offscreen, or you replay stages you've done to death already in order to add one extra upgrade point to a weapon. That there are a meagre 9 stages does not help matters, either.\n\nI played the mobile version of this game prior to getting it on Steam, and I'm glad at least that they've toned the grinding down a little, but it's still a very significant part of the game - too much so for me to recommend this.","December 21, 2015","false","14.1"," 65 of 83 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","65","83","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/355050/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","This game is absolutely craziness and extremely addicting.\n\nBasics - Skyforce anniversary is a bullet hell, vertical shoot 'em up. The game is a complete remake of the original mobile phone game that was released ten years ago. The anniversary edition is also a port from mobile, but this isn't in the slightest bit noticable. They have converted it extremely well to appeal to the PC audience instead of the casual mobile audience.\n\nGraphics - Probably the first thing you will notice when playing this game is the stunning graphics. There is so much detail in every item of the game. The colours used make everything stand out. Despite it being 2D the screen has a lot of depth to it due to the graphics used. The animations are also top quality especially in the water.\n\nSoundtrack - This is absolutely one of the highlights of the game. It is a pleasure to listen to such a nice soundtrack that goes great with the gameplay. It is also so good that I would be willing to listen to it outside of the game. And i can do this, because the developer has made the soundtrack free to all.\n\nGameplay - The gameplay of the game consists of standard bullet hell vertical shooter gameplay. The screen scrolls down at a constant rate and you shoot enemies that arrive on different sides of the screen via your upword facing gun. The best thing about the gameplay however is the amount of enemy variety. There are so many different types of enemies that move and shoot in different ways that you will never get bored. I think this is what really sets it apart from the rest of the games in this genre.\n\nStory - This game does have a story. It is told through quotes from characters as you are playing the game. Although the story is very basic and completely forgetable. I don't believe this particularly matters in a game of this genre though.\n\nProgression - The game features an extensive progression system. The ingame currency, Stars, are earned through playing the levels. They can be used to buy upgrades to your ship. This includes a very large variety including health, weapons and a magnet as well as many more. This upgrade system makes you never get bored of the game and really feel like your actually progressing.\n\nPC Specifics - The game is very well optimized for PC. The game runs at a constant 60fps on ultra on my mid end device. The options menu features everything you would want from a PC game of this genre. It includes set quality settings, including AA. A large set of resolution options. Language selection. And finally seperate sound and music volume sliders. I don't feel that rebindable keys are needed as the controls are very well done, however a section to view the controls would be useful.\n\nControl - The original version of this game was controlled via touch controls so obviously this had to be changed a lot to migrate successfully on pc. The game gives you 3 options of control. These are keyboard, mouse and controller. I felt the keyboard controls, using the arrow keys, didn't offer much control of the ship due to the limit of 8 directions. Mouse controls also didn't feel very fluid. I decided to use my xbox controller in the end as it just felt more natural for this type of game. I would highly recommend anyone playing it to also use a controller for it.\n\nSummary - This game is extremely fun and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of this genre. I would say it is one of the best currently available on PC. The low price makes it a must buy for anyone without any hesitation.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was given an early review key by the developer of the game for this review.","April 30, 2015","true","11.1"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","24","26","3","3"

It's a high energy shooter with pixel perfect bullet dodging, smooth and fluid controls, and a clear dedication to the art of the shoot 'em up genre. A shoot 'em up that while retaining all of the classic charm of its predecessors is absolutely tailored for the current generation.\n\nThe story presented in Sky Force Anniversary is an easy to ignore and mostly forgettable one, which is fine considering the fact that a story even being present in a shooter like this is surprising to begin with. Despite the loose and interspersed plot being mostly filler its told through some stylish and snazzy cut-scenes with some pretty sharp character designs particularly of our hot-headed and skilled lady pilot who takes no ♥♥♥♥, a real Amelia Earhart of modern times. The plot here isn't going to keep anyone too engaged but it serves the flow of the game more than fine.\n\nAs far as shmups go Sky Force sets its visual goals ambitiously high and ends up being the prettiest damn mobile shooter I've laid eyes on, and I've played my fair share. Presented with crisp 3D visuals on a classic two-dimensional side-scrolling playing field the game has no shortage of vibrantly natural settings tainted by the cruel steel touch of man's lust for power. Grassy hills, rocky mountains and pristine oceans assault the player's senses yet are all counter-balanced with the chaos of battle and the dancing of brightly colored bullet patterns for you to dodge. Everything is propelled into motion by the electric and nostalgic soundtrack that brings your ears right back to the PS1 and Saturn generation of gaming.\n\nWith a nice little set of side-objectives and goals to accomplish within each level I found myself returning to stages multiple times before even finishing the game to tackle each one with newly bought upgrades, and reaping their rewards. It will even seem mandatory to venture back from time to time into completed territories to go after the objectives padding each of the missions in order to earn their medals, which are required to progress further. This forces a small bit of grinding in every stage for medals to progress, which would usually irk me but with a shmup so visually stunning and easy on the ears this was more than welcome to revisit each one.\n\nPlenty of twists and turns are thrown at you throughout each level keeping things fresh and not quite as repetitive as games in the genre can usually be, with EMPs from your brutishly militant adversary that shut off your ability to shoot forcing you to focus on dodging heavy curtains of bullets to picking up the marooned survivors scattered across each landscape\n\nWe hear plenty of love and appreciation for the shmup and bullet hell genres these days, but hardly ever any acknowledgement for the cult classics that paved the way for what we have today. This is a category Sky Force fits snuggly into. It feels like a classic Toaplan shmup or an older Raiden on uppers and its glorious. I'm sad I missed it the first time. It's almost surprising that this is made from a studio in Poland, in terms of the enemy and bullet patterns and the scoring mechanics this is right up there in authenticity with the best of the best in classic Japanese shmups.\n\nWith over nine stages of modern shmup action and a whole lot of replay-ability between them derived from the large number of extra missions, difficulties, medals and objectives to accomplish in each one, Sky Force Anniversary packs more than enough content for the genre to justify the purchase.\n\nFor those looking to scratch that shoot-'em-up itch, Sky Force Anniversary is some of the purest shooting action you can find outside of an arcade.\n\nIf you already enjoy Sky Force Anniversary, be sure to check out the upcoming Sky Force Reloaded!","May 16","true","14.7"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/recommended/355050/","PeteOzzy","PeteOzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/","4903 products in account","Given a choice, I'd say I prefer my shmups of the vertical-scrolling bullet hell persuasion. The symmetrical beauty in the chaos of projectiles and explosions as you guide your craft through pixel thin safe areas; there's a real intoxicating panic behind your deadpan focus. When I pick up a non-bullet hell shooter, I tend to feel like I'm playing in slow motion which all too often leaves me craving something a little more high-octane. It's not a universal law by any means, especially when I consider some of the earliest and greatest titles, but it's always a concern on my mind when I fire one up.\n\nInitially, Sky Force Anniversary does feel rather muted and uneventful. The enemies arrive in straightforward line formations and die quickly to short volleys of fire while the larger foes drift slowly across, occasionally firing a single bullet that's easily avoided. The first level is best viewed as a lengthy tutorial of sorts and is probably not the best example from which to judge the entire game. Very soon it becomes apparent that this is not your average shmup, in any real sense of the word.\n\nThere's a focus on upgrades in SFA that creates a unique feel, almost like an endless runner, but you aren't fighting to see the end of the level necessarily so much as you are just trying to survive as long as possible. It's entirely level-based which lends a superior sense of structure but borrows on the formula's replayability and addictive draw. It also provides a purpose to the shiny trinkets commonly dropped by downed vehicles with a between-game shop selling permanent upgrades such as missiles, health increases and shield systems. It's a subtle twist on an incredibly familiar genre that manages to turn an unpleasant grind into a curve that keeps the entertainment levels stable throughout.\n\nOnce you have a few levels completed and several improvements to your ship under your belt the pace quickens dramatically. The challenge that comes in both the level goals and the odds you face within always provide enough resistance that your steadily increasing arsenal doesn't undermine the satisfaction. To progress through the campaign, you need to collect the stars awarded by meeting certain criteria. Generally, this involves taking no damage, destroying certain percentages of the enemy force and rescuing the MIA troops dotted throughout the terrain. At no point did completing these tasks seem trivial, more often I actually found them quite exhilarating, especially once you unlock the harder level variants.\n\nIt's worth addressing that SFA is a mobile port, something I know many find abhorrent. Thankfully, shmups are a genre where the smartphone versions tend to be perfectly functional in comparison to their console and PC counterparts. Personally, I find the areas that ports tend to disappoint are the UI/GUI (where they are often over-sized and simplified) and the controls (that can translate poorly to M&K). The display is a clean and minimal design through necessity to the genre and while the menus are a little basic, they fit their purpose as well as any PC native shooter. As for controls, they're adequate on keyboard though I'd absolutely suggest playing with a controller if you have the means; something I'd say of any shmup in all honesty.\n\nSky Force Anniversary is surprisingly pretty, opting for a realistic 3D style rather than the genre-typical pixels. The cloud effects and rippling of the waves and foliage beneath you look surprisingly stunning in motion. The enemy design can lack a little in personality and the projectiles occasionally camouflage into the visual effects, but it's a minor complaint. All the while, you have a great soundtrack charting your flight with beating techno in a slight retro flavour. The tempo rises as the bosses emerge and it's one of the cases where I'd happily buy the soundtrack to play outside of gameplay. What makes this even better is that the OST is actually a free DLC for owners of the game, so the reasonable entry charge is all the more palatable.\n\nIt's a slow start but it quickly evolves into one of the more enjoyable shmups on Steam. As much as I always enjoy a well-made example of the genre, what impressed me most is how Sky Force does more than just replicate and regurgitate. Whether you want just one more addictive adrenaline-fueled shooter or a fresh-flavoured cocktail of innovation and classic mechanics, I feel perfectly comfortable lending my voice to the many recommending Sky Force Anniversary.\n\n*This review was written using a key from the developer for reviewing purposes*","May 9, 2015","true","13.0"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/recommended/355050/","zanriel","Zanriel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/","874 products in account","I liked this game quite a bit until I got to Stage 5. The difficulty spiked up about 200% and I'm going to have to grind earlier levels quite a bit to get enough upgrades to pass it, I'm afraid. This game was originally a mobile game, as I've recently discovered, so that's probably why it has such horrendous difficulty spikes. There's no cash shop though, so you just have to grind your way through the upgrades to progress if you're not a 14-year old with superhuman reflexes.\n\nAnd that's the problem with this game. I don't mind a little grinding, I'm an old-school MMO player. Back in my day, grinding's all we had and we liked it!\n\nIn this game, to unlock later stages requires you to earn badges in previous stages. Badges are granted for things like killing Y% of the enemies or collecting Z% of the coins, getting through the level without getting hit, picking up all the civilians scattered around, etc. Once you get all four badges on Easy, it unlocks a tougher difficulty for that stage with a new set of badges. To get a stage unlocked you have to have completed the previous level AND you have to have collected X number of badges.\n\nAs you go through the game collecting coins, you can spend those on upgrades for your ship. This adds a neat RPG like progression system. The graphics are nice, the music is cool, the gameplay is smooth, but once I hit Stage 5 it wasn't fun anymore. What's wrong with Stage 5? There's this nasty energy pulse that chases you the whole time. If it hits you, you lose all ability to fire weapons and you just have to skate through the rest of the level not getting hit. Not fun. Or you can keep running from it, which means you have to juke and move CONSTANTLY, which makes aiming at enemies and picking up civilians quite a bit more difficult. Sometimes you need to go left to dodge a projectile, but that's where the energy orb is so you can't go that way. Ugh, it's just frustrating.\n\nSo, I'm giving this a thumbs down. It's too grindy, has huge difficulty spikes (I think because of its mobile P2W origins), and frustrating mechanics.","December 4, 2015","false","3.1"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","18","27","3","4"

It's a game in the same vein as the Snes Aero Fighters, among other shmups from the time.\n\nI had been looking for something like this for a while, since I'm not particularly fond of rage inducing, bullet-hell maddening shumps that dominate the genre (at least it's the case on Steam).\nThere are a couple of things in this game that set it apart from the rest and that to my knowledge, you're not likely to find anywhere else.\n\nSo here's the good...\n\n+ Skill upgrade system\n+ Gorgeous top down 3D visuals and slick interface/ reasonable graphic options\n+ Feels great and responsive on a gamepad (mouse control is relatively good as well)\n+ Multiple stage objectives keep you coming back for more\n(clearing them 100% will unlock a 'hard' mode)\n+ Catchy tunes, reminiscent of Snes/Megadrive era games\n+ Gameplay is a nice trade-off between challenge and fun and it has a fine-tuned difficulty curve\n(it's also surprisingly relaxing)\n\n...the bad and ugly:\n\n- A bit short, only includes 9 stages\n- A bit repetitive\n(stages are well designed and polished but the setting remains the same throughout the game)\n- Single controllable ship and weapon variety is limited\n(I suppose this is mainly because of the upgrade system)\n- Might be too easy for diehard veterans of the genre\n(it also features a life bar, with health being dropped randomly by kills)\n\nAll in all, Sky Force Anniversary is the shmup for when you need a break from the usual claustrophobic Ikaruga.

You have one ship to play as and it can be upgraded by collecting stars from killed enemies. These upgrades are permanent so over time you can have fun with a super powered plane.\n\nThis still won't make it easy to win though as you still need skills to dodge bullets and beat enemies who get tougher in the higher levels. There are a total of 8 story missions and then one bonus mission. Each mission has 3 levels of difficulty that you have to unlock by getting the medals for each difficulty. Medals consist of not getting hit, killing 100% of enemies, 70% of enemies, and saving all the humans. You don't have to do them all on one play through of the mission but if you can you can boost your score even higher. I've had a blast trying to unlock each medal and getting the highest score I can.\n\nThere's a local co-op which is fun with a friend on the couch. I played a little with my son and we had a blast playing. There is also a weekly challenge stage that will loop and enemies become harder and harder as you try to build your score. I would love to see some online co-op as I have a friend I'd love to play this with. Not sure if it's something that could be implemented in the future or maybe even a sequel.

Instead of direct plane upgrades from the old Sky Force, the new one let you collect stars and use them for upgrading plane, which annoyed me a bit at first, 'cause i couldn't play properly from stage 5 without good upgrades, but in the end, i got plenty of stars after just a few hours, and i could move forward to level 8 easily.

For example, the laser weapon in the promo screenshots is not a standard shot and has limited ammo.\nThe actual main cannon fires slowly and leveling it takes some time.\nThe laser, shield, and megabomb's ammo must be purchased before the start of each level, that ammo does not carry over.\n\nIt's the perfect formula for a free2play game with in-app purchases, it also makes the game feel like work. Another oddity is the speed of the ship, it's slow compared to other shooters and there is no buffs to speed it up. This will leave the player missing many ingame goals as enemies fly rapidly to the other side and off screen. Which brings me to another problem, most of the time it feels like the enemies aren't trying to kill you but get away from you. This probably has a lot to do with the progression system, where the player will be task to kill all enemies in a level but find themselves greatly underpowered most of the time.\nIt's not fun and unless you like being in an abusive relationship or being stuck in a sunk cost fallacy, skip this mobile remake for any of the other superior shooters on Steam.\n\npros/cons\n+excellent graphics\n+great sound\n-monotonous game-play\n-free2play/pay2win progression system\n-consumable ammo (laser/shield)\n-harder modes only increase enemy hp and damage","February 5","false","3.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This game has got to be one of the dullest shmups on Steam, it almost is devoid of anything even remotely interesting or exciting. There are no exciting attack patterns (like, half the enemies do nothing and just fly at you), next to no enemy-variety (small planes, big planes, turrets, boats - 8-Bit games offered more than this), there is no massive firepower to wield (you pea-shooter gets slightly more powerful by upgrading it for ingame-currency which you have to grind), no awesome power-ups (no different weapons, no secret stuff), and there are no interesting stages (the level is basically just scrolling by below you and has the same theme for 8 stages) and obviously no cool mechanics (the chain system  = don't miss a ship, score-multiplier = play on harder difficulty) - this game is just a complete bore, on the default diffculty it basically plays itself.\n\nSure, it looks good (though, as much as I enjoy color in my video games - there could have been much more variety in the themes of stages, it's 8 / 9 levels flying over a jungle-paradise) - but stages drag on forever and offer NOTHING to justify that length. Bosses are a joke and the tougher challenges have to be unlocked by beating the dumb and dull "easy" stages until you killed everything, rescued everyone and made it through the whole thing without a scratch. So, if you get unlucky - you actually have to replay the same boring ♥♥♥♥ in order to unlock HARD or INSANE. Mind you, INSANE is about Stage 1 / Easy difficulty in any japanese shmup on Steam - so it's still not exactly challenging or exciting.\n\nOnce you are done with the 9 Stages the game offers, there is exactly nothing else you can do but play for achievements - grind for kills, grind for rescues, grind for cards. It's kinda sad really, cause I get some SWIV-vibes from certain parts of levels and some of the sound-effects seem to be somewhat inspired by it too.\n\nBy being accessible to everyone the developers somehow forgot to put a game inside Sky Force Anniversary and instead wasted my time (and not in the good and entertaining kind). Consider it, if graphics and longevity achieved through grind are your thing but stay away if you are hungry for gameplay and want to spend some quality time shooting enemy fighters out of the sky.","June 21, 2015","false","3.1"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","4"

And that is by design !!! Not a bug! you can hardly believe it ...\n\nThe bug occurs but thereby I play with the xbox360 pad. The directional pad which I must assign the arrow keys on the keyboard with the Xpadder because someone wanted to decide for myself how I have to play the game ...\nSo that the game recognizes the keyboard and my Ship is shooting  on their own and then they're not... because I it have no directed imput for a while ....\n\nThus useless because I wanted to do it at my Arcade Machine.

Your weapon only has one upgrade path, leading to higher damage and a faster rate of fire; all the other weapons in the game come in the form of on-use items (shield, laser, and meg bomb) that don't carry over between missions. A carry on from what the game was originally developed for I imagine, but considering how easy the game is once you level up your weapons a few times (and buy the missile/wing cannon upgrades), you rarely need to use the on-use items and as such I don't see a reason why I shouldn't be able to carry them between missions. There's some mission variety that has you not being able to shoot down enemies and dodging them instead, but it wasn't enough to carry me to the end. There's a lot of content (each mission can be played through on multiple difficulties) but the lack of any significant upgrades means you'll get bored before you even hit the point where you want to play through hard.\n\nThe word disappointing was designed for this game.","May 3, 2015","false","0.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

The first time I started it up the controls were stuck to the right, forcing the ship into the right hand side of the screen. There's no way to cancel, suicide or bring up an options menu, leaving me no option but to wait to die, which took longer than expected.\n\nWhen I finally got to an options menu I realized there's no way to rebind the controller buttons. A few other bugs, like when you accidentally enter the hangar you HAVE to spend stars (earned by killing enemies) to get out of there, there is no back option until you spend some stars.\n\nStability on Linux is OK, but for some reason the game will not release the mouse when I alt-tab to other windows.\nWhy so sloppy? If you spent the time making a game that looks good, sounds good and seems to play good, why not spend the extra time making sure that controllers and options are up to par with at least the mid 90's genre you're trying to immitate? And why is it they never support the D-pad for controlling stuff? This is a "retro" game, how about giving me access to some retro controls? I hate the analog stick for shmups!\n\nThese issues may not irk everyone as much, but I'm pretty tired of really lazy programmers at this point. I'm uninstalling this game after 8 minutes of gameplay and unless I see an update I will not try it again, waste of money.","May 6, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codakon/recommended/355050/","codakon","Codakon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codakon/","143 products in account","Fun game, but... No co-op like they say it has. For the life of me I can't get second player on the game. It keeps saying "Press A for second player" and no matter how many times I press "A", I never get a second player. Frustrating.\nI didn't realize that it was "local Co-op" and not "co-op" so bought a game for my sons account. I chalk that up to my skipping over that part in the description so I don't fault the game for that. I missed that in the description.\nBut, I do fault the game for not allowing the second player to play for local co-op, we tried to salvage the evening by just playing it on my computer with the 22 inch monitor. We ended up going with another game after wasting too much time getting the second player plane to show up.\n\n[See edit below] I would recommend it if you don't ever, and I mean ever, plan on playing it in co-op mode. Although, that said, why not just get the game for your phone for free. The only reason I got this for the PC was so my son and I could play together.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe only thing I would change in my above review would be that I got it working with the controller. But my recommendation still stands based on:\n1. no keyboard-keyboard local co-op\n2. no keyboard + mouse co-op\n3. each time a new round starts does the controller get red or purple? Roll the dice and prepare to get confused. It drove me nuts because I would get used to red and then next round I was purple. WTH? I'm still using the controller and my son is still using the keyboard. Why the switching up of colors? I finally figured out the pattern to somewhat get the same color most of the time. But still kinda stupid.\n4.  no auto fire for the controller plane. So I sit there with my thumb mashed down for minutes at a time. Talk about thumb fatigue. The keyboard plane gets auto fire, why does the other one need you to fatigue your thumb. Lame.\n5. no useful information in the help file. There was nothing in there about a controller being required for the game.\n6. I'm still looking for where it says in the game description that a controller is required for second player. Still haven't found it. I definitely would not have purchased the game for me and my sons account had I known this.\n\nNow, to be fair, I do like the game on my phone. I easily gave it a 5 star review on Google Play as it deserved it. But I just can't in good faith give a recommendation for a $10 game on a PC that falls this short. I've paid far less and received far more in other games. I guess I got suckered in on a game on the phone and thought it would be equally as fun on the PC, and I think it could be with the proper forethought in gameplay/interfacing.\n\nI know I'll get flamed for this review, but in hindsight I would not have purchased the game knowing what I know above. Or at least I would have seriously hesitated. So because of that I'm leaving this review to help other gamer's make an educated decision.","April 30, 2015","false","1.7"," 11 of 32 people (34%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","34","11","32","4","6"

Your ship fires infinite ammo while all you have to do is dodge shots, hover over stranded people and rescue them, and enjoy the wonderful music and 3d scenery, laugh at the hilarious woots from your rescued passengers, and permanently upgrade your ship in the hangar. Amazingly, the scenery and bullet colors are all amazingly balanced to prevent disorientation or the inability to see enemy shots. No camouflaged ammo here, which is a common issue in shmups! The permanent upgrades, level select, easy-on-the-eyes scenery and funny characters make Sky Force Annivesary an excellent addition to any casual gamer's collection. 10/10, would celebrate that anniversary again!","March 16","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I typically do not play games of this sort but Sky Force has a great soundtrack (I recommend buying it if you like the in-game music) as well as simplistic yet challenging gameplay mechanics which I like.  The gist of the game is using your airplane's weapons to destoy the enemies you see on-screen.  Along the way you can acquire various upgrades and perks that will make your journey easier and more productive.  Best of all (from my perspective) is that you can beat any level (any level!) with simply persistence, by levelling up your perks to defeat formerly powerful (or overpowering) enemies.  Playthroughs are (for me at least) typically short, averaging 10-15 minutes, which makes this a great game for when you don't feel likeplaying for an extended period of time.  Your progress is saved automatically after every level/death and you also collect "stars" (the in-game icons that you collect and accumulate to buy items) even on "fail runs" where you airplane blows up.  Nice.  Overall I would recommend Sky Force if you are looking for an easy-to-learn pick-up-and-play overhead airplane shooter game with a great soundtrack.  There are also tournaments that run every weekend if you feel the need to challenge yourself against non-AI opponents.  Recommended.  4/5","May 25","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is not really a bullet hell before you encounter the bosses though.\n\nThe first thing that struck me, was the very nice graphics. And that is really important in games like this, or else it would  boring quick. The enemies and backdrop are animated nicely, using colors as it should be. Along with tight controls (only tried keyboard) did make a good first impression. The music, sound and speech is spot on: Fitting, and no way annoying after playing for several hours.\n\nI discovered however, that the gameplay was not up to par with the rest. Instead of creating a proper ammount of levels, the game is locked down by goals instead. You end up doing the same maps over and over again. This is because you have to get a certain ammount of total goals, before the next level is unlocked. And they are all the same on each map, except for one: Kill 70%, 100%, Rescue all the pilots and don't get hit a single time. To help out getting further, you permanently upgrade your plane, so each map becomes easier each time. I feel this is a bad choice of extending the game. The bonus level after you kill the boss, however, is a much better designed level. A few of these, and the game didn't have to rely on doing maps over and over to progress. The last level actually pulls up the score a bit.\n\nAnother thing that puzzled me, was the lack of help for the keyboard controls. After a while, you unlock one-shot mechanics (shield, laser etc) and they have to be fired manually. But the game doesn't tell you which keys. And it goes without saying that I haven't found a way to rebind the keys either.  For the record: you can pilot the plane with arrow keys, and wasd. The specials are fired with 1, 2 and 3. Since the main guns and missiles are autofired, I thought perhaps the one shots fired automatically too. But it didn't. So a little ingame-help would have been nice.\n\nSo how long do I think I will play this game? Well, the review was written after 2 nights of a total of 6 hours of gameplay. I have beaten the main boss and the boss on level 9. But I haven't unlocked all the goals or the steam achivements. I feel I might go back to play a little bit more. But the goals are pretty non-inspiring, so I doubt it will be a game I play for more than 10-20 hours. Might fire it up from time to time though.\n\nSo, the final question, was it worth my time and money? I will say absolutely. The game is a very solid shoot'em up, despite the choice of progression system. Perhaps this is how PC-arcade games have to be made, to compensate for the lack of quarters.","June 6","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
