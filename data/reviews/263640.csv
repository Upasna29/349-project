Ok, I finally got around to it.  Unfortunately it's not going to improve things.  When I tried to play to update my opinion I found some insane things that simply stopped me from playing.  Here are the most important reasons I quit playing after only a few minutes.  I will leave it at that:\n\n* The popup tooltips do not have any support for controllers.  So I can run around in the game with a controller but have to switch to my mouse and keyboard when a tooltip pops up?  Right...\n* The guns are placed in THE WORST way I have ever seen.  EVER.  Why, WHY, would a person hold a gun like that?  Take the handgun, when I picked this gun up the game character holds it way up to the right blocking a big portion of the screen.  When you aim it moves it way over to the left and way back in a way that makes absolutely no sense at all.  It feels like the character is somehow holding the gun beside their head, and behind it at the same time.  Soon after picking up the pistol I picked up some sort of a rocket launcher.  This gun took up more than HALF THE SCREEN.  Simply unacceptable.\n\nThat was when I shut the game down.  Read the original review if you like.  I'm out.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nKeeping in mind that this is an early access review (although when it is this short I have trouble calling it a review), I can not currently recommend CDF Ghostship.  The game seems like it will be really cool when some more work is put into it, but at the moment there are things that make it too frustrating for me.\n\nShooting\nShooting can be painful.\n\nGuns that do not reload but recharge instead are nice, but there is no clear indication of this which can definitely be a problem in battle.\nHitting what you shoot at is often difficult because the enemy hit boxes are too small or oddly shaped, and the guns are horribly inaccurate.\nThe UI is not well designed (yet?) and does not indicate well your reserves of ammo.\nEnemies\nHaving a few enemies be annoying is fine, but when the majority of your enemies are based around being annoying you have a problem.\nTiny enemies with tiny hit boxes moving around fast with inaccurate weapons = This is dumb, I'll play another game.\nUI\nI know, it is Early Access.  I get that.  I'm a game developer, I know what it is like.  That said, I'm also a gamer.\n\nI would not recommend you go into the inventory screen ("I" button).  The mouse moves so fast I can hardly find it and it almost always causes the game to do some of the weirdest glitching I've ever seen.\nThe UI does not well indicate the amount of information you need.  This was mentioned above as well.\nFinally...\nAny other problem I could mention with it is no big deal to me at the moment so I will leave it at that.  The bottom line here is that it is playable, but if you are short on cash I would wait.\n\nOne other thing to note is that while the game does support side by side 3D (Oculus Rift), the UI is NOT built for it and the guns float right in front of your face not only making you uncomfortable but also blocking much of your vision.  It is not playable with the Rift.","March 2, 2015","false","1.1"," 124 of 187 people (66%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","66","124","187","11","16"

I don't quite understand why, but it seems like the older you are the more likely you are to enjoy this game. Now to my original review...\n\nIt has come to my attention people are getting upset that I am a moderator on the forums for this game, friends with the developer, and have posted a review. I'm not trying to hide anything or trick anyone, people may not realize this but...\n\nIF YOU AREN'T GOING TO ENJOY THE GAME I DON'T WANT YOU TO BUY IT!!!\n\nSeriously.  I don't want people to spend their money on something they won't enjoy.  Even if you don't believe that, you can believe this. I don't want to have to deal with angry people being rude and disrespectful on the forums, people calling me names, telling me to "kill myself" in my review comments, and just the hatefulness in general.\n\nIn the end the game does better by ensuring only people who will enjoy the game and leave good reviews buy, because otherwise negativity chases players away who may have enjoyed it like I personally do. That is why I have posted gameplay videos that contains both features and bugs.\n\nYes, you heard that right, I don't edit out bugs or glitches, what you see is what you get. That way anyone watching can make up their own mind about whether the good outweighs the bad, and whether the game is for them or not.\n\nIf you read through all this, thank you.  It doesn't matter whether you ultimately decide to thumb it up or thumb down, you took the time to hear me out, and I really appreciate and respect that.\n\nEDIT: I have started a no commentary playthrough of the release version for you to get  a feel of the game without any outside influences, I hope this helps you decide if the game is for you or not.\nhttps://youtu.be/uA0fngw2ABI","October 28, 2014","true","85.6"," 44 of 70 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","44","70","3","23"

You can  play  on easy mode or crank up through normal to nightmare if you like a challenge.Its the same story but the harder modes come with more achievements.\n\nI personally don't think its for the faint hearted  and you do  have to apply  some grey matter to work out some of the codes required for unlocking doors or reaching objectives within the game in story mode.If you die however  don't worry you are re spawned in the last airlock you came through. If you've already taken  a beating  and are not happy you can just jump back there  anyway  without dying?The earlier versions could sometimes  give you  too much detail on some missions while leaving you to guess on others, but this has also  been improved.\n\nIf your not  too bothered  about story lines there may  be something to occupy you in  the other game modes , maybe something like onslaught , which gives you more of an in your face type of battle once the action begins.Challenge mode on the other hand  is more sustained  and requires a slightly different approach.With skirmish mode and simulation mode as well   there should be something to interest  most types of gamer.","May 31, 2015","true","154.3"," 29 of 47 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","29","47","0","0"

I keep telling everyone that branding this game as being bad does nothing, but people nowadays just hate to love and love to hate. This isn't just criticism; it's pessimism. Reviews and criticism in general have become more like a competition for most people. Rate the game as the worst one, and no one will want to buy it because they're stupid enough to believe anything. Either you play the game, or don't play it at all. Accept it the way it is, or bugger off! And if you don't want it to be stuck in your Steam account forever, watch the game on YouTube and other video sites before you buy it; but I guess people are just too worried about spoilers. What is there to spoil? The game is a different one every time you go to New Game. Just suck it up!\n\nOf course there are some people who think I'm being a f***ing idiot and don't know what I'm talking about, which is why I'm not getting a lot of support and why some would want to mark this review as funny. I support this game because it was a lot of work and dedication all done by one man. It took him nearly a decade to complete this game, and I'm in the starting stages of creating a game solo myself. If you discredit this game, you discredit the creator. I think there are just some people who don't appreciate the old-school genre of first person shooters, and I understand that there are a few bugs and glitches; but there really is no such thing as a game that is 100% flawless. Such a concept does not exist. For fifteen years, I have played hundreds of video games; and they are all made the way they are made.\n\nAlso, I argue about criticisms being nothing but competition because the total of reviews have been positive and then mixed, positive and then mixed, positive and then mixed, and so forth.\n\nThe one thing people should think about is the possibility of a sequel. After speaking with Shaun Williams last year, he said that there would be a CDF Ghostship 2 and 3 with Unreal Engine 4 if the sales are good. Whatever you all think he got wrong in this game, he could perfect in a future title.","May 29, 2015","true","6.7"," 54 of 97 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","54","97","7","12"

As it is now I just can't recommend it, there's comparably better titles at equal or less cost, and this one just fails to stand out.\nThe comparisons with System Shock and Dead Space are thoroughly undeserved, even if the game tries to ape them a bit in style it has none of the trappings that made the aforementioned games good, it just looks similar. Gunplay is not a fun affair as of now, and frankly, there's not much else this game has to offer. Even the random aspects don't do as much for replay value as they'd like you to believe, because let's face it, if two zombies or in fact two zombies and a bug spawn on you on a certain spot, who will notice all that much difference. This might need a bigger enemy variety or even a procedurally generated map like some other game about an actual ghost ship that comes to mind, has.\nAs far as I can tell, the title's biggest crime is its awful mediocrity. With the flood of abysmal content that plagues steam at this time, it is a good game in comparison. But put next to products of a quality that is considered standard these days? Not as much.\n\nBut don't listen to me, tune in to some unbiased gameplay footage first. *Cough*.. I went into it with very positive expectations actually.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyvEzALz17I","March 30, 2015","false","0.5"," 47 of 85 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","47","85","7","7"

I got this with its sequel bundled.  The opening was very indie, which is fine, but then once I got out of the ship and into the hangar, my controls started to spin.  I checked calibration on my controllers (which I had no intention of using) and my joystick and throttle and none of them were sending the input needed to cause this, nor were they in non-neutral positions.  After doing some enabling and disabling of devices, I found that if any controller that wasn't a GamePad was plugged in, the game would look to the left and up, and spin.\n\nWasted money, I'm not uninstalling my HOTAS setup just to play a budget game.\n\nFOLLOWUP REVIEW:\n\nAlright, I unplugged my controllers in order to be able to ensure the game got a proper review from me, as a matter of fairness.\n\nThis game is the labor of love of one person.  Just one, and with that considered, it's pretty impressive as an endeavor.  Unfortunately, it is the labor of love of one person.   Just one, and with that considered, it's understandable why this game is essentially stuck with its sequel in the cheap-games bin.  It's an admirable attempt, and better than other one-man shows (please observe Derek Smart's 3000AD games for details), but falls short of being a good game.\n\nFirst, lets address the issue tied to the review above; controls.  The controls in this game are just wonky.   Any control pad detected will be enabled, and cannot be disabled.  For those with more than a basic controller setup, this requires dismantling your rig a little in order to be able to play the game.  The official response from the developer (via the forums) to the problem is to unplug the USB devices that are controllers you don't want to use.  That's a Windows XP era problem that we shouldn't have now.\n\nOn the thread of controls, the controls in this game are a little odd.  You can't customize them mid-game; you must quit the game to its menu to change control assignments.   This is annoying, as it also deprives the player of quick reference keys for the controls.   Movement is slow, which makes sense (walking carefully with magnetized boots), but aim is weird.  The gun is held in a way that suggests you're holding it at face level, which makes aiming quite difficult against small targets.\n\nThe hitboxes make little sense.   Zombie crewmen die if you shoot anywhere near their head, but you can put 20 rounds into a small alien and still miss it.  There are a lot of "why is it not dead yet!!!" moments.\n\nThe last thing I want to address is the plot.  I was excited about this at first; a damaged hangar, then a couple of zombie crew in the hallway that looked more like mutations than proper zombies.  Just about anything could cause that.  This was like System Shock 1 when you wake up wondering why the medical equipment just tried to kill you, or Dead Space when you get chased down a hallway by the first bad guy.  Then there were eggs everywhere that looked like the egg pods from System Shock 2.  I dont' know what they do.  Then there were the aliens.  They're fast, small, and fragile, but the weapons provide enough difficulty aiming to make it possible to get hurt.  Easy stuff honestly, but at this point, I realized...I knew the plot.  The whole ship was infected with an alien bogeyman illness and it made zombies, and the aliens were there because enemy variety.   I finished the second mission, go talk to the AI in Operations, and sure enough, that's what she said.   Mystery solved.  From here on out, the game is DOOM Ultralite.  Fetch quest, unlock thingy, kill from point A to point B, unlock special prize lockers with passwords.\n\nThat's the real disappointment here.  The game comes off in advertising like a mystery needs solving, but the AI spoonfeeds it to you.  If you're looking for a game version of Event Horizon, where the plot is slowly revealed through discovery, this game isn't it. Even System Shock, which dumps the "SHODAN IS A ♥♥♥♥♥" plot on you in the first few rooms, leaves minor stories throughout that cover how that happened and the final moments of crew members.   Instead, the game favors an RNG for enemy spawns, which gives up control of a lot of plot elements.\n\nUnfortunately, this game is a reminder that an open world game with nothing but discoverables isn't really open-world; its a game where the developer didn't add a directional marker.  I saw no real motivation to move throughout the ship, and I found myself really bothered by the plot for a reason I couldn't put my finger on.  Then I realized it: the AI said that the player is the only uninfected person aboard the ship.  A Military ship, containing the "greatest threat" the in-game military had ever faced.    Which, according to the AI, is in a "decaying orbit" (a sci-fi BS term that means that the ship is brushing the atmosphere of a planet and is slowing down, which will cause it to fall.  FYI, that's not orbiting, that's crashing).  With a perfectly functional heavy fighter in the hangar.  A real military officer wouldn't be trying to solve a damn thing...they'd get in the fighter, get to a stable orbit, and watch the plague ship and all that it is carrying burn up in the atmosphere as a matter of containment. The very things they would not do are disable the lockdown on the ship, try to get it back online, and then try to fly it to Earth.  Guess what you do?\n\nBravo to the developer for all the work they did on their own, but the gaping plot hole, control difficulties, and some minor quality issues tied to being indie, I can't bring myself to recommend the game.  DOOM3 BFG Edition does it better, and is a AAA game that is not very expensive.","October 10, 2015","false","1.0"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","3"

The guns iron sights are inaccurate at best, but the worst thing about this game currently is the difficulty. Its not so much the amount of damage the enemies do but they move so fast they are hard to hit, and there hit boxes are weird, The worst part is the insect like enemies dive towards you, This gives you knock back, then they turn instantly and do the same to your back. This knocks you everywhere, which is frustrating and if there are more then 3, you are basically stun locked, and the enemies have even gotten stuck in my character model and repeatedly do damage. This would not be a problem, but it's happened a large number of times, not to mention the other bad bugs like, The mouse in inventory is hyper sensitive, and the camera has pop out of the character model a number of times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teddy2021/recommended/263640/","teddy2021","mmMmm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teddy2021/","317 products in account","Ok. So, I'm not sure whether to reccommend this game, so I'll give you my experience and you decide.\nStartup game, go straight to options to adjust it to my computer. Find that there is NO options aside for master volume for audio. Resign myself to this fact. Start game. Long opening (skippable), explaining the situation prior to the game. I presume this game takes place after the previous CDF game, of which I have not played. I then start the game, on my first playthrough I selected regular difficulty, and allowed game tips. Big mistake there, they throttle you like the gas pedal on a speed demons car. I then pick up the pistol as the ai commanded. Then I left the room. This took about half a minute...Then I got a minute of loading. Then on my first playthough I grabbed the weapon on the floor, as commanded the ai, killed some enemies, and explored. The second playthrough I did the same, minus the exploring, and went straight to the stairwell to proceed. This took about another minute to do. Then I was greeted by a loading screen. Load screen done, I entered the next area, killed some enemies with maximum difficulty because I COULDN'T SEE THEM! Not because it was too dark, but because as soon as they got line of sight, they decided to make sweet sweet love with my butthold, using their tentacles. After a firefight that lasted 10 times the length it should have. In the first playthough I explored the area, which took ten minutes, because I mistook a doorway blocked with boxes for a wall. The second one I went straight there. In the first playthrough I soon realized when I reached this area that the game uses MONO audio, or something equivical to it. This thoroughly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, because I couldn't tell where the EXTREMELY LOUD enemies were coming from, and it's not like a spent nearly $300.00 on a 7.1 surround headset to listen to audio that's quality lead to it's discontinuation in the 70's. I completed the objective, and proceeded back to the stairs, where I was greeted by another loading screen. On my second playthough this was 3 minutes after the most recent load screen. I then went down a floor, and was greeted by another loading screen half a minute later...I hadn't seen this many loading screens since half life. My first playthough didn't make it this far, as I'd lost patience by that point, so the rest is second playthough. The fourth loadscreen in 10 minutes of gameplay that I'd had by then out of the way, I proceeded to stand in a room listening to an ai tell me that I have to kill 3 people. I proceeded to find the first in the armoury on the same floor, and was greeted by him shooting me, and quoting the game over scene from the alien series. I then peeked from cover and shot at this man, who didn't move, nor APPEAR to return fire. I say appear because I was then instant killed despite no sign of shots fired.\nTo put it plainly, I am not mad...I'm just disappointed. I feel insulted by the quality of the game, which I can only assume was put out in one drunk lazy weekend. I feel plainly gouged by the price I paid for this game. I compare this to a game that I'd been playing along side it, Space Beast Terror Fright, which is a few dollars less, and a bit lighter on content, but in early access, and I feel it's a more complete game than this shambles of a mistake. I think I would like to take back what I said earlier about whether I reccommend this game. I don't. If it were free I'd say try it, but it's not, and it's overpriced for what it is. It's a steamy dump in a discarded paper cup that claims its coffee, and asks for $18.99. Don't buy it, it isn't good, and presumably will never be good.","November 22, 2015","false","0.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

I choosed most easy difficulty and turned game tips on. Anyway i am die too often in searching where i need to go. There is no actual map or journal and you will roam endless corridors trying to find that damn Cargo Hold! Why in that future that hero don't have any DataPad or personal PC or else to look at whole Ship's map to find out main locations? This is so unrealistic! Monsters will run at you in a huge masses and you will spend all you ammo on them without killing all of them (because they are made from very solid concrete - even small bugs and worms:). Even on most easy skill, even in almost very beginning of the game - YOU WILL DIE! Why in hell this game is so difficult? Why we can choose Easy skill? I think it is for whom who do not want to be in permanent dying from the beginning... Where is IMMERSION? Just imagine that you spent all of you ammo (and you collected a lot of new weapons and ammo before) but they are still alive and new ones are coming and coming in masses! But you don't have a melee weapons at all and you endless rifle recharges toooo slow. With what i must kill them? With bites and spits?:) You even can't do a kick/punch. Also you can't escape them because they are much faster than you and will corner you and eat you for 100500% Cool, yeah? Die most stupid way simulator ever made with most stupid but very quick and most tought monsters ever! Can it be more absurd?\nAlso you can't see any game options without complete exiting to the main menu. Resuming game will reload you last checkpoin instead of you last manual quicksave - very stupid, who will play the same parts if he already saved his further progress? Digital mastrubation? No crosshair at all in that complete darkness. Ok, maybe on higher skills and not in Easy too? And so and so... Nice concept, spooky atmosphere, cool graphics... But that ugly unbalanced gameplay kills all wishes to play further. If i will want some challenge - i will play System Schock 2 again, for example. That game is fair.\nNot recommend until complete rebalance will be made. Author killed his game himself. It should be very immersive atmospheric game. But when they begin to scream, run like flies around you and bites you to dead - no, it become deadly hillarious. Make "Easy" really easy for noobs/lazy ones like me. That will be fair. Do not spawn hordes of monsters in the very beginning - that ruin all immersion. Lower HP of some monsters which are looks like small bugs but can't be killed by whole clip. Make DataPad or make Journal/Tips little useful - at least on Easy again. Why you want me to be killed so fast and so ugly way? I feel myself cheated and injured... 3 from 10.\n\n\nP.S. Found solution to bring balance to this peace of code:\n\n*\SteamApps\common\CDFGhostship\Engine\Config\BaseInput.ini\n[Engine.Console]\nConsoleKey=Tilde\nin game press Tilde\ntype God\npress Enter\nBut this didn't helped to bring back interest to the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/likeucare/recommended/263640/","likeucare","LIKEUCARE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/likeucare/","1377 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhat is CDF Ghostship?\n\nIt is a mix between the good old System Shock 2, Dead Space, Doom and even at times, Alien: Isolation. As of now, you can only play as one character in the story mode until the marine releases down the line. So, you are a pilot that has boarded a ship where some nasties are running around, waiting to be exterminated!\n\nThe difference here from Ghostship Aftermath is you seem to be alone in this game, contrary to Aftermath where you could have directives from your partner then the AI or not at all! Well, maybe that changes later?\n\nAside of the story mode, the game offers an onslaught mode which can be appealing to horde mode lovers! The skirmish mode is fun but get's repetitive eventually! Challenge mode tests your skills in the game but I didn't liked that mode much, especially since the controls aren't that responsive in this game, just like the previous title Aftermath. When being stuck in items on the floor and hinders your movements, that irritates me A LOT!\n\nThe last game mode, simulation, is quite cool indeed. You get to explore the ship from a choice of fixed scenarios or you can simply roam the ship, map the areas in your mind. I was surprised to see a few enemies though!\n\nI'll sum up the pros and cons so you can get a better overview and decide for yourself whether or not to get this game.\n\n\nPROS:\n+Solid Atmosphere (similar to Ghostship Aftermath and also, reminds me of System Shock 2).\n+Various Game Modes (Story, Skirmish, Challenge, Onslaught and the best in my opinion; Exploration).\n+Decent Replayability.\n+Infinity ammo for some weapons but takes time to recharge.\n*On GhostShip Aftermath, the game offered different playthroughs but here in CDF Ghostship, the startup and miway through the story mode seemed to spawn the same elements around. Maybe it changes near the end or with the second character? Sadly, I can't put this on the PRO yet since that part is incomplete.\n+Predictable Story but how can you be original when something that has gone wrong in a ship or space station happens yet again?\n+Controls are improved from GhostShip Aftermath. Aiming works most of the time!\n\nCONS:\n-Price is steep for the game. I do recall buying it in December 2014 and the price was around 10$ but now, 22$ the game asks.\n-Many technical glitches. Granted the game is in BETA and Early Access so it can be understandable. It is more serviceable than GhostShip Aftermath though! But I keep getting stuck on ground items that hinders backtracking when enemies are rushing in my face. Very annoying!\n-The running speed is not long enough. Is your character in such a bad health or something? Can't run more than FIVE SECONDS?!? Weak!\n-Cannot remap or just see the controls while in pause? WHY!\n-Weak graphical settings (Limited graphical options. Only three resolutions available. No eye candy as you are used to in any modern games. Can't even change game settings when in-game.\n-Visually and animation speaking, it is very lackluster. I know this is a BETA INDIE game and its easy to pick negatively at the graphics. Still, I've seen indie games with better visuals and CDF Ghostship looks like it was made back in 2004.\n-Auto save only. Can't save the game manually.\n-Zombie/worm-slug-spider sound glitch that can still be heard after you killed the monster. Only way to make it stop was to quit and reload the game. (That was present on Aftermath and is occuring here as well). Very irritating!\n-Same enemies throughout the whole game. Same twitchy movements and even walk/crawl through walls.\n\n\nOVERALL:\nCDF Ghostship is a much more improved "GhostShip Aftermath". The game still has many faults but with its beta & early access phase, it can only improve upon before the full release. Like Aftermath, CDF has a good concept and some very good ideas. However, many things hold it back. It is still a commendable work the developer(s) [unsure if Shaun is alone in this or not like Aftermath] did on this project and hopefully the dev(s) can only improve before the full release.\n\nBiggest irritants to be fixed:\n-Glitches/bugs,\n-Controls,\n-Adding options in the pause menu,\n-Increase the running time,\n-Modern visuals.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nI recommend to wait on this title before the launch. With the inconsistencies, glitches and bugs, you would be better to wait until the game is out of early access at least. Besides, I find the 22$ price tag steep for what you get here. I'd say that my best recommendation would be to play System Shock 2 and/or Alien: Isolation until this game is ready.\n\nBut, you always get it now and see for yourself how the development progress though! I can honestly say that CDF is much improved from GhostShip Aftermath. So get CDF on a sale and give it a shot!\n\nRATING:\n6.0 / 10\n\nPS. Just like GhostShip Aftermath review, I do not own any VR equipment at the moment so I cannot comment on that matter here. HOWEVER, I imagine playing this game in Oculus should enhance the experience considerably.","February 17, 2015","true","0.9"," 20 of 49 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","20","49","0","5"

Key bindings  back then were  non  existant  and the game would be ok  provided  you were right handed .There was no inventory as such  and  Video resolutions  were as rare as hens teeth, while  the graphics  left some margins for improvements.\n\nSince its release into EA however the Dev has worked hard on the game and improved it with a steady stream of updates.We now have an inventory,bindable keys, many more resolutions and graphics that can be turned up or down according to your rig.The storyline  is now completed with three variations on the endings.You can play at your own level and pace with three difficulty levels ranging from Easy through normal to nightmare.The dev does not spoon feed you and finding information  to move  the game forward  requires  you to explore the ghostship seeking out clues, weapons and goodies.There to stop you doing this are a  raging bunch of  alien monsters and mutant infected crew members and you will certainly die a few times before getting into the swing of it.\n\nAlthough some of the battles can be very intense with seemingly endless streams of aliens  coming at you ,there is an auto  save point at the last airlock you passed through, in all the  difficulty modes.The few ideas that needed fleshing out a bit have now become completed versions  in Onslaught mode,Challenge mode,skirmish mode  and Simulation. All these modes have 4 or 5 variations within  each of them so there is plenty to get your teeth into  for the majority of gamers.I would  recommend this game to those that enjoy a challenge and having to use their powers of observation and deduction.

There's better games for less money.\n\nIt's a neat idea. Would love a AAA version of this game. (neat idea being the rogueliek aspects)\n\nThis game is a poor mans Doom 3. Poorly optimized and not very pretty, but it is indie.\n\n1st thing it is NOT realistic. Whoever wrote that in reviews needs to play better games.\n\n2nd thing it is kind edgy. You do get tense. I lasted maybe 15 minutes in my first run (i played it like any fps horror game conserve ammo and use the thing with recharging ammo.)\n\n3rd the enemies are a pain cause they are twitchy in a weird way (not a good way)  and its hard to hit them. But not for good reasons (i.e. they are sneaky or fast.) they are ahard to hit cause the gun fires wildly the sights are useless.  kneeling and aiming is useless. the blasts randomly go places and the enemies randomly bounce.\n\n\nPlayer Nakor has the best review of this game i will copy a couple of his points:\n\nShooting\n\nShooting can be painful.\n\nGuns that do not reload but recharge instead are nice, but there is no clear indication of this which can definitely be a problem in battle.\nHitting what you shoot at is often difficult because the enemy hit boxes are too small or oddly shaped, and the guns are horribly inaccurate.\nThe UI is not well designed (yet?) and does not indicate well your reserves of ammo.\n\nEnemies\n\nHaving a few enemies be annoying is fine, but when the majority of your enemies are based around being annoying you have a problem.\nTiny enemies with tiny hit boxes moving around fast with inaccurate weapons = This is dumb, I'll play another game.","February 5","false","2.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want a Doom game, get Doom 4 in a couple months from when I write this review.\n\nHowever, I do see that work went into it, and the voice actress did well for what was required from her, so good job on that. Good luck in the future, developers.","March 6","false","0.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
