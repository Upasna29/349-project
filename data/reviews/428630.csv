The type of game you would normally be able to get for free - and in fact, you can find a better version of almost this exact same game free of charge online. It's called "Phobia". The story, asset packs and the flow of stage transitions are almost identical except Phobia's scares are effective, it has actual puzzles and it features a runtime almost twice that of "White Mirror."\n\nThe problems in "White Mirror" are numerous. No options screen (in fact, the creator encourages you to edit the setup.ini file yourself), constant grammatical errors, frequent loading screen crashes, an exploitable, buggy enemy, a key with a timed spawn, nonsensical assets like a newspaper featuring a YouTuber and a nineteenth century "wanted" poster, and all sorts of other inconveniences. The game is only half an hour long, yet manages to overstay its welcome by the halfway point and even end abruptly after a rehashed "puzzle."\n\nWhile I can't recommend the game in any capacity, I can recommend two other things. First, that Steam take measures to end the positive-review spam that this developer has used on "White Mirror" and his previous two games. Second, the people who keep Greenlighting this dev's games need to take the hint already that the final product will be disappointing.\n\nOh, and the game's story is incomprehensible - mostly due to horrendous translation - and contains no mirrors. So there's that. Cheers!","February 1","false","0.9"," 51 of 56 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","51","56","8","0"

Game says it is a puzzler and the first puzzle is to get into the house.  Which a note tells you (in incredibly broken English) can only be opened with a key.  And then tells you where the key is.  You walk around the house, walk back to the fountain and there the key is, sitting in the basin of a fountain.  Of course, there's no real reason to actually look for it because as soon as you approach it a message on the screen says, "PRESS 'F' TO GET KEY".  Okay, so you grab it and continue around the house head down into the basement to turn on the generator and head around back into the house.  Walk in the house, go up to your room and cutscreen to the next night.\n\nWait, what?  Where all the puzzles?\n\nThere are in fact only about 3 puzzles in this game and those have to do with the creative combination of pressing, J K and H in an order which it isn't exactly hard to figure out.\n\nScary?  Well, maybe if you're three years old or if you have some kind of anxiety disorder and shouldn't play horror games.\n\nEven the words "Horror Game" are gross overstatement.  Though there are creaky sounds, you see a flash of a monster, and actualy encounter a monster later (hint -- run around it), the only horror here is how poorly the game designer slaughters the English language.  Here's a hint, guys -- this game ain't so big that you couldn't get some kid on the internet translate what you write into passable English, maybe cost you $5.  Hell, I would have done it for free.\n\nThe "climax" of the "game" is in the last area, down underground.  You walk into the area and in spooky red, splatter-like font in the center of the screen the word "RUN" appears.  So you run.  And you run.  And you run.  Up the stairs and then out of the house.  Game over.\n\nWait, what?\n\nTo call this a "game" is like calling a slingshot a "firearm".\n\nI kept waiting for the game and the horror to begin.  And then it was over.\n\nOnly thing I can conclude is that some dude was playing around and made a test run of a game, then decided to put it up on Steam because...I dunno, maybe he needed the fifty cents?\n\nWhat do I expect for $1.79?  I guess more than almost nothing.  I could buy a Coke zero with $1,79 and at least I could enjoy that twice -- going in and then coming out.\n","January 30","false","1.6"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","22","25","4","0"

It's a bad game, but I didn't find it dull. Some of the sound design was alright, but it's a short experience that doesn't use its cheap qualities well, has a few bugs, and turns out more silly than effective. It re-uses the same puzzle multiple times (and is the only puzzle in the game), there's maybe two encounters with anything threatning, and most of it is just walking around bland-looking environments while spooky sounds happen and you collect things. Still, could of been worse, found myself amused, and for $2 you could do a lot worse, even in the first-person indie horror game scene. Not recommended if you want a good game, and thus why I don't recommend it (much better alternatives), but in the end not offensively bad or anything, more... Silly-bad. Grammar and spelling mistakes up the wazoo, the whole game is about a cursed mirror and you never see the mirror... I don't strongly dislike it, it's not good, and I guess if you really want to experience it, then go for it. Just go in with the expectation that this isn't a good game, and you may have a little dumb fun with it.","February 29","false","4.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/428630/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","White Mirror is the third horror title from indie developer M. Yuriy. It centers around a relic hunter who has made it his current task to find a legendary mirror that holds the forces of good and evil. There is little in the way of storytelling throughout the game, save for the introduction and a few notes scattered about, all of which are marred by terrible translation.\n\nWhile this game was made in FPS Creator, the developer has done a great job in creating a creepy atmosphere. The game is dim, dark, and rustic, and the graphics are fairly pleasing to the eye. The soundtrack also keeps an air of tension about, even when there is no present danger. That being said, there's no real "horror" to experience except for one tiny jumpscare toward the end of the game, but the atmosphere keeps this title afloat. There are a few easy to solve puzzles throughout the short journey, and only one monster that rears its ugly head. This monster is met in the caves, and he's very easily glitched; he will get stuck in one spot, unable to move, leaving you free to bypass him without any hassle.\n\nSpeaking of glitches, the developer seems to have ironed out most of the concerning bugs that I witnessed in Let's Plays and read in prior reviews. I did not experience any crashing, or game breaking flaws. The game runs at a stable 80 FPS most of the time, however it does have problems rendering the water in the caves; dropping the framerates down to the 50s and 60s. Other than this, there's nothing particularly bad about White Mirror, nor is there anything resonantly good. It's just a run-of-the-mill average indie horror title that lasts 20 - 30 minutes at best. Recommended to wait for a sale, or purchase it in a bundle.\n\nRating: 3.0/5.0 - Average, can take it or leave it.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","April 15","true","0.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Not exactly "triumphantly" - that'd be a stretch - but I'm actually going to "recommend" this one, believe it or not.  Before your itchy fingers go hittin' that  "Add to Cart" button, however, allow me the benefit of a few small "disclaimers"...\n\nFirstly, no, I don't know the dev personally, and if I did I would have happily offered to translate all text in his game into English...something which Google has clearly failed to do on his behalf.  I actually suspect that one day I may in fact cave and offer my translating "skills" (i.e. I do actually speak English) to one of these Euro developers, but I think I'll save that for the day I find a genuinely talented one.  Yuriy Mamedov is not that developer - certainly not yet - and this is certainly not that game.  But one day, perhaps...\n\nSecondly, Steam DOES NOT HAVE A NEUTRAL BUTTON.  I seem to have confused punters more than once in the past by thumbing-up something which I seem quite critical and/or "meh" about, and this is simply because I figure a 5 or more out of ten has GOT to qualify as some kind of "pass"; and as this game is neither outrageously incompetent nor entirely unentertaining, I figure I'd give it a C-minus if I was a teacher.  Hence, a 5 out of 10.  Hence, a thumb-up rather than a thumb-down.  If you should have a problem with this ratings system I have employed, KINDLY GO EAT A ♥♥♥♥.  It's a reviewer's opinion, not a command from God.  Would you like me to WIPE YOUR ♥♥♥♥ for you, also?  Then again, if you've read this far into the review, I'm presuming you didn't just thumb my "positive" review down on sight, out of principle, and type some nonsense below about how I'm "obviously friends with the developer".  Steam users really do need to learn to READ reviews before jerking their knees as the first response.  Just because a reviewer gives a game a reluctant thumb-up DOES NOT mean that they believe said game to be the best ♥♥♥♥in' thing since sliced bread.  5/10 means just that...a pass.  BARELY.\n\nThirdly, Mr Mamedov, unlike a number of his peers, actually does show some vague and distant POTENTIAL.  I'm not saying he's come anywhere NEAR to that potential here...no sirree.  But at least he finally made a game which lasts for longer than twenty minutes - well, okay, about twenty-five, but that's still progress - and he has finally proven that he knows how to create a tiny bit of ATMOSPHERE.  His use of SOUND is especially commendable...he truly does know how to set up a smidgen of eeriness, and upon rare occasion even pays off said attempts at "suspense" with something resembling the aural equivalent of a bona fide "jump-scare".  He then, of course, proceeds to ♥♥♥♥ it all squarely in the ♥♥♥♥ by having some staggeringly lame "chase scene" where you stroll very briskly up a corridor while a monster who LOOKS like it's running full-pelt somehow never seems to catch up with you...but this is what the word "potential" is all about.  Mr Mamedov at least gets part-way there, and on this occasion, he's arguably gotten further than he ever has before.  If he would just stop asking money on Steam for short-as-♥♥♥♥ DEMOS, and devote five years of his life to making a substantially LONGER game combining all his strengths - while hopefully leaving out his myriad weaknesses - then we may actually have a contender for an honest-to-God, true-to-life VIDEO GAME DESIGNER.\n\nSeriously, at this rate, I reckon I'll be handing out a 5.5 to Yuriy's next game, and a 6 to the one after that...so we're only about five or six more "games" away from something a human being might actually want to PAY for.  Keep up the good work, Yuriy.  I, for one, believe in you.  The bits in the underwater caverns in this game are actually REALLY GOOD.  Atmospheric.  Spooky, even.  BRIEF, yeah, but...gettin' there.  VERY, VERY SLOWLY...but definitely gettin' there.\n\nSo the choice is yours, humble reader.  You can pay five bucks - less, on sale - for a twenty-five minute demo which would make a Mum proud, or you can spend your money on something else.  Personally, I've paid good money for much, much worse here on Steam in the past twelve months or so.  Hell, I even got a good chuckle out of the insanely bad A.I. which had the game's one-and-only "enemy" perpetually running at a whopping great iron fence in some misguided attempt to get at me...so I'm happy.  Oh, and we even get a sweet little carrot on a stick at the end, with those immortal words "To be continued" coming up on the screen.  I don't doubt it for a second, Yuriy, my friend.  I don't doubt it for a second.\n\nVerdict: 5/10.\n\n(PS Cheers for the free copy, Yuriy.  One thing, though...I haven't received that five hundred bucks in my account yet.  Any chance of speeding that up?  I have several hard-core, illicit DRUG HABITS to feed here, my man...cheers again.

The graphics weren’t that bad though, the writing wasn’t the easiest to read as it made no sense but you get the jist of what it meant. there were a couple of parts of this game that scared me *jumpscare like* overall didn’t really understand it. It crashed for me twice when i tried to go into the basement.. 3rd time lucky it loaded properly. Couple of times the game flickered too and i don't think that was deliberate..... But i would recommend if you want a silly game to play just for a laugh and if you’re willing to spend £1.59 then why not.\n","February 3","true","1.7"," 1 of 14 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","1","14","0","0"

No spoilers said - it keeps on edge all the time.\n4) Graphics is okay, not the best one for 2016 but You don't neet the best in that kind of a game.\n5) The price is more than OK.\n\nall things said, I'd recommend to purchase this game for one-time walkthrough, which worth the cost.\n\nnow, go find the mirror","February 4","true","9.7"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","2","17","0","0"

There was some light puzzling. The graphics were fine and it ran well on my laptop. The best thing about it was the sound design, which was really freaky and added to the atmosphere. One thing that was really nice was being able to press "M" at any time and see a list of your current objectives.\n\nThe negatives are the bad English translation, which isn't so bad that you don't know what to do or what is going on, and the length, which I guess is okay for the price. The monster is scary, but isn't hard to get away from. That could be either a positive or a negative depending on your preference.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's alright for a short first person horror, and I really enjoyed it.","January 27","true","0.9"," 4 of 24 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","4","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oveolegaben/recommended/428630/","Oveolegaben","Ove ole gaben","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oveolegaben/","450 products in account","About White Mirror: So this game starts out at the night, like the most horror genré type of games does, so not much to say there. The game has no options, so whenever you play you gotta learn to play with the settings you have, that might be annoying, but you get used to it fast, the game has some "puzzles" which is easy if you know just a bit about puzzles! Also the game has boring clouds, but you dont realize it if you dont look up at the very beginning, but if you are like me and loves to go into detailed things in video games, then you will realize what i mean.\n\nHints: You will be able to read some notes with some annoying and useless text, you just talk to a guy, he just tells you a little about what you are doing in the house, even though you MUST read them all to continue, you MUST remember to save the game you will get information about how to pause the game, if you forgot it, then click "F1", and remember it! You will need to start it all over again if you forget to save, and thats sad if you are close to the end and you get stuck or something else happens!\n\nControlls: So ingame you can run, which is normal in games, but you cannot jump which is pretty weird, but you dont really need it as much as i thought when i was playing the game, and you must hold "c" to crouch, and while you crouch you pretty much lay on the ground, i dont know why you need to crouch so deep.\n\nRECOMMENED?: Well for once in a horror game, i can recommend this game and actually hope we will be updated more for this game, and maybe add some more to the game, maybe make it a little more scary, and make the creatures ingame more scary and perhaps some more creppy sounds to them, even though i will say this! The game is worth the money, so if you wanna try a new horror game, then go ahead and play this.","January 29","true","1.3"," 1 of 18 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","1","18","0","0"
