I've spent quite a bit of time (and money) there, so naturally it holds a special place in my heart. While I can't say I'll be sad to see mountains of avatar-zombie-massage-dating advice-simulators disappear, there are numerous gems that should be preserved for future generations of games. For example: The XBLIG service is where developers like Mommy's Best Games got their start in game development. There are some other titles that are definitely worth looking into if you have an Xbox 360 (such as Protect Me Knight and Score Rush). In time, perhaps those games will appear on Steam as well.\n\nThe story behind Game Type has been told already, so I'll just offer my take on it. Microsoft's decision to bury XBLIG wasn't one of their better ideas. While it is arguable that the service wasn't much of a system-seller and offered a load of junk, "Hoodie Girl" was just mind-boggling. Every time I'd check the service to see what new games were released, I'd be greeted with that awkwardly-posed woman who had nothing to do with anything. I'm certain that Microsoft could have spared one or two people to do a better job of organizing and advertising everything. Oh well. At least we got a neat little game out of the debacle.\n\nSurprisingly, for the reasons why Game Type was made, I'm shocked that real effort was put into it. Everything about this game is a joke, but it's properly designed, contains numerous features we take for granted in modern shmups, and it's fun. You take control of the hoodie girl as she PARRRRK PARRKOUR PARRRRKOUR PARK PARKOURs her way through an infinite number of random creations. Apparently she's fighting against the Media Ball, a mock X360 that revels in its own ad-based absurdity. Unfortunately for her, this game is an infinite looper. In short, you can't win, but you're sure to take down thousands of football players, cats, crabs, cars, and giant cats. For this game, your attention-span is equal to how much hi-scores appeal to you.\n\nAs with any other shooter, you can expect to see lots of bullets, and Hoodie Girl is only killed when her heart-shaped hit-box is touched by something. The game is very easy to grasp. You shoot enemies to collect cash, use the powerful PARKOUR laser to destroy more enemies for more cash, and try to maintain a high multiplier for as long as possible. Every few stages the game loops, and after three loops you face CatChat (the aforementioned giant cat). On average, you'll survive 7 minutes per game. The strategy is in scoring as many points as you can, before things become too overwhelming for you. You're also given a limited number of time-stop-pulse-generators. These doohickeys slow time to a crawl, and your PARKOUR laser converts enemy bullets into money. Not only can you score a lot of extra cash, but when enough bullets are converted, you get another timer-freeze-object-blah. I honestly just played the game before writing this review and I already forgot what these gadgets are called.\n\nI appreciate the subtle yet important details in Game Type. Like some other horizontal shooters, whenever you move towards the top of the screen, the status window (score, # of lives, etc) fades away. You're also warned about off-screen enemies approaching from behind. These are nice features, but some developers don't include them, even the when they make "serious" games. Mommy's Best Games could have said "We made our statement. Who cares if the game functions that well." Instead they put in the extra 10% of effort, and I appreciate that.\n\nAll that said, Game Type is not a title I can highly recommend. I like it well enough. There's a good sense of progression, some depth, and the little touches bring everything together. However, it is extremely short - even by shmup standards - and doesn't have much in the way of content. You'll see everything there is to see within the first minute, and future loops are just more enemies, more bullets, and everything moves at a much faster pace. By itself, this game doesn't offer enough to justify the cost. My advice is to purchase the Mommy's Best package deal. Yes I know I'm saying "Why spend $3 when you can spend $8?" but you get three other good games alongside Game Type. On its own, this game doesn't really stand out, but it makes a nice bonus.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 12, 2015","true","3.0"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","25","30","4","1"

It's full of memes, cat pictures, and random sound effects but the shmup is solid.  I would and will play it again soon.\n\nI really think they could have tried a little bit harder overall, even in their mock menu they have a bunch of fake tiles to click on to make you think you are at an interface like the Xbox dashboard...  But many of the buttons are duplicated, there are different tabs with buttons on each but all four fake buttons on each page will show you the same couple-second-long animated gif.  It would have been so easy for them to include a few more gifs to make it actually interesting to go through them.  It just goes to show how little effort was put into the game overall.\n\nAlso there is only one game mode, Parkour, which is not parkour at all.  It's a shoot-em-up game.  The parkour part is the girl says "PARKOUR!" every time you shoot.  It gets annoying after about a minute.\n\nWith all of it's drawbacks, the gameplay is solid.  I had a lot of fun playing it and I wish they polished it up a bit.  I think the name of the game "Game Type", and the inclusion of a mock game store would have been a great opportunity to include more than one game mode.  They would have had a hit on their hands if they had 3-5 different game modes.  But what they ended up with is a relatively decent shmup.","January 24","true","2.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","1"

In this particular case, the target is Microsoft's infamous overhaul of the XBox 360's user interface, which plastered advertisements everywhere while making games, particularly indies, harder to find (grouping them, not coincidentally, under the heading "Game Type"). The official description even goes so far as to call itself "two games in one" - the first is a facsimile of the 360's dashboard where the "challenge" is to locate the second game, an infinitely looping, and rather loopy, side-scrolling shooter.\n\nTaking control of Hoodie Girl (a stock photo MS utilized to much-mocked effect), your job is to fight through waves of cats, cars, football players, doughnuts, and other frequent ad fodder; once you've made it through the sequence repeats, but your adversaries are faster, more aggressive, and more numerous than last time, and this goes on until you finally run out of lives. Your weaponry consists of a standard three-way shot, a slower, more powerful frontal "kick beam" (whose activation is punctuated by a stirring war cry of "PARKOUR!"), and a limited-use "time pulse" which temporarily slows things down while allowing you to transform enemy shots into point items (literally, piles of cash) - you'll want a constant flow of moolah to keep your multiplier up, so let off the fire button from time to time to attract all onscreen items to you.\n\nThat basically covers all there is to playing the game, which, it should be noted, was originally created within the span of a week - as such, there is only a single background and a few enemy types, whose animations range from "sparse" to "non-existant". That said, the bizarre, slapped-together look actually suits the theme rather well, and while the lone music track is somewhat anonymous the goofy sound effects pick up a lot of the slack on the audio end. Moreover, the developer has made both your character's hitbox and enemy shots easier to see than they were in the XBLIG release, which is quite nice considering how fast and chaotic things can become in short order.\n\nSo there you have it - a game whose scope could be described as both "limited" and "focused", having been brought into existence practically overnight and for a very specific purpose but managing to be rather fun in spite of its inherent shortcomings. If you're that hesitant to drop the three bucks (two, if you go for the "Mommy's Best Pack" which includes three other games), Game Type (and its free demo) should still be up on the XBLIG store for your perusal, at least until MS closes it a year or so from the time of this writing - in my heart of hearts, though, I'm tempted to recommend you snag this title just to do your part to ensure that small-but-vocal developers like Mommy's Best Games can keep doing what they're doing.","October 7, 2015","true","1.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","1"

Mommy's Best games were (as I understand it) a bunch of scrubby punks who made some surprisingly decent games in the Xbox 360's proprietary indie game framework, and this is their God Save the Queen. Game Type is dated, crude, short, and angry. It  reminds us of the time a multi-billion dollar software corporation sold out.","November 27, 2015","true","3.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/373630/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Game Type is a horizontal Shmup where we play as some girl facing off against cats, Honda Civics and giant crabs. Why? Because why not seems to be this title's philosophy as you are suddenly faced with a poor copy of the Xbox 360's interface upon loading up the game. You must navigate these (fake) ad filled menus in order to find the actual game itself which may be a bit difficult if you've never used a 360 before but luckily you can simply press the H key for a red arrow to guide you to your destination. Most of the fake ads do nothing if you click on them though I must admit I had a chuckle at the Uface “Your privacy matters... to you.” quip in an ad. Real Xbox Live Indie games like Soulcaster and Escape Goat are also advertised ironically enough considering they were just making fun of advertisements.\n\nThat Xbox Dashboard parody is the only joke in this title. While one may expect more jokes from this type of tongue in cheek title but that is not really the case. Upon entering the actual game you will be faced with really random enemies in a bland never changing background. The only enemy that can maybe be considered funny is the cats but everything else is just plain weird, though not in a funny kind of way. We have two forms of attacks at our disposal, one is a narrow shot that fires in 3 separate directions and a wide beam kick that causes far more damage to anything in your path. The narrow shot is pretty weak and will mostly be used when an enemy is right above or below you and you can't position yourself to fire the kick beam.\n\nThe kick beam is not infinite however, it runs on a bar that can only be refilled when you collect more money. Money is dropped when you destroy an enemy and will automatically be drawn to you if you stop firing even for a fraction of a second. That magnetism is a really handy feature as the screen is nearly always chock full of enemies and I could have seen it being a real issue if you had to chase after that cash only to crash right into an enemy. There is a multiplier meter that is filled up when collecting cash so it may be wise to manage exactly when you should pick up money if you care about high-scores. If you don't then feel free to pick it up whenever you please as you do not get more lives or power-ups from reaching a certain score but by completing a wave.\n\nWaves are exactly what they sound like and every time you complete one the game gets faster and more enemies will appear on screen. You will face off against the same giant cat boss every 4 rounds who gets harder and harder to defeat as the game goes on. Your activatable power-up allows you to slow down time and makes money drops more likely. It can be pretty useful as at times the enemies feel a tad bit too bullet spongy and numerous for your firepower to be able to dispose of them quickly enough. Game Type may be a joke title but it is no easy game and quickly gets serious as soon as you reach the 5th wave. Tons of enemies will approach you from all sides of the screens so not really a title that is going to ease someone new to the genre into the gist of things. I was honestly not expecting it to be a good shmup, much less a fun one but there you have it.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the gameplay is weighed down heavily by pretty much everything else that makes a game from the sound effects to the art. I couldn't care less about the graphics of the game but art is another matter. Everything is extremely bland looking with no good attributes to it. Same single bland background, same few bland enemies and nothing to break that monotony causes you to get tired of the game before long. The HUD transparency effect is a great feature so you don't lose sight of your character when you reach the top of the screen however.  The music is horrid and makes me want to bury my face in my hands and contemplate what I'm doing with my life.\n\nDon't get me started on how our character shouts “Parkour” every-time she fires her beam attack, that word is going to haunt me for a while. So bad art, bad music and little content yet good gameplay can indeed be worthwhile but I'm afraid that's not the case here. In my opinion the asking price is a bit much for what this is and I was dead tired of this title after half an hour. Game Type was a joke title that could have been good yet its very tongue in cheek nature of appearing not to give a toss backfired on it. Still if you get this from a bundle or if a friend randomly gifts it to you thinking it is garbage it's well worth booting up... as long as you mute your speakers before you cringe every-time someone says parkour in the future.","June 3","false","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"
