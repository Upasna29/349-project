It has three classes to choose from and a wide weapon selection from each as well as three different weapon slots to select and "Switch em up" while in game. There is so many changes from the original ballistic game we all came to love and know - but that doesn't mean the game will be changed too much for the worst.\n\nThe pros:\n- Lovely visuals\n- Customization of settings\n- Variety of weapons\n- Excellent developer support\n- Balanced maps\n- Ability to create your own match, open or private\n\nThe cons:\n- Laggy servers\n- Connectivity issues\n- OP grenades\n- Enemy team has the ability to kill in spawn (Even with the separate team guards)\n- Matches (especially King of the hill) do not seem long enough\n- No exp earned at the end of a match - Reason I put this, we're testing a game, you'd want us to be able to rank up and test out all the bugs from each rank up.\n\nAll of the cons are an easy fix through a few or several updates. As this is only early access, we can expect the game to go far in the future. I'm looking forward to the turn out of this game.","October 9, 2015","true","3.3"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","34","42","6","0"

More classes and weapons will only enrich this meta.\nLooks good for the price.\nRuns well once in-game.\nConsVery crude experience: both finding and creating a match is kinda hard and fiddly.\nHost-based servers: this means if the host leaves, everyone drops from the game.\nShort version:This is a rough gem that needs a lot of polishment. The ideas and content on the forum and promised features do point towards a great game, but onloy for those that wish to be involved in it.\n\nGET THIS GAME!!! --> If you want to participate as the game grows:\n\nDON'T GET THIS GAME --> If you want a fully functional and polished game: Wait until the final release =)\n\n\nLong versionI've played this game in its previous incarnation as a f2p service, and here is what I have to say about the Early Access opening.\n\nI recommend this game at this pont only for people who want to actively participate in its development. The game right now has some serious issues that I'll outline below, but it does have a lot going for it with a wealth of content to come. For those of us that participated in the alpha and beta stages of the f2p incarnation, it's the very same problems back again: hard to find matches and a crude user interface/HUD.\n\nWhile getting a game going is a pain, once you get in a match, however, I've found that my experience is smooth. I have found little LAG and the lack of feedback/HUD polishment is expected for this early release.\n\nContent-wise, the three available classes seem to cover everything from close-range brawlers to mid-range fighters and long-range assassins. The skill trees are interesting to play with, but its too soon to know if anything seems unbalanced. The weapons appear to function properly and sound and look good, just as do the new levels.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope the devs will fix these issues soon.","October 8, 2015","true","0.5"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","31","37","2","1"

It's very fast paced and has close quarted combat. And the level design reminds me of CoD4. A great start for an Early Access game! Here's a list of pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n+Shiny and cartoonish visuals (I love realistic cartoon graphics)\n+Decent map design\n+Good firing sounds\n+HUD and menu is pretty good for a game this early\n+Optimized for integrated GPUs\n+Only $6.99\n+It's fun\n\nCons:\n-Weapon models are too big (I mean they're too close to the camera) and pretty bland looking\n-There should be a back button on the setting menu so if you accidently open it you don't have to confirm your changes every time\n-Shouldn't show the scoreboard when you die\n-Not that many players (Game needs more publicitiy somehow)\n-Shouldn't have to choose your class everytime you die, instead make it like TF2 where you press a certain button with a class specific menu\n-For some reason on the controls menu the text for knife isn't there\n-If you're in the menu and you die, it'll take you off the menu and show the person who killed you which is kind of annoying\n-The chat has some issues and gets in the way of the game. (For example, you have to erase the filler text "Type here..." or else it will make it into your message)\n-Ragdolls and player animations are kind of clunky\n\nSome suggestions:\n=A Call of Duty style killcam would be cool since it's better than watching the person who killed you walk around\n=The picture of the class that you're using in the health HUD is kida weird and it should be a cross or something like that\n=Linux support (I know not that many people are on Linux, but it never hurts)\n=Achievements\n\nAs of now, it's a great Early Access title and it's a lot of fun for a small price. I hope the devs can fix the issues I listed and you should consider getting it.","October 18, 2015","true","3.6"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","2"

You have more options when hosting a dedicated server and in the future there will be further lobby customization.\nCons:\nNo official servers. All servers are currently player hosted (Aquiris is currently looking into official servers). This means you may have difficulty finding a match in which you have good latency but you can always host one very easily.\nIn Early Access the community is not large\nGame balance is still in progress\nNo progression yet\nNew players and experienced players are not separated as there are no official servers yet (still there are private servers you can easily make)\nThe future of this game is very bright, with a huge amount of content coming. I have a lot of confidence in the development studio Aquiris. They are an amazing company, “one of the Top 5 best Unity developers in the world” according to Unity Technologies, and are very involved with the community.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabepwn/recommended/296300/","gabepwn","GABE_PWN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabepwn/","32 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThere was once a browser game called Ballistic, and it was absolutely phenomenal for a browser game. I know it doesn't sound impressive to be the best browser game around, but it was  really  good. Probably better than many of the games currently on Steam, but that isn't exactly an achievement either. I logged many hours in that game (I know, what a casual scrub) until Aquiris, the developer, took down the browser game and put a more polished version on Steam.\n\nThis game brings back so many memories and nostalgia,  yet the game feels somewhat different. It's like Aquiris kept all the parts of Ballistic that I liked, but removed the bad parts. It keeps most of the game mechanics, so on the most basic gameplay level, it feels the same. I was always a fan of how while anyone can pick up this game and have a good time, the skill ceiling is also very high, and it's possible to become very good at this game. There are classes, and each has unique weapons and skills. Players can gain an edge by playing to the advantages and disadvantages of a certain class. It is easy to pick up a class, but it is much harder to truly master it, just like in the old game. Even the best players can always improve, making for a game that can be very competitive if that is your thing. This competitive nature is further reinforced by the fact that all weapons and skills are available immediately for all players, and that Aquiris has removed the microtransactions and pay-to-win aspect that haunted the original game. Immediately, new players are presented with a level playing field, and do not have to deal with more experienced enemies toting massively overpowered weapons.\n\nThis game isn't 100% perfect, and there are some balance issues. Just like the original game, spawn camping is a major issue, and it is sometimes impossible to get out of spawn without being killed by the entire enemy team waiting to kill you. Thankfully, a small area of spawn is protected, but Aquiris should really do more about it. In addition, some weapons are ridiculously unbalanced, such as the grenade launcher. It doesn't really take skill to get kills: just spam grenades in the general direction of the enemy and profit. It should really be nerfed so that it rewards practice and skill.\n\nDespite a few issues, Ballistic Overkill is a very enjoyable but difficult game. Unfortunately, not many people play this game. There are usually a few populated servers with some very dedicated players. Sadly, this game is far too overlooked. It deserves more players.","April 7","true","9.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","3"

It's a bit disappointing since people expected at least a playable version since the devs started focusing on the graphics part of the game. They should've worked on fixing the bugs first before enhancing the graphics to unity 5.

The community is VERY small, I've only found around 6-8 lobbies in total, most of which I'm guessing are in the U.S or in the E.U, thought I wouldn't consider that a problem, unless you're playing from asia.

When you download this game(While it is still in early access) do not expect a pollished game. Though the lighting looks wonderful, and the guns feel very smooth. Looks like all the time was put into the gameplay. Which, honestly is why we're all here. The home menu has no sound, which I admit is really uncomfortable and unpleasent. Currently the in game sounds could be a little more full sounding or have more depth. Regardless I highly reccommend this game, I have had more fun with the short amount of time I spent on this one than the free to play one. Though I do hope they add gun levels, which simply would unlock skins, it would give us some more to do. If you enjoy First person shooters, play this one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LongHardPencil/recommended/296300/","LongHardPencil","bottomcock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LongHardPencil/","25 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBefore getting into the review, not that this was written on May 13th of 2016. By the time you read this, many of the problems I lay out here will most likely be fixed.\n\nBallistic Overkill is a run-and-gun type FPS, with little focus on objectives or team play. If you are interested in a game with complex strategy and cooperation, this is not what you are looking for. The game is made to be a very simple and easy shooter to pick up, and it does that really well. Although the game excels at what it is aimed at, there are multiple issues, that if fixed, would make the game much more enjoyable. However, I'll talk about the positives of this game first.\n\n-Graphics: For an eight dollar shooter, this game is absolutely beautiful. As many of you know, this game was the best-looking browser game out there. In Overkill, they have further improved the graphics, making it look even better. All of the maps are very bright, making it easy to spot out opponents and have an easy time making it around the map. The textures are very good, but the game has a cartoony graphics stlye at the same time. The lighting is also very good, with cool reflections and a warm glow. Also, the FOV slider is an amazing touch, and I absolutely love how the game looks when it is set to max.\n\n-Optimization: On both of my systems, I have had absolutely no issues with framerate. The game runs perfectly, and I have never had to deal with stuttering, freezing, or frame drops. The game runs very smoothly for how good it looks.\n\n-Classes: This game has multiple classes to choose from, each suited for a unique playing style. It includes everything from a sniper to a ninja to a  grenadier. All of the classes can also be further customized by choosing skills that are uniqe to each class. Every class also has skills by default. For example, one class might have 20% extra sprint speed, while another would have 15% reduced recoil. As I said, you can also add customizable skills from the character customization menu.\n\n-Developers: I am presently surprised by how the developers respond to issues in this game compared to the browser version. They even have a webpage where users can submit propsed changes that can be voted on by others and given feedback. So far, many problems the community complained about have been fixed.\n\n-Community: This is where Overkill has a definite advantage over the browser version. Unlike the browser version, that chat isn't a constant spamming of "lixo" "noob" "omg why" and similar comments. Also, nearly all of the players have respect for one another and don't use rude tactics (nade spamming, blatant spawn camping, etc.)\n\n-Balance: This is arguably the largest problem with the browser version. There, snipers had crosshairs with perfect accuracy, there were LMG's with no recoil and a three shot kill, and it took hours upon hours of grinding to earn guns that would enable you to compete with more experienced players. This game gets rid of that system entirely, and instead lets you choose any gun in the game from the very start. This makes the game much more focused on skill, rather than who had the most overpowered gun. Snipers and other overpowered weapons have been severely nerfed, and the guns are fairly balanced. Also, they got rid of the gun tier system, so choosing any gun won't put you at a severe advantage or disadvantage.\n\nNow to some problems. Again, many of these issues will have been fixed by the time you read this review.\n\n-Playerbase: There are simply not enough people playing the game at one time to make it perfectly enjoyable. Oftentimes, there is no server that has a full fifteen or sixteen players. When there is one, it is often very far away from you, and you get pings in the hundreds or even thousands.\n\n-Guns: For a simple run-and-gun shooter like this, good-feeling guns are essential. Currently, that is not the case, at least with most weapons. The main problem is that most simply don't have enough recoil, and it ends up feeling like a laser gun from CoD except with bullets. This is something that is being improved on right now though, so it shouldn't be a problem for long.\n\n-Connection/Ping: This is very related to my point about the playerbase. Because there is nearly no one playing, the closest server to you might have you playing on 200, 500, 1000 ping. This is very annoying, as playing on 1000 ping is nearly impossible. At the moment, adding an offline bots mode would be an amazing alternative.\n\n-Lack of dedicated servers: Again, this is directly connected with the ping issue. Once they get servers up, it will make the game a lot more fun.\n\n-Grenadiers: This is something that many will disagree on, but I am one of the people who hate the grenadier class. In my opinion, it takes away from the skill in the game and discourages aim and technique. Many grenadiers will sit right outside of their spawn and spam a common entrance. This disrupts the flow of the game and often replaces true gun battles, which is very annoying. The way grenades work in this game makes them a replacement for gun battles in so many cases, just because they are so good. Many players that are using weapons will simply back off and throw a nade at you becuase it has such a good chance of killing you.\n\nIn conclusion, Ballistic Overkill is a simple but good shooter that needs basic improvements to become great.\n\n","May 13","true","15.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

It's insane, busy, fast paced, and action packed. Now, normally I don't like fast paced shooters, mostly because I can't keep up and I don't have enough time to play the way I want, but this is totally different. It does fast paced in a way that's fun, and tactical. Each class has it's own unique set of weapons, and there are classes that fight and go against other classes. For example, if you've got an army of people holding a certain area, and you want to counter that, there's a class with auto-pistols, and you can turn invisible to easily run past enemy lines. The only real downside to this game is that it can be hard to find a server sometimes, as it's all player hosted, no dedicated servers. I'd also love to see weapon customization, weapon skins, and more player customization in this game. Not to mention, a campaign. I LOVE to see a campaign for this game, and learn about the lore.\n\nIn short:\n\nShould you get this game? ♥♥♥♥. Yes.\n\nIs this a fun game? Damn right it is.\n\nIs this a balanced game? For the most part, yes.\n\nIs it 100% solid, and complete? No, there's plenty of room to improve, and there's plenty that can be added, but even with that being said, it's still a wonderful game.","May 21","true","8.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Im from north america. so most of the time i find that there is nothing but Asia, South America, and Europe servers... that means im logging out of the game, since chances are my ping to those servers is around 500.\n6. spawn shields. this was a HUGE problem during the web version. once they opened the steam version of this game they had removed the spawn shield ability (which was good). but they just added it back since idiots started complaining. and what it did was bring back the same annoyances that the web version had. too many noobs abusing the spawn shield, popping in and out tossing nades and trying to pull off a quick headshot before popping back inside the spawn shield. its a terrible thing to have in the game and the way it originally was is FAR better. what i suggest to do to address this issue is to either add a 15 second timer to return to base after u exit it, or to reinstate the way it was when the game was just released. but create barrier walls inside each spawn so people cant shoot through that wall and people cant shoot out. but the enemy team cant enter past the shield.\n\ni know i have more pros and cons but i cant think of them right now. this, however, are just my thoughts on the current state of the game and r no reflection on what the game may become in the near future. so take this all with a grain of salt.\n\nof course, there r more cons than pros right now. but, as u can see, im still recommending this game. im only recommending it because i know what this game can become. it has a ton of potential and can be something well worth the $6 price tag. not to mention, the devs r very active and listen to what the community suggest and requests be added or fixed.\n\nthanks :)","October 18, 2015","true","74.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

Compare that to the newest addition to the CoD franchise, Black Ops III, for $60. Now, lets look a bit further into it. CoD has been recycled over and over again, offering nothing new. Ballsitic Overkill is fresh, exciting and, most importantly, new. It is being rebuilt from the groud up, so you can expect some issues.\nLag & Latency issues are the biggest thing that drive people away. But, you have to understand, the game is being completely redone. With each update, patch, and hotfix, the game gets better and better, being able to handle more than before. With each update, the lag is decreased, and will be gone soon.\nThe game is updated almost once a week, or, maybe a little bit more spaced out than that.\nRight now, the game is at it's cores, so if you get Ballistic now, you can expect fresh and new things to do, from exploring new maps, using new classes, to creating fun game modes in your very own dedicated server.\nAll in all, Ballistic is still an amazing game. Yes, you can expect a few small issues here and there. But nothing so major that it will effect your gaming experience.\nGet the game, and join us in combat!

You can play in various modes like FFA or Team Deathmatch on maps that have a size that ensures almost instant gunfights. There's no downtime here, you spawn instantly and run a short distance to get back into the action. There are no support classes here, it's all about taking out the enemies. It's simple and it works well. At the low price point I think it's worth it if you enjoy FPS games. As this is an online PVP experience the fun to be had here depends on how many players keep playing the game in the future.

I've had a change of heart!? Its playable again! But lets start with what IS Ballistic Overkill? Put simply it's a FPS that 1st made a big splash on FB as a browser game, and it seemed to have impressed the many fans which fragged daily.\n\nOn the PC as a fully downloadable game currently in EA, it seems to be, a fresh start and built up from the ground up. Its dropped the F2P tag for a price tag. Limited by 3 maps and 3 modes pretty standard stuff so far. Skills, classes and loadouts that will suit, including sniper scum. The important ethos is a game based on fast fun. Early days on BO of course, still the ground work impresses me.","October 13, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It was super addicting on the web, but it was a pay to win (I admit, I spent money on the web version. Lots. I'm guessing around $90-$100). I got the game for free since I spent all that money on it, and was excited to jump in. Now I didn't expect a perfect game since it was under development, but it was almost unplayable. The menu screen was verry buggy, and there was a lot of frequent crashes along with performance issues.  I can see so much potential for this game, and I'll stick with it through development. I'm not going to recommend this game for now, but untill the game is playable, I'm just going to wait.","October 23, 2015","false","25.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Is it a revolutionary arena shooter? No. But for 6.99$ did you really expect as much? Now, I really would like to add more time to my review, but as it stands, there is one aspect that just makes playing matches too hard currently.\n\nThe make or break issue for Ballistic, at least in my case, was the networking. This is the reason I decided to go negative. Ballistic Overkill has a lot in common with Call of Duty. In that it's relatively fast paced arena shooter and the time to kill can be relatively low. You can find yourself getting one shotted at point blank with a sniper or even a shotgun. Why is that relavent you may ask?\n\nThere are no dedicated servers. You get a p2p connection with the host of the game. And there doesn't seem to be any lag compensation to make up for that fact like there is with the old Call of Duty games. What this means is in those moments where you meet someone around a corner and both of you are capable of killing each other almost instantly. The person with the better ping to the host will almost always win. You'll die putting buckshot into someone and end up not even getting a hit marker before you die. That puts a pretty large advantage on where the game host is located.\n\nNow, I personally haven't dealt with a p2p connection based shooter in half a decade, not unless you count Black Ops 2, which used a hybrid of p2p connections and listening servers. So I have to say I'm not sure whether that was my problem or not, but generally I experienced higher pings then what I'm used to in other games, like TF2 or CS:GO. Part of my problem is I just don't have enough information. Thankfully, the developers recently gave us the ability to see what general area the host is located in. But, the issue with this is that it's still too vague. You know you're playing with someone in North America or Europe now, you just don't know what state, province, or city they are located in. Do you live Kentucky? Good for you! The host could be living in Quebec for all you know. And if you're wondering where Quebec is, it's on the edge of the East coast of Canada. This is the reason I can't tell whether the game's networking coding is the problem for my generally higher ping, or if the hosts are located in more remote areas of North America then I am used too dealing with.\n\nIn short, unless you plan to be the host every single time you're playing the game, prepare to lose some gunfights left and right, and not of your own accord either. And if you are host, you should also learn to accept your winning might be due to the crutch that is the latency advantage rather then the other guy just being a noob who likes standing there and eating your lead.","October 14, 2015","false","5.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

However, now that i've finally purchased the game, i love it. Its well worth the $7 because this game is no longer Pay To Win. You start with all classes (2 still haven't been added yet) and all of the weapons are available immeadietly. This means no more long, painful grinds to get 1 class or gun then find out you need to pay IRL money to keep the gun.  Though it may seems dead at times, when you find a match (i reccomend quick match because that puts you in matches with other players) you're gonna have a lot of fun. All classes are quite balanced and each one is a signifigant threat to another. There really is no OP or UP class/weapon, as everything has it's own unique advantage. This game is WELL worth the $7 because those $7 is less than buying all of the stuff in the browser game would've cost BY A LONG SHOT.","March 27","true","4.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Well, take everything that made the game fun then, buff the graphics out a little bit, and take away any polish the gameplay had before it was moved to steam.\n\nThis game has quite a few issues, and very few positive additions. I bought this game expecting something... what that something was... nostalgia? Who knows, but this game is not very fun to play.\n\nPros:\n\nClasses-\nBallistic Overkill brings back only a few of the classes (from what I can tell when first starting) and allows you to tweak their loadouts and skills immediately. From the main menu, you can look through the Vanguard, Berserker, and Wraith character classes, and choose what type of weapons and skills they start with.\n\nSkills-\nIn terms of skills, you no longer need to grind out the game and level up in order to gain as many skill points as are needed to upgrade through the two individual skill trees. You start with a base of 20 skill points. Whether or not you can earn more skill points while playing the game for longer periods of time, is unknown to me.\n\nWeapons-\nThe weapons in this game have been redone in the sense that you can now select any of the available class specific weapons at any time. I thought this was a much better idea compared to what was originally intended in the free to play model (you needed to either grind out your character and earn an in game currency to buy additional weapons, or you could spend real money in order to quickly acquire the weapons you wanted) since players like myself and many others hate microtransactions (yes, I understand why they do this in F2P models). You can select between different assault rifles, submachine guns, sniper rifles, and sidearms.\n\nGraphics-\nThe graphics look much better in this version of the game than it did when it was still playable in a browser, The maps and weapon models actually look decent/quite good and I honestly believe that this game should have been a full retail release rather than a browser game.\n\nCons:\n\nF2P w/ MT's to Full Steam Release-\nNow, because this game used to be a free to play model, the mechanics worked in a certain way that was very fitting, but now that you have to pay for it on steam with some of the main components taken out, it really struggles to shine through as a diamond in the rough, rather than being just another boring rock.\n\nLack of Rewarding Gameplay/Microtransactions-\nBecause you have all of the weapons unlocked from the beginning, there is no incentive to grind the game or casually play it for unlocks. It's great that there aren't any more microtransactions, but it isn't saying much when the only thing that you do is run, jump and shoot.\n\nGamemodes-\nHow is this different from most modern shooters, you ask? Well, if I recall, there were only two game modes in the broswer version of the game, and the same applies for this version. You have Team Deathmatch or a Domination style game mode where there are three capture points that can be taken to gain score over the enemy team. The more capture spots you have, you more points you earn towards winning. This isn't necessarily bad, but it seems boring to only have these two game modes, with nothing else to choose from, and Ballistic Overkill doesn't do much of anything to spice it up.\n\nClass Limitation-\nOriginally, this game has additional characters to select, but I'm not quite sure if you have to work for them as intended, just like with the weapons, or if they haven't fully been added into the game. The only three classes you can play as are the three that I mentioned previously.\n\nPlayer Models/Clipping-\nAlthough the graphics do look nicer, I have seen player models clipping through the walls due and players who have invested their skills in movement speed clip through the map, other player models, and other items throughout the map. In regards to this, I have also seen a few hackers in the game already, which makes it even more frustrating to see them with higher movement speed that is unattainable, and makes the death that much more bitter.\n\nSpawns-\nPlayer spawns are just as bad as before. The original maps have come back, and nothing has been done to modify them (other than graphically) or make them more suitable and comfortable to play on. I can't recall how many times I have just waited in front of the enemy spawn and shot down enemy players as soon as they come out. On a few of the maps, the spawns are too close, but it doesn't take away from the fact that players spawn in the same area every time after they die, allowing enemies to gather around the "forcefields" and waiting for them to come out so they can be one tapped. There have been multiple times where it has happened to myself, and gets increasingly frustrating every time, especially when your team isn't even trying to take them out, but rather run into their spawn and do the same.\n\nSprint Key?-\nDoes the sprint key do anything other than activate your skills? Your character walks at a snails slowly, but when you hold down the sprint key, it seems like it doesn't change at all half the time. The only noticable difference is if you select a different class where your skills somehow boost your overall movement speed.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are many more issues that I could talk about, and probably others that I could find, but I'm not willing to put more hours into this game, and I can assure you, it isn't even worth the $7.00 USD. Most of the other people who have left reviews on this game seem to feel like this game is better than before, but I really don't see any improvement at all. If anything it feels like it has taken a step back. There are so many things that are generic and bland about this game, anything from design choice, to gameplay mechanics (if some of you think that the devs of this game have added amazing and refreshing gameplay mechanics that aren't taken directly from a Triple A title, than I believe you may have some brain damage) that make it annoying to play.\n\nPlayer Base-\nThere used to be a steady fan base playing this game (There weren't that many people playing this game before, but at least the servers were populated and you could find players either leaving and rejoining matches, or you would be put into a match as soon as you searched) and it seems like this has changed durastically. I believe when I was playing, I had only seen 3 available servers.\n\n\nTLDR; I understand that this game is early access. There is a reason why there is a bold headline stating such before you purchase a game such as this, but there are quite a few issues that I feel shouldn't even be in this version of the game. The developers couldn't keep the game alive on browsers because they were ending support of the Unity Engine. If there were any way to get my message across, or actually talk to the developers on ideas, or how to make the game better, I would do so in a heart beat. This game was a lot of fun to play, even when it was just in a browser, which was really cool. There could have been other steps involved between the liquidation of browser support to the full release of the game on steam which could have eased the game into some better light. Hopefully, the development team will roll out updates consistantly and things will get rolling. As for now, the game has is too lack luster and has too many issues for me to want to invest any more time or money into it.","February 1","false","0.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","4"

I'm sorry to say this but it just looks very watered down, and i expected more from this, but i wasted my money hoping for the best, but nope. If you played the browser version then it plays simliar hat is the only good thing about it. Id give this game a 5/10. Will i comeback maybe when its out of early access, but im gonna go get my money back. I also think this game is not worth $6.99 if the browser version was in the steam store then i'd pay 6.99 for this. Honestly i'd pay $3.00 for this as it stands right now. So not worth the buy unless you're willing to see the light at the end of the tunnel when it reaches a better state. The first couple of days i couldn't get into a game, but they fixed it as quickly as possible which is good. The deveolpers really care about this game.\n\nThe gameplay as i stated above plays basically the same as the browser one, i did notice a nerf in the sniper rifle which was the strongest in the F2P play version.\n\nThe maps are all the same from what I've seen.\n\nThe graphics are are better, but i dont care too much for graphics if the gameplay is dissapointing.\n\nI dont know how long they have been working on the steam version,but a lot of features have been trashed including a lot of settings if i remember correctly.\n\nFor some reason the screen seems stretched, and i tried to fix it by changing the resoultion settings, but no change.\n\nI understand it is early access, and this game has a lot of potential but a lot of work is needed if it is going to compete with the level it had in the F2P version.\n\nConsidering this is on steam i hope the hacker issue will be fixed because there was too much of that in the F2P version which caused an uproar amongst the community of who was hacking and who wasn't. A bunch of really good players including myself would be kicked because the lower tier of players saw our score. Lets hope that is fixed.\n\nAnyways this my review of the game","October 13, 2015","false","0.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","1"

At this point the game has less content than the Facebook version of it, which is the free-to-play somehow predocessor.\nBallistic: Overkill gets:\n8/10 ~Great!","November 6, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its hard to find a good fps with decent graphics on mac. I have low specs on my MBP and i was surprised how good the game looked. Dont get me wrong, there is a lot of work to be done.

The non stop fast paced action packed close quarters gameplay is still there and I still enjoy it except for the problems listed below. The game is relatively easy to play and can be compared to COD, but like on steroids with caffeine and red bull. Half the time when you die, you don’t know what killed you, which is actually not that good cause all the weapons seem to do a little TOO MUCH damage. But nonetheless a great must get game.\nNow let's get to business. This game, like many other reviews have said, is a great game as far as early access games go, and it DOES have TONS of potential to grow as I am sure the Dev’s are working very hard to get the full game underway. You have probably seen many people say these things but why? Well the graphics are STUNNING compared to the F2P version. The weapons and characters are still a little fuzzy around the edges with the detail and everything but I am sure they will end up fine. The only problem is the vanguard still looks really stupid in my opinion but whatever.\n\nCONS\nThe thing is I know how everyone is saying, “Oh this is great! I get all of the classes and all of the weapons! Cause ya know, this game is all about SKILL now. Not, who can buy the best weapons!” That is only half true. In the F2P version, if you didn’t know, you could only rent weapons for a certain amount of time with in game money. But with real money, you could by kong creds and get them permanently. This, which I feel many F2P vets will agree with, was total bs, and I am very happy that they did not carry that onto the new steam game. However, they contradicted themselves by giving everyone every weapon. If you hadn’t noticed, the weapons in the mix, like the Hydra (Machine pistol or whatever) and the Interdiction (Sniper), were both LEGENDARY weapons in the F2P version, and SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED FOR EVERYONE TO USE. Instead of everyone having ALL of the weapons, they should bring back IN GAME CURRENCY and have everyone start out with a default weapons, and have to EARN their weapon. Cause I have played countless games with noobs just running around with the super OP bonebreaker and just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ everyone off. Bassically they just threw a smorgash borge of elite, standard, and legendary into a big weapons pile and said, “Here, use this, it's’ a one shot kill”. Things like the anaconda as well should be legendary. All of these weapons like the Chainsaw, if they bring it back with the tank, should be hard to get. Or at least take a while to get.\nSecondly they need to have everyone pick one class they want to default as, and have them have to save up to buy their next class. BRING BACK WEAPONS CASES AND EVENTS. WE NEED SKINS. I believe any F2P vet can agree at how exciting it was to open a case and be like, “Holy crap! Check out this sweet gun! OMG I CAN’t BELIEVE I GOT THIS”. These things need to be changed. And I must say that spawn points are jacked up in free for all. I’ll die and just spawn in the middle of a firefight and die before I can move.\n#HOPEAPLOTLINEISADDED\nI also agree that the chat does interfere with gameplay cause i'll be fighting and hit T and then i'll try and move and i'll be typing a message and then before I know what I did I will die.\n\n\nI know I just totally trashed the game but this game is STILL GOOD and I recommend it to ANY player.","January 17","true","26.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I bought this game expecting to have the same playerbase, stability, and fun as the previous release. I didn't really expect too much as this is an "Early Release" title, and this game barely lived up to my low expectations. There are plenty more issues that I thought there would be some of which include: Latency issues, lack of players, crappy FPS balance and optimization, hitboxes, gun balance, and servers - just to name a few. My biggest complaint is that the amount of players in a server more than drastically effects your Framerate - by this I mean a single player in a map with me drops my FPS a whole 5 frames - fix that. Also, I really hope there is a lot more content in the future as the current feature is pretty much just a copy and paste of the F2P version of this game.\n\nIn conclusion, as of now, the game is not very good, I only recommend it because I know that this game can be great, the developers are very active and are always listening to community feedback - now all they need to do is fix some bugs, add some content, and advertise.\n\nCurrent score: 5/10","January 16","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sour-salsa/recommended/296300/","sour-salsa","SourSalsa | kickback.com","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sour-salsa/","108 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs a big fan of what Ballistic originally was, it pains me to give this game a negative review.\n\nWhen the game was on Kongregate just as Ballistic, it was so much better. A F2P FPS with pretty good graphics for a browser game, lockboxes (crates for weapons), multiple events for special lockboxes, a ton of classes to level up, so many weapons! It was amazing! I played the game for a long time, levelling up my classes, opening lockboxes, participating in the various events, unboxing those lockboxes. There was a little bit of character customization too, just some little hats or miscs that you could put on from Holiday Events. The game was so ALIVE! I would get in a party with my friend and find a match instantly no matter what time of the day it was. Ballistic was more than I ever expected when it came to a Browser-Based, Free2Play FPS game.\n\nUnfortunately, Ballistic Overkill is NOT Ballistic. Before I get into why, let's start with the Pros. Ballistic Overkill still has the good graphics that were in Ballistic, possibly even better. The game has all the classes from the original Ballistic and you can still level them up. They've also kept old maps from the original game. Gameplay feels like it used to. It hasn't changed a bit. The way you play the game now is the way the game was played before it came to Steam.\n\nNow, let's go to the Cons. Lockboxes are gone. There is no way to play the game and earn any type of lockbox. Special lockboxes, mostly event ones, would give you the same gun you can buy in the store but with boots and/or camos to the guns. Not to mention, you didn't even have to buy the lockboxes if you didn't want to. You could just play the game and over time you'd earn enough points for them to unlock for you right after the game. The game eliminated the idea of being F2P, but did they really have to get rid of the idea of lockboxes for boosts or skins or anything like that? I mean, it'd still be cool to have a way to personalize your gun through them. Rather than lockboxes, all the guns are already given to you. Seriously? There's no feeling of a grind to unlock a gun you want? There's no sense of achievement after doing so? (Not to mention that not all of the guns from Ballistic are in Ballistic Overkill!) Everything is already given to you. It's like you've already beaten the game just by buying it and pressing play. It gets so boring after a while because once you use all the weapons, there's nothing more to the game. That's it. Also, where the heck are the servers? This game was always so alive when it was on Kongregate. Now I open the game and I see about 3-4 servers. If I'm lucky, 5. Most of these servers don't even have good connection. After seeing multiple red 1 bar connections on almost all the servers, there's that 1 server that either has a 3 bar or the lucky, green 4 bar connection. Even if the connection is good, sometimes it still won't join. I click cancel and try again, but no luck. After a bit of time I click cancel again, and then the cancel button doesn't work. Cancel. Cancel. CANCEL! It doesn't cancel. Then I have to restart the game. That's just annoying.\n\nBallistic Overkill is far from the original Ballistic. Sure, the gameplay is the same, it has the same maps, it has same classes, it has SOME of the same weapons, but does it add anything new? Is the game better in any way? No. Not at all. In fact, it takes away things that made the old game so much fun. Lockboxes, weapons, events, especially players and servers. It just makes the game worse. It's so boring to play. The original Ballistic was so much fun! I loved it! I don't hate this game, but I definitley don't like it. I don't want to hate this game! This game either needs to go back to its old self, or it at least needs to add back everything that made Ballistic what it was. This game is really nothing special or unique now. It's just anothe average shooter that you could easily find on a browser.\n\nThe cons easily overweigh the pros, I do not recommend this game to anyone.","March 28","false","1.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","4"

Played everything under the sun and NEVER ONCE have I ever requested a refund on a game. Until now.\n\nEverything about this game screams amateur and not at all ready for any kind of public access. I buy into so many Early Access games that I almost forget what EA is. This, isn't it. This is terrible.\n\nMaps are extremely small (literally you walk out of the spawn "gate" and instantly being attacked. The maps themselves you can run across to the other side in LITERALLY 10 seconds. I kid you not, the maps are the size of my bathroom.\n\nThe animations are extremely clunky and poorly done. The player models are paper cutouts with almost no features to them and absolutely ZERO customizability.\n\nThe game has NO menu options for graphics other than "Low", "Medium", "High", and AA on/off. I wont even address motion blur because that should never be in any PC game period.\n\nThere are a whopping 6 servers, with 4 of them running the same dumb, midget sized map. Each server had a couple players on it with two nearly maxed.\n\nPings and latency were terrible.\n\nPerformance horrible.\n\nGameplay was not at all fun and I'm no beginner to twitch shooters and arena combat games.\n\nNo physics.\n\nNo BALLISTICS (you know, the name of the game).\n\nUnpleasant on the eyes UI.\n\nHonestly, if I were the devs of this I would be ashamed to have released it, let alone for MONEY. It should be free to play. I couldn't even recommend this game for a $1 sale. Not at the current state of the game.\n\nI rarely downvote games and I can't even find something positive to say about this one.

In my opinion Quake 2 (CTF / Rocket Arena expecially) is still the best playing FPS there has ever been. When I saw this was a back-to-basics style FPS I jumped on board straight away. It definitely has potential. Downsides: Players appear to glide across the surface rather than move and getting a kill lacks the 'satisfaction' that other FPS's offer (not quite sure why it just didn't seem to!)  Of the 3 servers I jumped on via quick match, the ping times were horrendous - 400-500ms, searching for a match manually showed plenty of closer, in game, with slots available sub-30 ping servers, not sure why I ended up on Brazilian servers each time.\n\nAs you can see I only played for literally a few minutes but 1st impressions count and I'll be keeping a close eye on this.","November 15, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We all had a blast playing it, and when it got taken down, we were devastated. Then, like a light shining from the heavens, I was browsing the front page of the store, and saw this game. I was more excited about this game coming to Steam then I was for Fallout 4. I bought it as soon as it was available, and played it, and enjoyed a decent amount. At that point, the game was still larval. Now, it's in a state where I would consider it good enough for new players to play, and have fun without the nostalgia I had. Only one problem, it still feels a bit like it's free to play roots. Bumping up the price to seven dollars is understanable, as there are no more microtransactions, but it still feels like it did when it was free. Which is a good thing, as I used to play it for how it felt, back when it was free, but I think the price should be lowered, as to not scare off new players, in early access, at the very least.

I know it's "Coming Soon" but that's something that should be done before selling a game like that.\n\nI'm giving a positive here because I actually had fun playing it, the engine is simple, pretty and fast.","March 22","true","40.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are fixing bugs and balancing things, as long as YOU tell them whats wrong, without saying the game sucks and no1 likes it and that you are going to uninstall.\n\nBuy this game? Yes! Do it!\nWhy? This game has ALOT of potentiall and there is alot to come, if you care and are kind enough you will buy the game now and test it, then you will inform the developers of whats wrong on their steam group/s or then you can wait for it to be done (will take some time though) and buy it then, but buy it! This game is amazing and its getting better.\n\nI know i kind of said the same thing over and over again but this is all you need to know! They are going to add alot of things and i know it!\n\nBUT DONT LET THEM ADD ANYTHING BEFORE BALANCING EVERYTHING SO ITS PERFECTLY SYNCED, YES I TOLD YOU TO NOT LET THEM DO IT! WE ALL NEED TO TELL THEM WHATS WRONG SO THEY KNOW WHAT TO FIX! THE COMMUNITY IS PRETTY BAD ATM BECAUSE EVERYONE IS COMPLAINING BUT NO1 IS DOING ♥♥♥♥ ABOUT IT!\n\nI have subscribed to all the discussions talking about bugs and new updates and balancing and ive seen that there is NO ONE who has said that "Hey Developers! You should probably fix the Vanguards heavy weapons because they are unbalanced, the other weapons arent doing alot of damage, so maybe you could fix it?" or then "Developers, the Wraith is ridiculously overpowered and its game breaking, could you reduce the Wraiths protection and decrease accuracy when zoomed out? Thank you!"\n\nBut instead what they say is "This game sucks! The grenadier should be a counter for the sniper but it sucks! i shot a vanguard with the Destroyer 3 times in the chest and then he killed me and he had 50% health left! This patch made the game so bad im uninstalling!" And yes i actually saw this comment.\n\nBut please read this comment twice if you are not from the bright side. The bad thing in this game is the COMMUNITY! The game itself is NOT BAD.","March 25","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason why is this may be dev build and all but on pc it was worth spending $500+. Now i wouldn't even spend half a penny. Their is many glitches bugs when i played. It was worth the time on kongregate 250+ hours. Not even worth 2+ hours on here. I hope when game fully releases it would be better.

Sadly, not many people understand this. This game has great graphics (I get an avergage of 40 FPS on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ microwave-looking PC) , fun gameplay and many maps and gamemodes. However, Ballistic contains A LOT of bugs which sometimes make it hard to play (most times actually).
