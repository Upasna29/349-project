I logged into steam, saw this game on sale, and resigned myself to buying it.\n\nIt was amazing.\n\nMedia accurately depicting the Greek Gods is hard to find, and doubly so for video games. "Someone is god of the wrong thing" is a square on my mythology movie bingo card. But Apotheon completely nails everything. This game wasn't written by people who read through a couple wikipedia pages and called it day; literally everything about the Gods is correct, from their attitudes to their ironic demise, and even their allegences. One of the most telling moments was having Dionysus on the side of humanity; someone who'd only done cursory research wouldn't know that he'd lived among mortals for years before joining the gods.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the art. This game is one of the most beautiful things I've ever played. Everything is stylized perfectly down to the creases in a character's chiton, and the color changes in the different realms are beautiful and perfectly fit the tone of the area. The architecture is accurate, as are the items and decorations. The NPC dialogue and major themes of the story even parallel important values of Ancient Greek life.\n\nBasically: the devs for this game researched the hell out of Ancient Greece, and I kind of want to kiss every one of them for it. 10/10.","September 30, 2015","true","14.1"," 478 of 487 people (98%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","98","478","487","42","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/208750/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nIn the beginning there was presumably chaos; the cosmos swirled violently, endlessly. But the gods, lazy control freaks that they are, swept all that chaos under the proverbial universal carpet and called it a full, rich day. Eons passed, and little of consequence was done: multicellular organisms developed, terra rose from beneath churning primordial seas, and the very first Waffle House opened to middling reviews. At some point (post Waffle House), the gods grew bored and reached out to indie game developer Alientrap. In a booming and unified voice, they decreed that a game be made – a sidescrolling, puzzle/platform adventure game that would do them honor. Little did the gods know that this particular genre of game would be pumped out with such regularity in the indie community that titans CoD and Madden would blush empathetically. Alientrap, like Sysiphus before them, faced an uphill battle.\n\nThey succeeded, and did Olympus proud.\n\nApotheon is the aforementioned sidescrolling puzzle/platform indie adventure game, and it tells a story as old (and as metal) as time: the gods of Olympus have forsook the cosmic “oopsy daisy” of mankind, and it's up to brave Nikandreos to save what little spark of humanity remains. Sure, roll your eyes. “Didn't God of War do this a decade ago?” Well sure, technically, you stick in the mud. Homer also wrote stuff in this vein nearly 3,000 years ago, and whoever the ♥♥♥♥ wrote Gilgamesh 1,300 years earlier than Homer still! And for what it's worth, the story is very fun. It doesn't break the ancient mold, but the ending still left me surprised and satisfied.\n\nNikandreos sidescrolls his way up  hub-world Mount Olympus on his quest in stunning black and red figure style as seen depicted on all the best Ancient Greek pottery. Watching people stroll the market, guards brandishing their spears, and satyrs getting drunk is mesmerizing. But at some point you'll have to get to the gameplay, and what gameplay it is. You'll have an array of archaic weapons (purchased or picked up), a variety of shields, a torch, potions and the like. Weapons and shields shatter after prolonged use, so the game regularly forces you to fight in different styles. I was initially put off by this feature but found that it forced me out of my comfort zone, requiring me to learn the unique swings, reaches, and speeds of each weapon. You'll pick up money and crafting items after combat and by shattering crates and barrels, though these activities can bring unwanted attention from Olympian guards.\n\nOver the course of  three acts you'll deal with eight major deities (four optional), and each offers starkly different, fun, varied gameplay. For example, Demeter, Goddess of the Harvest, pities humanity's plight, and would provide bounty. Unfortunately her daughter Persephone currently dwells in Hades' realm making it impossible. You'll have to descend to the underworld, cross the river Styx, and proceed to cross the lesser rivers Acheron, Lethe, Phlegethon, and Cocyctus to be granted an audience with the Lord of the Dead. Each of these rivers provide different platform gameplay tropes that keep things fresh, exciting, and entertaining. And that's just for one “quest.” Dionysus, Hephaestus, Poseidon, Athena... each and every deity provides different gameplay mechanics so the game never gets stale. All the while you'll visit shops to upgrade your attack strength, defense, and resupply on favorite weapons.\n\nAnd for those of you with a multiplayer itch there's local multiplayer combat, allowing you to test your skills against a friend. This is pretty fun, and the combat (singleplayer and multiplayer) is deceptively deep and tactical. The multiplayer won't keep too many people distracted for long, but between the three difficulties, metroidvania-lite gameplay, beautiful soundtrack, stunning graphics, and varied gameplay, you'll sink at least 10 hours into this little indie game.\n\nThis is AAA quality on an indie budget, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing out on this one. Apothoen has accomplished its 12 herculean tasks, and is deserving of a place in the pantheon of gaming.","February 3, 2015","true","13.3"," 386 of 450 people (86%) found this review helpful 127 people found this review funny","86","386","450","127","19"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reberk/recommended/208750/","reberk","reberk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reberk/","702 products in account","This game is rad. So many melee combat games have tried to find a satisfying balance between simplicity and granular control, and Apotheon absolutely nails it. Being able to toss a javelin, roll between the legs of an opponent, then send a slash up his back while his shield's still facing the other way makes me buzz like nothing else.\n\nWeapons feel distinct from one another and satisfying in their own ways. Though it didn't take long for me to discover my love of heavy-headed polearms, I'm always pleased when a situation calls for something different and I'm rewarded with an entirely different (though no less enjoyable) visceral interaction. There's something to be said for the intimacy of shield + knife.\n\nThe world is pretty big, with a solid variety of enemy types and challenges, but what I thought was the coolest is how all if it was informed by Greek mythology. I was tickled when I realized I had to stab a certain enemy in the eye to bring him down.\n\nAlso, if you've got a buddy on hand, the local arena mode makes for a fun time. They can try to kite you with arrows all they want, but all it takes is one well-placed javelin... (or a quick roll and slash combo... or a mighty leap with hammer in hand... etc.).\n\nAll in all, if you like combat platformers with a dynamic rhythm, Apotheon won't disappoint. Strong recommend.","February 3, 2015","true","10.0"," 148 of 161 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","148","161","3","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 10\nApotheon\nPurchase Date: 6/13/2015\n\nLong ago on my Commodore 64, I used to play a game called The Return of Heracles, which had a similar Greek myth setting.  So when I saw this game, I was pretty much immediately sold on the setting and the art style looked awesome.  This is one of the rare games I bought on Steam that I ended up playing almost right away.\n\nThe game starts with some quick cut scenes explaning how Zeus has turned his back on mankind, and things are looking grim.   After that I found myself in a town being invaded by raiders, which is where the tutorial kicks in.\n\nThe controls are pretty simple.  I didn't check if the game supports a gamepad or not, but I played with a keyboard and mouse.  The keys move you around and perform actions, and the mouse is used for aiming.  I've played other games with this control scheme; it's not my favorite, but it does feel familiar, and isn't difficult to pick up.\n\nGiven the controls and the platform nature of the game, I was expecting the combat to be pretty simplistic.  Instead I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of weapons at my disposal.  Even better, the weapon differences are not just purely cosmetic.  Each weapon feels different.  Knives are quick and do small amounts of damage which add up over repeated strikes.  But after too many quick strikes I found myself gasping for breath.  Larger weapons do more damage but are slower, and can be trickier to hit with against a moving target.  A variety of ranged weapons are provided as well.\n\nIt isn't long before I am introduced to the crafting options in the game.  I got a couple of recipes, one to make a 'fire bomb' of sorts, and the other for making a 'healing potion'.  The components for making these can come out of random crates or from killing enemies.\n\nI occasionally struggled with the map.  The map overlays the screen with a transparency effect that I sometimes had trouble distinguishing the map from the background.  I wished I could have had some control over the transparency here.  Otherwise though the map did a good job of highlighting the location of my current objectives and helping me find my way around.\n\nOne thing I appreciated was the run speed of my character.  The longer you run, the faster you get.  So for those times where I needed to run far across the map, it doesn't feel like it's taking forever.\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, the game starts out pretty easy.  The earliest fights are very simple and gave me a good opportunity to try out the different weapons.  At the end of the first area, I got into my first boss fight, where the game starts to ramp up the difficulty.  As I progressed into the next area, I started to encounter more of a variety of enemies, and I definitely noticed a continued increase in difficulty.  I found myself having to evolve my combat strategy as well.  Early on it was sufficient to simply stab enemies a few times before they could respond in kind.  But as the game progresses, I found myself leaping to dodge attacks, and having to approach combat more methodically, especially in some of the later boss fights.\n\nThe graphics options are pretty basic, but that makes sense given that this is a 2D platformer.  I did see the option to change my resolution, which for me is always the most important.\n\nI ended my first hour of gameplay continuing to explore the forests of Artemis.  The game definitely gives you a decent amount of exploration.  It reminded me a little of Metroid in that regard.\n\nOverall there really wasn't anything about Apotheon I didn't like.  I expect I'll be enjoying many more hours of fun in this game.  I can recommend this without hestiation.\n\n","June 20, 2015","true","1.0"," 191 of 221 people (86%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","86","191","221","11","6"

It's such a great game.  The art style is obviously awesome.  Unless you hate orange, in which case steer clear.  It's a wicked beautiful game and they nailed the Greek Pottery aesthetic.\n\nThe game focuses primarily on combat, and don't let anyone tell you it's anything less than stellar.  Yes, it takes some getting used to.  This is a style of 2D combat that in a league of it's own.  1 part Terraria, 1 part Dark Souls, and yet totally unique somehow.  Once you get the hang of it, properly dodging and timing the perfect devastating blow is incredibly satisfying.  This really should be played on a keyboard and mouse, though, as precision is a big factor in combat.  Also, it's much safer to switch weapons by going into your inventory by pressing "i" instead of hitting a number key and scrolling, while trying to dodge enemies.\n\nThe music is perfect, The voice acting is good, and I love the story, because it minds me of all the time I spent reading Greek mythology for fun when I was a kid.  I think the ending is just freaking perfect.\n\nIt's got plenty to do.  I spent 10 hours playing, and didn't spend a lot of time exploring and many sections I ran and dodged by dozens of enemies.  So there's plenty of time to spend here if you look for everything and do all the side stuff.\n\nMy only real complaint is that there are just too many weapons that you hang onto all at once.  I would have preferred just 2 or 3 melee weapons, and 1 or 2 ranged.  As it is, I just had a lot of stuff that I never needed to use, so there was no sense of urgency.  Also, I realize they were going for an "ammo" feel by having weapons degrade and breakdown ... but I'm not sure that helped the game.  It seemed like an unnecessary convention, and the only time it remotely effected me was when my assassins dagger broke, but I just ran and bought a cheap one from the black market dealer.\n\nAnyways ... I highly recommend this game, and that you take the time to learn and appreciate the combat.  I have a feeling that this'll be a sleeper-hit, and once online multiplayer is up there will be renewed vigor for Apotheon!","March 13, 2015","true","13.9"," 102 of 111 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","102","111","6","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/recommended/208750/","StarSide","Psychedelic Adventurer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/","422 products in account","Tl'dr version:\nAs a classicist and avid reader of mythology I consider this a hidden gem of the metroidvania genre. A good story and decent combat, coupled with the most immersive and unique artstyle I have ever seen seen makes this a must buy for anyone who wants to put a toe into Greek mythology or metroidvania games.\nA Controller is highly recommended however.\n\n\nElaborated version:\nAs stated above, I consider myself a individual well verse in Greek myth and it's Aesthetics. I say this in regard to why I think this game is probably the first of it's kind to seamlessly blend Greek iconography into a video game.\nThe art is immediately distinctive, and go's beyond just a pretty background\nThe art work is a stark reminded that this is actually how people; circa 500-300BC did ART, with some of the darker levels (Hades' realm for example) styled in old Athenian "BlackFigure' style, while the majority of the game plays in different palettes. The God's themselves are the stars of the show; with some being monstrosity tall and the ability to deal gigantic damage to boot, or the more cunning Gods, which use cunning or subterfuge to try and stop you.\n\nI won't go into the story too much. The simple plot remains that the Gods have turned against humanity and Nikandreos, resident Greek villager turned Epic Hero must stop them from wiping them out. If this sounds cliche, that's because it is, but only to the modern eye. We live in a society where most media have butchered much of Greek Myth. This is not one of those pieces of media. Apotheon  reflecting a far older brand of storytelling.\nUnfortunately, players will probably notice the game shares many of its narrative threads with God of War, but the differences pile up quickly. Where God of War sticks to video game tropes, Apotheon is content to ground itself in ancient myth. I find this to be a strike in Apotheon's favor.\n\nIn gameplay terms it's 2-parts Castlevania or Metroid, and 1-part Legend of Zelda 2. During this side scroller you'll forced to engage in combat and a little bit of platforming and open level design which scrolls in all directions. Each of the game's areas contains various objectives that must first be completed, then usually conclude against  the realms master as a boss, or trial.\n\nThe common pit falls of it's genre show through however. Too often you'll find yourself wailing on an enemy hoping that a good hit lands, or that you're weapon won't suddenly snap in two and you'll be left with only a dagger to poke at the giant Cyclops roaring for your nu**s. Another common problem I found was that sometimes, when both parties were melee focused, we'd be hacking at each other with neither hitting because the hitboxes didn't register super close hits.\nEverything else seems to be good however. You can use a multitude of different weapons to kill your enemy's with including Spears, Bow&Arrows, Swords, Maces, Glaves, Hammers, Rocks, and explosives.\n\nSoundtrack wise; it's passable. I found myself mildly surprised that a game with such insane visuals would have such a mediocre OST. To be fair however, soundtracks are often one of the harder development processes for Indie devs.\n\n\nFinal thoughts:\nAn exceptional oddity in our world of graphical powerhouses' like Crysis and Battlefield. This game to me looks better than all of them simply due to it's art style.\nThe combat is rock solid to, and the game boasts a fun story for you to keep you invested.\n\nSlightly harder to justify at Retail price, but under any discount this becomes a steal. A definite recommendation to anyone with a passing interest in myth, Metroidvania, or looks for a fun distraction.\n\n• Good Combat, If a little clunky\n• Good Story\n• Gorgeous and Unique visuals\n• Reasonable length.","June 29, 2015","true","25.7"," 71 of 74 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","71","74","2","5"

You play Nikandreos and you have an epic fight ahead of you against the gods.

You can also use the map to find ancient writing. You will be able to gather plenty of weapons like spears, arrows, swords, axes and much more.  In terms of protection, armours and shields are pretty much it.

It was a gift, for one, and secondly I really wanted to like it on its own terms. I'm a Classical scholar, and the concept is all kinds of wonderful. But I feel duty bound to be honest to anyone thinking of buying the game, so here we go:\n\nPros:\n+ The art style is superb. I feel like this game could have been a top-notch animated film. It's not only beautiful but steeped in the iconography and lore of the ancient Greeks. Could not be better.\n+ The music, likewise, is evocative and well suited to the gameplay.\n+ The concept of an ancient Greek themed platformer inspired by pottery is fantastic.\n\nMeh:\n= The story was simplistic. This is something that could appeal to some but not all gamers.\n= If you're familiar with ancient Greek epic, religion, or myths at all, you might have some moments of frustration. I knew the hero was making some really poor choices but, as with any linear game, you have to go along with it. Some might find it a refreshing twist on the old stories.\n\nCons:\n- What other reviews have said about the combat is, sadly, true. The controls are terrible on KB and mouse.\n- Combat feels floaty. There were several moments when enemies killed themselves, threw themselves out of the level including an elite. It is also possible for one boss battle, at least, to become glitched if a required item is knocked out of the level by the boss.\n- Boss battles have neat gimmicks but are implemented poorly. Each boss has been less about challenge and working out a strategy, or being skilled, but simply having the patience to grind it down.\n","March 19, 2015","false","9.0"," 277 of 406 people (68%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","68","277","406","11","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/recommended/208750/","OneHandedSquire","OneHandedSquire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/","168 products in account","What's the first thing you think of when you think of ancient Greece?  No, not that!  Get your mind out the gutter, you degenerate!  Okay, what's the second thing?  Right!  The awesome myths of heroes and gods!  You think of Odysseus blinding the cyclops, Zeus overthrowing the titans, and... uh, Heracles mucking out some stables!  Yeah, that's the ticket.\n\nWith all these feats of heroism wouldn't it be sweet if there was a video game that took place in ancient Greece, so that we too could test our mettle against these gods and monsters?  What's that?  God of War?  No, no.  That won't do at all.  I'm talking about something that wasn't pushed through the filter of what thirteen year old boys think is cool.  Something that's got fun gameplay, sure.  But something that keeps it classical, you know?  Preserves the tone and character of the myths.  Fortunately for us, we've got Apotheon.\n\nAssuming you've at least looked at the screen shots, I don't need to sell you on Apotheon's visual aesthetic.  It just looks great.  Bold black character models, flattened in profile, placed on warm background colors and intricate patterns do an excellent job of making you feel like you're playing an ancient Greek vase come to life.\n\nIt's clear a lot of work was put into Apotheon's visuals, but I'll admit, I almost passed on Apotheon, since I was concerned there might not be any substance behind the style and very little was said about it when I first had a look.  It's too easy to fall into the "art game" trap, these days.\n\nI grew still more concerned in a different way when some of the voice acting for the early game's enemies intruded on the stately visuals with an out of place cockney sounding accent.  And still more worried when it introduced the main conceit of the game as "the gods have taken their gifts from man and it's up to you to overthrow them one by one."\n\nUgh.  Groan.  Spit.  We're really doing the God of War thing?  We're really giong to treat the Olympians as one big boss rush?  No concern for all the gods' benevolent qualities?  No mention of the heroes they helped, the customs they preserved?  Just gonna treat them as absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ all the time?  Ladies and gentlemen, I will confess that I was genuinely worried that upon my descent into Hades I would find the big man himself putting on his best James Woods playing Hades-as-the-Christian-devil before a meat-head slam down as the hero against an irredeemable evil.\n\nBut, mercifully, for its couple of worrisome first impressions, Apotheon never went that route.  Yes, you do play as the mortal hero, Nikandreos, on his quest to conquer Olympus and steal the gods' powers.  And, yeah, that concept's a little off-base from the mythology, but Apotheon always manages to treat the source material with a great deal of knowledge and respect and it gets all of the points for that.  Aside from the odd intro enemies, the voice acting is good and, I would say, necessary for presenting the extreme personalities of the Greek gods.  Most importantly, their characters are preserved.\n\nOh yes, your encounter with Ares will be a slaughter-fest bordering on supernatural Hulkamania, but that's befitting the charcter of Ares.  Your meeting with Hades on the other hand is one of a number that pass without violence and with a lot of understanding for your plight.\n\nAnd just to ensure that the fight-the-gods premise is pulled off with panache, Apotheon makes sure to vary its gameplay to suit the gods' realms and keep each climactic encounter with the gods themselves true to their characters.  I knew, for instance, that I was in for something special when my showdown against Artemis took the form of a demented game of tag, with the role of hunter and prey switching as I navigated the level.\n\nIn Poseidon's realm you get to ride a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horse!  People who know about mythology just came!\n\nSorry, I got excited there.  The fundamental gameplay for Apotheon is fairly simple.  You can attack with an absurd variety of ancient weapons: spears, swords, axes, pitchforks, bows, javelins, rocks, the power of love, an arrow that's three arrows, a flying saucer, a sword on fire....  Look, it's a big list, okay?  And you can block with a shield if you have one equipped.  You can adjust the angle of your attack with melee as well as ranged weapons to sneak blows past enemy shields.  But despite the extreme variety of weaponry, your equipment will break on you mid-battle.  Normally, I'd question the setting's decision to make equipment out of paper mache, but it was the bronze age, I guess. Combat gets fairly frantic as you and your opponents are smashing each others' shields and you dodge roll around like Sonic the effin' Hedgehog while you scramble to pull out your next favored weapon.\n\nIt's gets a bit metroidvania-ish with you being able to explore large areas of Olympus right out of the gate.  There are lots of secrets to find and reasons to backtrack, athough the game is about as good at rewarding the player as someone saying "open your mouth and close your eyes."  More on that later.  It's also a bit step platformer-y, with movement focused on jumping and climbing around on your environment.  Nothing really unique, but it works.\n\nThere are some RPG elements where you can buy upgrades to speed and damage with various weapon types, but it's minimal.  You start with everything you need right out of the box.\n\nBut it wouldn't be like an ancient urn without some cracks in it, would it?  The core gameplay is weak when it comes to precision.  I found that the arrow telling me where I was aiming with my ranged weapons only had a token resemblance to where my attack was actually going and that made a few puzzles that relied on that precision tedious.  The sheer volume of weapons can also quickly become a hindrance.  Yes, you will need a lot of weapons since they break quickly.  But it sucks to cycle through your huge inventory looking for the next spear weapon in the heat of the fight, especially since they aren't placed next to each other for some reason.  It also makes one wonder why Nikandreos can't drop some swords and axes to hold more spears if you happen to have been giving him more proficiency with them.\n\nOn the huge inventory note, there's also a crafting system that feels a bit gratuitous.  Yes, the potions and things you can make are useful.  But so often, I found myself overburdened with materials that only had one or two specific uses, I couldn't help but wonder, "Is this necessary?  Could you maybe have just given me the final product instead of making me go through this extra flow-breaking step."\n\nAnd as I've briefly mentioned, Apotheon doesn't seem to know how to reward questing and exploration.  I did one side-quest for an optional god and ended up with something that increased the duration of poison damage.  There aren't any weapons that do poison damage. No, really, I didn't find any and I found everything.  You also get a grappling hook for another elaborate sidequest that allows you to explore absolutely ♥♥♥♥-all you couldn't without it.  Generally, there's very little reason to go after all the secret treasures.  Odds are you've found one or two weapons you really like and that chest is going to contain those special sling bullets you are already maxed out on because you never use them or a backstabbing dagger in a game without real stealth mechanics.\n\nBut for its flaws, Apotheon's gameplay feels shield-shatteringly epic and suits the mythology well.  I'm always happy to pick some nits, but the broad strokes are exactly what they need to be.\n\nIndeed, short of including butt-stuff mechanics, I'd say that Apotheon has everything you need to get the full experience of epic Greek mythology.  It's certainly the best take on the subject material I've seen to date and it's just good fun.","July 11, 2015","true","17.6"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","85","45","53","19","0"

The fact that this game managed to pull me in and provide a memorable experience despite the fact that I don't generally like side-scrolling action is a testament to its charm.

But melee fights aren't everything, you'll have to be prepared also on ranged combat - you can shoot arrows and throw javelins or just any weapon you're just holding. Combining the right attack strategy for fights make a huge difference.\n\nWhat excels on Apotheon is the visual style of Ancient Greek, where also the story goes. These graphics might not be winsome for everybody but it's nice to see the level of details developers put into it. Anyway, it's not their first platformer (as you may already know Capsized, for example), so it's great to see how they are getting better and innovating the genre.\n\nPros:- Combat system that requires to be precise. Spamming attacks will not get you so far here.\n- Two difficulty settings. The second one is great for those who want to make Apotheon more like Dark Souls experience. The enemies won't be only stronger, they'll also interrupt your attack if they slash first.\n- Ancient Greek environment. Made to the eye candy level of graphics, just great to watch all the details.\n- Nice soundtrack.\n\nCons:- Beware, if you have a GPU combined with integrated GPU, you'll have to manually switch GPU in your driver settings.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 9","true","6.3"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","39","45","0","0"

However, I'm saying yes because it's worth a playthrough, BUT only if you can get it on sale. To summarise why:\n\nPros:\n- Gee golly this game is beautifully designed when it comes to the art style.\n- It doesn't pretend to be something innovative. It's a sidescrolling action/adventure game and it knows it.\n- The stamina system makes for an interesting combat mechanic, making you choose when to strike a little better instead of just flailing away until things die.\n- There's actually quite a large array of weapons in this game. Bows, spears, swords, maces and shields all come in many varieties. Just enough to keep things interesting, anyway.\n- Really easy achievements if that what you're in to.\nCons:\n- The controls are terrible. T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. I've spelled it out for you, just in case. Plain and simple it's just a nightmare to aim, swing a sword, jump from ledge to ledge.. Hell, just about everything.\n- Tedious. It's mainly fetch quests with some puzzles thrown in every now and then. It is fun for the most part, but can get a little tiresome in a long session.\n\nIt's also very short but I wouldn't know which section to put it in as it could be seen as good or bad, depending on your views of the game anyway.\n\nSo in short. Buy this game if it goes on sale. If it doesn't, you should probably avoid it.","February 20, 2015","true","11.4"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","37","42","2","0"

A nice break from blockbuster games like Far Cry, GTA, Skyrim, etc., the game took me roughly 10 hours to beat and obtain every single achievement (except the "beat the game a second time" achievement, which can be acquired using a small glitch).\n\nThe music is very nice and adds to the overall feeling and emotion of the game. There is plenty of classic "Greek/Roman" music--what you would imagine playing in epic scenes of Greek/Roman Movies.\n\nGameplay-wise, there is some room to be filled. Controls are totally fine on Keyboard, but there were many small times where I wish there was some better ease of controls (i.e. I had to manually go into inventory to change weapons. You can hotkey Primary/Ranged/Tertiary/Potion, but within each of the slots you need to manually go into inventory to switch). Hitting enemies is also sometimes hit or miss (pun intended?), as if the enemy is layered on top of you, your attack might not register as hitting them.\n\nHowever, there is lots to explore and enjoy throughout the entire game. If this game looked interesting to you, do yourself a favor and pick it up during a sale if you need that little boost of incentive.\n\nOverall, a solid 8.5 out of 10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/recommended/208750/","ichikumer","ichik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/","1268 products in account","Apotheon, the game that is most well-known for its looks. The style mimicking the one of  ancient greek pottery feels strikingly unusual and memorable. If only ancient greeks knew. Or maybe they did, but you surely won’t know it from this game. As predictable as it seems, the story revolves around killing gods in order to take their godly powers from them; and as revenge on them for being sadistical mass-murdering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The olympic dwellers had decided that the mortals are “not worthy” anymore and all quit their god-jobs. There’s no more sun rising and setting; the soil has lost all its fertility. People are starved. As a result there’s banditry. So you find your hero in the midst of a raider attack on his village. Nikandreos fights them off effectively and makes it to the high ground, where the Hera's temple is originated. She offers him assistance in solving his people misfortunes by killing Zeus, who is portrayed like a constantly horny idiot making all of this just on a whim. Not that it isn’t accurate according to myths. After all we’re talking about a guy, who turned himself into a ♥♥♥♥ing swan to ♥♥♥♥ a daughter of king of Sparta, right?\nSo you’re sent to Olympus and there’s all that familiar jazz dating back to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. There’s a map where exact locations of where you should be going right now are marked with your goals noted; usually it’s something like “acquire the aegis of Athena”. Sometimes it  doesn’t even involve killing another god, because of course there are those among deities who are sympathetic to humans, but can’t do anything except provide you with tasks of going to dangerous places and doing all that fighting along the way. The map isn’t uncovered initially though, so these arrows are just indicators of general “right” direction. Somewhere you need to go, rather than can. What you can is to start wandering around uncovering secrets and hidden areas, secret caches with upgrades and weapons or even vendors selling some potions or recipes for summoning stuff. As far as optionality goes you don’t even need to acquire all the gods’ powers available in the game but can instead stick only to mandatory ones, those with tiny arrows attached.\nIf not in terms of amount of such content, but in a sense of proportion of it in the core experience Apotheon surely took notice of what first Dark Souls did. Same is true for combat mechanics of the game. You’ve got a stamina bar which is used for blocking with left trigger on the gamepad and attack on the right one; there are combat rolls and tons of weapons with different attack animations. Cautionary exploring is rewarded and smart tactics can save you a lot of trouble. Knowing your weapon, its speed and reach is a must; handling it properly is even more so. To keep things spicier there’s need to actually target your weapon with a right stick, which takes place of the positioning depth of 3d games. You can just try to mash attack facing in general direction of a nearest surprisingly tanned ancient greek god or his eternally respawning minion, but if would be hardly effective. Enemies try to dodge, block and reposition themselves as much as you do, so catching them mid-flight with a pointy tip of your weapon at least sometimes would be life-saving. To make things even more complex the game throws in an ability to use ranged weaponry and even throw your main equipped one right in the surprised face of another evil cyclops. On top of that there’s traps, armor system, health regeneration system, environmental weapons like big blocks of stone lying around here and there. Upgrades apart from gods’ powers are bought with gold and either are pieces of armor or static bonuses with percentage of attack speed and damage added to certain types of weapon. This works for a world where weapons break all the time, and those “repair kits” don’t actually repair anything, but just fill up that armor bar. Thankfully you’re not really limited around in what you can bring to another fight. You can’t have two of one weapon type for a few exceptions, but you can carry all your armory within their respective limits in those non-existent ancient greek pockets of yours. Axes, lances, swords, arrows, throwing rocks — everything can be used considering you’ve dealt with controls while dodging all those life-threatening stuff.\nOf course finding those ingredients for potions and refilling a stock of preferable spears takes some time. In a few hours breaking all the boxes and looking for them outside of a scope of main adventure will be usual. Wandering around and exploring actually helps, so it becomes natural. In the middle of another house break-in when another citizen of Olympus will offer to you “take what you want and leave”, you may even question yourself what is a real motivation of our hero is. Revenge? Hope to help mankind? Lust for power? Isn’t robbing wrong? But then the game throws in another factually correct retelling of another myth, and you can see who’s the real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ here. A musical contest with a mortal for any wish where the obvious winner wishes to flay the loser alive — how does that sound? In the script of the game that stands for some stabbing and acquiring Apollo’s lyre.\nMaking a way through the game’s world while engaging in interesting combat and enjoying the view accompanied by a good symphonic soundtrack is engaging. As for the story, it focuses more on epic battles and general translation of a end-of-times feeling. That is enough to make a great game.","February 9, 2015","true","9.7"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","31","37","2","0"

I'm happy that not only does this game look amazing, they've spent a lot of time on the levels and is a complete game.\n\nCombat is not hack and slash.

You are Nikandreos, humanity's last hope against Zeus and his family of mongrels.\n\nIn case you missed the thumbs-up, I like this game. Consistency is an oft-overlooked aspect of game-design. Apotheon's art-direction is essentially patterned after ancient Greek paintings. If you ever looked at some pottery and wondered "What if someone made a side-scrolling action game out of this?" this is about as close a result as you could imagine.\n\nGoing further, Apotheon's art-direction affects how the game is played. Everything animates in a very stiff manner. It's off-putting at first, and likely won't gel with fans of franchises such as Castlevania. This is what makes consistency such a double-edged sword. This game couldn't have its unique visuals AND the mechanics/animation of a traditional side-scroller, it would look weird.\n\nCombat is all about commitment. Your defensive options are varied and effective at any moment. However, when you swing your sword, stab with your spear, or fire an arrow, you're going to be extremely vulnerable. Aiming & timing are essential; if both aren't true, you're going to take damage. While your skills can be upgraded, attacking is never instantaneous. Most of the time, you have to give your attack half a second to connect, and button-mashing is futile. Encounters tend to be short, as enemies can be killed in a few solid strikes. Furthermore, certain techniques (such as aiming for the legs) can force the enemies to crumple, leaving their head exposed to a critical strike.\n\nThe other interesting aspect of combat is that weapons are fragile. While it's expected that players will find armanents that suit their play-style, it's also common that they'll have to make do with what's available. This tends to keep every encounter fresh, since the player can't afford to exhaust their favorites. Thankfully, Apotheon is balanced in the sense that bosses or other tough enemies don't require the "best" weapons. The boss-fights are mostly unique, and tend to involve unexpected events. In short, intuition and reflexes are the weapons you should rely on. In my play-through I got by relying almost entirely on common weapons. In true Resident Evil fashion, I saved all of my best stuff for...that time after I beat the game and realized that maybe I should have used some of it. Perhaps on the harder difficulty I'll be a little less frugal. Hades, I didn't even touch the ability-boosting potions. Sure they provide temporary boosts, but that's still better than nonexistent.\n\nExploration is also a common element of this game. Each area has numerous secrets, most of which are hidden behind cracked walls and floors. Rewards are typically in the form of gold, weapons, and sometimes even God-granted powers. However, one aspect that is a bit disappointing is that there really aren't any powers that assist in exploration, or allow you access to new areas. Aside from bombs -- which are acquired as early as the first dungeon -- there aren't any techniques that allow Nikandreos to jump higher, fly, or reach areas he couldn't before. A side-quest unlocks a weapon called the Caduceus. It has a grappling mechanism that can be used on faraway objects, or even as a makeshift weapon. It's even possible (if a little finicky) to grab ledges to pull yourself onto. Unfortunately, this weapon can't be used to find new areas. Basically, this game is less Metroidvania than I expected, which is a little disappointing.\n\nApotheon shares innumerable commonalities with the genre, but it does just enough to stand out. Keep in mind though that the art-direction and its resulting combat is *sigh* not for everyone. Some gamers will discount it as clunky and cheap, and that's fine. Everything immediately clicked for me, so I had a pretty good time with the game.","June 22, 2015","true","7.3"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"

Even if you aren't really into these kinds of games, Apotheon is definitely one to try out. The story is interesting and the trials are engaging. The characters are great and I was sad to see the game end. I was never taught about Greek mythology in school, so I was very interested in reading the different plaques which gave information on the different gods and goddesses.\n\nThe gameplay is engaging and the different upgrades and weapons keep the game changing in a way that makes you feel supreme when you visit a previous area with advanced weapons, but still challenging in current stage bosses. Speaking of which, not all boss moments are fights. Some are tests, some are puzzels, and some are games (in the case of Dionysus, a drinking game!). Although the fights are slightly challenging on Warrior difficulty, I suggest playing the game on Champion for the full experience. The directional combat may get a bit annoying from time to time when Nikandreos swings with a mind of his own, but it's still fun!\n\nOf all the aspects of the game, the artwork is probably the best. And I'm not just talking about the nudity!. The art style, and the illusion that the whole game is painted on a stone wall, give the game a very epic (meaning story/legend) feeling and a very epic (meaning awesome/cool) look.\n\nI really had fun playing this game and, as it is now nearlly 6 am (after being up all night playing this) and I have a lecture at 10, I am going to need to wrap this up. Overall a really good game and definitely worth getting. It is worth more than the price paid for it. Trust me.

For example: If you goes to Hephaestus temple inside the game and take a close look to the representation the same outside ,you may notice Doric columns, that were usually dedicated to male gods, so the developers did their homework in that point. Gods like Poseidon or Apollo, since their own respective domains appear much more in the game set in comparison to Hephaestus may be better to notice this kind of level details.\n\nHistory:\n\n'Grand Theft Auto: Mount Olympus’.\n\nIn resume you are Nikaendros Vercetti, the badass of Dion and have to show to the Olympus, who is the boss. (That also means to continue serious during your quest while have a drunk Satyr talking of your back at some point).\n\nCombat:\n\nEver went  while a kid to a museum and for a while wondered those Hellenistic, thousands years old pottery images of heroes, their tales of great deeds at the side of the object , giving a small historical description and some information of the object and how they actually managed to triumph over almost impossible odds? This game delivers that quite a lot with a few of the boss fights, like the Cyclops and to manage hitting the same eye not just over that part but how remarkable accurate it is the animations over the vast Hellenistic arsenal you have at your disposal fighting other soldiers and mythological creatures.\n\n----------------------- Positive-----------------------------------------------\n\n-Art style.\n-Faithful game background with Hellenistic world that includes combat style, music and amazing atmosphere.\n-Huge variety of weapons, potions, armor all delivered straight from ancient Greece offering an extremely versatile combat system, kill in the way you want and be happy with your own pottery carnage.\n-Easy and simple craft system.\n-Funny dialogs in their own way across several moments over the game.\n-Astonishing and rewarding exploration, the game really takes your curiosity to explore every corner of the map you are set and prove to not let you down most of the time while finding hidden treasures, notes or keys to even more secrets.\n\n---------------------------Negative-------------------------------------------\n\n- It may feel repetitive at some points with combat but nothing that you can’t make up with different weapons setup for a change.\n-  Mechanics itself may feel a bit the lack of polish and wonky sometimes.\n\n\n----------------------------------------Overall--------------------------------\nThere are games out there we say that is more than just for fun but also a piece of art, Apotheon is a clear example of this, a precious hidden jewel,10/10 would definitely goes into pottery graffiti again!\n","February 14, 2015","true","17.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

This game is the epitome of an indie quality product. The amount of inmertion thanks to the background music and, of course, the outstanding artstyle, makes this a game worth trying. I took 10 hours, wich for the price of this game, is pretty fair. Also, I haven't done all of the game's "sidequests", so I still have more to do.\n\nSomething important that I didn't expect from this game (because it isn't stated anywhere in the store page) was the fact that it's open world, therefore, those "sidequests" exists. Altough some are just are kind of dull, they give a change of pace to the game if the player ever wishes for one. But either way, the game changes the pace by itself. For example, getting to Athena is very diferent from getting to Poseidon. And in a related topic, let me tell you, I was surprised by the amount of creativity that the boss fights have\n\n\n+Pros\n\n1.-THE ARTSTYLE. You can see that the artstyle is not only unique, but well crafted and incredible. It's what convinced me to buy the game, and I wasn't dissapointed. You really feel like you are one big piece of ancient art, and it's amazing.\n2.-Greek mythology. Many games think that just because God of war succeeded with Greek mythology, it's easy to abuse it. That has been proven wrong. But in this case, they nailed it perfectly.\n3.-The controls. They are very responsive, and once you get a hold of the weapons, you find your own fighting style naturally.\n4.-Level design. Once you finish the first level (which works as a good, non-boring tutorial) they give you a bit of freedom to do as you please (but thread carefully). In the levels themselves, the enemies feel in place, and the moments without combat generally serve a purpose, and last just long enough.\n5.-Boss fights. If you are like me, and like a good, creative, brutal and old-fashioned fight against a\nmighty, fearsome and satisfying enemy, then this is the game for you. The classic feeling stays there even with the large amount of creativity that most boss fights have. Rarely are two boss fight the same, or even simlar, which is impresive.\n6.-Pace of the game. The "tutorial" is fun, and gives a good taste of what's to come. The difficulty curve is very smooth (unless you try to go too crazy and go, for example, to Hades before Apollo, you may have a bit of trouble). And as I said before, every boss is different, and also the common enemies tend to vary, so you must change strategies from time to time. This prevents the game for getting tedious at all times.\n\n\n-Cons\n\n1.-Hitboxes. Sometimes you are sure you hit somebody (or that you got hit) but nothing happens. If youlike close combat, you may find a strange and maybe awkward combat situation now and then. And this is way more common that it should. Most times it is actually funny, but when the game gets harder, it might end in a frustrating moment.\n2.- Map design. It's not bad by any means, just that sometimes is a little too simple, and relies on changing "areas" to keep the flow of the game. The again, the inmersion of the game makes it hard to noctice sometimes.\n\n\nVeredict:\n\n9/10\nHighly recomended.\n\nA fine piece of an indie game at a low price, with an artstyle that has never been seen. The fun factor is always present in this enjoyable experience.","February 4, 2015","true","13.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Since this is a story-driven experience:\n\n***SPOILER ALERT***\n\nSpoilers will be properly marked with tags such as this: Spoiler text read them at your own risk.\nWith that out of the way, let's begin.\n\n\nThis 2D sidescroller brawler/platformer is in my opinion a strong contender for best game of 2015 (as of the time of this review, at least). It pretty much does everything right.\nThe first and most noticeable aspect of the game is obviously its art style, which is based on ancient greece pottery painting and links nicely with gameplay elements: enemies units have red markings on them so you can identify them right away, for instance. Nice choice of color for the backgrounds and effects (foam, blood, smoke and so on) and excellent music as well.\n\nGameplay feels very complete and fun: Your character can walk, jump, swim, climb certain slopes (and even the ceiling in a few cases), roll, block with a shield and wield a variety of ranged and melee weapons with their own unique properties. There is some enemy variety, but it isn't the main point here: combat is. While simple, it allows you to perform a variety of attacks, depending on the weapon such as throwing projectiles, upper and lower slashes and thrusts. It is essential to know these in order to attack enemies, specially ones carrying shields. It has some degree of realism to it. For instance, the slow, but long Sarissa will only hurt enemies that are at the tip of the spear just like in real life and that can take some getting used to (althought it is well worth it once you do get used to it). In short, it feels satisfying and controls very well (I used an XBOX 360 controller).\n\nCombat also includes several boss battles and this is where the game really shines: This game probably has the most creative set of boss battles I have ever seen. The Olympian Gods you face are not limited to simple brawls: The boss battles really go hand-in-hand with their unique personalities. Good examples are Artemis' Hunt, Hipparchos' horseback battle and  Poseidon rocking your boat .\nPlatforming sections are also well made and creative with sections such as Athena's Maze being one of the most brilliant pieces of level design I've played through in a good while (again, going hand in hand with the Gods' personality).\n\nGameplay also includes certain metroidvania elements such as the big overworld with several subsections, but don't expect a whole lot of hidden secrets and any form of item progression (I.E. this item allows you to access this area which gets you a new item for a new area and so on) here. It has a simpler approach, as the focus of the game is the combat. A small market and extremely simple (I mean it in a good way) crafting system provide a small degree of RPG elements to the experience, giving you some choice regarding the direction you wanna take your character in without feeling complex to the point that it detracts from the action. Like I said before, just right.\n\nThe story is pretty much what you'd expect from Greek Mythology:\n\n***SPOILER ALERT AGAIN***\n\nArrogant, capricious Gods, stern heroes, the strength of men, clashes for power, betrayal, vengeance and lots of blood.\n\nThe ending moments genuinely surprised me (in a pleasant way, actually), but this is probably because I was sure it was gonna go down a certain way (and it didn't). Again, a mention to the boss battles being able to truly deliver a perfect and satisfying experience that's fitting with what's going on, story-wise. Speaking of the campaign, the game lasts just the right amount of time without feeling too short like a sudden ending and without dragging on to the point of becoming boring and causing the player to go "ugh, get to the point already!". Again, just right.\n\nAll of that I said above refers to the campaign mode: There is also a fun duel minigame that can be played locally with a friend and an online mode which I can't comment on here, because I couldn't find games as of this time (Then again, I haven't really tried and it's still in beta, so some problems are to be expected).\n\nAnything bad I could say about the game would be nitpicking and would not harm the overall experience in any way (the only thing I can think of right now is how slopes slow you down as you're getting momentum to start running... feels just a bit frustrating. A very minor complaint indeed.)\n\nSo this is my long review for this game: A fun, satisfying experience that integrates gameplay, story and art perfectly, featuring fun and interesting characters and brutal, bloody 2D action.\n\nBuy it!","April 18, 2015","true","18.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Having the entire game look like the artwork on an ancient greek urn was an inspired decision and it really payed off. Just walking through the different areas and looking at all the statues and characters and enviroments is a lot of fun, and that's a big part of what made me want to keep playing.\n\nThe combat takes some getting used to but can also be a lot of fun. I think a big part of what makes it difficult at first is that a lot of weapons have a long wind up time before the strike, whereas in most platformers the strike happens almost instantenously. I can see why some people don't like this but to me it made it feel like the attacks have real force behind them which makes landing a blow a lot more satisfying. The other unusual part of combat is that you aim your attacks with the mouse. This probably adds more depth for players who want to really dig into the system and develop their skills, but to me it often felt overcomplicated. However, if you play with a controller your attacks will automatically go in the direction your charcter is facing, so that was a good solution for me. You can still aim your attacks with the right stick if you need to.\n\nThe story is interesting if you are interested in Ancient Greek literature and mythology. They did a good job portraying all the gods and had some interesting takes on their characters. A touch I really liked is the signposts around the game with quotes from Homer and other Greek authors about the parts of Greek mythology you're currently playing through. One problem I have with the story (and this is a pet peeve of mine that happens in a lot of stories like this) is that the characters all speak in that weird, formal, pseudo-Shakespearian register. It doesn't make sense to do this just because this is set in an old time period. These characters are not English people from 400 years ago, they're based on Greek people from 2,000 years ago. It would have been cool if the writing was more like Stanley Lombardo's translation of Homer, which uses mostly modern language but still sounds appropriately epic.\n\nDespite a few drawbacks though, I highly recommend this game. Its a fun and engaging platformer with a good story and a unique and beautiful artstyle.","March 30, 2015","true","34.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Apotheon has a stunning art style, mimicking ancient Greek art perfectly. The story is not the most creative thing but the mission layout is really well made - each zone has tons of variety and there are always multiple ways to conquer them. And the boss fights - don't get me started on those. Each is unique requiring skill and strategy to beat and they have they're own little mechanics to them as well which can make for a nice change.\nIt has some basic platforming elements which admittedly can be tedious, and usually involve jumping, climbing, jumping, climbing and more jumping - followed by climbing - but the rage boiling inside me is let free when I get to massacre a group of enemies at the next area.\nThe combat is reliant on player skill, not character skill, and you constantly need to be switching back and forth between your doru and your xiphos and rolling behind your enemies and lobbing jars of greek fire at them. Despite this, there is a nice system of character progression, and you can upgrade armour, purchase skills etc.\nApotheon has basic stealth mechanics built in, and its nice to sneak into someones attic and steal their coins or shoot a satyr in the back from the shadows.\nI did find myself lost and the map can be confusing. Unfortunately, a lot of time is spent figuring out where to go, but the reward makes up for the painstaking navigation.\nAll in all, despite its flaws, this is a beautiful game that deserves your money.

I've played it here and there throughout its alpha and beta and continue to be really engaged by the aesthetic and controls. Though you can certainly button mash to get the job done, I appreciated that an effort has been put in to give finesse and skill to the melee combat system. Much like I think the designer intended, the game plays out something like a sidescrolling darksouls with combat that depends on timing and knowing your weapons, which you figure out intuitively by using them.\nSwitching between weapons to equip ones you already have, picking up weapons from defeated enemies and throwing whatever weapon youre holding either in desperation or for that tactical final blow, all work seamlessly as you fight your way through the world.  The dialogue, voice acting and story is unobtrusive or engaging, depending on whether you care for such things (I rather do).\nThe art style is consistent and striking. The music is foreboding.

The story in short, something is wrong/corrupt on Mount Olympus, and now you have to whoop some a** to find out why. It is much more in-depth than this, but I do not want to spoil anything. If you like reading, there are also several "vases" scattered around the world to really flesh out the story and even educate you on some of the myths.\n\nDo you remember studying Ancient Greece Mythology? Remember those finely crafted vases? What about the Disney movie, Hercules? Remember when they had segways and story-telling on the side of a vase? That's the art style of this game. In fact, the gameplay is as such as well. The animations completely capture the feel of those vases. It almost feels clunky at times... a good clunky... a clunky that makes sense in this art style. If this is turning you away, don't let it - it needed to feel this way if you ask me. Plus, the enemies experience this as well.\n\nAfter 10 minutes, you'll realize that this is probably one of the most highest quality Castle/Metroidvania that has come out in a long, long time. You find weapons, buy weapons, pick up weapons off the dead bodies of your opposers. These weapons include: (Melee) Sword, Clubs, Spears, Hammers, Shields (Projectiles) Arrows - many different kinds of them, Javelins, Bombs, and Greek fire. Armor is upgradable. You get special powers from defeating bosses.  There are probably tons more as well, I'm only about 2-3 hours in right now so I have a lot more to see.\n\nThe game also covers many popular mechanics of today as well. Like crafting? It's in the game, and it's actually useful. They didn't complicate this game with recipes that require TOO MUCH reagents. Want to make a bomb? You only need 2 items. Potion? 2 items. Not a fan of potions or bombs? You can make traps. Hate traps? You can summon companion ravens and wolves. Hate companions? WHO COULD HATE A COMPANION WOLF?\n\nAnyhow, I think I'm done writing this review now - because I want to play some more. I'll update this is I find anything else that NEEDS to be noted.\n\nTL;DR: Buy it.","February 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","12","14","4","0"

I've also edited down below where I talk a little about the controls. Where to start?\n\n-Level design: big sprawling levels, with various "missions" to complete in each one at your own pace and order. A good variety of different environments and I've barely seen anything yet. Also there is a good variety of missions too, the gameplay is not repetitive.\n\n-Weapons: Very large variety of different weapons. Melee weapons can be thrown and picked back up. Arrows and javelins can be retrieved as well. Really gives you a lot of options when fighting enemies. I even picked up a boulder and threw it on someones head crushing them. Each weapon breaks and discards after so much usage, but they last a good while before they break. And you find them all over, so you're never unarmed scrambling for a weapon to use. For weapons that you can only carry one of(like the sword), when you pick up a new one, it will discard the old one and not allow you to pick it up again. I like this feature because it's one less thing to manage or think about(Whether or not the sword you picked up was the same one that was about to break that you just dropped) I recommend use a weapon only good enough to beat the opponent in front of you, save the best weapons for the bosses.\n\n-Crafting: There is a crafting system, whereby you collect plants, fangs from dogs you kill, etc. And you also get recipes from characters throughout, some they will give you others you will have to buy. You craft healing potions, "Greek Fire," bombs, powder to summon wolf companion, powder to summon Eagle companion to hunt for you. The crafting system is simple, easy to use, and yet there are so many good features it brings to the table(Like the wolf companion). I can't wait to see what else you can make.\n\n-Mythology: Stones are placed all over the world with quotes from Ancient Greek literature. They seem to be relevant to where you are in the world as well. By this I mean they inform the creatures and gods directly around you, so you never really feel lost if you are not a scholar in Greek Mythology. I'm learning and it's fun!\n\n-Various: Gameplay is great, controls are responsive. I've seen some reviews that think the controls are clunky, but this was not my impression. BTW I've only used a 360 controller. There is certainly a learning curve, but after an hour I had the hang of it though and never looked back. There is an endurance bar in bottom left that will drain if you button spam the melee weapon, and it will take you longer to swing slower. You really need to use your shields and time your strikes. Don't just rush in after a group of enemies, but rather strike from a distance, set up traps, and rush in when numbers are thinned.\n\nReally creative and unique boss fights(like Artemis, Apollo, you'll see). Voice acting, music, and sound effects are great. There is even some humor in the game(the satyrs made me laugh).\n\nThese are just some of the key points I wanted to highlight. I can only imagine the blood sweat and tears that went into making this. Alientrap did an amazing job. I don't want to say anything definitive about any game before I finish playing but this game has quickly become a favorite, leapfrogging hundreds of games in my backlog I've been meaning to play that will now have to wait even longer. I think we may have a masterpiece here.","February 3, 2015","true","45.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

With the beautiful Greek pottery inspired artstyle, rich colors and atmospheric lighting, it often felt as if I were traversing through a painting come to life. The dialogue of the gods and goddesses was both well written and delivered nicely, with the battles against them feeling tense, exciting and complimentary to whatever deity you're battling thanks to clever level design. Combat is tricky and often quite frustrating (requiring patience and precise timing paired with clunky controls).\n\nI was most impressed by how wonderfully accurate Greek mythology and its history were portrayed (something seldom seen in depictions like this) -- even weapons and armor (which were finely detailed) were given actual ancient Greek names, which I thought was a another great touch. To top all of this off, the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and it's paired well with the aesthetic of the game.\n\n9.5/10 would drink with Dionysus again.","March 23","true","17.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","9","9","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/recommended/208750/","daytondoes","Dayton Does ¯\_( ͡°Ꮂ ͡°)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/","1247 products in account","Learning isn’t really a popular theme for video games these days it seems. I find that a real shame, as there is not much that can be more immersive than a well-made video game. Being dropped into the middle of a strange culture, and absorbing every aspect of it is supremely satisfying for both spirit and mind. As someone who knows quite a bit about Greek mythology, it’s quite obvious that the team over at Alientrap has done their homework as well. The weapons are all standard fare for the time, and can each serve a different purpose. There are ranged and melee weapons, but in a pinch your can throw your melee weapon with the middle mouse button. Just try not to break them all before you find a replacement. The durability on weapons adds greatly to the survival aspect of this game, but is really only the tip of the iceberg. There is a lot here to be excited about, so let’s get into it and take a deeper look at Apotheon.\n\nThe story revolves around a Greek warrior named Nikandreos, who has been sent by the goddess Hera to kill her god-husband Zeus as punishment for abandoning the people of Greece. Along the way you will fight Zeus’ brothers, daughters, and sons. As you defeat them, you will be powered up. Artemis’ Bow will allow you to fire arrows faster, Apollo’s Lyre will illuminate the dark so a torch isn’t a complete necessity. Before you fight the gods, you will need to complete objectives within their realm. These usually consist of “find this” but some are a bit more thought out. Stealthing around a Satyr party to smash all their wine and make them leave is bliss. Make good use of your Assassin’s Dagger, which does 600% damage from behind. It might also be a good idea to craft some stealth potions… Or you can craft a bunch of explosives and healing salves, and just go Rambo on them. The choice is yours, and adds quite a lot to the replayability.\n\nOn top of using a different loadout of weapons, there is also an advanced difficulty mode. Enemies have more health, swing faster, and hit harder… I wouldn’t recommend it to start with due to the quick nature of the combat. The aesthetic in the game really captured me, it is all based on the Greek art commonly seen on all manner of decor of the time. When the game goes extremely dark, you might notice that the dark nothingness appears to be made of stone. Major kudos to the guy who thought that one up. I just wish the music was able to keep pace with the graphics, but unfortunately, to me it falls a bit short. It’s not that the music breaks the mood, or isn’t enjoyable. I just found that the songs didn’t really stick with me. Still, the multitude of creatures and heroes and gods that you meet along your path towards bloody revenge would be enough for me to want to complete the story, even if there were no music at all.\n\nThere is very little criticism I was able to find in Apotheon. Some of the hitboxes are wonky, which can lead to a comical mid-combat moment of both characters flailing their weapons wildly and hitting nothing but air. The music is also a bit bland, as I stated previously. Overall though, I love everything Apotheon has to offer. The endless struggle to find a useable weapon and shield, the crafting of potions capable of amazing feats, and the terrific speed of the running and combat. The entire game feels very fluid, and comes together to form an experience that I’ve never had before and doubt I ever will again. While you won’t be able to write an essay on the rise and fall of Greece, Apotheon is a great game to brush up on your mythology. Or you can just enjoy it for the experience it is, which is great. But I think the tidbits posted add a great deal. Who doesn’t want to read a little passage about Apollo? And once you’re done learning about him, you can murder him! Huge thanks to the folks at Alientrap for developing something that is so much fun, and even slightly edifying.\n\nSummary: Greek action-adventure peppered with survival elements and lessons on mythology.\nFinal Score: 8/10 for aesthetic, story, replayability, and education.\n\nFull text/photos: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-apotheon/\nVideo review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k9PwxcmIC4","February 3, 2015","true","4.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","14","19","4","1"

It's a platforming hack-n-slash that requires well-timed blocks and a good eye for where to swing. You do navigate obstacles, but the game focuses more on combat. You're often put into situations where you need to juggle between fighting at range and up close. Enemies demand that you overcome their strengths and exploit their weaknesses. The AI is pretty decent, it will strike at you if you leave yourself open, wait for you to drop your guard, and even dodge projecticles if you hurl them wildly. There is a progession system, you upgrade your armor, buy new weapons (which degreade and break after use), upgrade your damage/attack speed with certain weapon types, and purchase recipies for brewing potions (health and buffs mostly). There's a surprising amount of weaponry for an indie game, over a dozen choices. The story is interesting, and while it's not what drives me to play it, I'm definitely interested when the NPCs begin their dialogue. The atmosphere, music, and art are absolutely fantastic; the game does an amazing job aesthetically. The art style is what attracted me to it, but I can say I genuinely ended up enjoying the game; i'd give it a solid 8/10.","February 8, 2015","true","17.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

It was a nice vacation, though.\nWhat is happening in the game:Greek Gods have abandoned the humanity and it's up to you to fight against the gods, take their power and ensure the humanity to survive.\n\nPros:    It will be the first you'll notice and the best thing you'll notice: how the game looks. It's just like those ancient vases and amphorae that you see in museums. I never expected this style to fit this well into the game, but it really looks perfect.\nThe combat mechanics are really enjoyable, you get to try a lot of different weapons like swords and spears (those really long ones).\nThe music is really nice, it fits the environment well and kind of sets you to ancient times. Really nice.\nAnother thing I did not expect in a game is the way it shows spoken text. It shows you the entire thing someone is going to say and it colours the letters as they are spoken, just like in karaoke.\nYou can smash mostly anything you can come across, all the boxes, vases and stuff like that. They can sometimes include coins or other valuables, so it's a good idea to smash everything.\nThere are not only weapons in this game, but it also has a pretty nice shield system. When you hold right click, a large shield pops up in from of you and you can direct it with your mouse. Unique and very useful.\nYou get a lot of weapons and other things in game and this game manages your inventory extremely well. You can keep everything you pick up with no limits, but most of the things "expire" after you use them for some time.\nLinux and MacOS support. Just the way things should be.\nCons:    Combat system is great in my opinion, but it takes a bit of getting used to it before you master it. I know this is bothering to most people, so I'm listing it here.\nSometimes, I feel like there are way to many things on the screen or at least the rich visuals give that feeling. It's not that bad, though.\nThe final verdict:This game is awesome, no questions about it. The visual style itself is almost worth the price, but with the story and music, this is not a game you want to miss.

This is why i bought this game.\nGameplay is your typical platformer with a lot of combat. There are cRPG elements: new weapons and armor, training melee proficiency. Game is short, it took me 20h, with all but one achievement.\nQA was very good; glitches are rare, have not seen any errors. Only the multiplayer is in beta, with mostly empty lobby.\nStory is present, but it is not the most important element of the game. It is linear, however, you can choose the order of taking challenges. You can revisit places. There are a lot of static quotes from ancient greek texts. They provide background for what you are fighting with, next.\n\n9/10","July 2, 2015","true","21.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cruinne/recommended/208750/","cruinne","cruinne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cruinne/","366 products in account","The first thing to really notice about Apotheon is the art: the aesthetic choices for the game are truly superb.  The whole game looks like it's taking place on the side of an ancient Greek vase, and the lines and composition are frequently beautiful. The soundtrack is quite good, and the voice acting is above par to boot, making for a great experience overall.  The game incorporates snippets of Greek mythology, from the writings of Homer to various Orphic hymns, producing an unusual atmosphere for a video game, let alone one of this category.\n\nMechanically - well, it's a side-scrolling 2-D platformer.  That isn't one of my favorite genres by a long shot (in fact, I usually avoid them).  This category inevitably means a bit of frustration for me with the de rigueur boss fights, the lack of any choice in how the story plays out, and so on.\n\nApotheon got quite a bit better for me, though, once I moved from keyboard-and-mouse to Steam controller to play, with a minor exception (as I'll explain below).  With mouse and keyboard, it's just too hard to be facing the right direction when fighting, but controller play deals with that considerably better.  Except when you need to, say, aim down a long tunnel to hit a target with an arrow.  Then I pretty much had to go back to mouse and keyboard for that specific trick - no amount of fussing with my Steam controller settings could get the aiming to work with any amount of sensitivity, and there is no way to address sensitivity in-game at all.\n\n(It's worth noting that I have played other 2-D side-scrollers with mouse and keyboard without this problem and I have played other 2-D side-scrollers with the Steam controller without these problems.  These issues seem to be something very particular about how Apotheon works, and it is the worst aspect of the game.)\n\nMany players also complain that the combat is clunky, and I can honestly say that I find it terrible - but that is with the caveat that I frequently find the combat in these sorts of games terrible, so I can't tell if it's genuinely wonky, or I just do not enjoy this sort of thing and since I am only trying to get through the silly boss fights to see where the story actually goes and what the next area looks like.  Just know that in Apotheon, strikes must be aimed and they must be relatively precise; meanwhile enemies will dodge - and will often spring around crazily like mad frogs - which I found to be somewhat disconcerting, and which did not seem to fit well with the game's other artistic choices and tone.  Bottom line though: if you're looking for someone to appreciate unusual or varied combat in game of this genre, it's definitely not me, so take what I say with that grain of salt here.\n\nI got best into the game by floundering through the opening level, mashing buttons until I had (slowly) sublimated attacking, dodging and rolling, and switching weapons, and then I started over in order to pay attention to the story and scenes instead of being focused more on "Oh damn it, I didn't mean to throw that! Bwah! Why am I facing the wrong direction?!?"  That generally provided a better experience for that secondary start and subsequent play.\n\nOtherwise, though, the game is an interesting experience, and looking around provided me a ton of entertainment.  I'd definitely buy and play follow-ups to this game in the vein of Egyptian, Japanese, Sumerian, Aztec, and so on just to see the art and experience the mythology, honestly.  It's worth the admission price for that alone.","February 7","true","32.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

As a student of Ancient Greek litterature and mythology, this is a bit "out there" in that respect.  That being said, in every other respect I can think of, the game was spot on.  More than spot on, in fact.  The little tablets with ancient translations were incredible.  The names of the weapons were all in correct Greek spelling.  I was truly impressed with the detail that was put into the game.  Both the mythological and historical accuracy were amazing.\nMoving on the graphics: I was a huge fan.  In creating a platformer, I know that there are a lot of options for styles of the visuals.  The choice of Ancient Greek art style was genius.  It puts the gamer right in Ancient Greece.  This art is the same as that on greek pottery.  Once again, an awesome detail that really made the game that much better.\nDon't worry, I am certainly not going to overlook the gameplay.  It was a blast.  I was impressed with the combat in the sense that you have to judge your enemies next attck and there are so many possibilities to destroy your adversary.  The designers managed to make each stage tailored for that god, leading to underwater bouts, chases on horseback, and tricky mazes.  These all integrated combat with unique foes.\nIn addition, your practically endless arsenal of creative Greek weapons and shields makes sure that each fight is interesting.  Once again, many of these weapons are found in ancient Greek culture, but many new weapons were created based on stories myths.  Discovering these weapons is really cool as you find more specialty items.\nThis game is a must-have for everyone (especially for any of you classics students like me!)","March 15","true","10.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

To me, a platformer game is a much more basic, even simplistic game genre. Yes, Apotheon has a basic platformer layout but the game doesn't consist of jumping from platform to platform, timing each jump carefully to avoid things or to avoid falling to your death. There are only two instances where Apotheon really felt like a platformer but one of those is completely optional (Dionysus) and the other is a very original take on platforming (Athena). If Apotheon is a platformer, it is to modern platformers what 'Gods' was to the SNES and Sega Megadrive (Genesis) consoles. Fun fact: both games are set against a background of ancient Greek mythology, but I digress...\n\nI would rather like to describe Apotheon as a 2D action adventure game with basic roleplaying elements, reminiscent of 'hack and slash' games. The game is mainly about combat. Although not perfect, the combat system in Apotheon is pretty decent. There are several types of weapons, each with advantages and disadvantages (speed, range, damage). You can use a shield to block. There is a stamina bar to make you think about your tactics, as opposed to allow you to just spam the attack button. Weapons degrade over time and break pretty quickly. At first, I didn't like this but soon I came to realize it had two important advantages:\n- if you woud be able to use the best weapon throughout the whole game, it would be way too easy and therefore no fun\n- this way, you're forced to use different weapons fairly often, making the game more varied and therefore more fun\n\nThe story: you are Nikandreos, a warrior whose home town gets destroyed because Zeus (king of the gods) thinks it's time to eradicate humanity because its creation didn't turn out the way he'd have liked. So Hera (queen of the gods) suggests you take up arms and go to Mount Olympus to usurp the powers of each of the main gods, either by proving yourself to them or by defeating them, in order to defeat Zeus. That's it, the whole story of the game.\n\nThis is no game you play for its elaborate, deep story. The fun is exploring the realms of the gods, each satisfyingly different enough and each with one or more boss fights, which are mostly well-thought-out and exciting fights.\n\nAbout the RPG elements:\n- there is an extremely limited skill system: you can purchase training for 4 levels of skills for the weapon types (sword, axe, spear, mace, bow)\n- more importantly, there are quite a lot of side quests. Even though they are pretty basic (explore, kill or loot), they are varied and interesting enough to pursue. Here I have to specifically mention the Steam Achievements. There is an achievement for each sidequest. This makes doing these quests feel rewarding. Also, you can start from the achievements and see them as a 'quest log' if you want to make sure you don't miss anything.\n- there are 'quest hubs' with merchant npcs, with npc houses to explore (and loot!) and with guards who will attack you if they see you you steal or attack anything or anyone.\n\nThere is also some crafting of utility items (health potions, armor repair hammers, bombs to throw, ...) to add to the mix. Yes, the art style is 2D and looks very simplistic, but it's actually quite easy on the eye and it fits the game and its settings perfectly. The length of the game is perfect as far as I'm concerned. I estimate it took me about 20 hours and by the time I was about to take on Zeus, even though I was never bored with Apotheon, I felt the game shouldn't go on much longer. All in all, I'm positively surprised by this 'simple platformer' and would certainly recommend it.","May 30","true","27.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/208750/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Apotheon is a platformer with an ancient Greek theme.  It is a very unique-looking game with an art style matching ancient Greek pottery.  You play a regular person, tasked with defeating the gods (led by Zeus of course) who have chosen to destroy humanity.  It's one of those games that shows how well thorough theming can work.  Everything about it is ancient Greek and well-researched to provide the best experience possible.\n\nWhile the game may be a platformer, it deviates quite a lot from the norm.  You have a wide range of ancient Greek weaponry to choose from with various melee and thrown weapons as well as quite a few types of arrows and sling ammunition.  Weapons are realistically modeled so you must actually hit enemies with the blade in order to damage them and both you an enemies can use shields to block attacks.  While it may feel clumsy at first with long attack windups, you quickly get used to it.  The one major problem with the combat is that attacks are performed either overhead, underhand, or stabbing, but the game selects one at random when you attack.  This can cause a lot of incorrect attacks that miss your target and lead to some frustration.\n\nThe other major annoyance in the game is the movement.  While for the most part the platforming works fine, and the game even provides a ledge-climbing mechanic for when the jump is slightly too high, maintaining speed while running across a map is nearly impossible.  You speed up as you run but any time the slope of the ground changes, such as when you start climbing stairs, you lose all momentum.  In some places you can actually skip the stairs by jumping and land on another piece of ground of the same slope as you jumped from to maintain speed but very few locations offer that opportunity.  The game would have been better served by leaving out this feature altogether.\n\nThe game is structured in a non-linear way with several hub areas branching into areas with multiple objectives you have to complete before continuing.  It gives the game more freedom to allows for mini quests that take place across several areas.  It also allows easy access to go back to previous areas to find secrets you missed and complete achievements.  Each area is themed for a specific ancient Greek god while the hub areas act as towns, complete with town guards who will attack you if you break the law.\n\nI was greatly surprised when I discovered that this game which I thoroughly enjoyed was made by the same developers as Capsized, a game which I found frustrating and poorly designed.  I hope they continue to make games of this quality in the future.","June 25, 2015","true","15.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

So heres how to make Enchiladas:\n\n1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.\n\n2 In a large frying pan at medium-high heat add a tablespoon of oil. When the oil is shimmering and hot (not quite smoking), add a corn tortilla to the pan. Cook it for 2-3 seconds, use a metal spatula to turn it over, and cook it for 2 to 3 seconds more. Lift up the tortilla with a spatula, add another tortilla underneath. Cook the second tortilla for 2-3 seconds, lift both tortillas, and add another tortilla underneath. Repeat the process with all the tortillas, adding more oil as needed. This way you can brown and soften the tortillas without using a lot of fat. It's important to pre-cook the tortillas because not only does cooking them help soften them for rolling, cooking them in a little fat helps develop the flavor of the tortillas. As the tortillas brown a little, remove them to a plate.\n\n3 Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5-6 minutes, until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for a minute more. Add the crushed tomatoes. Add the green chiles. Add 1/2 cup of water. Add the oregano. Bring to a simmer and taste. If the sauce tastes too vinegary, add half a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce. Remove from heat.\n\n3 Put a little olive oil on the bottom of a 3-quart casserole pan. Take a tortilla, cover 2/3 of it lightly with the shredded cheese, then roll up the tortilla and place it in the casserole pan. Continue until all tortillas are filled and rolled.\n\n4 Add sauce to the top of the tortillas in the the casserole pan. Make sure the rolled up tortillas are covered with the sauce. If not, add a little water to thin the sauce to spread it more evenly over the tortillas. Cover the whole thing with the rest of the grated cheese. Put the casserole in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the cheese melts.\nServe with sliced iceberg lettuce that has been dressed only with vinegar and salt. Garnish enchiladas with cilantro and sour cream.\n\nHere is the full wiki for Enchiladas:\n\nEnchiladas originated in Mexico, where the practice of rolling tortillas around other food dates back at least to Maya times. The people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate corn tortillas folded or rolled around small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal Díaz del Castillo documented a feast enjoyed by Europeans hosted by Hernán Cortés in Coyoacán, which included foods served in corn tortillas. (Note that the native Nahuatl name for the flat corn bread used was tlaxcalli; the Spanish give it the name tortilla.) The Nahuatl word for enchilada is chīllapītzalli  which is formed of the Nahuatl word for "chili", and the Nahuatl word for "flute". In the 19th century, as Mexican cuisine was being memorialized, enchiladas were mentioned in the first Mexican cookbook, El cocinero mexicano ("The Mexican Chef"), published in 1831, and in Mariano Galvan Rivera's Diccionario de Cocina, published in 1845. An early mention, in English, is a 1914 recipe found in California Mexican-Spanish Cookbook, by Bertha Haffner Ginger.\n\nVarieties - In their original form as Mexican street food, enchiladas were simply corn tortillas dipped in chili sauce and eaten without fillings. There are now many varieties, which are distinguished primarily by their sauces, fillings and, in one instance, by their form.

But maybe this is just me, but the visual style was just not my thing. I see what they were going for but it sorta just becomes the mess of black on black, breaking pots and smashing everything just to replace weapons that break in 10 swings. Its not entirely engaging that every soldier looks the same (for the first hour i played) and the flash animation style leaves something to be desired, the characters just feel so lifeless. The physicisy felt so awkward getting randomly thrown. I suppose many may not feel this way, but I was simply not having fun.\n\nAlso Something about breaking weapons in games has never settled with me. It's an annoying mechanic that once i shuffle through my crappy weapons i finally find one i like and then its gone again.  Strangely I'm ok with the dark souls way of doing it, durability and repairing them, but i feel like i get my fair use of the weapon before its broken.  Even then it is a bit annoying.  But here no, once it's gone, it's gone.\n\nLevel design is quite... tediuos and unmemorable. Most outside area's don't really have any outstanding features that make them memorable, and i suppose for me thats partly on the visual style. Most indoor atmospheres feel very samey. Plenty of exploration with very little reward in big environment that feel more daunting to explroe than exciting.\n\nLastly the combat simply feels awkward to me. Maybe I am doing something wrong but It doesn't feel like i'm making meaningful combat choices, i'm simply running up and trying to chop at something with an awkard hitbox that can miss even if i'm standing next to them because the tip of my weapon extended slightly beyond the enemy.\n\nI realize that 1 hour is probably not the most fair assesment of a game, and you may enjoy it, but for me, im sitting here thinking that i'm genuinely bored with a genre i'm usually enthralled to play , a few design changes could have made this game in my personal experience far more enjoyable.","April 22, 2015","false","1.3"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","23","43","0","0"

Here are the most importanrt points:\n\n1) Graphics/art - I've never seen anything like it, unless you want to count the ancient Greek art it's based on. Seriously, just watch the preview video - its beautiful. Very crisp, with interesting uses of color and good detail. The creators even include readable stone etchings in the game that have real passages from ancient Greek literature, further adding to the atmosphere. The best way to say it, I think, is that the game has a feel of authenticity about it. You can really tell that the creators did their homework, and I think they did a fantastic job of giving the Greek mythos life.\n\n2) Music - Also fitting in with the setting, you will feel like Odysseus while you're listening to this soundtrack. War drums, chanting, full orchestrated scores - it's got it all. The tracks for the boss battles have a very epic feel to them; they really lend to the idea that you're fighting Gods.\n\n3) Gameplay -  Probably the other "best" from this game besides the art/music. I've never seen another game in this genre implement such a wide variety of weapons so well. You will have at your disposal quite a few ancient Greek weapons, including spears, swords, clubs, bow & arrows, javelins, greek fire, and a lot more. You can wield most weapons with a shield as well as throw them, and you can evasively roll back and forth to try and manuever into a better position or get behind your enemies. When you combine all of these elements, combat is very engaging and fun. Usually in games of this type, I find myself using one or two weapons that are clearly superior to the others, but that isn't the case here. I can honestly say that I used every weapon class in the game effectively, and I think that using all of the different weapons is part of what makes this games so fun. I can only speculate that the creators realized this early on, which is why the weapons have durability that runs out decently fast - it forces you to experiment.\n\nThe other aspect to the gameplay I wanted to mention is the scenario variety. Each boss battle, especially, and to a lesser degree, each quest, presents different sorts of challenges to the player. There is almost always more to it than "hit this enemy until he dies" or "go to this location and pick up this item." The level designs themselves are very unique, so often just getting through the level can be the most interesting part.\n\n4) Collectibles/side quests - Some games suffer from having nothing else to do outside of the main questline, while others suffer from overloading the game with collectibles and time-consuming sidequests. In my opinion, this games walks the line well. There are 2 achievements for collecting - 1 for getting all of the unique weapons in the game, and one for opening all of the chests(lockboxes) in the game. The weapons, however, are often found in the chests, so really you can focus on just finding the chests, which are not terribly difficult to find if you are constantly looking out for breakable walls and making sure to explore every area thoroughly.  The sidequests available range from simple tasks to fairly complex series of events that require trips to multiple areas. I didn't find any of the sidequests to be frustrating, which is a mistake a lot of games make.\n\n5) Minor points:\n- Each piece of armor you get permanently increases your total armor points, which basically acts as a second pool of hitpoints. However, you keep all of your old armor pieces, and since the increase is permanent, you can freely switch between armor pieces with no penalty. I found this to be very progressive and pleasing.\n- There is a multiplayer mode, though I cannot comment as I haven't tried it\n- A 3rd difficulty unlocks after you beat the game, Olympian Difficulty. Beating the game on this difficulty earns you the last achievement.\n\n6) Negatives: not many for this game.\n- I did have one save become irrevocably corrupted at one point, and it crashed the game whenever I tried to load it. Luckily, the autosave saved the day for me. Hopefully this isn't a widespread issue.\n- The character movement can be a little clunky & hard to get used to, and I hate that the character stops running whenever I hit stairs. I highly recommend playing with a gamepad, though this may vary if you're used to using a mouse/keyboard all the time.","July 13, 2015","true","19.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloughsburgh/recommended/208750/","bloughsburgh","Bloughsburgh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloughsburgh/","399 products in account","Dark themed Grecian Metroidvania.\n\nIf the above sentence piques your interest then look no further than Apotheon!\n\nSet in the wildly creative ancient Grecian times where Zues and his fellow gods and goddesses rule over the kingdom of man. You play as Nikandreos, a simple peasant armed with the responsibility to protect his beloved home town of Dion. Hera is there to meet you at the city's temple and tells you to vanquish the gods of Olympus. Thus begins an epic quest of godlike conquest. Mount Olympus can be seen as the world hub where you can explore different parts of the city, visit markets, break in to houses and even uncover a long buried secret or two.\n\nThe primary structure of the game is to enter a God's domain through one of the game's two main hubs. Inside each domain is a vastly unique set piece where you must display skills related to the god at hand. For example, in the Forest of Artemis you will be tasked to hunt legendary beasts and possible become a beast yourself in your ultimate quest to take on Artemis herself! Likewise, in Poseidon's realm, you will have to brave the seas that the old god controls himself to calm the spiteful deity's wrong doings. Each area really does have a life of it's own even if it uses the same art style throughout. Another piece of conversation of its own is the art design.\n\nI have never seen anything like this game's visual design. It's a 2D-open world-sidescroller at heart but the way it is presented just bursts with originality. It is hard to explain but just looking at the screen shots gives you an idea of paintings come to life. The breathing vivid colors of these pieces come to life give a sense of wonderment and otherworldly experiences like no other metroidvania. The different domains of gods use this visual style by shifting color palettes perfectly to suit the environment you are in. From the warm orange glows of the central hub Agora to the soft off-white blues of Poseidon's sea palace to the muted dismal tones of Hades, the worlds are brought to individual life from this masterful design. The gameplay is engaging and does not get old even to the very end of Nikandreos's arduous quest to become one with the gods.\n\nThe central gameplay element is exploring the realms of the gods and combat. Combat is simple yet intuitive as the popular deterrent to the norm of button mash is once again ill advised. Nikandreos attacks in concentrated swings, swings that drain a stamina bar which will cause him to take large amounts of breath in order to wind up another attack if he is not given some time to rest. Enemies do the same, where the have timed attacks and can shield/roll/fly/backpedal/ and charge at their opponent with little hesitation. While the combat is rather easy, I found the reactive style to be quite satisfying all the way through. Spear pieces flesh, sword slashes at sinews, and clubs bludgeon skulls. The instant ragdoll and sound of your foes dropping their weapons as their last breath leaves there sorry bodies is something to take in again and again.\n\nThe other side of the game resides in the player following certain laid out quests in order to gain audience with the god of that domain. You will encounter secrets, puzzles, and platforming challenges as the game plays out. Each challenge is presented in some unique way that never makes you tire of the formulae at hand.\n\nThere is a multiplayer that is both local and online, and while this is always welcomed I can see this being only a quick side interest to the major deal that is the single player campaign. There are also two difficulties with the last being unlocked after completing the game. I am curious to see how the increase challenge plays out and could easily provide more replay value for the hardcore Apotheoner.\n\nI can easily recommend Apotheon at it's full asking price of $15.00 USD. If you love metroidvania games then you will NOT be disappointed with Apotheon offering to the table!","July 22, 2015","true","16.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fleetfiend/recommended/208750/","Fleetfiend","Fleetfiend","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fleetfiend/","151 products in account","Apotheon is one of my favorite platformers, period.\n\nThe music and art are absolutely SUPURB. I highly recommend playing this game with good headphones, because it's worth fully sinking into. It's gorgeous, thematic, with great voice acting and a pretty good, fitting story (if you've played God of War, it will feel really familiar).\n\nThere is a wide variety of weapons, and they are all interesting in their own right. Because of the way weapons degrade in the game, I ended up trying all of them at least once, out of curiosity or necessity. The combat using said weapons is incredibly satisfying; the sound effects and the tight hitboxes really drove every hit home. Some parts of the game were definitely more challenging than others, and it never felt frustrating.\n\nMy only problems with this game have to do with the inventory management/controls, and slight bugginess. You can hold a very large number of weapons at a time, and it can be really tedious to equip the one you are looking for. You have to have the right type equipped (melee, ranged, tools, or support) and then scroll with the scroll wheel until you reach the right one. You can't really find what you want unless you take your eyes off of the action, which I didn't like at all. Also, the wide variety of weapons and potions in the game can feel a bit excessive at times. I used many of the weapons (and enjoyed the variety from a historical/mythological standpoint), but I rarely touched any support potions other than the healing one, which has its own hotkey.\n\nThere are also a few bugs in the game, but none of them were totally game-breaking. They would either cause crashes or a need to restart (due to an invisible wall or something), but the game would continue from a very recent checkpoint.\n\nApotheon is not perfect, but it is also really, really good. I wholeheartedly recommend it. After seeing this game, I couldn't stop thinking "why didn't I think of this?! It's such a good idea for a game," and it's well-implimented. I doubt it will happen, but I would love to see more; with Egyptian hierogliphic art!\n\n","August 21, 2015","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/208750/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Apotheon is a 2d sidescrolling platformer taking place in Greek mythology. You play the role of Nikandros, a human whose civilization was forsaken by the gods. Seeing your city in ruins, you make an alliance with an opportunistic Hera, who guides you through your quest of assassination and dethroning.\n\nThe graphics for this game are themed entirely around ancient Greek paintings such as those found on pottery or tapestries and it has a really neat look as a result. The soundtrack is also set along the same theme and various obelisks detailing actual Greek scripture can be found in each level. The weaponry mirrors that which one would find in ancient Greece and just about any other obvious reference you could make is accounted for.\n\nIf I had to pick one beef in this game, it would have to be the controls. The control scheme in this game is very similar to terraria in that you have to both face your character towards enemies or items as well as “aim” him. Combat can be kind of tricky at first and combined with knockback effects, downright awkward. I found myself struggling just to land hits against an AI that instantaneously switches to the exact counter to my current weapon. Thankfully the game has potions and other items which can be used to easily resolve combat, although with the added detriment of a cheapened accomplishment when one uses a potion of invulnerability to cheese a boss battle. Additionally the quests can be both tiresome and predictable (come to an area, 3 sub-quests, rinse and repeat).\n\nIn the end I didn’t think that Apotheon was a great game, but it wasn’t a terrible game either. If you can grab it for under $10 you’ll probably get your money’s worth on this one.\n","August 30, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The controls are really really floaty which put me off playing on hard. Easy was loads of fun though. The level design is absolutely world-class and they always used the engine in creative ways, whether it was racing in a hunt against Artemis in stag form or frantically trying to chuck invading dead people off Charon's barge. The music and voice acting are excellent throughout. Lots of pertinent quotes from Homer scattered about and every NPC is a name-drop... I just wish they could have been a bit more restrained with the overall plot, which is sadly pretty similar to God of War.

That's one hell of a phrase to throw around, but this game really earns it. This game went out to create the experience of being the hero greek myth and everything in the game goes to painstaking lengths to make sure you feel that way. The art is designed to look like it was painted on the side of a greek pot, where myths are so often seen painted, and everything seems to move that way as well. The voice acting is as good as one can ask for in an indie game and the music is brilliant. Youcan hear in the audio the epic and godly feel everythig is supposed to have. The combat feels very good and the need for skill is evident. Pulling off successful rolls into backstabs or taking down an dog as it jumps at you by throwing a well timed javelin is really rewarding.\n\nBut the best part of the game is by far the level design. A lot of research and love and a truckload of creativity went into the level design. It is perfect in that every area works by precisely the same rules but still feels entirely unique.  Your job is to gain the power of that god by fulfilling some task in their place on olympus and confronting them. Each area is desgned to reflect the god who lives there. For instance, Artemis lives in  a grove where hunters slay game all day and in order to be allowed an audience with her you must become the greatest hunter by slaying dangerous beasts.  Ares, aways the bloodthirsty, lives in  a giant kill dungeon where people slaughter eachother in an endless rage and you must slaughter Ares' enemies to see him.  And Hades is built so be a sad, unsettling place where those you kill come back to life so as a result,  the undead horrors you find there respawn soon after re-dying,  this gives the player the feeling that they don't want to be there long and forces them to run through the land of the dead for fear of joining them.\n\nThere are 7 different houses each with their own distinct feel which is what makes this game truly amazing and truly worth buying. The game was certainly not perfect and had quite a few flaws in terms of the execution of some of the fine points but artistically and design-wise, it is a masterpiece.","June 21, 2015","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Here are the most importanrt points:\n\n1) Graphics/art - I've never seen anything like it, unless you want to count the ancient Greek art it's based on. Seriously, just watch the preview video - its beautiful. Very crisp, with interesting uses of color and good detail. The creators even include readable stone etchings in the game that have real passages from ancient Greek literature, further adding to the atmosphere. The best way to say it, I think, is that the game has a feel of authenticity about it. You can really tell that the creators did their homework, and I think they did a fantastic job of giving the Greek mythos life.\n\n2) Music - Also fitting in with the setting, you will feel like Odysseus while you're listening to this soundtrack. War drums, chanting, full orchestrated scores - it's got it all. The tracks for the boss battles have a very epic feel to them; they really lend to the idea that you're fighting Gods.\n\n3) Gameplay -  Probably the other "best" from this game besides the art/music. I've never seen another game in this genre implement such a wide variety of weapons so well. You will have at your disposal quite a few ancient Greek weapons, including spears, swords, clubs, bow & arrows, javelins, greek fire, and a lot more. You can wield most weapons with a shield as well as throw them, and you can evasively roll back and forth to try and manuever into a better position or get behind your enemies. When you combine all of these elements, combat is very engaging and fun. Usually in games of this type, I find myself using one or two weapons that are clearly superior to the others, but that isn't the case here. I can honestly say that I used every weapon class in the game effectively, and I think that using all of the different weapons is part of what makes this games so fun. I can only speculate that the creators realized this early on, which is why the weapons have durability that runs out decently fast - it forces you to experiment.\n\nThe other aspect to the gameplay I wanted to mention is the scenario variety. Each boss battle, especially, and to a lesser degree, each quest, presents different sorts of challenges to the player. There is almost always more to it than "hit this enemy until he dies" or "go to this location and pick up this item." The level designs themselves are very unique, so often just getting through the level can be the most interesting part.\n\n4) Collectibles/side quests - Some games suffer from having nothing else to do outside of the main questline, while others suffer from overloading the game with collectibles and time-consuming sidequests. In my opinion, this games walks the line well. There are 2 achievements for collecting - 1 for getting all of the unique weapons in the game, and one for opening all of the chests(lockboxes) in the game. The weapons, however, are often found in the chests, so really you can focus on just finding the chests, which are not terribly difficult to find if you are constantly looking out for breakable walls and making sure to explore every area thoroughly.  The sidequests available range from simple tasks to fairly complex series of events that require trips to multiple areas. I didn't find any of the sidequests to be frustrating, which is a mistake a lot of games make.\n\n5) Minor points:\n- Each piece of armor you get permanently increases your total armor points, which basically acts as a second pool of hitpoints. However, you keep all of your old armor pieces, and since the increase is permanent, you can freely switch between armor pieces with no penalty. I found this to be very progressive and pleasing.\n- There is a multiplayer mode, though I cannot comment as I haven't tried it\n- A 3rd difficulty unlocks after you beat the game, Olympian Difficulty. Beating the game on this difficulty earns you the last achievement.\n\n6) Negatives: not many for this game.\n- I did have one save become irrevocably corrupted at one point, and it crashed the game whenever I tried to load it. Luckily, the autosave saved the day for me. Hopefully this isn't a widespread issue.\n- The character movement can be a little clunky & hard to get used to, and I hate that the character stops running whenever I hit stairs. I highly recommend playing with a gamepad, though this may vary if you're used to using a mouse/keyboard all the time.","July 13, 2015","true","19.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloughsburgh/recommended/208750/","bloughsburgh","Bloughsburgh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloughsburgh/","399 products in account","Dark themed Grecian Metroidvania.\n\nIf the above sentence piques your interest then look no further than Apotheon!\n\nSet in the wildly creative ancient Grecian times where Zues and his fellow gods and goddesses rule over the kingdom of man. You play as Nikandreos, a simple peasant armed with the responsibility to protect his beloved home town of Dion. Hera is there to meet you at the city's temple and tells you to vanquish the gods of Olympus. Thus begins an epic quest of godlike conquest. Mount Olympus can be seen as the world hub where you can explore different parts of the city, visit markets, break in to houses and even uncover a long buried secret or two.\n\nThe primary structure of the game is to enter a God's domain through one of the game's two main hubs. Inside each domain is a vastly unique set piece where you must display skills related to the god at hand. For example, in the Forest of Artemis you will be tasked to hunt legendary beasts and possible become a beast yourself in your ultimate quest to take on Artemis herself! Likewise, in Poseidon's realm, you will have to brave the seas that the old god controls himself to calm the spiteful deity's wrong doings. Each area really does have a life of it's own even if it uses the same art style throughout. Another piece of conversation of its own is the art design.\n\nI have never seen anything like this game's visual design. It's a 2D-open world-sidescroller at heart but the way it is presented just bursts with originality. It is hard to explain but just looking at the screen shots gives you an idea of paintings come to life. The breathing vivid colors of these pieces come to life give a sense of wonderment and otherworldly experiences like no other metroidvania. The different domains of gods use this visual style by shifting color palettes perfectly to suit the environment you are in. From the warm orange glows of the central hub Agora to the soft off-white blues of Poseidon's sea palace to the muted dismal tones of Hades, the worlds are brought to individual life from this masterful design. The gameplay is engaging and does not get old even to the very end of Nikandreos's arduous quest to become one with the gods.\n\nThe central gameplay element is exploring the realms of the gods and combat. Combat is simple yet intuitive as the popular deterrent to the norm of button mash is once again ill advised. Nikandreos attacks in concentrated swings, swings that drain a stamina bar which will cause him to take large amounts of breath in order to wind up another attack if he is not given some time to rest. Enemies do the same, where the have timed attacks and can shield/roll/fly/backpedal/ and charge at their opponent with little hesitation. While the combat is rather easy, I found the reactive style to be quite satisfying all the way through. Spear pieces flesh, sword slashes at sinews, and clubs bludgeon skulls. The instant ragdoll and sound of your foes dropping their weapons as their last breath leaves there sorry bodies is something to take in again and again.\n\nThe other side of the game resides in the player following certain laid out quests in order to gain audience with the god of that domain. You will encounter secrets, puzzles, and platforming challenges as the game plays out. Each challenge is presented in some unique way that never makes you tire of the formulae at hand.\n\nThere is a multiplayer that is both local and online, and while this is always welcomed I can see this being only a quick side interest to the major deal that is the single player campaign. There are also two difficulties with the last being unlocked after completing the game. I am curious to see how the increase challenge plays out and could easily provide more replay value for the hardcore Apotheoner.\n\nI can easily recommend Apotheon at it's full asking price of $15.00 USD. If you love metroidvania games then you will NOT be disappointed with Apotheon offering to the table!","July 22, 2015","true","16.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fleetfiend/recommended/208750/","Fleetfiend","Fleetfiend","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fleetfiend/","151 products in account","Apotheon is one of my favorite platformers, period.\n\nThe music and art are absolutely SUPURB. I highly recommend playing this game with good headphones, because it's worth fully sinking into. It's gorgeous, thematic, with great voice acting and a pretty good, fitting story (if you've played God of War, it will feel really familiar).\n\nThere is a wide variety of weapons, and they are all interesting in their own right. Because of the way weapons degrade in the game, I ended up trying all of them at least once, out of curiosity or necessity. The combat using said weapons is incredibly satisfying; the sound effects and the tight hitboxes really drove every hit home. Some parts of the game were definitely more challenging than others, and it never felt frustrating.\n\nMy only problems with this game have to do with the inventory management/controls, and slight bugginess. You can hold a very large number of weapons at a time, and it can be really tedious to equip the one you are looking for. You have to have the right type equipped (melee, ranged, tools, or support) and then scroll with the scroll wheel until you reach the right one. You can't really find what you want unless you take your eyes off of the action, which I didn't like at all. Also, the wide variety of weapons and potions in the game can feel a bit excessive at times. I used many of the weapons (and enjoyed the variety from a historical/mythological standpoint), but I rarely touched any support potions other than the healing one, which has its own hotkey.\n\nThere are also a few bugs in the game, but none of them were totally game-breaking. They would either cause crashes or a need to restart (due to an invisible wall or something), but the game would continue from a very recent checkpoint.\n\nApotheon is not perfect, but it is also really, really good. I wholeheartedly recommend it. After seeing this game, I couldn't stop thinking "why didn't I think of this?! It's such a good idea for a game," and it's well-implimented. I doubt it will happen, but I would love to see more; with Egyptian hierogliphic art!\n\n","August 21, 2015","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/208750/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Apotheon is a 2d sidescrolling platformer taking place in Greek mythology. You play the role of Nikandros, a human whose civilization was forsaken by the gods. Seeing your city in ruins, you make an alliance with an opportunistic Hera, who guides you through your quest of assassination and dethroning.\n\nThe graphics for this game are themed entirely around ancient Greek paintings such as those found on pottery or tapestries and it has a really neat look as a result. The soundtrack is also set along the same theme and various obelisks detailing actual Greek scripture can be found in each level. The weaponry mirrors that which one would find in ancient Greece and just about any other obvious reference you could make is accounted for.\n\nIf I had to pick one beef in this game, it would have to be the controls. The control scheme in this game is very similar to terraria in that you have to both face your character towards enemies or items as well as “aim” him. Combat can be kind of tricky at first and combined with knockback effects, downright awkward. I found myself struggling just to land hits against an AI that instantaneously switches to the exact counter to my current weapon. Thankfully the game has potions and other items which can be used to easily resolve combat, although with the added detriment of a cheapened accomplishment when one uses a potion of invulnerability to cheese a boss battle. Additionally the quests can be both tiresome and predictable (come to an area, 3 sub-quests, rinse and repeat).\n\nIn the end I didn’t think that Apotheon was a great game, but it wasn’t a terrible game either. If you can grab it for under $10 you’ll probably get your money’s worth on this one.\n","August 30, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The controls are really really floaty which put me off playing on hard. Easy was loads of fun though. The level design is absolutely world-class and they always used the engine in creative ways, whether it was racing in a hunt against Artemis in stag form or frantically trying to chuck invading dead people off Charon's barge. The music and voice acting are excellent throughout. Lots of pertinent quotes from Homer scattered about and every NPC is a name-drop... I just wish they could have been a bit more restrained with the overall plot, which is sadly pretty similar to God of War. The fact Zeus doesn't clobber humanity in a fit of divine grumpiness is sort of the point of him.","September 4, 2015","true","17.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WENDYS/recommended/208750/","WENDYS","TR Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WENDYS/","287 products in account","Artisticaly and technically speaking, this is one of the best games I have ever played. That's one hell of a phrase to throw around, but this game really earns it. This game went out to create the experience of being the hero greek myth and everything in the game goes to painstaking lengths to make sure you feel that way. The art is designed to look like it was painted on the side of a greek pot, where myths are so often seen painted, and everything seems to move that way as well. The voice acting is as good as one can ask for in an indie game and the music is brilliant. Youcan hear in the audio the epic and godly feel everythig is supposed to have. The combat feels very good and the need for skill is evident. Pulling off successful rolls into backstabs or taking down an dog as it jumps at you by throwing a well timed javelin is really rewarding.\n\nBut the best part of the game is by far the level design. A lot of research and love and a truckload of creativity went into the level design. It is perfect in that every area works by precisely the same rules but still feels entirely unique.  Your job is to gain the power of that god by fulfilling some task in their place on olympus and confronting them. Each area is desgned to reflect the god who lives there. For instance, Artemis lives in  a grove where hunters slay game all day and in order to be allowed an audience with her you must become the greatest hunter by slaying dangerous beasts.  Ares, aways the bloodthirsty, lives in  a giant kill dungeon where people slaughter eachother in an endless rage and you must slaughter Ares' enemies to see him.  And Hades is built so be a sad, unsettling place where those you kill come back to life so as a result,  the undead horrors you find there respawn soon after re-dying,  this gives the player the feeling that they don't want to be there long and forces them to run through the land of the dead for fear of joining them.\n\nThere are 7 different houses each with their own distinct feel which is what makes this game truly amazing and truly worth buying. The game was certainly not perfect and had quite a few flaws in terms of the execution of some of the fine points but artistically and design-wise, it is a masterpiece.","June 21, 2015","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Very nice characterization of the gods, they truly feel like the ancient greek gods, with all the characteristics, in the way they behave and interact, the way their temples look. ETC... VERY well placed and intresting dialog, you will never, "jesus i know already that, just skip it", exepitional writing, O.K voice over, the main characters are kinda good voice over but the normal peasants/NPC have 3 sentences max. Awesome graphics and aesthetics. And the thing that impressed me the most is the maturity they addressed sexuality, the greek society was one of the first to have the vision 'men should be fit viril and smart', not brutes, the 'mind and body to the perfect' kinda of thing. And, a lot of their art, (one of the most well known greek caracterictics) relflect that vision, i bet you already seen a photo (or the actual one in a museum) of a greek statue, 6-pack, big abs, pn out, "no fu*ks given" expression. (if you didn't, this[www.goddessgift.net] is what I mean), their reflection of the greek society is just, simulator grade, they aren't afraid of showing boobs and pn where is needed, and they aren't childish about it.  Level desing is very good. Look awesome, (like I said you always have immersion you are in a greek world) and are also awesome to navigate through. And the gamplay is fabulous, challeging, fair and  scalable to be very hard. it's physhics/hack'n'slash/timing based. People seemed to like the music a lot.

The artstyle is inspired from blackfigure painting during the Classical Greece in 7th-4th centuries BCE. The use of this style creates a visually distinct game that is pleasing to behold.\n\nIn regards to story, it is somewhat comparable to God of War where you are ultimately fighting against the Gods. The major difference though is the respect that is taken to the actual mythos surrounding the divinities. The modernized view of many of the divinities is taken away. Hades is not Satan, Apollo isn't Mr. Perfect. Additionally there are many homages to classical myth scattered throughout the game that should put a smile on any fan of Greek Mythology.\n\nGameplay is fairly solid. Combat is focused around on both aiming and timing attacks intandem with blocking and dodging oncoming attacks. There is a large variety of weapons both ranged and melee to be found in the game along with special weapons with unique properties. The weapons have durability which is a nice touch, altough I found that weapons break too quickly sometimes. I found a sword that I could not purchase in the market, so once it breaks I will be lucky to find another one. There is a hubworld system in the game that encourages exploration. You will end up saving a lot of money by doing this on armor and weapon purchases. Finally there is a crafting system that allows you create potions and tools to help you on your quest. Controls works but take some getting used to, I would prefer to have more hotkey options for the PC version.\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, this game is easily a hidden gem. It's a shame that this game didn't get more attention on release. This game is a must have for fans of the Classics and a high recommendation for people looking for a new Metroidvania experience.\n","December 22, 2015","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is certainly enjoyable and easy to play but it can be very confusing at times as well.\n\nI bougth the game, when Jerma said that he was voiceacting for it and I just wanted to hear it ingame myself. Now even though that was the main reason, I dont regret buying it at all for other reasons.\n\nThe Artstyle is beautiful and the voiceacting is on point. Fighting in this game is a little bit tricky but the player has enough chances not to die on various occasions. Like you can get knocked down to 1 health, and if you are quick and roll away you can heal yourself with a potion and head back into the fight.\n\nThe bossfights range from puzzles to actual fights. The puzzles take some time to understand and the fights themself... Well I found them a bit underwhelming. Even me, being decent enough to have no problems (or not many), managed to get thrown all over the place when fighing Neptune or the Giants. Other enemies didnt make it easier either. In the end it comes down to you being more spamhappy with the weapon than actual skilled combat, but that comes down to the 2D style of combat.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Yea. Its enjoyable and you can surely waste a lot of time with it by figuring out its secrets and hidden rooms and of course by playing its main game.","March 23","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayKayGray/recommended/208750/","JayKayGray","Hypersleep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayKayGray/","316 products in account","An almost Souls-like experience, Apotheon follows Nikandreos, lead by Hera as he slaughters everyone on Olympus one by one, and sometimes house by house, eventually usurping Zues himself. Refuge or god, none are safe from Nikandreos' primal rage as he fights to avenge a quite literally god-forsaken humanity.  A suprisingly varied experience as brilliant in aesthetic as it is in satisfaction from start to finish. I do reccomend playing on the harder difficulty on your first playthrough to get the most out of this game. The lower difficulty leaves you with far too many resources and breathing room. You are killing gods after all, prove yourself worthy to walk upon the Olympian summit.\n\nOne thing to note about this game is that a lot of your learning is done in a heavily autodidactic fashion. Such little tidbits will follow. Semi spoiler alert relating to the specifics of combat.\n\n1: Sweeping an enemies feet out will throw them into the air.\n2: Hitting them in the head with your swing will do more damage.\n3: When blocking, you need to aim your shield at the point of which the attack will impact with you. This is particularly needed in the final fight.\n4: If you get into a fight with guards around the 'non-combat' areas, either run as far as you can and hide. (The top left of the screen shows you portraits of who you are in combat with, and will fade away if they lose you.) But if you choose to fight, make sure you don't let them blow their horns. They will summon more dudes to fight and can do this endlessly.\n5: Middle mouse while blocking to do a shield smack, knocking people back and putting their guard down.\n6: Stackable weapons durabilities are individual to that weapon. For example, if you have a spear in your hand it's durability isn't shared with the other 4 hidden on your person.\n7: When breaking open stuff, if you have the time switch to your fist not to waste durability on weapons.\n\nThat's all that comes to mind right now just after finishing the game. I would love to see a similar style game but for Norse mythology instead of Greek. It would be brilliant.

Of course the first thing I noticed is how gorgeous it looks, I love ancient Greek black and red figure pottery, and this is the perfect style for a 2D game about Greek mythology, which I also adore. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters is lovingly crafted. The switch in colour palettes works very well to give different moods and personality to the different levels. The music is fantastic aswell.\n\nThe immersion is completed with superb writtng and voice acting. The inscriptions with actual texts from ancient authors from Homer and Hesiod to Apollodorus or Euripides are a beautiful detail that tells you the developers really did their research.\n\nNow to the gameplay. The combat is based in timing and momentum, the longer you run, the faster you run and if you hit an enemy with a running uppercut, it's joyous to see him flying away offscreen. I played with kb&m and managed well enough although sometimes I wasn't sure where my mouse was and couldn't turn or aim my blows effectively. The enemies can use the same moves, weapons and tricks you use, they switch between ranged and melee, they sometimes heal themselves, block, dodge and are generally competetnt AI. The weapons are varied and feel different, and you'll have to get used to different weapons because they break, even the special ones (they're not unique, only rare). Not usually a fan of weapon breaking but here it's done well. You always have other weapons you can use, even if they're not your specialty but you're never defenceless, and it won't be long until you can loot new weapons. I don't think I bought a single weapon from a trader in all my time ingame. Every item that's for sale you can find in the world (not so for training and crafting recipes).\n\nThe levels have their own mechanics and each one feels unique and original. Same goes for the bossfights.\n\nAs a negative point, the inventory management is not very good. Scrolling to select weapons gets a bit annoying when you have many and are looking for the right one. The shop inventory and the items description boxes can run off of the screen. But that's about it, I don't have any other complain. This is one of my favourite games of 2015, and if it's not THE favourite, it's because of The Witcher 3.","May 12","true","21.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentzero1/recommended/208750/","silentzero1","SilentZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentzero1/","21 products in account","Introduction:\nApotheon is an action adventure platformer based on ancient Greek mythology.  The gods have turned their backs on humanity, and you play as Nikandreos, a mortal warrior who takes up arms against the gods in order to save mankind.  Choose your weapon and get your war-face on, because it's about to get bloody divine up in here!\n\nTLDR Highlights:\n++ Artwork\n++ Level Design\n++ Challenging Combat\n+ Voice Acting\n+ Music\n\n- Combat Controls\n- Inventory System\n\nReview:\nPROS -- For starters, the artwork is amazing and really gives this game that ancient Greek mythological atmosphere!  It seriously amazed me the whole way through the game, because all of the different characters and monsters and maps kept bringing something new to the table.\n\nSpeaking of which, the level design was incredible.  Each level and location had it's own style and theme, not to mention it's own challenges and puzzles and combat strategies.  Not once did I feel bored or think to myself, "Oh, this again...."  because Apotheon keeps mixing it up and throwing something new at you every time you turn around.\n\nAs for combat, I found it to be quite a challenge, especially in the beginning when it took some getting used to.  Enemies are really good at dodging and blocking your attacks and putting themselves in great positions to attack you.  You'll need to master blocking and rolling, but also how to press an attack.  There are so many different weapons and fighting with each one can be a completely different experience.  For example, keep your distance and be sure to hit the enemy with the point end of the spear, not the shaft.  Use maces and clubs to break shields faster.  Hit enemies in the legs to take them to the ground, and use the momentum of a jumping attack to do more damage.  All these things matter!  Simply diving into the fray and mashing buttons won't be very effective.  In fact, it's more than likely going to get you killed!\n\nAfter all of that, it's the voice acting and music that breathes life into Apotheon, making the game that much more immersive and exciting.\n\nCONS -- Admittedly, the first hour or so of the game was a bit of a struggle for me, thanks to the controls, which were somewhat difficult to master.  This made combat even more challenging too, at least early on in the game.  There was a point near the beginning when I questioned whether or not this purchase was a good one.  If you ever feel the same way, take a deep breath, and keep trying, because it won't take too long before you're a force to be reckoned with!\n\nSort of related to combat controls is the downside of the inventory system.  As I mentioned earlier, there are a ton of weapons to choose from in the game, which means there's a lot to cycle through when you're changing weapons.  And it's an even bigger pain in the middle of battle.  Honestly, I'm not sure how it could have been done any better, but you do learn to plan ahead (where you can), selecting your main melee weapon, ranged weapon, potion, etc, before charging into battle rather than after it starts.  Still, it's a constant struggle regardless.\n\nOVERALL --  There's not much debate to be made here.  I'm extremely pleased with the game and even the early struggle with the controls can't come close to changing that.  If you are thinking about trying the game out, DO IT.  Apotheon is a real gem, and I highly recommend it!","March 8","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(playtime 4h)\n\nI had only played the intro. After that the difficulty goes up, and you get to choose between Warrior and Champion (if you want to go even more difficult). The game explains very little about what the goal of some boss/mini-boss battles is exactly, but it's easy to find out and you always just restart before the battle/mini-game without penalty. (so losing a few times isn't that frustrating, wasting arrows can be frustrating though)\n\nI'm still in the "OMG, the pottery graphics are beautiful"-phase, and it is a very enjoyable phase. The story is not very interesting, but it doesn't have to be (at least for a philhellenic like me!), the environment and the quotations as well as the broad range of challenges keep the game interesting.\n\nNegative points:\nThis game definitely suffers from AITKS (Arrow-In-The-Knee Syndrome) some of the NPC lines get really annoying when hearing them for the umptieth time.

It's certainly a main reason why I've bought it. And what makes it even better is an amazing soundtrack which breathes with mythology and epicness. The one thing that could and should be better visually vise is terrain. At least some parts, like the thin ones designed for vertical traversal. Those are just thin black lines and it looks really weird.\n\nBut what about the game mechanics? Well, they are ok.\n\nIt's a 2D game and the maps are usually both very horizontal and vertical. The traversing through the map isn't always without problems. Sometimes when you for example jump on a ladder the game won't notice that it's a ladder and you won't be able to climb it. There are these slim terrain parts which are there for you to change your vertical position (I obviously don't know how to explain it), by jumping while holding the Down key. Which isn't really that responsive, especially in combat.\n\nThe combat it self is just a click fest, even though you have a stamina which will deplete quickly. I think that they imagined the combat to by more tactical but I don't think that they've managed to do it. Main reason is the problem of the enemy AI with navigation on the map. If there is a vertical traversal or a jump sequence then they'll run around like crazy (especially the animals).\n\nYou can block, use different types of attack based on the mouse movement and roll around. It certainly can look good if there isn't too much of a chaos. But more often than not I had to just click attack button like a mad man.\n\nThe item progression is a particularly good one. There is a ton of different types of melee and ranged weapons, shields, armor parts, and special items like bombs, creature summons, healing and invisibility potions, the list goes on. There are a lot of special, mythical, weapons.\n\nThe way the armor works is kinda weird. You have few armor parts which increase your maximum armor. When enemies are hitting you, the armor goes down and after it reaches zero they'll start to attack your hit points. Then you can either fix your armor with Repair kit or destroy items (boxes, vases, whatever) and find armor points like this.\n\nThere are limits for how many of each items you can carry which honestly I don't understand. The main problem with items and combat is that the weapons can break down. And they'll break down really fast. It's not unusual that while you are fighting with few enemies three of your weapons will break down (because all of them were used previously) and you'll just see how every few seconds you have different kind of weapon in your hand. One moment you have short knife so you are right next to the enemy and suddenly you have 5 kilometers long spear in your hand and you can't hit him. I really don't understand reasons for this. And I don't think it fits with the mythology theme. There is a book written about you, great hero fighting gods and every third sentence is about how you have to switch weapon because another one had broken down?\n\nI don't know if I'll ever finish this game (I have played it for 7-8 hours so far, don't look at the hours steam is showing, I was waiting for trading cards:D) because Dragon's Dogma just came out and I don't find the story of Apotheon interesting. There isn't much of a story telling. You'll get few objectives and you can read few lines here and there about the gods. In the few lines of monologues, you can see their different personalities, and that's great. And I have to add that some of those objectives are really creative or at least interesting. So you are just playing around with these average mechanics while looking at a beautiful piece of art.\n\nIt's an interesting, beautiful looking game. I would like to see more, but with fleshed out mechanics. The UX could be better, the fighting system should be better, the map traversing should be better, the story telling should be better. Then it could really be an amazing experience. Now, if it would be without its visuals it would be an average game, with those visuals it can't be average but it isn't that much fun to play for a longer time.\n\nBuy it on sale.","January 16","true","25.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There's even an educational element to the game for those with absolutely no clue about Greek mythology (like me!).\n\nFor the relatively modest price the game is set at, this is a worthy purchase, particularly, if like me, you're looking for something a bit different.

Apotheon is a beautiful game and its soundtrack and environments are magical and immersive. The game is SUPER aesthetically pleasing, from its use of Attic Black-Figure pottery style, to the faux-ceramic texture of the screen (scratches and ribbing, which is the result of throwing pottery on a wheel, included!), to the beautiful use of color, light, and shadows. However, the game mechanics suck. A lot. It can get frustrating and downright annoying.\n\nIf you're looking for a new, relatively cheap but visually stunning game, I would recommend Apotheon. Also, if you have a background in Classical history or archaeology (like me), this game becomes even more delightful, as there are excerpts from Hesiod and Homer, and all of the gods were clearly designed with their ancient depictions in mind.

The combat system, while servicable is rather frantic, often you're flailing around trying to hit things rather than being able to decisively attack.  There are a large number of weapons... often too many, as there are no less than thirty different weapons at your disposal, most of which can be thrown as well as used at melee range, not to mention a wide variety of arrows.  This makes picking the right weapon for the job difficult at times, and as weapons tend to break (though you hardly ever find yourself NOT having one, as they're EVERYWHERE) you generally find yourself using whatever you have on hand.  Fortunately, this aspect DOES add to the feel of the game, as you're often pulling weapons off racks and hurling them at your attackers.  Quite often I've found satisfaction in hurling a short sword and embedding it in an enemy footman's forehead.\n\nThe power-ups are useful but none of them (until the final one, at least) are spectacular so the power up curve is very slight and almost imperceptible.  The enemies get harder and you get tougher, but the game never really seems to get any more or less difficult.  Depending on what you like, this can be a good or a bad thing, but I found it to be fortunate as the game never became a slog.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and interesting little gimmicks in the game that aren't really overused.  Many of the boss fights are unique and interesting and each god's area is flavored by their domain and personality appropriately.  If you are a fan of Greek mythology (or even have a passing knowledge) you should enjoy the references and there's also a ton of little blurbs from various ancient Greecian literature to flavor the events of the game.\n\nAs the game progressed, I found it to grow progressively more unstable, crashing several times near the end.  However, this was never more than a momentary irritation as checkpoints are numerous and the game has an autosave/continue system as well as a manual save should you need them.\n\nAll in all, a solid and entertaining piece of work.  I'm not sure if I'll try to beat it on anything other than the default difficulty, but I did find all the lockboxes and I completed MOST of the sidequests so there's a lot of fun to be had.  It's definitely worth its time and Zeus and the other gods are compelling enough to keep you going until the end just to stick it to them.","December 13, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Apotheon is a beautiful game and its soundtrack and environments are magical and immersive. The game is SUPER aesthetically pleasing, from its use of Attic Black-Figure pottery style, to the faux-ceramic texture of the screen (scratches and ribbing, which is the result of throwing pottery on a wheel, included!), to the beautiful use of color, light, and shadows. However, the game mechanics suck. A lot. It can get frustrating and downright annoying.\n\nIf you're looking for a new, relatively cheap but visually stunning game, I would recommend Apotheon. Also, if you have a background in Classical history or archaeology (like me), this game becomes even more delightful, as there are excerpts from Hesiod and Homer, and all of the gods were clearly designed with their ancient depictions in mind.

Makes you fan out to fight the Gods of Olympus.\n\n+Fun and creative gameplay.\n\n+Survivial (in a way), you pick up items on you're way, can buy items in stores, can trade items, but from as far as I can see, there is no selling weps or supplies.\n\n+Fun as hell bosses, and each boss sticks to a theme.\n\n+Some of the missions are hard as hell, but have great pay offs at the end.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMixed:\n\n~Music is pretty basic.\n\n~There is in fact voice acting for the text. But it varies, if anything, I hate how movie, tv shows, and video games do this stupid\nthing where they make everyone have a british accent. If I am playing a game about acient greek history, I would like the\ncorrect accent. It also switches off for some characters, going from british, to scotish, to an american accent.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons:\n\n-I am sure I am not the only one who has said this.\nBUT GOOD LORD THIS GAME'S STORY IS ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE "GOD OF WAR".\nYou are a mortal who has been left for dead by Zeus, you aint gonna take that ♥♥♥♥ and go and hunt him down. Of course Zeus's\nfollowers arent to happy so you have to kill them too.\nGood lord its like they took "God of war's" story and shoved it into one.\nNot to say "God of war" has a bad story, but there could be some more creativity into the story in "Apotheon".\n\n- Some of the game gets crazy, and pure unfair.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo in conclusion\nIs this game bad? Hell no, it has its flaws but in the end the game is a great buy.\n\nMy Rating: 7.5/10\n","December 13, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat system, while servicable is rather frantic, often you're flailing around trying to hit things rather than being able to decisively attack.  There are a large number of weapons... often too many, as there are no less than thirty different weapons at your disposal, most of which can be thrown as well as used at melee range, not to mention a wide variety of arrows.  This makes picking the right weapon for the job difficult at times, and as weapons tend to break (though you hardly ever find yourself NOT having one, as they're EVERYWHERE) you generally find yourself using whatever you have on hand.  Fortunately, this aspect DOES add to the feel of the game, as you're often pulling weapons off racks and hurling them at your attackers.  Quite often I've found satisfaction in hurling a short sword and embedding it in an enemy footman's forehead.\n\nThe power-ups are useful but none of them (until the final one, at least) are spectacular so the power up curve is very slight and almost imperceptible.  The enemies get harder and you get tougher, but the game never really seems to get any more or less difficult.  Depending on what you like, this can be a good or a bad thing, but I found it to be fortunate as the game never became a slog.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and interesting little gimmicks in the game that aren't really overused.  Many of the boss fights are unique and interesting and each god's area is flavored by their domain and personality appropriately.  If you are a fan of Greek mythology (or even have a passing knowledge) you should enjoy the references and there's also a ton of little blurbs from various ancient Greecian literature to flavor the events of the game.\n\nAs the game progressed, I found it to grow progressively more unstable, crashing several times near the end.  However, this was never more than a momentary irritation as checkpoints are numerous and the game has an autosave/continue system as well as a manual save should you need them.\n\nAll in all, a solid and entertaining piece of work.  I'm not sure if I'll try to beat it on anything other than the default difficulty, but I did find all the lockboxes and I completed MOST of the sidequests so there's a lot of fun to be had.  It's definitely worth its time and Zeus and the other gods are compelling enough to keep you going until the end just to stick it to them.","December 13, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art, music, story, and level design tied together to create a compelling experience that felt like something Homer wrote. The game also does a good job with pacing; it's doesn't take too much time to feel like you've made a decent amount of advancement in it. I have two critiques of the game. First, the controls are a little awkward. The fights usually feel pretty epic, but if you stop too close to an enemy it gets really weird as your weapon swings go right past each other. Second, the inventory screen is a little cumbersome and keeps track of unnecessary things like obsolete armor types. Overall, I'd give this game a solid B+.","March 4","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls were great, the story was interesting and the weapon variety made the combat fun. The art style looked cool throughout the game. The only issue I had was that once you threw all of one type of weapon (ex spears) it just swaps to the next and you can keep throwing. There were serveral times I threw every sword, axe, etc before I realized I was out of spears. Veni, vidi, vici!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magefire/recommended/208750/","magefire","Jason_c_o","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magefire/","398 products in account","TL;DR Apotheon has become one of my favorite games in my Steam library.\n\nA lot of reviews call this game a Metroidvania, I however, do not think it quite falls into that category. To me, it was more of a side-scrolling action RPG. Metroidvanias tend to lock advancement through abilities, Apotheon is gated through objectives. While you can earn new equipment and (some) do grant new abilities, you do not gain access to new areas through these assets. Equipment, namely weapons and shields, have durability and you must replace them as you face combat. Armour, on the other hand, acts as a buffer to your health and can be increased permanently by buying/finding new pieces. You can also increase your attack speed and damage with the various weapon types by paying a skill trainer.\n\nThe story is well written and, from what I understand, is very accurate to the personality and positions of the gods. It is a unique story, I believe, so just knowing their legends won't spoil the experience for you. It was a very atmospheric game, and I very much felt alone against the gods. While these games won't quite warrant comparison in a gameplay sense, it brought to me memories  reminiscient of Morrowind and Dark Souls, with it's patient yet frantic combat and well-designed atmosphere. The dialogue of even minor characters really grips you, and snipets of the legends of the gods scattered throughout on little statuettes wrap the whole package together quite nicely.\n\nQuests were quite varied, even going so far as to introduce new mechanics temporarily just to mix up the formula and keep the game interesting. This was very refreshing and kept the game from feeling redundant or tedius.\n\nIt's not without it's cons. I played through entirely on normal difficulty and, while some battles did present somewhat of a challenge, I found it quite easy because of the abundance of new shields and healing items. I never lacked for protection, and armour upgrades seemed to come quickly. There is the option shortly after the introduction to increase the difficulty and I wish I'd done so right away. It is also worth mentioning that, after game completion, an Olympian difficulty is unlocked.\n\nThe physics can, at times, also act a little wonky. This is not a spritegrid-based physics system, and things can act a little rag-dolly. Every once in a while I'd take a hit that would send me flying across the area just because of how it connected. After you get use to the physics of the game this isn't really a hinderance, but worth mentioning. It can make some fights take a little longer than necessary.\n\nI'll end this review with some tips for new players, mechanics the game doesn'tmake obvious:\n-Saves DO NOT work by slot! The most recent save is always at the top of the list. Be careful when overriding as your save may not be quite where you expect it to be in the list.\n-While you may aim with the mouse/right stick, the direction of the LEFT stick can change the type of melee attack you perform with the weapon.\n-Using the throw button IS NOT a quick button for your equipped ranged weapon, but will instead throw your currently equipped melee weapon. Useful for surprising enemies and ditching weapons low on duraility.","January 20","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Looking at the interface and graphics they both are aesthetically pleasing also might I add dynamic. The story seems very historically accurate due to all of the Greek Gods that appear in Apotheon. This game has all pros and only one con ( for me )which is that this game requires a enhanced skill tree based system ( do not quote on this as I have only played it for a small amount of time ).\n\nOverall I give this game a 8.5/10 as the skill tree is fundamentally required for a RPG type game.\nOr\nA 9/10 if I am wrong about the skill tree.","February 5, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Apotheon uses the distinct ancient Greek pottery art style to portray ancient Greece and it works excellently. The world is unfolding before you as if you were looking at a genuine ancient Greek vase and with the brilliant use of lighting effects Apotheon leaves an impression like no other game.\n\nExploration is also a big part of Apotheon. Level and world design are very thoughtful and immersive with a good variety of landscapes, from the lush forest of Artemis where you can hunt game, to the dark, spine-chilling Underwolrd where lost souls crave for your warm blood, the game delivers a fantastic world to discover.\n\nThere are plenty of mini-quests and hidden areas along the way to keep you sidetracked and like any respectable RPG, you can enter houses, break vases, steal goods, collect unique weapons, craft consumables and although weapons break, you will always find some new toy to play with.\n\nSecond, the game mechanics. Movement is done like any other platform game, you can jump, roll behind enemies, grab on edges and more, while combat is similar to Mount & Blade's. You aim/attack with the mouse and you can change the direction of your attacks by moving the mouse up or down. Also the speed of your character and his position affect the damage done, so gaining momentum before an attack, or hiding behind your shield play a big part in combat.\n\nThe combat itself feels very precise and fluid with enough weapon variety to make it satisfying. Breaking shields with a big mace, outmaneuvering them with a long spear, rolling behind them and stabbing them in the back with a sword, pinning them down with a bow or even summoning various creatures to aid you in battle. And although every weapon in the game has it's uses, you can focus on playing with the ones you like and enjoy the most.\n\nPersonaly I've never played a game that represents the iconic Hoplite better, so if you crave for some spear & hoplon action, you won't find it elsewhere.\n\nLastly, I would also like to note the ability to customize how your character looks, something that most games seem to ignore but in my opinion is very important in every game that utilizes armors.\n\nApotheon has become one of my favourite games of all time and I've been playing pc games since the age that Lost Vikings came out.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n-Enjoyable and dramatic story.\n-Unique and impressive art style.\n-Brilliant level/world design and compelling exploration.\n-Satisfying Combat, good variety of weapons.\n-Fair price for what the game delivers.\n","February 9, 2015","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Makes you fan out to fight the Gods of Olympus.\n\n+Fun and creative gameplay.\n\n+Survivial (in a way), you pick up items on you're way, can buy items in stores, can trade items, but from as far as I can see, there is no selling weps or supplies.\n\n+Fun as hell bosses, and each boss sticks to a theme.\n\n+Some of the missions are hard as hell, but have great pay offs at the end.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMixed:\n\n~Music is pretty basic.\n\n~There is in fact voice acting for the text. But it varies, if anything, I hate how movie, tv shows, and video games do this stupid\nthing where they make everyone have a british accent. If I am playing a game about acient greek history, I would like the\ncorrect accent. It also switches off for some characters, going from british, to scotish, to an american accent.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons:\n\n-I am sure I am not the only one who has said this.\nBUT GOOD LORD THIS GAME'S STORY IS ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE "GOD OF WAR".\nYou are a mortal who has been left for dead by Zeus, you aint gonna take that ♥♥♥♥ and go and hunt him down.

The combat system, while servicable is rather frantic, often you're flailing around trying to hit things rather than being able to decisively attack.  There are a large number of weapons... often too many, as there are no less than thirty different weapons at your disposal, most of which can be thrown as well as used at melee range, not to mention a wide variety of arrows.  This makes picking the right weapon for the job difficult at times, and as weapons tend to break (though you hardly ever find yourself NOT having one, as they're EVERYWHERE) you generally find yourself using whatever you have on hand.  Fortunately, this aspect DOES add to the feel of the game, as you're often pulling weapons off racks and hurling them at your attackers.  Quite often I've found satisfaction in hurling a short sword and embedding it in an enemy footman's forehead.\n\nThe power-ups are useful but none of them (until the final one, at least) are spectacular so the power up curve is very slight and almost imperceptible.  The enemies get harder and you get tougher, but the game never really seems to get any more or less difficult.  Depending on what you like, this can be a good or a bad thing, but I found it to be fortunate as the game never became a slog.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and interesting little gimmicks in the game that aren't really overused.  Many of the boss fights are unique and interesting and each god's area is flavored by their domain and personality appropriately.  If you are a fan of Greek mythology (or even have a passing knowledge) you should enjoy the references and there's also a ton of little blurbs from various ancient Greecian literature to flavor the events of the game.\n\nAs the game progressed, I found it to grow progressively more unstable, crashing several times near the end.  However, this was never more than a momentary irritation as checkpoints are numerous and the game has an autosave/continue system as well as a manual save should you need them.\n\nAll in all, a solid and entertaining piece of work.  I'm not sure if I'll try to beat it on anything other than the default difficulty, but I did find all the lockboxes and I completed MOST of the sidequests so there's a lot of fun to be had.  It's definitely worth its time and Zeus and the other gods are compelling enough to keep you going until the end just to stick it to them.","December 13, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I won't go into detail about that here because it's been talked about a lot already. The other things I liked were the open world elements of the game- you can go back and revisit nearly every area if you want. It's possible to beat the game in a pretty short amount of time if you don't do any of the non-essential side quests and activities, but all of these are fun and often give you extra powers. The combat has been compained about quite a bit, and this brings me to my next point: if you have really bad framerates, it's not very fun. Because of the nature of combat- very timed, not button mashing, directonal, etc- it's a challenge. I was getting ~20fps from my laptop, and that was no fun. However, once I started playing on my desktop PC, it was far more enjoyable. The combat is love-it-or-hate-it, I suppose, but I found it engaging and rather difficult. Most of the boss battles are great, as well. Storyline? It's kind of a standard ancient tale, I guess. Not much, to be honest, and your charcter never speaks. The deities are accurate in their personalities.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Apotheon for its amazing visual quality, refined combat, limited RPG elements, and atmosphere.","March 31","true","43.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though it's only a 2D platform game the graphics themselves are absolutely perfect. Done in a style of ancient greek paintings and mozaiques it unbelieveably matches the whole atmosphere of the game and is a pleasure to watch. Also each and every place you visit has a different atmosphere, from welcoming Agora of the Olympus, to hostile swamps under Artemis' realm, it really spices the game up and makes you feel you are still about to discover more and more unique locations, it never makes you bored.\n\nAnother jewel of this game is the outstanding soundtrack composed by greek composer Marios Aristopoulos <3 . For each part of the Olympus (at which you operate in this game), or other destinations there is a different theme music which fits the nature of the place perfectly. When playing in the Hades' realm of the Underworld I was actually pretty scared solely because of the song playing in there.\n\nThe story itself is very interesting as well and I really liked the differences between each of the numerous bosses appearing throughout the game as well as the unique ways of defeating them, every single one of them had a different approach and developers of this game really took everything they could and used every opportunity the 2D platform RPG game offered.\n\nFor me as a lover of greek mythology this game earned it's place in my heart and I would really like to thank the developers for creating this game (not game a masterpiece within games!) and it pleases me that even in these times, some people are still passionate enough to make a game about the awesome greek mythology!\n\nI highly recommend Apotheon to everyone, this piece of art will just suck you in and won't let you out until you finish it and maybe not even then.\n\nThat's it, thanks to the ones reading it this far and I hope that one day the 'gods in making games' at Alientrap will bring us something even more awesome than this, even though trumphing Apotheon will be an extremely hard task. :))","September 11, 2015","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

By the end of the game you actually start feeling like a true hero, even if the ending is slightly unexpected.\n\nBoss fights are engaging, and there's a few bosses indeed. Not all are about fighting 100%, for some you solve puzzles or take trials which makes the game actually seem engaging. Even for the bosses themselves, each have their own abilities and at times you need to perform several tasks before you can even start the battle.\n\nFurthermore, through the plaques sitting around you learn quite a bit about the actual myths and stories of real life ancient Greek gods, which is an awesome bonus.\n\nThe artwork is amazing, it feels as if you're actually a mural on a greek wall/vase making your way and seeing the story being drawn so to say, and the artwork is really amazing in my opinion.\n\nThe sound is nice, the music fits the moment and the athmosphere.\n\nYou have different upgrades for your charater, weapons that do different things, both melee and ranged that you can upgrade by getting new and improved ones.\n\nOne small problem is the attack direction, with melee weapons your character attacks depending on where your mouse is in 3 directions, direct attack, upwards attack and downwards. That being said it's a bit hard at times to actually get the attack you want. This will be mostly evident at melee bosses and at the last boss.\n\n\nOverall, an amazing game that I'm glad to have bought. Interesting, great story, great gameplay, visuals and music.

However, as you pass the first stage of the game, which is learning the mechanics and geting used to the controls, the game becomes surprisingly interesting and rewarding.\n\nThe story takes place in ancient Greece where the mortal world is abandoned by the gods of Olympus. The gods no longer have a use for humans and since they are also merciless and cruel, they are punishing them. You are a warrior named Nikandreos who seeks to prevend the destruction of your home and people. You meet various gods that help you or try to hurt you and other lessergods or heroes of the rich greek mythology. If you have studied greek mythology then many of the substories will be familiar to you.\n\nThe presentation is a strong point of this game. A unique art style which is based on the ancient greek mythology and the result is very pleasant to the eye. The music and sound of the game is very good as well. No memorable tracks in general but it all comes together nicely, visuals and sound, it doesn't tire you at all.\n\nGameplay wise Apotheon is an action scroller but it has some rpg elements like weapon and armor management, skill enhancement, a market etc.. but the fighting and the rpg stuff is very well balanced. Playing the game on higher difficulty is in my opinion demanded in order to appreciate the rpg side of the game, otherwise it feels just like an brainless action slasher.\n\nAs for the negatives, the difference between normal level of difficulty and the higher ones can be frustrating and the controls can be very punishing. The battle sometimes gets glitchy and some key parts of the game can be abused and get passed taking advantage of the controls. Also in some parts of the game I spend a lot of time backtracking which is very annoying in these types of games since you are expecting to play a straightforward action game.\n\nAll in all, despite being frustrating at some parts, Apotheon was a pleasant surprise. A cool theme- greek mythology, a slick presentation, nice sound, a balanced set of gameplay mechanics, moderate puzzle solving and a nice level design. I got to say that 2-3 levels as you get to the end of the game have very cool ideas and are really unique. The Athena one, the Poseidon, and a couple of others were great. Definitely looking forward to Apotheon 2.","April 24","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I personally had no issues with the controls on a game pad and it lead to some interest attack and shield defense moves.\n\nAs far as the game goes.\n-Great Greek filled mythological story.\n-Great soundtrack (DLC, well worth adding on).\n-Full Voice acting is superb.\n-Beautiful level areas along with secret locations held within.\n-Fun and interesting combat system with both mythological weapons.\n-The ability to improve your hero’s Armor and Weapon proficiencies.\n-Simple and nice inventory/crafting system.\n-Adjustable Level Difficulty settings.\n-Complete gamepad mapping.\n-Multi-player Local (Have not attempted this yet).\n-Co-Op (coming soon).\n\nIt will nice to see if there will be any add-ons in the future to continue the story of Apotheon.\n\nHaving been playing games in all genera’s since my first commodore 16, there have been moments over the past few years that I was looking for something enjoyable and not bloated with all that “Look at all the things our game offers” and then to find out most of those things are broken or just weigh the overall experience down. Apotheon is a beautiful game that offers just the right amount of everything to make entertaining and continues bringing back for longer play sessions. It has been a long time since I played a game with such enjoyment or even looked forward to playing as much as I do with Apotheon.\n\nThe only thing I would like to see in the future is an equipable inventory system for a DLC continuation of Apotheon story.\n\nThank you Apotheon Team.","February 5, 2015","true","32.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

Extremely well composed and suited to the atmosphere of the game. Just like in Hotline Miami, the music makes of a very important factor in this game.\n\nStory: The story itself isn't really jawdropping, but features very well designed gods, both in terms of their appearance and character.\n\nCombat: The controls might be a bit unintuitive at the beginning, but you will get used to them quite quickly. Although relatively simple, the combat really has a high skill cap, especially on higher difficulty levels.\n\nDifficulty: Very difficult, especially on Champion and Olympian levels. The difference between Warrior and Champion is pretty huge, but unfortunately enough for the fans of extreme challenge, the only difference between Champion and Olympian is the lack of health regeneration. Still, the bosses can be really painful and will often require preemptive strategy and tactics to beat them.\n\nOverall: 9/10.\nAlthough I wouldn't place this game in the pantheon (hue) of the greatest indie games of all time (ex. FTL, Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain, Shovel Knight), it is still a must buy for any person who likes platforming, the interesting graphics and difficult combat.\n\nPS.\nUse hatchets for maximum manliness.","June 29, 2015","true","37.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This. Game. Is. ♥♥♥♥ing. Amazing! Absolutely the best action-adventure-platformer I've played this year! I give it a huge 10/10!\n\nThe setting is so beautifully expressed through the fantastic graphics Apotheon has to offer. Everything blends together well while keeping the foreground action obvious. Never do you get confused or lose your character. The art direction is exceptional.\n\nThe controls are soooooooo tight—they would have to be to make the crux of the gameplay so manageable and easygoing. Well, I say "easygoing," but in reality, the game's hard as balls if you let it take you over. You're rewarded for going out of your way to explore little nooks, finding more and new weapons and armors to better define your playstyle. You may not like swords for their short range, so you decide to use spears, although you might not like spears for their stabbing attack animations, so you start using maces for their arch and shield-breaking capabilities.... You decide how you want to play Apotheon... It gives you the freedom to go wild. I believe that might be where people make the comparison with Dark Souls: How you can be plotted right into a battlefield with no hand-holding, having to learn on your own. It's quite a marvelous experience.\n\nThe soundtrack, produced by Marios Aristopoulos, is phenominal. From the moment you begin your epic, to your final battle, Marios compliments the beautiful scenery with a range of ambient to intense music (all strings, by the way) to create the perfect atmosphere!\n\nEnemies are difficult as ajghksjbnfk.jasdbnlf. They're soooo difficult later on, they're sooo annoying, but they're sooooo satisfying to overcome, considering there is no one way to beat them. Learning patterns isn't about determining how the developers intended for the enemy to be killed, it's about figuring out when it would be optimal for you to get a hit off before he manages to stagger you. I say this, however I can't attest to how the Normal gamemode plays. Having done my first playthrough on Champion (the hardest of the two difficulties), I definitely felt as though that was the way the game was intended to be played. I haven't played the Normal mode, but the descriptions for the two are really quite accurate. Hell, there's a potion in the game that removes the enemies' ability to stagger you temporarily, while getting staggered is only possible in Champion difficulty. Aaaaaaaaall this to say: Play the game on Champion. You'll have an intense time.\n\nI don't know how to close this off. This game was so phenominal! Everything was done deliberately; You can feel the quality! There are absolutely no inconsistencies that I had an immediate reaction to or anything. No graphical issues, no audio issues, no gameplay issues.... nothing felt unfair. It was just a solid, absolutely QUALITY game... and I give it a big ol', delicious, whole-hearted 10 out of 10.","September 18, 2015","true","13.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The whole game is steeped in Greek myth, as you would know if you watched the trailer, and I can see the amount of effort the devs put into this game. Art work is beautiful and I was never once bored with this game.\n\nAs for replayability, I'd say it's okay. I would play it again in a bit because it's just that good, albeit in a harder mode. Multiplayer has been set up too so you can now spear your friends to death.\n\nMy only regret is getting this game on sale.

The angle and momentum of your attacks are important if you want to take down your enemies efficiently. The game also offers a plethora of melee and ranged weapons to use according to occation or to your liking.\n\nStory wise  its the same old scenario where a man goes against the gods of Olympus, nothing we haven't already seen in other games, namely God of War, or in movies.\n\nLevel design is generally good and unique which helps to retain players' interest. On the other hand the total game length is rather short.\n\nIn addition, as in every platform game, there is some puzzle solving, alas not complex enough (or at all) in many cases.\n\nAs for the art style, a simple glimpse says it all. The use of ancient greek vase artwork for a 2D platform game is not only convinient for this genre but it bonds extremely well with both the theme, story and gameplay.\n\n\nOverall its a very good 2D platformer and certainly its worth its price value, though it needs a little bit more features and content.","August 3, 2015","true","18.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now we can add yet another incident to his already long list of misdeeds. By his decree, the gods have turned their back on humanity essentially condemning it to oblivion. Someone ought to pull that lightning bolt out of his butt one of these days. But humanity has a wildcard in the form on Nikandreos who, with a little assistance from Hera, ascends to Mount Olympus to confront the gods and Zeus himself face to face. Not all gods agree with their King and will be more than happy to help you out, but you’ll also face some of them in direct combat.\n\nApotheon is a 2D side-scrolling action adventure game with open-ended design. The first thing that you will undoubtedly notice is the fantastic art style, it basically looks like a playable ancient Greek vase. It’s a game that is always a pleasure to look at. Most of the game has a wonderful orange tone, but some areas use a different color palette. For example, the forest of Artemis takes on a greenish hue whereas Poseidon’s realm is sensibly blue. The visual style is very well complimented by an appropriate soundtrack. The sense of atmosphere is heightened further with excerpts from classic Greek literature most notably Homer’s Illiad.\n\nNikandreos can wield an extremely wide assortment of weapons and use a ton of varying gear. Aside from classic melee weapons of the era such as swords, spears, clubs and maces, you can also use ranged weapons such as arrows (of which there are multiple types), discs and small oil containers that serve as bombs. You can also use shields and set up traps. There are even some mystical weapons that summon skeletons or wild animals to fight at your side. It all contributes to a varied and emergent combat system. However, the mechanics and the controls aren’t as tight as you want them to be in a game like this. You want pinpoint precision in combat and platforming and Apotheon is definitely lacking in that area. It all feels a bit loose, a bit clunky even.\n\nThe level design is really good, there are plenty of areas and they are all quite large and filled with different kinds of loot and secrets. There are also various segments that are a bit on the short side, but they definitely add to the variety. For example, there’s a combat sequence which enables you to fight on horseback, there are multiple swimming and diving areas (one even offered the ability to ride a seahorse). Also, encountering each boss either in combat, puzzle or mini-game is not only different, but is built around that particular god. For example, Artemis and Nikandreos exchange turns where one is the hunter and the other a deer until one hunts down the other whereas Dionysus requires Nikandreos to get drunk at his party.\n\nEven though the gameplay mechanics and controls could use a lot of fine-tuning, Apotheon is a genuinely great game with a lot of variety. It looks amazing, the game world is a joy to explore and it remains thoroughly interesting throughout.\n\n8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)","May 10, 2015","true","16.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You play as a human who is tasked with taking down various gods after they decide that humanity is not worthy of existing, and climb Mount Olympus to meet and battle Zeus. There is a surprising amount of depth in the various weapons you can equip and potions/projectiles you can use, which help you to explore the various dungeons and fight the multiple entities trying to stop you in your tracks. The artstyle is probably the best feature of the game, although the soundtrack grants a specific atmosphere which helps to immerse you in the mythology of the subject matter. This is a great title if you're looking for an action-adventure game that is a little different than usual.","January 28","true","11.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/recommended/208750/","Aizawaa","crowbAr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/","342 products in account","rating: worth buying at sale price (<8€)score: 6/10 - solid\nsimilar games: Disney´s Hercules Action Game, Rogue Legacy, Dark Souls\ntarget audience: fans of greek mythology, metroidvania (this is not a metroidvania though), exploration\n\nApotheon is a beautiful game. There were parts I really liked this game, but there were also parts where the game was ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. It has some really cool ideas, but the devs also made some bad design decisions. Still, its worth a play, especially because of its satisfying ending and even for its full price you cant do much wrong, but I recommend waiting for a sale.\n\nGameplayMy biggest problem with Apotheon was that it wasnt a challenging game. The problem is not that the combat is too easy, but there are some features which breaks the challenge. First the fact that you can have healing items in your inventory is a bad design decision in my opinion (for this game) and even worse is that you can craft healing items. Even if you play bad, you can just keep healing and go. Crafting healing items isnt even that hard and also you will find tons of healing items on the way. Until half of the game I always had the maximum amount of healing items in my inventory and later I only had less because I started wasting them since I didnt need to fight efficient anyway. There are some ways you could solve this, I think for this kind of a game a health system like Dark Souls would be best. You get a set amount of potions and can only refill them at checkpoints. This way the devs always know how much potions the player has and can balance that part of the level accordingly.\nAnother thing which breaks the challenge is that dieing in this game is meaningless, you just respawn and can continue. I didnt really understand how it works, cause sometimes everything was the way it was before after respawn, sometimes everything reset, maybe it depends if its a boss fight or not, I dont know.\nThe AI sometimes does really random things or makes an extremely fast move or jump which makes them annoying to fight sometimes. The most annoying enemies were the sentrys, because they attack so fast that you cant block an arrow and make a counter attack after that, you HAVE to take a hit (on higher difficulty at least). There are even more annoying when they are at the ceiling and use blast arrows or hydra fangs.\nSome enemys have really powerful attacks which is fine, but sometimes those attacks launch you 100km away to weird places, also annoying. The inventory system is a mess. Extremely clonky and hard to manage, annoying.\nAt at last there are some O P consumable potions, especially the potion which makes you invulnerable which COMPLETELY breaks the game, they are not even hard to craft its ridiculous. They should take out EVERY consumable item.\n\nSo whats good about this game? Combat, even if sometimes annoying, is still fun, especially because of the many many different enemy types which I really appreciate. Later in the game when you have many more tools to fight with, combat gets even more fun and sometimes you can pull of crazy moves which will kill many enemys at once which is very satisfying to do.\nThere are many different weapons, which behave different more or less, there are also some rare weapons with special effects. Same goes for shields and bows. You can summon minions, set traps, use bombs, there is alot you can do and whats more important is that you NEED to use different tactics against different kinds of enemys.\n\nThe devs had some neat ideas for every level, the game has enough variety so you never get bored, unless the game gets too annoying. The boss fights were really fun and some of them really well made, especially the final boss. However the invulnerability potions breaks every fight (fortunately I figured them out really late so I used them only in 2 fights).\n\nOverall the gameplay is fun, motivating, satisfying and rewarding because of a nice progression system. All parts of the game are full of annoyances though, for some people more, for others less, so for you this could be a blast to play, or a very frustrating experience. For me the good parts made up the annoying things so I can recommend this game.\n\nNarrativeThe narrative of the game is basicly God of War. You are a human, Zeus is bored so he makes orders to destroy humanity or something like that, you want revenge and save your people so you kill every greek god until Zeus. The nice thing is that you probably know about greek mythology, so when you see your next objective which is for example "kill Ares", then you already are excited about it before you even meet him. This works because they gave them interesting personalitys, well at the end most of them are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but still they are fun to listen to. They have good voice actors are their writing is fine.\nThere is no real big narrative though, its just something to give the gameplay some context, but thats fine to me, and at least it keeps you motivated throughout the game.\n\nAesthetics/ GraphicsThe game looks beautiful, there is not much to say about its visuals. It can get a bit dull though, some areas of the game have different color palettes which bring some variety. The problem I have with the aesthetics is that sometimes there was too much on the screen and it was hard to tell where my character was standing or were I was aiming, or I didnt identify something as a trap which explodes when you attack it so I accidently made things explode many times.\nOh also there are many naked people, including ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nSoundtrackMusic is good. Has enough variety and fits the game and its mood. Not much to say about it really.","February 26, 2015","true","6.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

The story is good, the graphics are awesome (especially seems there is limited variation in colours) and the controls are good, took me a second to adjust to attacking with the RT on the controller but I adapted fast enough and the options to change bindings are there.\n\nThe subtle tutorial approach I liked, no pestering but all the information was provided without text walls, it was very simplistic.\n\nI recommend this game, to all sorts of gamers and I recommend the risk even if scrollers aren't your favourite style.","April 17, 2015","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I believe I read a small review about it and shortly after checked out its Steam page. Immediately its art style hooked me as i've always been a fan of Roman and Greek mythology as well as their cultures. I also love the history and combat from the era and when I saw this game was done entirely in Greek mythology art style I decided I was going to go in blind on this game and just buy it there and then. It looked great and it met any expectations I had. It was a bit of a different game than I expected. Its a Metroidvania type game that is similar to a lot of the recent 2D platformers from the current era. Its challenging combat and beautiful art and animations immediately grabbed me and that was just the scratching the surface. As I got into the game I found it had more depth than I expected, varied weapons and items, fun secrets and side missions, great sound and voice acting and just a huge charm which made it feel so unique even though there are so many other Metroidvania games out there.\n\nEverything in the visuals department sets Apotheon apart from other games and its amazing animation quality plays into the combat and gives it a very, very deliberate and visceral feel. They really did an amazing job on it and it stood out to me through my entire experience. Its a combat system that is a bit finnicky at first, is so satisfying once accustomed to and difficult to master. The combat I really feel makes this game worth playing and truly was handled perfectly to match the style of this game. Apotheon also controls fantastically, again it took a bit of getting used to because the game is animation heavy but once you get used to it the feeling of momentum from running and jumping just feels wonderfully on keyboard or controller. The same can be said for the combat as each blow landed feels visceral and has impact. The combat is deliberate, every attack commits your character to the action so the combat takes on a bit of a Dark Souls feel where some thought and patience is required to really accell at it. The game features a fairly large number of bosses each with their own challenges. The game never felt like it was getting stale as it threw in new twists to the combat at every turn with new enemy types and new level types to fight in. In one level you can barely see, its pitch black and you only have a torch to light the way a few meters in front of you. In another level you're battling mermen under water which restricts your ability to use ranged weapons accept for one which was made for the mermen's use. The voice acting is top notch and every God character has personality and identities. The story was well done and well told with lots of cool lore and history on the Greek Gods and every weapon and piece of armor has its own model and there are a lot of them. Theres a crafting system for consumables but its nothing to write home about. And each level looks beautiful and feels unique for the most part. The levels can blend together a bit because of how consistent the art style is but the color pallete is great and there are awesome contrasts and colors to give the game a really great feeling of majesty and beauty.\n\nPros -\n-Great combat system. Satisfying and brutal, pretty easy to learn yet hard to master.\n-Tons of different weapons, shields, items and armor each with their own unique models.\n-Expansive levels with lots of secrets and items to be found as well as enemies to fight.\n-Varied enemies.\n-Great voice acting\n-Strong, well told story.\n-Beautiful art style and color scheme.\n-Authentic feeling environment.\n-Awesome final battle.\n\nCons -\n-Weak crafting system.\n-Boss fights can be unintuitive at first.\n-Combat encounters can get a little repetative at times though not often.\n-Normal difficulty isn't very challenging, I felt very overpowered by the end of the game.\n\nAll in all this game is absolutely worth $15 for my money. It was bigger, badder and better than I expected it to be. It lasted about 15 hours for 1 play through though, its probably realistically closer to 10-12 hours. It has multiple difficulty settings for extra play time as well as a multiplayer mode. I've not tried the Multiplayer so I can't speak for it but if it uses the combat system and runs smoothly I imagine its a lot of fun. I just bought this game not expecting the amount of detail and care that I found once I played it and it really suprised me. It was one of my favorite suprises in gaming in recent memory and I'd recommend it to anyone. It really is a fantastic Indie and is so masterfully crafted that it deserves more attention than its gotten.\n\nI'm not big on giving a number score to games but if I had to give this game a scroe, i'd give it...\n\n8.5/10\n\n\n","June 25, 2015","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I usually dont like, do these kind of quest in games, but here i broked all :)\n\n\n\n\nBAAD:\n\n\n-game is lacking in tutorial, or ingame missions which should teach You the controls and combat mechanics of the game, I "educated" myself on forums.Big opportunity missed here from devs.Trainnig mission would be so fun to see.\n\n-lot of texts, or shopkeepers inventory items goes offscreen and cant even scroll to look after\n-the ending of this game is rushed (for faster release I guess) and didnt liked it much I was dissapointed, the rest of the game is good atleast\n-enemies can kill each other or themself by "accident"\n-very inconsistent AI\n-doors once opened still closing by themself-this is very annoying pls fix\n-cant delete save games lol\n-armor (the blue bar) has no meaning/value in this game its useless, its a second HP bar basicly, since armor doesnt reduce dmg, wont take any dmg usually from Hp bar until armor is nullified (You can play/beat the game with 0 armor all the time btw)-needs rework\n\n-unorganized and uncomfortable interface/inventory when u want to use it at real time during combat, You better press "I"instead, which pause the game also.\n-cant carry more than 1 shield in inventory\n- cant repair items (this was not that bad feature for this game if we could sell the items atleast)\n-cant sell items\n-cant use shield bash when I dont have weapon in my other hand.\n\n-inconsistent swings with melee: we have 2-3 hit animation/attack type, but its RANDOM :(, problem is the one which starts from below our hip is totally useless and ruins the combat, sometimes can cost ur life.Its too slow and the swing direction is not effective, in a game which features headshots and leg shots, but we cant do precise attacks manually all the time.Its rly like enemy has passiv evasion which is unfair in this game.\nThe straigth hit is the best and maybe should be the only one (i am not speaking here from run or jump performed swings, however it happens there as well sadly)\n-movement controls are uncomfortable and sometimes not precise--can make combat idiotic\n\n\n-remove hp regen and give olympic difficulty to choose at from start, rly i have to do 1 playthrough to enjoy the game without hp regen? this was big deal to me.I had to beat the game twice just coz of this bad system.Wanted to try out the game without hp regen.I hated to play with hp regen.Olympic difficulty was better, but I experienced less enemies in some areas...for example at Poseidon fight (there was nothing in the water on olympic difficulty)\n\n\n-physics: totally broken, enemy can throw/knock u even out from the whole maplevel and u die, restart level...or u just fly 50 meter... unfair even if u block with shield\nthis "fun" physics adds nothing to immersion or doesnt enchant combat fun,infact makes combat just harder and pain to deal with.(of course only enemies can knock out You this hard, You cant send them to the skies and thats how it should work for them as well)\n-Awful, constant screen tearing when vsync disabled, usually its rare to see things like this especially on 2D\nThis happens only when Vsync is enabled:I only had performance issue on 2 levels ( Hades level-flames chasing me, an the whole Zeus fortress level) not just frame drop but stutter as well\n\n\nI hope they will patch the game and make fun MP (which is in beta right now) in the future\n\n\nsome info about  mechanics\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/208750/discussions/0/604941528487962631/","June 27, 2015","true","38.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/208750/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","I have to say that there are definitely some pro's to the game, the majority of which are in its overall style. However, the game turned out to be a pretty big letdown overall due to the gameplay, as many other people seem to also complain about - and further, the developer seems like they haven't been that helpful with some big issues.\n\nI'll lay it out simply. The artistic style was the entire reason I got hooked into playing the game, right when I saw it. And I happen to love Greek mythology as well - or pretty much anything set in or focused around the mythology. I was super excited to play the game, but right off the bat I had a very big problem.\n\nThe game simply did not load up for me at all. It showed a black screen, then the application closed. Thankfully, some people in the forum had a fix for installing some framework MSI that came with the game, and it worked for me. However, a good amount of people seemed to claim that didn't work for them and that they were just unable to play the game entirely. I've not really seen the developer respond about this problem, which is extremely important considering it's playing the freaking game! That's a big strike right away.\n\nThere's a thread about the above problem in the Bug Reports sub-forum right now still.\n\nHowever, I followed along as I was still hooked in, and the above fix worked for me in about 5 minutes. Right away in the game, I noticed how bad the controls were. The setting changes don't matter, and mouse/keyboard vs. controller also doesn't really matter. The game has a weird lag in a lot of the motions, and your character doesn't function properly.\n\nYou move relatively slowly for a bit, until your character can suddenly start sprinting if you're still moving in the same direction - however, the moment you hit any sort of incline at all, even if it's like a 10 degree ramp, your character comes to a complete stop and then starts moving slowly up the incline again. This happens all over the place, so your motion is really bad much of the time. Bringing that into combat, you have tough enemies moving around you while you keep getting stuck or bouncing around in certain corners or places.\n\nAlso, while it is realistic that a person can't be sprinting and then immediately turn 180 degrees and keep sprinting, they can definitely keep a lot faster speed than your character. The same thing happens as with the little inclines. If you turn around, your character becomes a snail again for a short bit. Such a thing is really bad in battles when the enemies get around you easily.\n\nAnd speaking of battles - some of the characteristics are fine, along with a general collection of weapons. But again, the gameplay is poor in the sense that very often when you swing melee weapons all over the place, you can be too close to the enemies and the weapons just pass through or over them, which does not make much sense in a 2D game. Even spears did this at times - if I am jutting a spear straight ahead, it shouldn't pass through an enemy. Thus, the stamina mechanic was made more of a pain when half the time you lose stamina without being able to hit anything.\n\nAnother issue is the UI in certain places - particularly in item descriptions and in the shops. The descriptions for some items, if long, will run off the screen even if you are in the max resolution for your PC. But more importantly, once you unlock enough items, you will be unable to buy some of them in the shops. The shops keep the items in a vertical list, and you'll eventually hit a limit where items will run off of the screen and you can't select them. There's even a thread about this right now ("Cloak and Dagger..." in the General Discussions).\n\nIn fact, there's a good amount of Bug Reports threads and the developer seems to not really be around much or care.\n\nThere's more things I could go on about, including a good amount of lag in places too, but I don't want to sit here going on forever. The controls and gameplay overall are some of the biggest critical problems with Apotheon. I tried to give the game my best try and completed it simply because I wanted to witness all of the style, but it is really a pain in many places due to its problems.\n\nI can't willingly tell someone else to buy the game because I am sure there are many people who will hate it due to the above implementation issues.","May 4","false","15.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

I dont like the art style, but i guess it fits the ancient greek theme. You can see it yourself in the trailer, if its a plus to you thats fine.\n\nGameplay consists of going on various quests involving following arrows through the overworld to find mini dungeons scattered about that often have a boss in them and lots of purposeless corridors. Most of these quests never really had any explanation as to why I needed to do them, for example in the "Hades" area players must cross 4 rivers before fighting the areas boss. When you cross these rivers you come out back exactly where you started. It seem the only reason I had to do it was to add to the gameplay, not the story. However, many of these quests were very interesting and fun. This isn't nessicarily a fault. The problems come in with the platforming and combat.\n\nPlatforming is quite obnoxious, it almost feels like im lagging but I dont think i am. Its very hard to move just a small amount or land on a small platform. Most areas are designed with "Z" shaped platforms, so youll often try to jump up onto one and lagging into the crook, because the jump didnt respond well. Also unresponsive is trying to down jump through a platform. This is very annoying when trying to run away. When you receive a big hit sometimes you go flying unpredictably. Also if your like me your used to roll jumping everywhere. Nope in this game you get to jump roll instead, thats a bit strange. There arent really that many parts in this game that require precise platforming anyways but its still annoying, especially on the final boss.\n\nCombat system is very simple but there are a ton of guards its much better to just run past most of them. When you do have to fight, despite the game insisting otherwise, you can just button mash with most weapons. Range weapons even have automatic aiming which is pretty OP. You can also make a ton of healing items using the crafting system. Even when you do die you aren't set back much by it.\n\nTheres this weird issue while trying to switch weapons while in combat where you cant do it while attacking. I would expect the game to finish the attack and then switch. When your weapon breaks this gets really annoying and makes it hard to use the more advanced potions at all.The UI also has weird overlapping issues very often.\n\nIf your going to play it play it for an ancient greek story the gameplay is subpar.\n\nP.S. If your going to play it anyways you should note that the last difficulty is locked until you beat the game once but theres a bug you can do to skip to the final boss and get the acheivement for beating that difficulty without beating the whole game again.","November 15, 2015","false","40.5"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

The main pulling factor for this game is definately the Artstyle. So the flowchart for this game is pretty simple: Do you like the Artstyle? Yes: buy / No: don't buy\n\nOverall the gameplay is mostly fluid and satisfying. The Stages are varied and follow appropriate themes. The game manages to set the mood just right, eventho the appalingly British voiceactors do their best to brake this immersion. Controles can be a bit wonky at times, but on gamepad it's generally managable. It is somewhat prone to glitch at times, this goes from +5 HP apples ragdolling into a pillar and being unreachable to important quest items getting lost in a similar way(or down mount olympus). The story is ok, good enough to be a game, or greek myth.\n\nOne thing that I personally liked a lot is that some typical tropes were avoided, like Hades being all evil. Also having Hera as Patron was both a reasonable and refreshing choice. I did notice they forgot to include poor Hestia. Which is a pitty as she is always left out because everyone thinks "the twelve Olympians" includes Hades, who lives in... Hades.\n\nFinished on easy with all sidequests, lacking some "secret chests" in about 15 hours.","March 31, 2015","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Well, that's no RPG, but I would have appreciated some optimization options)\n- Disappointing "hardest" difficulty level, which is quite the same as the "hard" difficulty\n\nFINALLY...\n\n8/10, must have indie game for anyone liking 2D action platformer game\nApotheon reminds me that videogames can be WORKS OF ART on their own, not only for the graphics, the soundtrack, the animations, but by combining all of these to make an amazing and pleasant experience.\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE COMMENT\n\n\nThis game seduced me with its art style (it's not just beautiful, but also neat and refined) and convinced me with its gameplay, which requires well-timed attacks and dodges, using the right weapon / potion at the right time, diving in the melee like a true warrior, and even sometimes avoiding useless fights.\n\nAfter the first mission which could be considered as a tutorial, you'll be able to chose between two difficulty levels:\n- The Warrior (easy) one should be adapted for casual gamers and people who want to explore the levels without being threatened much by the enemies\n- The Champion (hard) difficulty provides a decent challenge and requires to understand well the fighting mechanics and the different enemies\n- The Olympian difficulty, unlocked when finishing the game once, quite disappointing: it's the same as the Champion one, but without life autoregen when it drops below 50. Don't see the point... Maybe limitting the number of possible saves or save frequency, or giving the enemies more damages / HP would have been great to make this difficulty level worth it.\n\nTo beat the game, you will be given a variety of weapons with different attack power and range (and sometimes additional effects), but that will break easily, requiring to have a good set of weapons in your inventory before diving in fights. You'll also have armours giving you damage mitigation, and various potions that will become handy (not to say vital) in many situations.\nThe quite rare physics glitches I encountered weren't quite a problem (it's just strange to see an arrow floating in mid-air, as the rest of the game seems just perfect).\n\nFor "serial achievers", you'll need to explore every bit of every map to find the hidden keys, chests and rare weapons, which shouldn't take you too much time but still feels rewarding and pleasant.\n\n\nI'm definitely convinced that this game is simply better, funnier and more challenging than many 60+$ games.","February 6, 2015","true","25.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is similarly weighty, the hitboxes are very tight, there's a stamina gague involved, weapons/shields run out of endurance, you can have up to 10 health regen items on you at once... yeah, there's a lot of similarities to Dark Souls in this game. One thing that not a lot of people agree with me on is on the matter of controls: I think this game controls fantastically, albeit not exactly like you would expect. Moving is with the left analog stick; that much you can expect (oh yeah, also I really recommend playing this game with a gamepad), but with the right analog stick you adjust the angle of your weapon, meaning that if you're good enough at seeing the angles, you can very easily critical hit any enemy you run across. Critical hits are headshots, for reference. Blocking is with the left trigger and attacking is with the right trigger. It does take a few minutes to get used to, but once you do, it feels very natural.\n\nAs far as the enemies go, they usually have a combination of ranged and melee attacks. They also usually come in waves of four to five, so spacing is definitely something you wanna keep in mind. These enemies are all pretty fun to fight, and it's never an enemy swarm that feels unfair or overwhelming. I will say that the final area could've been one section shorter and have been perfectly fine. As for the boss fights, they're all pretty fun as well. There's plenty in there to keep things interesting, and they usually have their own clever mechanics (even if there are a couple of "giant dude" fights).\n\nThis game really doesn't have much of an RPG element to it like the Souls series does. In fact, pretty much the only thing you get in the way of upgrades are armor upgrades or abilities you unlock from defeating certain gods. Apart from that, you've got currency and a rather meager crafting system (which feels kinda shoehorned in, to be perfectly honest) and that's your lot. Regarding the difficulty, I'd definitely recommend putting this game on Hard for your first time through if you happen to be a veteran of the Souls series, as this game can be a bit disappointing in terms of challenge if you're just going on Normal. Even on Normal it does offer some resistance, albeit a resistance of size and not of force, if you understand where I'm going with this. I only died once, and that was because I wasn't paying attention.\n\nEven though my first playthrough only took me about five hours, I could see myself playing this game again in the future (more specifically on Hard Mode). It's a pretty darn competent 2D action game with a pretty good amount of challenge and fun. While not anywhere near being GOTY material, I'd say $15 ain't a half bad price for this. 8/10\n\nStory: I'm not too well versed in Greek mythology, so I can't say with certainty how well this game follows the source material, but from what was presented, it wasn't bad. The writing does feel a bit romp-y at times in that it feels like we're going to beat up all these gods for the sake of beating up the gods (and collecting their powers, of course). The core storyline of the game is, "Zeus is a butt, Hera gets mad, go hit Zeus with your wepon." Dialogue is... well, it serves its purpose and nothing more. There isn't much in the way of twists (at least none that I called from a hundred miles away), so to be perfectly honest, the plot ain't gonna impress you. It does serve its purpose, and it does so pretty well, so I'll give it a 7/10.\n\nGraphics: Well, it's meant to look like ancient Greek bronze art, and it does. The way that the sprites were handled can get a bit silly at times, though. Basically, sprites in this game are jointed together, kinda like what you would expect from Flash animation. As such, sometimes the sprites rotate a bit too far and loop around or separate entirely, and it all just looks kinda silly. On the matter of optimization, I do feel like this game shouldn't be demanding as much from my system as it does. It's by no means a system destroyer, but it does warm my GPU up a bit (about 50degC for my GTX 760), which does seem rather odd for a 2D game. I suspect this is because of the lighting engine. Either way, I didn't have any frame dropping issues or overheating, but I will say that it maybe could've been optimized a bit better. The art is definitely stylish, but the obvious jointing could definitely get a few unintentional laughs out of you, and it does feel like the game could run a little lighter. 3/5.\n\nSound: Again, the comparison arises to Dark Souls: it does feel like the composer kinda tried to use Sakuraba's style for the boss fights, but they didn't quite match the overwhelmingly anthemic nature of Sakuraba's work in Dark Souls. It's not bad, and in fact for an indie studio an orchestral recording is quite good; it's just that Sakuraba's work exists. The sound design is really, really good on the other hand, as well as the more subtle and ambient tracks this game has to offer. A couple of standout areas are the hunt for the Chimera and Hades. Those areas are very well done. The voice acting is pretty good as well. Nothing that's gonna blow you away, but it's quite a bit better than dev voiceovers. All in all, they did a pretty darn good job here in the audio department. While the boss themes could've had a bit more oomph, the subtleties are all very well done. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 8/7/3/4; cumulative score of 7.3/10. I'd definitely say this game is worth your time if you like games like the Souls series. Just don't expect a Souls game and you'll be fine.","February 9, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A fun sort of platformer with interesting, albeit clunky, combat. Took me about 12 hours to finish and I didn't quite unlock everything. Plenty of exploration and finding of secrets and weapons. It's kind of an interesting game, in which commiting crime seems to be the favorable choice, as it gets you the most stuff. (I guess it makes sense, since your'e essentially killing off the gods anyways.)\n\nThe big thing I'd change is the combat system. It doesn't make any sense. See, for the most part you've got an overhead, underhand, and (if you've got a weapon with a pointy bit at the end) a thrust. I don't entirely know how to trigger the over and under attacks, as the game doesn't say how. This can be a little troublesome, as you can hit walls, damaging the durability of your weapons. I recommend sticking to thrust attacks, as all you have to do is click to trigger that, it attacks further and doesn't collide with walls near as much. Also getting the item from Hermes and using it is... weird at times, erratically breaking and allowing you to break the game in some locations.\n\nOther than that, the voice acting is solid. The asthetic is great! It's like you're playing on an old Greek urn. The gameplay can still be fun, even if it's a little clunky. Give it a go if you like platformers with combat! Just don't be too aggresive on harder difficulties and work your dodge roll.","April 16, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main pulling factor for this game is definately the Artstyle. So the flowchart for this game is pretty simple: Do you like the Artstyle? Yes: buy / No: don't buy\n\nOverall the gameplay is mostly fluid and satisfying. The Stages are varied and follow appropriate themes. The game manages to set the mood just right, eventho the appalingly British voiceactors do their best to brake this immersion. Controles can be a bit wonky at times, but on gamepad it's generally managable. It is somewhat prone to glitch at times, this goes from +5 HP apples ragdolling into a pillar and being unreachable to important quest items getting lost in a similar way(or down mount olympus). The story is ok, good enough to be a game, or greek myth.\n\nOne thing that I personally liked a lot is that some typical tropes were avoided, like Hades being all evil. Also having Hera as Patron was both a reasonable and refreshing choice. I did notice they forgot to include poor Hestia. Which is a pitty as she is always left out because everyone thinks "the twelve Olympians" includes Hades, who lives in... Hades.\n\nFinished on easy with all sidequests, lacking some "secret chests" in about 15 hours.","March 31, 2015","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The black-figure art style is what initially attracted me and made Apotheon an instant buy. Both the art and the music are beautiful, and the inclusion of quotations from the Homeric hymns and other source materials was a nice touch, and much appreciated.\n\nAbout the only (relatively minor) negative thing I could say about the game is that I felt that despite the huge variety in weapons and items, it didn't really seem to matter much what I used. I just picked something and only really switched when it broke or if it just wasn't getting the job done. Usually this just meant a switch from melee to ranged on a few bosses that seemed to call for it, and the occasional enemy like peltasts or mechanical sentries that were difficult to get in melee range of, rather than any specific weapon choice within those classifications. Given the realtive speed with which equipment breaks though, I did get a chance to use pretty much everything the game had to offer, however.\n\nDespite my slight ambivalence toward the combat in general, the variety in boss fights and trials, from brawling with Ares  and hunting Artemis, to traversing Athena's shifting labyrinth, to the time trials such as Dionysus' drinking contest and crossing the river Phlegethon in Hades, kept things fresh and entertaining. The encounters and puzzles were well done and provided an adequate level of challenge, but nothing proved particularly difficult. So, I might have liked to have the option to play on Olympian difficulty from the beginning, rather than have to unlock it by beating the game. There is a decent amount of content in the way of optional/side-quests to satisfy the completionist as well.\n\nAll in all, Apotheon was a very enjoyable experience and highly recommended! Well done to Alientrap for this gem.","February 7, 2015","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those areas are very well done. The voice acting is pretty good as well. Nothing that's gonna blow you away, but it's quite a bit better than dev voiceovers. All in all, they did a pretty darn good job here in the audio department. While the boss themes could've had a bit more oomph, the subtleties are all very well done. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 8/7/3/4; cumulative score of 7.3/10. I'd definitely say this game is worth your time if you like games like the Souls series. Just don't expect a Souls game and you'll be fine.","February 9, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have abandoned mankind, so you must seek their assistance or kill them and gain their powers to save man yourself.

Ranged weapons can be thrown or launched with a bow, sling, or other devices. You can even pick up and throw boulders or stone blocks for massive damage. The difficulty on the default difficulty setting is ridiculously easy, and the next setting really isn't much harder. I think I only died a couple of times. Beating the game unlocks the hardest difficulty, which I have yet to attempt.

They also use this great effect when you take a heavy blow, a pottery crack will appear on screen to highlight what just happened.\n\nSound: The music while not necesarily award winning is very good in my opinion and can make the more epic moments of the game even better (I'm planning on getting the soundtrack once I've got some spare cash). The attack sounds clearly punctuate when you make contact with a target and when they make contact with you. I especially like how when a heavy blow is dealt or something dies you get a wooden drum type sound to accentuate what just happened.\n\nGameplay: The combat is a little weird at first and not your typical metroidvania, but that is something that can be said about a lot of games (the little weird part, not the metroidvania part). I will say that Apotheon is better played on a gamepad because, it makes melee combat simpler since you don't have to actively aim your attacks and you have all your primary actions easily accesible at all times; but be sure to have a mouse near-by for the arrow aiming challenges (precise aiming with a joystick in this game is practicaly impossible).\nI do have a few gripes with the gameplay though. 1. if you want to pick a specific weapon to use, you may have to scroll through all the weapons you have of that type particularly melee and ranged (I never used that many bombs/traps or potions). 2. Even when using a gamepad my character would not be facing the right direction all the time in an intense fight (it was better than manualy aiming with a mouse though) also, the drop off for ranged weapons is probably a little to severe. 3. No wings, go to the acropolis for an explanation. 4. After you unlock most of the items on the blackmarket the screen can't show all the options at once. 5. Some item descriptions can't be entirely displayed unless viewed in the inventory, except one of the notes.\nBut these issues may just be due to limited resources and are more of an issue of how refined the gameplay is.\nFinally, nearly all the bosses are either ingenious, epic or both and the the ones that fit into any of those categories are more of a test to see if you have a solid handle on the controls (the tutorial boss is a prime example of this). All the bosses are drawn from greek mythology and before you fight most of them, you read a passage of greek mythology to give you some context and an idea of who or what they are as well as what you need to know on how to beat them or what to watch out for. I only remember one or two mediocre bosses but, all these bosses are good examples of what a boss should be in a game. A test of everything you have learned and done to get to them. Not just a normal enemy that is a bit beefier than the others.\n\nTo sum it up, this game is good, the visuals work perfectly for what this game is trying to be and the gameplay, once you've gotten use to it, it is solid despite it's minor flaws. Anyone who loves greek mythology and would like to see a different play on your average greek story that can make you think. (As you're playing think about the goal and objectives you are completing and ask if you're doing the right thing in context to the world that this is happening in, Classical Greece.) Also, I feel that this game is more greek than God of War is. The only thing you may ask for is a little more content, the game is fairly short. As for a sequel, no; the story prevents the game from having one by wrapping everything up in such a way that a direct sequel would just be tacked on for the sake of their being a sequel. A spiritual successor however, would be perfect. The gameplay was not just greek specific and I could see it being used in a Midieval or feudal Japan setting or if the developers wanted to stick with pantheons of gods norse mythology would be a good idea. The major problem I forsee is that they'd need to figure out a new art style to use. Regardless this game is definetly worth buying and at least finishing through to the end.","April 6, 2015","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is something new to look at and combat is very simple but varied enough to allow for stratization. You get a multitude of weapons with their own strengths and some special weapons that have special abilities to up the antie during a fight. You have armour and when you upgrade ypur amour from a lower level peice, you get to keep all peices of armour and customize your look with a lower level piece of armour (if thats the look you are going for) without having the downfall of losing armour points when downgrading  from higher to lower. All lore fits whithin greek mythology (Zeus is the same a man-♥♥♥♥♥; tyrant son of a gun that we all kmow and love) and the plot stays true to the formula: man rises up from their devastation and hands the gods their butts on a bronze platter. One negative is that you can catch the A.I, on corners and pick them off with a longer ranged weapon really easily (might not be a bad thing depending on how you play). Another would be the music  in some stages , like the very last stage, would end and would have a 30 second delay were it wouldn't repeat and then it would after 30 or so seconds, kind of killing the ambiance and mood. Also the Poseidon stage in certain areas when traveling with the boat, there would be complete silence unless you were fighting. That stage in particular wouldn't need music, as the desolation of the Sea would fit the silence, but it could benefit from at least the sound of wood creaking, water splashing against the boat or for at least the seagulls that fly over your head to cry, Other than those minor nitpicks, the game is absolutely perfect.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone intrigued with the art style, anyone who played (and enjoyed) God of War, anyone who is familar with Greek Mythology or who just likes Greek Mythology infused movies (Clash of Titans, etc.) or anyone who is a casual gamer (Or hard core if you like to play games that don't require thousands of hours to master). It's really fun and it's price is just for the type of game that it is.","February 13, 2015","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The black-figure art style is what initially attracted me and made Apotheon an instant buy. Both the art and the music are beautiful, and the inclusion of quotations from the Homeric hymns and other source materials was a nice touch, and much appreciated.\n\nAbout the only (relatively minor) negative thing I could say about the game is that I felt that despite the huge variety in weapons and items, it didn't really seem to matter much what I used. I just picked something and only really switched when it broke or if it just wasn't getting the job done. Usually this just meant a switch from melee to ranged on a few bosses that seemed to call for it, and the occasional enemy like peltasts or mechanical sentries that were difficult to get in melee range of, rather than any specific weapon choice within those classifications. Given the realtive speed with which equipment breaks though, I did get a chance to use pretty much everything the game had to offer, however.\n\nDespite my slight ambivalence toward the combat in general, the variety in boss fights and trials, from brawling with Ares  and hunting Artemis, to traversing Athena's shifting labyrinth, to the time trials such as Dionysus' drinking contest and crossing the river Phlegethon in Hades, kept things fresh and entertaining. The encounters and puzzles were well done and provided an adequate level of challenge, but nothing proved particularly difficult. So, I might have liked to have the option to play on Olympian difficulty from the beginning, rather than have to unlock it by beating the game. There is a decent amount of content in the way of optional/side-quests to satisfy the completionist as well.\n\nAll in all, Apotheon was a very enjoyable experience and highly recommended! Well done to Alientrap for this gem.","February 7, 2015","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And that's thanks to the amazing art, beautiful music, solid fighting mechanics, and variety of levels. It's not a long game, but I feel it's as long as it should be. The level designs are wonderful and so is the voiceacting. I'd say that the story isn't all that detailed, but at the same time it's oddly very good and interesting.\n\nIf anything, I'd like it if the powers you gained from the various Gods gave you abilities that you would need to get to another God or the very least open up new areas. That said, I do like that the powers you gain acts as buffs so it seems like you really gain that God's power. It also removes the need to backtrack through areas you've already been only to open up new sections of it which can be a bit tedious. I feel they have really found a good balance in their gameplay.\n\nThe variety in the levels is another huge plus for Apotheon. You usually have to do 3 tasks before facing off against a God, and they have made each level unique to the God you're fighting. There's puzzles, horseriding, becoming a deer, and lots of neat mini-bosses to fight.\n\n10/10 for a most wonderful game","February 8, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is similarly weighty, the hitboxes are very tight, there's a stamina gague involved, weapons/shields run out of endurance, you can have up to 10 health regen items on you at once... yeah, there's a lot of similarities to Dark Souls in this game. One thing that not a lot of people agree with me on is on the matter of controls: I think this game controls fantastically, albeit not exactly like you would expect. Moving is with the left analog stick; that much you can expect (oh yeah, also I really recommend playing this game with a gamepad), but with the right analog stick you adjust the angle of your weapon, meaning that if you're good enough at seeing the angles, you can very easily critical hit any enemy you run across. Critical hits are headshots, for reference. Blocking is with the left trigger and attacking is with the right trigger. It does take a few minutes to get used to, but once you do, it feels very natural.\n\nAs far as the enemies go, they usually have a combination of ranged and melee attacks. They also usually come in waves of four to five, so spacing is definitely something you wanna keep in mind. These enemies are all pretty fun to fight, and it's never an enemy swarm that feels unfair or overwhelming. I will say that the final area could've been one section shorter and have been perfectly fine. As for the boss fights, they're all pretty fun as well. There's plenty in there to keep things interesting, and they usually have their own clever mechanics (even if there are a couple of "giant dude" fights).\n\nThis game really doesn't have much of an RPG element to it like the Souls series does. In fact, pretty much the only thing you get in the way of upgrades are armor upgrades or abilities you unlock from defeating certain gods. Apart from that, you've got currency and a rather meager crafting system (which feels kinda shoehorned in, to be perfectly honest) and that's your lot. Regarding the difficulty, I'd definitely recommend putting this game on Hard for your first time through if you happen to be a veteran of the Souls series, as this game can be a bit disappointing in terms of challenge if you're just going on Normal. Even on Normal it does offer some resistance, albeit a resistance of size and not of force, if you understand where I'm going with this. I only died once, and that was because I wasn't paying attention.\n\nEven though my first playthrough only took me about five hours, I could see myself playing this game again in the future (more specifically on Hard Mode). It's a pretty darn competent 2D action game with a pretty good amount of challenge and fun. While not anywhere near being GOTY material, I'd say $15 ain't a half bad price for this. 8/10\n\nStory: I'm not too well versed in Greek mythology, so I can't say with certainty how well this game follows the source material, but from what was presented, it wasn't bad. The writing does feel a bit romp-y at times in that it feels like we're going to beat up all these gods for the sake of beating up the gods (and collecting their powers, of course). The core storyline of the game is, "Zeus is a butt, Hera gets mad, go hit Zeus with your wepon." Dialogue is... well, it serves its purpose and nothing more. There isn't much in the way of twists (at least none that I called from a hundred miles away), so to be perfectly honest, the plot ain't gonna impress you. It does serve its purpose, and it does so pretty well, so I'll give it a 7/10.\n\nGraphics: Well, it's meant to look like ancient Greek bronze art, and it does. The way that the sprites were handled can get a bit silly at times, though. Basically, sprites in this game are jointed together, kinda like what you would expect from Flash animation. As such, sometimes the sprites rotate a bit too far and loop around or separate entirely, and it all just looks kinda silly. On the matter of optimization, I do feel like this game shouldn't be demanding as much from my system as it does. It's by no means a system destroyer, but it does warm my GPU up a bit (about 50degC for my GTX 760), which does seem rather odd for a 2D game. I suspect this is because of the lighting engine. Either way, I didn't have any frame dropping issues or overheating, but I will say that it maybe could've been optimized a bit better. The art is definitely stylish, but the obvious jointing could definitely get a few unintentional laughs out of you, and it does feel like the game could run a little lighter. 3/5.\n\nSound: Again, the comparison arises to Dark Souls: it does feel like the composer kinda tried to use Sakuraba's style for the boss fights, but they didn't quite match the overwhelmingly anthemic nature of Sakuraba's work in Dark Souls. It's not bad, and in fact for an indie studio an orchestral recording is quite good; it's just that Sakuraba's work exists. The sound design is really, really good on the other hand, as well as the more subtle and ambient tracks this game has to offer. A couple of standout areas are the hunt for the Chimera and Hades. Those areas are very well done. The voice acting is pretty good as well. Nothing that's gonna blow you away, but it's quite a bit better than dev voiceovers. All in all, they did a pretty darn good job here in the audio department. While the boss themes could've had a bit more oomph, the subtleties are all very well done. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 8/7/3/4; cumulative score of 7.3/10. I'd definitely say this game is worth your time if you like games like the Souls series. Just don't expect a Souls game and you'll be fine.","February 9, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Athena's Labyrinth was probably my favorite zone, with all the cool skill challenges, but I was also a fan of the Underworld. The music and lighting down in Hades sometimes made me feel legitimately uneasy, and crossing the River Lethe was slow and tense without being frustrated. My only complaint is that the controls can be a bit sluggish when fighting, which is a bit of a problem in a platformer. Even then, combat made me feel like a badass. I should note, however, that I only played with an XBox controller, so a keyboard and mouse may be quicker and more precise. Other than that, no complaints. As a historian and lover of myth who loves to nitpick, I only noticed two historically inaccurate things: In the game, the sarissa can be held one-handed and thrown, and the pelta is carried on the arm. Besides the fact that these weapons were introduced in Macedonia several centuries after when this game seems to be set, the sarissa required two hands to use, and the pelta (which was invented to be used with the sarissa) was slung over the shoulder. But I digress. Long story short, play this game. Great story, great music, great history, and all-around fun.","April 27, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaign offers many hours of gameplay, which constantly introduces variety and rarely repeats itself. Well worth buying outside of a sale.\n\nYou play as a greek warrior from the archaic period fighting the greek gods on Mount Olympus, whom are attempting to clean up the earth by doing away with humanity. The story won't win any awards, but it serves its purpose of setting the scene well, and doesn't bog down the player in unnecessary details. It is, however, very well-researched, and proves it through excepts from ancient greek culture spread out on readible plaques spread throughout the game world (safely ignorable by those uninterested in such things). The artwork is beautifully drawn and heavily inspired from ancient pottery, while at the same time making important details very noticable to the player.\n\nVariety is the spice that makes this game special. The world is laid out in a metroidvania-style arrangement of hubs with branching off areas for each god. Each god's area carries with it a different theme, with different goals, enemies, and backgrounds; each in turn has subregions within. The contrasts are well-balanced, providing enough time for the player to learn new tactics and strategies in each zone, and often lessons learned in one place will prove useful in others. But (perhaps more importantly) it isn't always *necessary* to learn new tactics all the time: the player can usually power through but with a greater cost in resources. However, there's a certain satisfaction to be had in going out of one's way to sneak up behind an opponent merely so that dagger with 800% backstab damage doesn't languish in one's inventory forever.\n\nI cannot find a single major problem with the game, but I do have a few nitpicks. For instance, inventory gets cluttered after a while and there are like ten times as many lockpicks as locked doors. it's also annoying how smashing crates reduces weapon durability and that the stacking limit on crafting ingrediants is so low. But those are like tiny chips on an ancient vase: the basic quality of the item remains the same.","March 29, 2015","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style caught my eye immediately, reminding me of the Muses' scenes from Disney's Hercules. About a third of the way into the game, the realization that there are hidden shopkeepers, side-quests for items and buffs, and hidden chests scattered all over the game added some depth and diversion from an otherwise straight-forward, linear experience.\nAs a fan of the God of War series, it's interesting to see a similar story implemented in a very different style of art and gameplay. Side-quests involving Dionysus, Aphrodite and Hephaestus were a welcome addition. The magic weapons you find along the way are great, a favorite being a discus that works much like a boomarang. After receiving items from each God and Goddess, you snowball into a powerhouse, which makes the rest of the game a breeze, but ends up making enemies more annoying than challenging.\nLike any game, there's room for improvement, particularly with items getting stuck into corners and left unreachable to the player, but this was a nice way to spend a weekend.

Just for the visual aesthetic alone, it is worth playing. However, on top of that, it is a good platformer and simple fighting game with an interesting story. The platforming is challenging but not frustratingly so except in one level that is constantly rotating and it is hard to orient yourself. The fighting is good and simple, without complex combos that would turn me off like in a dedicated fighting game. There is a wide variety of weaponry, but I often stuck with just one or two different setups. Spears in melee for reach and javelins for ranged so I could still use a shield in between shots. As for the story, it is typical Greek gods being self-centered jerks with you having to, literally in most cases, knock some sense into them.","April 4, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main pulling factor for this game is definately the Artstyle. So the flowchart for this game is pretty simple: Do you like the Artstyle? Yes: buy / No: don't buy\n\nOverall the gameplay is mostly fluid and satisfying. The Stages are varied and follow appropriate themes. The game manages to set the mood just right, eventho the appalingly British voiceactors do their best to brake this immersion. Controles can be a bit wonky at times, but on gamepad it's generally managable. It is somewhat prone to glitch at times, this goes from +5 HP apples ragdolling into a pillar and being unreachable to important quest items getting lost in a similar way(or down mount olympus). The story is ok, good enough to be a game, or greek myth.\n\nOne thing that I personally liked a lot is that some typical tropes were avoided, like Hades being all evil. Also having Hera as Patron was both a reasonable and refreshing choice. I did notice they forgot to include poor Hestia. Which is a pitty as she is always left out because everyone thinks "the twelve Olympians" includes Hades, who lives in... Hades.\n\nFinished on easy with all sidequests, lacking some "secret chests" in about 15 hours.","March 31, 2015","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a metroidvania type of action-platformer, but uses very little rpg elements, which simplifies the mechanics for players new to the genre.\n\nYour character does not level up, rather he gains extra health/protection and powers by upgrading his armor and weapons, and even honing his skill with select weapons such as the xiphos (sword) or spear.\n\nYou move with the standard WASD, but use the mouse to aim, attack and block; this can be confusing for players who haven't experienced this type of controls, and this ends up muddling the combat. Often, the player will be stabbing blindly at the air, simply because the cursor isn't at the proper elevation. Likewise, this can affect the player's speed when moving if the cursor isn't in the direction the player is headed.\n\nThe combat is not turn based, and most enemies can be dealt with only a few strikes of a sword or spear. However, enemies can pile up quickly and this is bothersome as running away is seldom a viable option considering the difficulties linked to platforming. The player is armed with only a modest jump and a stunted ledge grab to go through the levels.\n\nThe visual style is deceptively modest, taking on the the style of ancient greek pottery of colour-on-black. The characters move mostly fluidly, bar some repeated motions during dialogues, and the background is almsot always filled with  ancient greek forests, cities and the like.\n\nOverall, Apotheon is a game that will frustrate the player in order to push them to do their best. The sometimes frustrating combat mechanics or platforming physics are easily overshadowed by the amazing visuals, immersive story and engaging gameplay.","November 1, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed Disney's animated Hercules film, and the first two God of War games on Playstation, but in either one of those cases the mythology could have been swapped with entirely original characters and no one would have known the difference. Here, the mythology IS the story, and it's done very well. And I am in love with the visuals: the varied color palettes, the silhouetted Greek pottery art style complete with texture and lighting overlay and simulated imperfections. I could stare at it forever; it's gorgeous... and the music is wonderful, too.\n\nYet it's so difficult to unconditionally recommend the game, and the combat and controls are the reason. Using mouse and keyboard, the game controls like Terraria: Move with WASD, jump with spacebar, and control your weapons with the mouse, pointing the cursor around the screen to determine the direction you will strike. You will either be okay with these controls, or you will hate them. Personally, I thought they worked pretty well most of the time. I didn't love the apparent inability to choose how I was going to swing my weapon, but I didn't find it much of an issue on the normal difficulty, which is a little on the easy side. Now if I spent a few hours on Olympian difficulty, I might feel much differently. I haven't decided whether I'm going to attempt that yet.\n\nOverall, though, I am thoroughly impressed with this game. Loved it, loved it.","February 9","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plain and simple, good ol' fashioned fun.\n\nDon't come into this game looking for an immersive novel-like story---it's just not there.  But like a beautifully illustrated children's book, Apotheon shines in its simplicity, style, and sense of adventure.  It's fun to play, and fun to watch.  The controls are simple and fluid.  The scenes are beautifully rendered in the style of Greek art.  It's truly a joy to behold.\n\nThe soundtrack doesn't disappointment either, with a host of tunes that totally immerse the player into the environment, and convey the excitement (and sometimes anxiety), as you pit your mortal self against the mighty gods of Olympus.\n\nIt's a must for any fans of Greek mythology, or anyone who enjoyed the Iliad or Odyssey.  Fans of simple, but fun adventure games will also find a lot to like here, as well as anyone who can appreciate games as art.\n\nTo be fair, the story narrative could have been better integrated into the entirety of the game.  At times, it comes off feeling slightly arbitrary, or disjointed.  The side-plots also feel a bit confusing, and it's not clear most of the time how they fit in.  But, on the whole, the story is cogent, and it works for what the game is.  Again, in keeping with my earlier metaphor, think Chris Van Allsburg, not Leo Tolstoy.\n\nMy final grade for this beautifully rendered Greek odyssey:  B+.","May 20, 2015","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to mention armor and health upgrades that can not only be found completeing the main quest but in secret stashes and lockboxes hidden off to the side. Enemies are incredibly varied, besides the fact that they all wear red, and none of them will act alike.\n\nThe only major problems I had with this game is that every single mission in this game is a "Fed-Ex" quest, you go to retrieve an item from a God, and that God or their underlings sends you off to go do some ♥♥♥♥ (the only exception being Apollo, because he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and then you come back, fight a boss, then get the item. All the items give upgrades and you feel accomplished after getting one, but then you remember that you still have to get items from 11 more gods. You might as well carry a checklist while playing this game. The only other annoyance I had was with enemy AI, the AI for the larger enemies (Bosses, Cyclopses, Weird half-animal dudes, etc.) is great, because you can wittily outmanuevur them and shove your spear in their asses. The AI for smaller enemies isn't that great, all of the normal enemies will engage you with whatever weapons they have, and thats it. Enemies like Apollo's Guards will randomly decide to attack you with a bow, drink a potion, run away from you until potion runs out, pull out their sword, stab your toe, and then run away from you again. And obviously there's tons of these guys in one area, so killing them is more of a chore than anything else. Wolves, who only majorly appear in one part of the game, will jump attack you, run as far as the can in one direction, turn around, attack you again, and then run as far as they can in the other direction before repeating everything else. You'd honestly have more luck just running away from them rather than wasting your weapons and armor trying to kill them.\n\nThere are some pretty great parts in this game though, in Artemis' woods, some nymphs ask you to clear their home of satyrs (Olympus is overcrowded with all of the deities moving in suddenly) and you walk in to promptly find a bunch of goat-men, drunk off their asses with erect ♥♥♥♥♥ (someone actually took the time to animated a ♥♥♥♥♥ on these enemies) humping the air and getting absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. How do you get them to leave? Smash all the alcohol. Once you do that, they get so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they kill each other.\n\nOh, and the art style is pretty cool too.\n\nPlot Synopsis:\n\nYou play as Nikandreos, a Greek normalfag from the village of Dion, one day, Zeus decides "ayy lmao, humans are ♥♥♥♥" and orders all the other Olympians to neglect mortals. He also invites all deities living on Earth to come to Olympus, so that when all humans die off, everyone can go back to the Earth. Crops refuse to grow, animals disappear from the forest and even the sun lingers at one point in sky all day. Humans being humans, instead of trying to repent/stop the oncoming disaster, they decide that now would be a perfect time to steal everyone else's ♥♥♥♥. The game opens with Nikandreos stopping the pillaging of his village (and other things) by shanking every single mother♥♥♥♥♥♥ wearing a red tunic. At this point you go to the Temple of Hera where she appears, tells you to help the mortals and then sends you off to Olympus, all the while softly caressing your ♥♥♥.\n\nYou roll up on the Olympian Gates acting chill as a mofugga', and the guards who for someone reason, don't recognize you as a mortal let you in to the Agora, which acts as the overworld of the first tier of Mount Olympus.\n\nI'd rather not spoil the rest of the game so I'll just say that Olympus is full of fly honies, and that ♥♥♥♥♥ Athena got ♥♥♥ for days.","June 17, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are many things you can do in this game:  you can challenge your inner Caligula as you attempt to slay Poseidon in an epic seas battle, defeat the legendary Jerma985 in a horse battle, and spelunking and deep sea diving for treasure, all in just one of nine playable areas! The art direction in this game is tremendous, and the combat, while clunky at first, is quite unique, and many of the boss battles are very unique; this game is more than a hack and slash affair almost all of the time (although the combat can get tedious at points). My personal favorite touch to the game were small shrines that had samplings of ancient Greek texts; these added a whole new level of detail and character to a game that was already quite full of both things. Buy this game, especially if you like 2D side-scrollers or the ancient world. As one famous Homer might say about this game, "οὐδέ κεν ὧς ἔτι χεῖρας ἐμὰς λήξαιμι φόνοιο, πρὶν πᾶσαν μνηστῆρας ὑπερβασίην ἀποτεῖσαι!"","December 3, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game gives you a mood that you are exploring a mythic world and you are going to tear the gods from their rule.\nThe music accompanied with this game fits that mood perfectly.\n\nYou gather armor tiers and you can craft potions which may boost you or summon allies. The armor system is done pretty nice, once you gather higher tier armor, your total armor level expands. That means that once you can still wear your other armor purely for cosmetic reasons while retaining the armor level.\nThere is no experience or statistics system, but the game does not really need that.\nYou do get an array of weaponry with names that stem from ancient Greece. Spears are Doru, swords are Xiphos, etc.\nThe controls are a little floaty, but the developers have taken away frustrations that other platformers have. When you reach the edge of a platform, you hang off of it and you can gradually slide down or climb up.\n\nSomething I did not really like was the fact that you assault guards who clearly are not hostile to you unless you attack them first. It made me feel a bit like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to attack them first just so I can progress in the game. But this is just my opinion.\nIngame, I missed the classic monsters like the Centaur, Pegasus, Minotaur, Manticore, Hydra and the Medusa Gorgon. I was hoping to fight those as well.\nFurthermore the Steam achievements for Apotheon are a little too easy to gather.\n\n----------\nNevertheless, Apotheon is a godly game and I really recommend it to anyone into Metroidvania games.","July 9, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seriously I just spent 11-12 hours beating your game and you want me to replay the whole thing on a new unlocked difficulty? With nothing else new apart from dying really quickly?

The plot was reminiscent of God of War. The voice acting is solid which surprised me for a budget game. The best thing in my opinion was the sence of exploration the game provides. Theres so many side quests and collectables. The combat is a bit to get used to but is definetly managable. The game has some great set pieces and boss battles with varying scale. Some I'd say are pretty clever and interesting in how they're approached.  There is a crafting system and upgrade system in the game. I did not really use the crafting system much in my first playthrough though.\n\nThe only real flaw the game has is the fact that weapons degrade. All weapons can be bought at shops in the game but when going through an area, its very possible to be finished with your favorite weapon a third through. This was probably most apparent in the last level when I had to go through I'd say 6 weapons just to reach the boss.","August 24, 2015","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stats are not the only thing that give weapons their power. Each weapon among having stats has range and movement patterns that really make combat about qualitative differences instead of hunting the best drops.\n\nWeapons break and so they function as a limited reasource, but they are easily replaceable.\n\nThey do rpg mechanics well. Instead of just being lazy and adding an experience bar they had upgrades you can buy from vendors.\n\nThe grinding doesn't really exist. Times when I couldn't defeat a boss therefore I decided to go and collect gold to imrove my abilities I wasn't really grinding it actually allowed me to explore areas and find things that I had missed.\n\nThe game doesn't just shower you with new upgrades, weapons, items, etc. It provides enough gameplay were you feel that you can master each aspect and really build your abilities as a good player of the game.\n\nThe games astetic is amazing.\nThe artists did an amazing job with the making you feel like you are in this ancient greek world.\nThe level design is lively you actually interact with it and it is not just about using gimicks you actually develop your character.\nThe voice acting while not the best gives you enough story and interaction that it feels some what genuine while not bogging you down in nonsense that doesn't matter.\n\nController support. I mean with a game like this it is great to have and they actually do it well so that it is actually worth having unlike other games that claim to be controller supported.\n\nThings that I dislike:\n\nFrame rate sucks. It might just be the fact that the linux version is not that well optimized. It is still playable but you do get a little anoyed when you drop from 60 to 14.\n\nThere is no modding reasources.

Seriously I just spent 11-12 hours beating your game and you want me to replay the whole thing on a new unlocked difficulty? With nothing else new apart from dying really quickly? This is a crappy throw back to old gaming, either have the Olympian difficulty unlocked from the start or make it a new game +.","July 20, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game gives you a mood that you are exploring a mythic world and you are going to tear the gods from their rule.\nThe music accompanied with this game fits that mood perfectly.\n\nYou gather armor tiers and you can craft potions which may boost you or summon allies. The armor system is done pretty nice, once you gather higher tier armor, your total armor level expands. That means that once you can still wear your other armor purely for cosmetic reasons while retaining the armor level.\nThere is no experience or statistics system, but the game does not really need that.\nYou do get an array of weaponry with names that stem from ancient Greece. Spears are Doru, swords are Xiphos, etc.\nThe controls are a little floaty, but the developers have taken away frustrations that other platformers have. When you reach the edge of a platform, you hang off of it and you can gradually slide down or climb up.\n\nSomething I did not really like was the fact that you assault guards who clearly are not hostile to you unless you attack them first. It made me feel a bit like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to attack them first just so I can progress in the game. But this is just my opinion.\nIngame, I missed the classic monsters like the Centaur, Pegasus, Minotaur, Manticore, Hydra and the Medusa Gorgon. I was hoping to fight those as well.\nFurthermore the Steam achievements for Apotheon are a little too easy to gather.\n\n----------\nNevertheless, Apotheon is a godly game and I really recommend it to anyone into Metroidvania games.","July 9, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is probably the prettiest game I have ever played.\nThe Story - The story is clever and is tight enough to be told purely through stuff that actually happens in game, so there is zero mucking around with a billion codex pages like some games.\nLevel design - Every level is challenging in it's own way, and no two levels will be resolved in the same situation, some will require a stealthy approach, some will require straight out bloodshed, and some will need brains rather than brawn.\nSubject matter - This game delves far into greek mythology and is excellent in using it.\nCombat - Combat is challenging, but if you take enemies as they arrive, it is usually quite manageable, and will leave you with a sense of accomplishment after the more difficult enemies.\nTeaching the player - This game sort of throws the player right into the thick of it and teaches as it goes. It teaches everything you need to know without being too heavy or too light with the explanations.\n\nBad\nControls - With a keyboard the controls are somewhat clunky and some attacks, especially the bow, are very slow to respond. I even had some occurences where some of the more exotic weapons completely broke down, and prevented me from attacking, and one situation where I just stopped being able to block for no reason. The clunckiness of the controls also means that the platforming parts are usually a chore.\nWeapons/Items - There are far too many weapons and items in this game. There's 4 different categories of melee weapons, and then probably 5 or 6 different types within each category, and you can usually carry at least one of each type. When you combine that with all the shields, arrows, slings, potions, traps, etc, your inventory is quite difficult to manage.\n\nFinally, in my opinion the final boss fight area thing is utterly terrible. I found it so bad that rather than feeling like I achieved something, finishing the game just left a bad taste in my mouth.

Apotheon also has some increadibly frustrating moments, for example the remaining boss fights. The visuals are nice and interesting, but that interest soon vanishes.

The story is interesting, even though it isn't exactly original. I finished the game and get most of the acheivements.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yashoki/recommended/208750/","Yashoki","Yashoki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yashoki/","245 products in account","Yes.\n\nStory:\n\nThe game is simple: You're mad at Zues for being a ♥♥♥♥ so you're going to teach him a lesson or two. So with the help of his wife Hera you go on an adventure to gain favor from the other goods in whatever way you can.\n\nThe story isnt too complex, but its enough to see that you have a clear goal and the characters you meet are varied enough whether theyre naked nymphs, gods of war, or random NPCs who have trouble walking up stairs. I wont speak much more because your interactions with the various gods were pretty interesting, despite 80% of them being "♥♥♥♥ you mortal, I'm gonna kill you".\n\nGameplay:\n\nCombat\n\nThe combat is simple with just enough variety and nuance to keep it interesting. You have melee weapons with varied reach, attack speeds, and damage. Then you have your ranged weapons such as differnent types of bows, slingshot spears, and even firebombs. There are so many kinds of weapons that you'll never feel stuck once the durability of one dies out, but because there are so many, you'll eventually find one or two that you really like and end up using it the whole game with the exception of some of the bigger enemies who seem to take different types of damage from different weapons without any clear reason. The game was so short that I felt like I didnt get to use everything, but I wont fault the game for allowing me to find my niche and not punishing me for it.\n\nThere are also some fights that you can cheese because of the way some of the level are designed. +1 for things you can only do in video games like Slashing horses in the buttcheeks through floors[/spoilers]\n\nTravel/Scenery\n\nTraveling from area to area isn't hard, but I did feel like the map was a little difficult to read at parts and was thankful for the ever helpful arrow telling me where to go. That being said, you are encouraged to explore as you will often find upgrades to your armor, materials for the simple  crafting system, and replacement for your broken down weapons. And some of these maps are big.\n\nControls\n\nOther than than the combat which did feel "floaty" at times, moving around is not hard, there this fun little mechanic where if you keep running in one direction you will eventually pick up speed into a full sprint, but you will ever run in one direction for too long.\n\nThe platforming was good enough, but there was this little quirk where you can stick to certain ledges and slanted parts of the geometry that I never fully understood. It was helpful, but non-obvious.\n\nMy biggest problem with this game was swithing through weapons and various tools. I played this entire game on an X360 controller and the Dpad on this thing is horrendous, I ended up using the wrong tool or weapon very often and since you end up carrying so many different item by the end, switching in the middle of a fight was a real pain, I would have appreciated either a radial menu, or having the game stop time while I reached into the infinite space that was my pants pocket.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the controls might be floaty, the map kind of vague, and the game short I highly recommend this game.\n\nEach area you go to is varied and different enough to keep things fresh, you can play the game at your own pace, either explore everything or beat down ♥♥♥♥♥es with your hammer of justice. The combat is simple, but fun, seeing hordes of olympian guards fly through the map after laying down the law was a treat. The boss fights are simple enough not think to hard, but simple misteps will cost you a bit of health and armor.\n\nFinally this game looks and sounds amazing. The voice acting was very convincing and the art style is mesmerizing. From water to fire to lighthing it all looked great and the art team did not skimp on the bloodiness that were the Ancient Greeks.\n\nThe time involved wasnt a huge commitment which for me was a godsend (pun intended) because I favor short and sweet experiences over those that drag on.\n\nMy final word was that this game is fun, fast, beautiful and, and offers a great experience.\n\nTL;DR This game gud, kill gods, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\n\n\n","June 22, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an action platformer with unique controls and combat mechanics. The controls do take a bit of time to get used to, they could be a bit more precise and responsive, but once you get the hang of it the platforming shouldn't be any problem and the combat will become really fun. Especially during boss fights, which are really well thought out. The combat basically involves swiging your weapon and blocking with your shield at the right time and switching between your melee and ranged weapons when needed. Enemies are fairly competent too, so it keeps you on your toes and encourages you to try out all the special weapons the game gives you.\n\nIt's not quite metroidvania style as in you don't really gain additional mobility from killing bosses, but the game has two main hubs connected to several other areas you can complete in more or less any order you want. Areas will offer a lot of different challenges, the game never outlasts its welcome that way. The visual style is just plain amazing and the soundtrack is also very fitting, offering brilliant orchestral arrangements.\n\nAll in all an extremely good game. The only gripe I have with it is the fact that the controls aren't as finely tuned as they could be and the game, at least on my machine, suffers from performance issues on higher settings, while it really shouldn't.","June 21, 2015","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmonauticcat/recommended/208750/","cosmonauticcat","Insominus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmonauticcat/","101 products in account","Overall I give this game a 8.5/10 and would definetely reccomend you buy it if you like Platformers and/or Greek Mythology\n\nIf you want to know why, continue reading.\n\nCompared to other platformers, Apotheon's combat system is amazing, there's an endless combination of weapons and legendary weapons (with their respective affects) to find and evetually, break after beating in someone's skull. Not to mention armor and health upgrades that can not only be found completeing the main quest but in secret stashes and lockboxes hidden off to the side. Enemies are incredibly varied, besides the fact that they all wear red, and none of them will act alike.\n\nThe only major problems I had with this game is that every single mission in this game is a "Fed-Ex" quest, you go to retrieve an item from a God, and that God or their underlings sends you off to go do some ♥♥♥♥ (the only exception being Apollo, because he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and then you come back, fight a boss, then get the item. All the items give upgrades and you feel accomplished after getting one, but then you remember that you still have to get items from 11 more gods. You might as well carry a checklist while playing this game. The only other annoyance I had was with enemy AI, the AI for the larger enemies (Bosses, Cyclopses, Weird half-animal dudes, etc.) is great, because you can wittily outmanuevur them and shove your spear in their asses. The AI for smaller enemies isn't that great, all of the normal enemies will engage you with whatever weapons they have, and thats it. Enemies like Apollo's Guards will randomly decide to attack you with a bow, drink a potion, run away from you until potion runs out, pull out their sword, stab your toe, and then run away from you again. And obviously there's tons of these guys in one area, so killing them is more of a chore than anything else. Wolves, who only majorly appear in one part of the game, will jump attack you, run as far as the can in one direction, turn around, attack you again, and then run as far as they can in the other direction before repeating everything else. You'd honestly have more luck just running away from them rather than wasting your weapons and armor trying to kill them.\n\nThere are some pretty great parts in this game though, in Artemis' woods, some nymphs ask you to clear their home of satyrs (Olympus is overcrowded with all of the deities moving in suddenly) and you walk in to promptly find a bunch of goat-men, drunk off their asses with erect ♥♥♥♥♥ (someone actually took the time to animated a ♥♥♥♥♥ on these enemies) humping the air and getting absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. How do you get them to leave? Smash all the alcohol. Once you do that, they get so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they kill each other.\n\nOh, and the art style is pretty cool too.\n\nPlot Synopsis:\n\nYou play as Nikandreos, a Greek normalfag from the village of Dion, one day, Zeus decides "ayy lmao, humans are ♥♥♥♥" and orders all the other Olympians to neglect mortals. He also invites all deities living on Earth to come to Olympus, so that when all humans die off, everyone can go back to the Earth. Crops refuse to grow, animals disappear from the forest and even the sun lingers at one point in sky all day. Humans being humans, instead of trying to repent/stop the oncoming disaster, they decide that now would be a perfect time to steal everyone else's ♥♥♥♥. The game opens with Nikandreos stopping the pillaging of his village (and other things) by shanking every single mother♥♥♥♥♥♥ wearing a red tunic. At this point you go to the Temple of Hera where she appears, tells you to help the mortals and then sends you off to Olympus, all the while softly caressing your ♥♥♥.\n\nYou roll up on the Olympian Gates acting chill as a mofugga', and the guards who for someone reason, don't recognize you as a mortal let you in to the Agora, which acts as the overworld of the first tier of Mount Olympus.\n\nI'd rather not spoil the rest of the game so I'll just say that Olympus is full of fly honies, and that ♥♥♥♥♥ Athena got ♥♥♥ for days.","June 17, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great art and story, plus the mechanics mesh really well with both. Great level design and GREAT MUSIC. The combat and collecting is fun. Very atmospheric. I used to read a lot of greek myths and nothing made me go: EH. So pretty awesome interpretations and the quotes are definitely a nice touch. (Although where the hell was Hestia?? she always gets forgotten haha).\n\nONE WARNING: you cannot play this on the computer with mouse and keyboard. The sensitivity of the mouse is appallingly low and it cannot be changed. You need a controller. Which is really unfortunate because that means a lot of auto-aim and a lot less accuracy. It's doable though. I just don't understand how that happened, because the rest of the game is so polished.\n\nJust wish I could have taken Artemis and Athena and all the pretty friendly gods into my new pantheon and only kicked out Zeus, Apollo, (Hera), Poseidon and Ares. That would have been nice (though not the point of the game obviously).\n\nWhat would REALLY be an improvement is if the multiplayer mode also had nymphs, like it has satyrs.","July 2, 2015","true","37.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Venokris/recommended/208750/","Venokris","Disturbed One","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Venokris/","149 products in account","I had seen mixed thoughts on this game, but thought I would give it a try.\n\nI'm always very interested in ancient greek mythology, so that in itself is a major draw to this game. While the story is very reminiscent of another greek mythology game (*cough* God of War *cough*), the way it was presented set it on its own.\n\nThe art style is awesome, it's bold colors and just oozes with greek influence. It felt like I was playing a story book that was made by the ancient greeks themselves.  There is a nice variety of locals as well as your move throughout the story. While the graphics looked great, there were some slowdown issues with the framerate despite having a fairly powerful PC. They would come at random times, independant of what was going on during that particular moment.\n\nThe other part of the game that made it a very positive experience for me was the combat. Its difficult, it has a high learning curve (in my opinion), but its *satisfying*. Once you figure out how you have to space yourself for different weapon types, and how you have to actually aim your ranged weapons, it becomes very natural. I was FRUSTRATED at first, so expect that, but know the more you practice with it, the better the game becomes. You can't expect to just run in and kill everything without timing your attacks and blocks, or you'll die horribly (as I did at first).\n\nThere were a couple annoyances with the game I should mention too. For one, unless I missed some control, the map can't be moved around to search the area. This makes looking through a large map impossible, which is necessary sometimes when trying to figure out where treasure chests are, where an objective is located at specifically, or if you've already gone a certain way. Second, the weapon breaking system. It adds a degree of realism, and it allows you to try different weapons when one breaks, but it still was annoying. I enjoyed playing with the sword the most, but it always broke way too easily. I understand what the devs were trying to do with it, but it just detracts from the fun a bit in my opinion.\n\nTL;DR\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun, with great unique graphics, and very fun gameplay. The story is not very unique, but enjoyable. The map could use some tweaks, and the weapon breakage system detracts from the fun a bit. Still a highly recommended game!\n\n9/10","July 3, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Awesome work.\n\nGameplay is simple yet varied enough to maintain your interest through the hack'n'slash. There have been a few surprises that have me wondering what else they have up their sleeve. I'm really enjoying the variety of equipment that's all tied back to actual Greek weapons and armour with a few added mythological notes as you'd expect.\n\nAll in all, a well crafted game.

Apotheon is a 2D side scrolling action RPG game based on Greek mythology where your home has been destroyed by the Gods of Olympus, you have to ascend Mount Olympus and defeat the Gods\n\nIt is a simple game, but has a lot of mehcanics that need to be learnt slowly. I love Apotheon's storyline as I love Greek mythology, and seeing all the Gods, such as Poseidon, Zeus, Hades and many more in Apotheon, made me really happy seeing them in a videogame\n\nThe game's mechanics teach you not to button mash when it comes to combat, you have to strategically plan your attacks, and if you don't or fail to plan them correctly, then you are liable of being killed. The combat is simple, plan your combat correctly, strike the enemy until his/her healthbar reaches to zero, but as mentioned before its not that easy\n\nOverall, the game is not easy. It has the same amount of difficulty that Capsized offered, however, there isn't a huge difficulty spike as Capsized had\n\nThe music is wonderful and made me feel like I was on Mount Olypmus during the Greek times. The voice acting was really good, hearing every single character talk in the game was a nice addition\n\nApotheon also offers a free to play multiplayer portion which is seperate to the main game, however, for me personally, I cannot understand why Alien Trap Games made a multiplayer version so late and seperately, the multiplayer is bare bones, hardly no one plays it, whenever there is a match it always keeps on disconnecting and personally, Apotheon's multiplayer is a waste of time...\n\nApotheon is a nice game to play in short bursts, it is not an easy game, but certainly not as unforgiving as Capsized. Apotheon Arena (which is the multiplayer portion of Apotheon) is a waste of time downloading and playing\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","January 1","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story strays into the cliche at times, but otherwise is wonderfully crafted and engaging\n- Voice acting. This is something plenty games, especially sidescrollers, lack. The voice acting is spot on\n- Depth. The game has plenty locations to explore and plenty treasures to find, keeping the player interested and roaming\n- Accuracy. This is something I didn't expect, but the game tosses out old terms and quotes from the Greek poets and        Homer with astonishing regularity. This really helps the world connect back to the ancient Greek roots, unlike plenty other that wore the "Ancient Greek" label.\n- Varied Gameplay. Instead of being same-old, shoot-this kill-that, the game actively switches it up between puzzles, races, platforming challenges, and kill-them-all brawls interspersed with the occassional boss fight or conversation with an NPC. This helps it stay fresh for longer and is a welcome addition\n- Music. While it may not be to everyone's tastes, the music is hauntingly beautiful if somewhat repetitive after a time\n- Balance. This sort of game always has trouble balancing between frustratingly dificult and too easy. Apotheon manages it. There were definitely moments of sheer panic where I felt like I was being crushed, but these never crossed the line into an annoyingly hard fight.\n- Replayability. The first run through, without seeking out side quests or the like, on the easiest settings, takes about 12 hours. Have fun. I persume it will take another 12 on the next difficulty, and a lot more than that on Olympian.\n\nCons:\n- Controls. Yes, let's talk about the one major failing that this game has; the controls. They aren't all that bad, but suffer on two points: Firstly, platforming is a bit of a nuisance. The game makes you stick to any climbable surface you touch, theoretically making platform puzzles easier but also slowing you down at inopportune moments. Furthermore, archery and thrown weapons are the slightest bit inaccurate and hard to master early on.\n- Tutorial. The first mission is in essence a tutorial mission. It gives you all the basics, but no more, leaving you to puzzle out the rest on your own. Where do I get more crafting recipes? Wait, my weapons can break? Can I repair them? These questions and more are left to the player to decipher. On the one hand, this can be enjoyable if the player enjoys the challenge and the thrill of discovering something new. On the other, people who want to jump straight in may suffer a few mishaps - I myself ended up fighting a boss with only one spear as my other weapons had worn down.\n\nDespite the slightly sticky controls and the imperfect tutorial, this game is still excellent. If you enjoy sidescrollers, story-driven adventure games, or Greek mythology, this game is a perfect fit and I anticipate having a lot of fun with it.","December 10, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/208750/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","Funnily enough, a few weeks before learning about Apotheon for the first time, I had a similar idea for a Metroidvania-style game stylized to look like ancient artwork, only Egyptian-style instead of Greek. Not terribly relevant, just noting what got me enthused to play Apotheon in the first place.\n\nThe basic premise of Apotheon is that Zeus has grown tired of mankind's continuous degeneration, and has decided to call do-over and wipe the Earth clean of mortalkind, and decrees that the gods of Olympus will withdraw their favor. Crops won' grow, sun won't shine, the forests are empty of game, etc. After fending off some desperate raiders in the opening tutorial, Hera bids you to travel to Olympus and take back what the gods have deprived your people of by force. One thing leads to another and you find yourself going head to head with Zeus himself in the climactic battle.\n\nApotheon's being drawing point is definitely its artstyle. The entire game is made to look like Greek pottery art come to life, and it gives the game an identity all is own that serves the tone of the game perfectly. Gameplay wise there isn't much to talk about, pretty typical Metroidvania fare, and in the end I only have three major complaints:\n\n1. Weapon degradation has never improved a game. I imagine it was mostly added to force players to try out the different weapons in the game (there's a lot of them), but all it did was make me focus on using the worst weapons in my arsenal just so they'd break and get off the list. Breakable shields is more understandable, but generally speaking iron is slightly more sturdy than carboard and tinfoil.\n2. The game tends to take more than it gives, which made me resort to farming on more than a few occasions. Farming is for survival games and MMOs. Otherwise it just indicates poor resource distribution.\n3. The Caduceus of Hermes, while a fun exploration tool, also reveals a number of clumsy level borders, as the developers never intended those areas to be accessed. Many of these are one-way trips and can lead to falling out of the map entirely. I get the feeling the Caduceus was added to the game partway through development and the rest of the game wasn't built with it in mind.\n\nAll in all these are only mild niggles in what is otherwise a beautiful and engaging Metroidvania title. Definitely give it a go.","December 8, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art is beautiful, the story is great, the fighting system is pretty solid. There's plenty to do but not so much that you'll be overwhelmed. I usually don't feel led to accomplish a ton of side quests that only amount to extra loot or require a lot of running around, but something about Apotheon genuinely made me want to. Maybe it was the rich world the story takes place in, I'm not quite sure, but it was something I've found lacking in a lot of other similar games that give you free reign to explore.\n\nSure, the game has its setbacks. Sometimes you get absolutely bombarded by enemies and it gets repetitive or stressful, the default controls can be a bit awkward (especially if you're left-handed like me, even though I'm used to having to mess around with controls for Steam games), and the game has crashed on me a couple time, but it auto-saves frequently, so it's generally no big deal.\n\nI also adore how the developers took so much time to research and properly implement different aspects of ancient Greek mythology, art, and culture into the game, you can tell a lot of love went into it.

You might think this will be annoying, but it isn't. Each type of weapon are good in their own way. I ended up using maybe around 15 different kind of melee weapons by the end of the game; this includes tridents, flaming swords, iron rods, and spears (my favorite). I can say the same for ranged weapons as well. You can use arrows, hatchets, and more.\n\nThe map design is well done. In the grand scheme of things, the entire map is split into themes that match a personality of the associated gods. Ares, god of war, rules over a bloody, trap-filled, chaotic battler areana. Athena, goddess of wisdom, has a revolving maze. Each theme can and will change the way you battle your enemies.\n\nThe story is brought to life thanks to the great voice acting. If you have played God of War, this story will seem very similar since you have to deal with different gods.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend this game!

Captivating Greek Theme. Great Attention to Detail. Slightly Flimsy Combat. Value for Money."\n\nApotheon is a fun 2D platformer with a beautiful ancient greek pottery aesthetic. The story follows Nikandreos - a champion of humanity - who rises up against the Greek Gods to steal their powers and salvage the fate of his people. As Nikandreos, you will scale Mount Olympus and challenge the Gods in their respective realms.\n\n+ Apotheon's gameplay is quite solid, with plenty of interesting melee and ranged weaponry (historically-accurate ones included) to choose from, making for healthy variation in playing style.\n+ Great attention to detail is also displayed in level and character design, with each in-game location having a different feel and plenty of variation in the appearances of both NPCs and enemies.\n+ The music accompanies the game well and gives it great atmosphere, particularly during epic god fights. The lyre pieces, in particular, gives the game an elegant touch.\n+ The storyline is average with a cliché god-usurper plot. Nevertheless, it is well-executed.\n+ Game length is pretty substantial, well worth its price tag.\n+ A healthy level of appearance customization is available for the hero, from leather caps to wolf pelts to the iconic corinthian helmet.\n\nHowever,\n- Combat is slightly flimsy as attacks are completely mouse-dependent and can be annoyingly difficult to control when Nikandreos is surrounded by enemies, which happens fairly often.\n- The variety of actions available during melee combat is lacking, being limited to the usual stab or an upwards/overhead swing.\n- On a personal note, the amount of armor sets available for Nikandreos pales in comparison to the wide variety possessed by the NPCs, leaving something to be desired for a game so heavily focused on attaining excellent visuals.\n\nOverall, Apotheon is a good game with a composition of 55% style 45% gameplay. Its form similar to the pottery art it emulates: carefully crafted and artistically flavorful. A definite must-try if you dig its aesthetic and love classical history; a worth-trying if you're looking to play a fresh platformer.\n\nB+","April 28, 2015","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is some of the richest that I know, and some of the most entertaining, and this game does every bit of that storied culture proud. As far as I can tell, the setting described within this game is as spot on as one can get in regards to something first created thousands of years ago. The art style is amazing, I feel as if I  am fighting my way through my own Greek epic, my own legend, and the music captures that feeling even more, and honestly, the whole display would not look at all out of place on a urn or carving in a museum. When just wandering Olympus, the sound of Pipes and Lyres fill the world, but when Xiphos and Doru are drawn, out come the horns and battle drums, not to mention a chorus to build up the tension. While the style and display are among the best I have ever seen, the actual gameplay and writing technique fall slightly short. The writing itself is fine, but aside from our silent hero Nikandreos, there are few, if any, returning characters to beef up dialog. When your home village of Dion is attacked, there is little impact to seeing a Greek village engulfed in flames. Characters run around screaming the same few lines over and over again, and even the characters that do speak rarely show up again, and if they do, it is unlikely you will remember any of them. Even the Gods themselves have little to say, barely a paragraph in some cases, Hephaestus and Aphrodite being the most notable in that regard. Some gods have  more substantial amounts of dialog, mainly Zeus and Hera, but the rest talk before boss fights, and that is about it. I remember distinctly (spoilers to those who care) breaking Helios out of Prison, and expecting to see him again after I had done as he asked, but I never saw him again. He just ran off after giving me the requisite three things to blow up. The actual game portion of this game fairs slightly better, though it is also flawed in it's own respects. It is a two-dimensional brawler, with a focus on inventory and clever usage of the tools at your immediate disposal rather than special attacks. Your attack options include tossing various bombs, javelins, darts, or any weapon you happen to be holding at the time, (Hey you! Lets play catch the pike! You first!) blocking or bashing with a shield, over hand and underhand attacks, a faster but weaker stab, healing items for when you are terrible at dodging, at a roll command. Occasionally you can blow something up in the background, usually lanterns and sometimes specific urns, but for the most part that's it. This is improved somewhat with the generally very competent AI, which will attempt to use their superior numbers against you, flanking, dodging attacks, or constantly backing up so they can continue tossing infinite numbers of spears. And finally you have boss fights, when all have their own little quirks to keep them interesting; Apollo shuts off the lights, forcing you to sacrifice your shield for a torch, or else blindly fumble in the dark, Artemis takes turns hunting and being hunted by you, Poseidon attacks your ship at sea, knocking it around trying to knock you overboard, and various monster bosses have their own weaknesses and tactics. This is all well and good, but the combat fumbles a bit with the the combination of an absurd number of weapons at your disposal, and a cumbersome method of switching weapons on the fly, which leaves you vulnerable as you frantically scroll through your six different clubs to reach the hammer you want to use. The Dodge button is also rather finicky, with enemies often hitting you regardless of your efforts to dodge attacks. At the end of the day though, this is a beautiful game, with a wonderful world, with mostly entertaining combat and a mildly lackluster story. In short, I would give this game a 8/10, and a hearty recommendation.","May 17, 2015","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are many things you can do in this game:  you can challenge your inner Caligula as you attempt to slay Poseidon in an epic seas battle, defeat the legendary Jerma985 in a horse battle, and spelunking and deep sea diving for treasure, all in just one of nine playable areas! The art direction in this game is tremendous, and the combat, while clunky at first, is quite unique, and many of the boss battles are very unique; this game is more than a hack and slash affair almost all of the time (although the combat can get tedious at points). My personal favorite touch to the game were small shrines that had samplings of ancient Greek texts; these added a whole new level of detail and character to a game that was already quite full of both things. Buy this game, especially if you like 2D side-scrollers or the ancient world.

With the fall of the age of bronze and myth comes an age of iron in which zeus loses faith in humanity. The gods abandon the Earth, and only one man can stop them.\n\nAlthough this may sound "God of War"-ish, the game drops the usual hollywood fluff and special effects for a simpler and more rough myth. It is obvious from the start just how well researched the story was. Although not based on any particular myths, the Gods and other mythic characters are portrayed in a spot-on fashion. The personalities are familiar and correct to the original tales, the places visited such as Hades and the Garden of Artemis feel natural to the legends and impose a vivid and often lasting image. The games aesthetic only furthers these feelings with its use of old Greek art, where the way these ancient people saw the world was immortalized in the only fashion they knew how to use for their time. Even where the game takes liberties in its story, it still rings true to old Greek mythical ideals.\n\nWhat about the combat you may ask?\nFrom the start, I realized the combat was challenging. Many have complained that its the controls. Personaly, having beaten the game on the hardest difficulty, I can say this is not the case. Although the creators may have not have used the most ideal system for fighting, it still works quite well. Especially in a game about a mortal challenging the divine. Fighting is challenging and often fun, only frustrating in sections of the game where multiple enemies rush you at once. Weapons, armor, and shields all may break if overused. The key is timing, and the system in place feels well balanced and all-around satisfying.\n\nAll in all, a must play for anyone who's a fan of mythology. The story, characters, voice-acting, aesthetic, and even combat all wrap up for a very memorable and great work of art. 10/10 imo.","January 6","true","48.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plot was reminiscent of God of War. The voice acting is solid which surprised me for a budget game. The best thing in my opinion was the sence of exploration the game provides. Theres so many side quests and collectables. The combat is a bit to get used to but is definetly managable. The game has some great set pieces and boss battles with varying scale. Some I'd say are pretty clever and interesting in how they're approached.  There is a crafting system and upgrade system in the game. I did not really use the crafting system much in my first playthrough though.\n\nThe only real flaw the game has is the fact that weapons degrade. All weapons can be bought at shops in the game but when going through an area, its very possible to be finished with your favorite weapon a third through. This was probably most apparent in the last level when I had to go through I'd say 6 weapons just to reach the boss.","August 24, 2015","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In addition to offering surprisingly fun platforming gameplay, Apotheon does a great job of capturing the essence of the Olympian gods and their attitudes.  Especially Hera.  Zeus must have slept with a really hot mortal girl to get Hera that riled up.  The only gripe I would have is the Nephilim tier main character, Nikandreos.  Who evidently is a mortal capable of running around Olympus and slaying everything, including the gods.  They were called immortals for a reason, you know.  But I guess staying 100% true to the lore and having Zeus send him straight to Hades in the first five minutes would have made for a lousy game, so I'll give them a pass on that.  All and all, it was a wildly enjoyable game that any fan of Greek myth should like.  It even has a Dionysus drinking game!\n\n10/10\n\n\n\n...I'll never forget you, Athena.

The game map reminds me of Metroid II: Return of Samus; an overall linear progression from start to finish, but with several deviation areas that you'll need to enter in order to obtain the upgrades. Not all the upgrades are actually necessary to beat the game, but once you move up to either the 'Champion' or 'Olympian' Difficulty Settings, the extra bonuses are certainly worth going out of your way for. Finally, most sections contain at least one secret area which require hidden keys to reach.\n\nYou collect 'ingrediants' by killing enemies and then use the pause menu to craft them into useable items like potions, traps, and even summon-able allies. Collect the gold they drop to spend on new crafting recipes, more weapons, better armor, and improved combat training. There are a lot of different weapons to be obtained (both primary and secondary), and selecting the right one for any given circumstance can sometimes be the difference between life and death.\n\nThe best aspect of this game is in how well laid-out the 'boss fights' are. The scenarios are generally challenging, but not aggraviatingly so. Each fight is comeplely unique, using setting appropriate material; such as the fight against Pseidon from the deck of your ship; the seas roiling around you while he pummels your tiny vessel. Not to mention the musical scores that accompany each of the fights lends a desperation to the tone of the game not usually seen in side-scrollers.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, it took me almost 18 hours to beat it just on the first Difficulty Setting and I will definately play it through again. Not to mention, once you feel that you're pretty good at the main game, there's Apotheon Arena; the standalone multiplayer portion (which is completely FREE) if you'd like to test you mettle against the best that virtual Greece has to offer!","February 28","true","44.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tone is desolate, and horror surrounds you; you must fight your way out of the darkness. The combat system is slasher, and reminds me of Mountain Blade or Chivalry; with timing, postioning, and range being important factors of success. Ultimately, however, I found the combat to be clunky and a bit unsatisfiying with a feeling of weightlessness. Not that the combat is bad, it is fine, but it is hardly the games selling point. The gameplay really shines when scenarios of total warfare erupt and really serve of the striking imagery of the game. The visuals are truly what make this game stick; it is as if you "watching" a piece of art, rather than playing a video game...\n\nApotheon is the perfect example of an art style setting a game apart from its competition, In fact, nothing about Apotheon is unique or compelling except for the greek-themed art direction.

This isn't God of War quality here, but it's also a much smaller game and team.\nPhysics and connection of hits can look weird at times, but nothing to complain about\nWeapons degrade overtime, which is good because it forces you to try all the weapons and not just the best one\nI never bought weapons or items, only recipes and weapon training.\nYou don't get game changing god like powers similar to GOD of WAR\nMy Score:A\n\nPaid: $2.50\nCompleted in: 13 hours\n\nGames similar:\nDust: An Elysian Tail( very stylized gameplay)\nCortex Command( physics based combat and movement)\nMount and Blade( how you control your attacks)","February 26","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whitetailfox/recommended/208750/","Whitetailfox","Whitetailfox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whitetailfox/","120 products in account","An action/platformer with well thought out gameplay. Feels a bit like an action RPG in the sense that you have a degree of freedom which of your objectives to pursue and a lot of side areas to explore, there's a lot of items to find, weapons, shields, ammunition, crafting items, healing items, buff items... add to that item shops, crafting and there's a lot to do. On the other hand every item is pretty much somehow breakable or consumable meaning you always need more. The secrets themselves are fun to look for but rarely give anything you couldn't just get otherwise. There is a degree of power progression as you get more gear, buy better training and armor over time as well as get permanent buffs for completing quests although it doesn't go into metroidvania territory and upgrades aren't neccesary to open new areas.\n\nCombat itself is fun, varied and has plenty of nuance to it, several types of weapons to use with different ranges, attack types and blind spots when you attack, you can use ranged or melee weapons or even crafted explosives and occassionally items in the enviroment to your advantage.\n\nEnemies are varied although a surprising ammount of them are more annoying than dangerous, such as hit-and-run wolves, skirmishers and archers that do their damnest to keep away from you, skeletons that refuse to permanently die and so on. Even if they're not dangerous landing a hit against some of them can be a chore. Bosses themselves are pretty well done and usually just test your skills in combat, though some get tricky as well and will involve you chasing them around the arena or looking for that one item that can temporarily incapacitate them.\n\nThe game features varied enviroments, level design and often has levels distinct by structure or some gimmick that makes it memorable. When you're in Athena's realm, you have to get around through a maze filled with traps, Ares throws you in a bloody pit filled with deathmatch style combat against whoever is present and Hades will see you walking around darkness and fending off the unrelenting dead and that's just a few. This is level design done right and fits in with the personalities of the deities you face against.\n\nThe graphics style as you can see is very unique and I understand some people can be turned off by it, but it very much fits the story based on greek myths and makes the game way more stylish than if it just had generic 2D greek style enviroments. The only complaint I have here is the animations look not so well at times and in some cases could do with an overhaul.\n\nOveral, unless you suffer from an irrational hate to the style, definitely try it out. Great and memorable game that could show many other games how to make level design interesting and memorable.","January 5","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A bit subjective, but when I started, the game was somewhat difficult: you have to rely on health drops from the environment and enemies, you treasure your weaponry, and you scour the environment for every armor pickup. But, you can realize the endgame. Before long you have armor forged by demigods, weapons wielded by heroes, powers of gods, and enough potions to make Bacchus blush. And its FUN getting there.\n-Despite the cons mentioned above, the combat is still pretty fun.\n\nAll in all, recommended.

The worlds are detailed with lots of secrets and treasure to find, easily exceeding 10+ hours.

Seriously I just spent 11-12 hours beating your game and you want me to replay the whole thing on a new unlocked difficulty? With nothing else new apart from dying really quickly? This is a crappy throw back to old gaming, either have the Olympian difficulty unlocked from the start or make it a new game +.","July 20, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not terribly relevant, just noting what got me enthused to play Apotheon in the first place.\n\nThe basic premise of Apotheon is that Zeus has grown tired of mankind's continuous degeneration, and has decided to call do-over and wipe the Earth clean of mortalkind, and decrees that the gods of Olympus will withdraw their favor. Crops won' grow, sun won't shine, the forests are empty of game, etc. After fending off some desperate raiders in the opening tutorial, Hera bids you to travel to Olympus and take back what the gods have deprived your people of by force. One thing leads to another and you find yourself going head to head with Zeus himself in the climactic battle.\n\nApotheon's being drawing point is definitely its artstyle. The entire game is made to look like Greek pottery art come to life, and it gives the game an identity all is own that serves the tone of the game perfectly. Gameplay wise there isn't much to talk about, pretty typical Metroidvania fare, and in the end I only have three major complaints:\n\n1. Weapon degradation has never improved a game. I imagine it was mostly added to force players to try out the different weapons in the game (there's a lot of them), but all it did was make me focus on using the worst weapons in my arsenal just so they'd break and get off the list. Breakable shields is more understandable, but generally speaking iron is slightly more sturdy than carboard and tinfoil.\n2. The game tends to take more than it gives, which made me resort to farming on more than a few occasions. Farming is for survival games and MMOs. Otherwise it just indicates poor resource distribution.\n3. The Caduceus of Hermes, while a fun exploration tool, also reveals a number of clumsy level borders, as the developers never intended those areas to be accessed. Many of these are one-way trips and can lead to falling out of the map entirely. I get the feeling the Caduceus was added to the game partway through development and the rest of the game wasn't built with it in mind.\n\nAll in all these are only mild niggles in what is otherwise a beautiful and engaging Metroidvania title. Definitely give it a go.","December 8, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork is beautiful, the gods and mythos interesting, the gameplay is fun, and there's both enough challenge and slack to appeal to higher and lower skill levels. The game is not long in terms of its main story (it took me 9 hours total), though it can be fun to explore a bit and try to get the acheivements, or just bash some enemies, so there's potential to pad the run time, or replay.\n\nThe game does have its faults though. For me, the controls were spotty most of the time. Areas that required precise and agile platforming were absolutely horrible, and when combine with the pressure of combat made for an entirely unenjoyable experience. The controls also prevented me from enjoying all that Apotheon's combat had to offer, since I could never actually do anything more advanced than flail a spear at my enemies. Also, the game will hard crash at times. The crashes usually occur when loading in a new area or cutscene, and the auto-saver does a pretty good job of covering you so that it's a simple matter of rebooting and hitting continue, but it's not perfect, and you might have to completely redo a boss battle if it fails (I did).\n\nIn summary, the controls are imprecise and problematic, there are issues with hard crashes, but Apotheon will deliver what it promises, namely unique and interesting mythological Greek gameplay.","December 28, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat system is a little bit different, but in my oppinion it's really well designed. You can have an off-hand and main-hand (standard stuff, I know) but they have tons and tons of weapons that have various damages and attack speeds. You also get exhausted, so the more you attack the slower you'll attack until you take a break between attacking and re-gain attack speed (the bar goes up really fast, it's not like fight someone, wait 2 minutes, fight someone else). When blocking with a shield it shows an area that you can move around to block attacks.\n\nThere's also armor that basically adds more health in the sense that all damafe done to you will be dealt to your armor. Sometimes when killing enemies they'll drop blue things that'll restore your armor a certain amount (even if armor level reaches 0, they don't break).\n\nOverall this is a great game and definitely worth 15$.

The game map reminds me of Metroid II: Return of Samus; an overall linear progression from start to finish, but with several deviation areas that you'll need to enter in order to obtain the upgrades. Not all the upgrades are actually necessary to beat the game, but once you move up to either the 'Champion' or 'Olympian' Difficulty Settings, the extra bonuses are certainly worth going out of your way for. Finally, most sections contain at least one secret area which require hidden keys to reach.\n\nYou collect 'ingrediants' by killing enemies and then use the pause menu to craft them into useable items like potions, traps, and even summon-able allies. Collect the gold they drop to spend on new crafting recipes, more weapons, better armor, and improved combat training. There are a lot of different weapons to be obtained (both primary and secondary), and selecting the right one for any given circumstance can sometimes be the difference between life and death.\n\nThe best aspect of this game is in how well laid-out the 'boss fights' are. The scenarios are generally challenging, but not aggraviatingly so. Each fight is comeplely unique, using setting appropriate material; such as the fight against Pseidon from the deck of your ship; the seas roiling around you while he pummels your tiny vessel. Not to mention the musical scores that accompany each of the fights lends a desperation to the tone of the game not usually seen in side-scrollers.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, it took me almost 18 hours to beat it just on the first Difficulty Setting and I will definately play it through again. Not to mention, once you feel that you're pretty good at the main game, there's Apotheon Arena; the standalone multiplayer portion (which is completely FREE) if you'd like to test you mettle against the best that virtual Greece has to offer!","February 28","true","44.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stats are not the only thing that give weapons their power. Each weapon among having stats has range and movement patterns that really make combat about qualitative differences instead of hunting the best drops.\n\nWeapons break and so they function as a limited reasource, but they are easily replaceable.\n\nThey do rpg mechanics well. Instead of just being lazy and adding an experience bar they had upgrades you can buy from vendors.\n\nThe grinding doesn't really exist. Times when I couldn't defeat a boss therefore I decided to go and collect gold to imrove my abilities I wasn't really grinding it actually allowed me to explore areas and find things that I had missed.\n\nThe game doesn't just shower you with new upgrades, weapons, items, etc. It provides enough gameplay were you feel that you can master each aspect and really build your abilities as a good player of the game.\n\nThe games astetic is amazing.\nThe artists did an amazing job with the making you feel like you are in this ancient greek world.\nThe level design is lively you actually interact with it and it is not just about using gimicks you actually develop your character.\nThe voice acting while not the best gives you enough story and interaction that it feels some what genuine while not bogging you down in nonsense that doesn't matter.\n\nController support. I mean with a game like this it is great to have and they actually do it well so that it is actually worth having unlike other games that claim to be controller supported.\n\nThings that I dislike:\n\nFrame rate sucks.

I've been fascinated with Greek mythology since I was a child, and am not used to seeing it presented with such fidelity in any entertainment medium. I enjoyed Disney's animated Hercules film, and the first two God of War games on Playstation, but in either one of those cases the mythology could have been swapped with entirely original characters and no one would have known the difference. Here, the mythology IS the story, and it's done very well. And I am in love with the visuals: the varied color palettes, the silhouetted Greek pottery art style complete with texture and lighting overlay and simulated imperfections. I could stare at it forever; it's gorgeous... and the music is wonderful, too.\n\nYet it's so difficult to unconditionally recommend the game, and the combat and controls are the reason. Using mouse and keyboard, the game controls like Terraria: Move with WASD, jump with spacebar, and control your weapons with the mouse, pointing the cursor around the screen to determine the direction you will strike. You will either be okay with these controls, or you will hate them. Personally, I thought they worked pretty well most of the time. I didn't love the apparent inability to choose how I was going to swing my weapon, but I didn't find it much of an issue on the normal difficulty, which is a little on the easy side. Now if I spent a few hours on Olympian difficulty, I might feel much differently. I haven't decided whether I'm going to attempt that yet.\n\nOverall, though, I am thoroughly impressed with this game. Loved it, loved it.","February 9","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat system is totally amazing, and despite everyone complaining about the controls you can rebind them.\n\nAll the negative reviews were either about the combat system or controls for the most part, but I like both. The combat system is a little bit different, but in my oppinion it's really well designed. You can have an off-hand and main-hand (standard stuff, I know) but they have tons and tons of weapons that have various damages and attack speeds. You also get exhausted, so the more you attack the slower you'll attack until you take a break between attacking and re-gain attack speed (the bar goes up really fast, it's not like fight someone, wait 2 minutes, fight someone else). When blocking with a shield it shows an area that you can move around to block attacks.\n\nThere's also armor that basically adds more health in the sense that all damafe done to you will be dealt to your armor. Sometimes when killing enemies they'll drop blue things that'll restore your armor a certain amount (even if armor level reaches 0, they don't break).\n\nOverall this is a great game and definitely worth 15$. Paying 4$ for this is practically cheating the developers.","February 23","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art is beautiful, the story is great, the fighting system is pretty solid. There's plenty to do but not so much that you'll be overwhelmed. I usually don't feel led to accomplish a ton of side quests that only amount to extra loot or require a lot of running around, but something about Apotheon genuinely made me want to. Maybe it was the rich world the story takes place in, I'm not quite sure, but it was something I've found lacking in a lot of other similar games that give you free reign to explore.\n\nSure, the game has its setbacks. Sometimes you get absolutely bombarded by enemies and it gets repetitive or stressful, the default controls can be a bit awkward (especially if you're left-handed like me, even though I'm used to having to mess around with controls for Steam games), and the game has crashed on me a couple time, but it auto-saves frequently, so it's generally no big deal.\n\nI also adore how the developers took so much time to research and properly implement different aspects of ancient Greek mythology, art, and culture into the game, you can tell a lot of love went into it. This game has made it into my top 10 favorite video games in record time, and I'm definitely looking forward to whatever the developer, Alien Trap is planning next.","June 30, 2015","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great art and story, plus the mechanics mesh really well with both. Great level design and GREAT MUSIC. The combat and collecting is fun. Very atmospheric. I used to read a lot of greek myths and nothing made me go: EH. So pretty awesome interpretations and the quotes are definitely a nice touch. (Although where the hell was Hestia?? she always gets forgotten haha).\n\nONE WARNING: you cannot play this on the computer with mouse and keyboard. The sensitivity of the mouse is appallingly low and it cannot be changed. You need a controller. Which is really unfortunate because that means a lot of auto-aim and a lot less accuracy. It's doable though. I just don't understand how that happened, because the rest of the game is so polished.\n\nJust wish I could have taken Artemis and Athena and all the pretty friendly gods into my new pantheon and only kicked out Zeus, Apollo, (Hera), Poseidon and Ares. That would have been nice (though not the point of the game obviously).\n\nWhat would REALLY be an improvement is if the multiplayer mode also had nymphs, like it has satyrs.","July 2, 2015","true","37.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the story is very reminiscent of another greek mythology game (*cough* God of War *cough*), the way it was presented set it on its own.\n\nThe art style is awesome, it's bold colors and just oozes with greek influence. It felt like I was playing a story book that was made by the ancient greeks themselves.  There is a nice variety of locals as well as your move throughout the story. While the graphics looked great, there were some slowdown issues with the framerate despite having a fairly powerful PC. They would come at random times, independant of what was going on during that particular moment.\n\nThe other part of the game that made it a very positive experience for me was the combat. Its difficult, it has a high learning curve (in my opinion), but its *satisfying*. Once you figure out how you have to space yourself for different weapon types, and how you have to actually aim your ranged weapons, it becomes very natural. I was FRUSTRATED at first, so expect that, but know the more you practice with it, the better the game becomes. You can't expect to just run in and kill everything without timing your attacks and blocks, or you'll die horribly (as I did at first).\n\nThere were a couple annoyances with the game I should mention too. For one, unless I missed some control, the map can't be moved around to search the area. This makes looking through a large map impossible, which is necessary sometimes when trying to figure out where treasure chests are, where an objective is located at specifically, or if you've already gone a certain way. Second, the weapon breaking system. It adds a degree of realism, and it allows you to try different weapons when one breaks, but it still was annoying. I enjoyed playing with the sword the most, but it always broke way too easily. I understand what the devs were trying to do with it, but it just detracts from the fun a bit in my opinion.\n\nTL;DR\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun, with great unique graphics, and very fun gameplay. The story is not very unique, but enjoyable. The map could use some tweaks, and the weapon breakage system detracts from the fun a bit. Still a highly recommended game!\n\n9/10","July 3, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Feels a bit like an action RPG in the sense that you have a degree of freedom which of your objectives to pursue and a lot of side areas to explore, there's a lot of items to find, weapons, shields, ammunition, crafting items, healing items, buff items... add to that item shops, crafting and there's a lot to do. On the other hand every item is pretty much somehow breakable or consumable meaning you always need more. The secrets themselves are fun to look for but rarely give anything you couldn't just get otherwise. There is a degree of power progression as you get more gear, buy better training and armor over time as well as get permanent buffs for completing quests although it doesn't go into metroidvania territory and upgrades aren't neccesary to open new areas.\n\nCombat itself is fun, varied and has plenty of nuance to it, several types of weapons to use with different ranges, attack types and blind spots when you attack, you can use ranged or melee weapons or even crafted explosives and occassionally items in the enviroment to your advantage.\n\nEnemies are varied although a surprising ammount of them are more annoying than dangerous, such as hit-and-run wolves, skirmishers and archers that do their damnest to keep away from you, skeletons that refuse to permanently die and so on. Even if they're not dangerous landing a hit against some of them can be a chore. Bosses themselves are pretty well done and usually just test your skills in combat, though some get tricky as well and will involve you chasing them around the arena or looking for that one item that can temporarily incapacitate them.\n\nThe game features varied enviroments, level design and often has levels distinct by structure or some gimmick that makes it memorable. When you're in Athena's realm, you have to get around through a maze filled with traps, Ares throws you in a bloody pit filled with deathmatch style combat against whoever is present and Hades will see you walking around darkness and fending off the unrelenting dead and that's just a few. This is level design done right and fits in with the personalities of the deities you face against.\n\nThe graphics style as you can see is very unique and I understand some people can be turned off by it, but it very much fits the story based on greek myths and makes the game way more stylish than if it just had generic 2D greek style enviroments. The only complaint I have here is the animations look not so well at times and in some cases could do with an overhaul.\n\nOveral, unless you suffer from an irrational hate to the style, definitely try it out. Great and memorable game that could show many other games how to make level design interesting and memorable.","January 5","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is probably the prettiest game I have ever played.\nThe Story - The story is clever and is tight enough to be told purely through stuff that actually happens in game, so there is zero mucking around with a billion codex pages like some games.\nLevel design - Every level is challenging in it's own way, and no two levels will be resolved in the same situation, some will require a stealthy approach, some will require straight out bloodshed, and some will need brains rather than brawn.\nSubject matter - This game delves far into greek mythology and is excellent in using it.\nCombat - Combat is challenging, but if you take enemies as they arrive, it is usually quite manageable, and will leave you with a sense of accomplishment after the more difficult enemies.\nTeaching the player - This game sort of throws the player right into the thick of it and teaches as it goes. It teaches everything you need to know without being too heavy or too light with the explanations.\n\nBad\nControls - With a keyboard the controls are somewhat clunky and some attacks, especially the bow, are very slow to respond. I even had some occurences where some of the more exotic weapons completely broke down, and prevented me from attacking, and one situation where I just stopped being able to block for no reason. The clunckiness of the controls also means that the platforming parts are usually a chore.\nWeapons/Items - There are far too many weapons and items in this game. There's 4 different categories of melee weapons, and then probably 5 or 6 different types within each category, and you can usually carry at least one of each type. When you combine that with all the shields, arrows, slings, potions, traps, etc, your inventory is quite difficult to manage.\n\nFinally, in my opinion the final boss fight area thing is utterly terrible. I found it so bad that rather than feeling like I achieved something, finishing the game just left a bad taste in my mouth. The entire section just completely ignored all the strengths of the game and used level designs and mechanics that emphasised everything that was wrong with the game.\n\nHowever, with the exception of the truly awful ending, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and I would recommend it.\n\n","June 26, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seriously I just spent 11-12 hours beating your game and you want me to replay the whole thing on a new unlocked difficulty? With nothing else new apart from dying really quickly? This is a crappy throw back to old gaming, either have the Olympian difficulty unlocked from the start or make it a new game +.","July 20, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I actually really enjoyed reading about the different gods and godesses and how they contributed to the lifesytle of humans.

The artistic style was refreshing, the combat mechanics are pretty advanced (but not complicated), the music set a great tone, and it had a great sense of exploration.  I liked the mood of the game - it's hard to describe, but it's a feeling that most games don't offer.\n\nI only have three major complaints about the game:\n1. The British accent of all the characters was off-putting.  It really shouldn't be that hard to do a Greek accent.\n2. There were too many items to work with, and it felt clumsy all the way to the end.  I pretty much never used any potions unless I knew I was just about to get into a fight.  The way I see it, being able to throw melee weapons was unnecessary and the controller button for it should have been replaced with either "attack with projectile weapon" or "use potion".\n3. The introduction to the story was really lacking.  The story as the game portrays it is decent, but it felt like there were gaps in it.  I suppose it's better if you actually read things like The Odessey.\n\nAnyway, Apotheon is a great game and reminded me a lot of Diablo II, except requires more skill.","February 28","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
