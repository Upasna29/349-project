The €20 price tag was enough to make me take a look in to what I would find. I was assured that, despite the interface driven gameplay, this was not a hidden object or pixel hunting game - and I have happily found that this was true. This is a genuine adventure game, in the classical sense - it reminds me of the many, many titles released in the late 90's, which so frequently had fantastic story and design. Noir - A Shadowy Thriller; Sacred Mirror of Kofun...I could go on. These games took on a semi-mythical status due to it being so hard to find them - a demo disc tease was all you got sometimes - but when you could find them, they were so deep and enjoyable, it was worth the search.\n\nTo find this game, so long after these classics were produced, afloat in a sea of triple-A explosion fests and MMO-RPG-FPS-OMG-STFU games...well, it feels like finally spotting that cardboard game box on the shelf at the local gaming store.\n\nThat said, this is anything but old fashioned. The interface is slick and responsive, and the game looks beautiful, especially in the Full HD mode. It's not going to tax your video card, but the rich art and loving details make for an immersive environment. Foley (sound effects) and music significantly contribute to this sensation.\n\nIt is cleverly written, and the story and characters are immensely enjoyable - give them just a little time to grow on you, they will. It's the kind of game you keep thinking about when you stop playing - you imagine yourself in the character's shoes, imagine what you would be doing in the same situation, what you would be feeling...you create your own narratives. Anything which stimulates your imagination in that way is a great argument against anyone who would claim that video games are inherently dumber than books, for example.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of puzzles in games - the often break the pace, or aren't logical - but I love the puzzles in J.U.L.I.A. Maybe I'm not a fan of puzzles because they're not often done this well. Even the instantly familiar "pipe" style puzzles are different from the norm, so well done and with a proper feeling of reward on completion. Cracking datapads, figuring out door codes, all the while wandering the corridors of long dead stations, a subtle threat looming in your mind...it all fits very well. And the threat is not an IN YOUR FACE, IN YOUR FACE, YOU'RE GETTING STABBED IN YOUR FACE kind of threat...it's an instinctual fear of what you can't see, what might be coming. And that's so much worse. Yet, you're safe up on the ship, while the robot explores. That works really well, as you're sitting at a PC remotely controlling the robot, just as Rachel would be. And just like her, you're safe. Right? Right?!","September 13, 2014","true","19.3"," 126 of 131 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","126","131","5","9"

Highly recommend, though maybe wait till its a bit cheaper as it is not a super long game.\n\nPros\n- Good atmosphere\n- Solid story, kept me going throughout the game\n- Very nice look to the game, especially for an indie\n- Voice acting is decent, MOBOT is great though\n- Some Puzzles are very good. Require some real thinking and are not just mindless A-Z things. However...\n\nCons\n- Some puzzles are annoying in the extreme. Not in terms of difficulty, but in the actual practice of doing them.For example, an end game translation puzzles resets every time you fail, so if you have 2/3rds of it translated, one wrong click makes you reenter all the info you already know to be correct. Just annoying.\n- First few worlds are nice and lengthy, the last 2-3 fly by and are less than 6 screens each for the most part.\n- I had two crashes, both while saving my game. The save still worked, but not ideal.","December 28, 2014","true","5.5"," 109 of 113 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","109","113","2","0"

You even learn to communicate with alien beings in a weird at first glance but highly rewarding puzzle. There is some freedom in what planet you choose to travel to, although since you have to unlock abilities for some of them, the right order is fairly linear.\n+ Nice interface, everything is in order. Important clues you find are being documented, no need to keep notes (like in the old good days of adventure gaming).\n+ Good length, around 10 hours or much more if you get stuck at some puzzles.\n\n+/- Mindomatic is a puzzle where you have to reconstruct the order things happened, very well thought puzzle but found it too frustrating to complete. On the other hand if you complete those puzzles, it's certain you paid attention and understood every tiny part of the story...\n\n- The repetitive blueprint puzzles that become progressively more difficult, but are vital to progress.\n-  Story becomes too dramatic after a point and unbelievable. I like sci-fi stories a lot, but those that are close to our reality. In other words i love the mystery side of the story but i didn't like the magic side of it. Overall the writing is very good though.\n\n\nThe game was way above my expectations, it is a very polished classic adventure game but with modern interface and presentation and the way it plays is refreshing for the genre. Highly recommended to those interested in the genre/theme whether on sale or not.","September 22, 2015","true","13.0"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","40","43","0","0"

I say this even though I would not consider this style of game one of my favored genres.  It's that good.\n\nThe majority of the gameplay experience happens through the "eyes" of Mobot, an intelligent multipurpose exploration robot that follows the directions of your character, Rachel (an astrobiologist) on board a deep space probe that is run by a somewhat acerbic AI named Julia.\n\nYou navigate between very beautifully rendered scenes looking for clues, insightful information and solving the odd contextual puzzle obstacle.  Puzzles are very logical and are not heavy on pixel-hunting or the combination of seemingly unrelated items.  This makes them feel very much part of the world you're exploring rather than a strange abstract that draws you out of it.\n\nDecend to Xenophon if you...\nARE a fan of interface-based puzzle/adventures such as Myst.  A must buy in your case.\nLove a well-told sci-fi yarn.  I would not say the story is completely original, with some plot points being somewhat cliche, but the actual delivery of the plot is well-polished.  All character dialog is well-voiced.  Although you might predict some plot twists ahead of time, others will keep you guessing and it's a satisfying story arc.\nEnjoy narrative-focused puzzle games.  There is no nonsensical puzzle solving here.  All puzzles make contextual sense, which adds to the immersion rather than distracting from it.\nAre looking for a thoughtful change of pace.\nReturn to cryosleep if you...\nExpect any action.  Although there are a few sort of tense moments, you are never really in danger.\nWant a hardcore puzzle game.  Although some puzzles in JULIA can be challenging, the majority of them can be solved in under 5 minutes.\nDislike high-concept sci-fi.  If you think the only good alien is a dead alien, you might think the plot of JULIA a little stuffy.\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMy worst dig at JULIA is that the game feels too short.  I really wanted for there to be just another planet or two to explore and a couple more styles of puzzle to unravel.  I suppose being left wanting more is not altogether bad.  The story does seem to borrow a page or three from 2001: A Space Odyssey but does so in a way that is very original and just as thought-provoking.  I had a great time with this cerebral space epic, and if you enjoy a good mystery there's not much reason for you to not give it a try.  You'll make Mobot sad if you don't.  Please don't make Mobot sad.","March 16, 2015","true","12.1"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","33","36","3","0"

How comes? I'm attributing it mostly to the developers keen sense of what makes a good space adventure game coupled with good production values and an enjoyable story.\n\nWhen I started playing this game, something definitely clicked. I rarely play a single game non-stop unless it's really short, but I couldn't put this game down. There was enough mystery in the story to make me want to find out what has happened in the protagonist's past. The feel of adventure and exploration was also there, discovering the different worlds within the star system was one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game. Each of the worlds were vastly different and snooping through the different science bases piecing together the mystery was fun.\n\nMechanics wise this game is a fairly standard point and click game. The puzzles in this game felt just right, unlike in many other point and click  games where developers add difficulty by throwing in illogical and unintuitive solutions. I wouldn't say any of the puzzles were hard in this game, but I didn't feel like they were too easy either, the pacing in that sense was very good. It is also worth noting that reading in an important part of this game. Your character has the  chance to read through quite a few emails sent and received by her fellow crewman, some of these may help you with the puzzles, but they will also help you piece together what happened in the story.\n\nIn the end, the different elements of the game just came together for me and worked very well. The atmosphere, the exploration, the mystery, it all made for a really great space adventure. There aren't many space adventure games on Steam like this, this fills in a hole for a very niche crowd and does so brilliantly. If you want a spectacular space adventure with a good flavoring of mysticism a la Space Odyssey, an enjoyable story, and puzzles that feel just right, this game is definitely worth your time and money.","December 19, 2015","true","9.0"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","32","35","0","0"

Though the puzzles were very enjoyable, I didn't find the story very interesting or the characters engaging. The CGI is polished but animation is very jerky and unrealistic. The game gets a lot of basic science so wrong that it's simply immersion-breaking (nitrogen gas is explosive now?).\n\nIf you like puzzle games and want to try out an interesting sci-fi puzzle, go for it.

A great adventure game with seamless Linux support!\n\nI loved this game! It has it's flaws: a few unpolished text-pieces that the editor missed, a few pieces of dialouge that miss audio, a few logcial inconsistencies, and at least two puzzels whose premisses are complete nonsense from a Science perspective (I don't mind the science fiction elements, but there were occasions when they simply got the day-to-day science wrong that made me cringe. The one that most bugged me involved Nitrogen being depicted as an explosive compound, which is most definitely is not -- if they had swapped Nitrogen for Oxygen all would have been fine...).\n\nThe classic game it is most like, and probably owes most debt to, is probably Mission Critical, which is also very good. The gameplay is similar to this game, with several mini-game like puzzels inbetween. This provides a less seamless player experience compared to e.g. the Myst series, and makes "suspension of disbelief" a little less convincing, but it works fairly well within the SciFi-setting. Most of the mini-games are fun, and even those that are not make sense, though there were a few that were plain frustrating even if I understood what I was supposed to do. The game-play is also aided by an unobtrusive hint-function that helps you find hot-spots within the scenes. This may be considered cheating by hard-core gamers, but it is optional and I think it is a neccessary function for advanced and detailed graphics such as these. If you are an acheivement hunter, then this game is also promising, with loads of acheivements to unlock. On my system (Linux), however, there seems to be a problem with this, but in principle at least there is a lot to go for.\n\nThe story also reminds me a lot of Mission Critical, at least the premise: sole survivor has to find out what's happened while they were out cold. It is told in beuatiful graphics (that seem to be inspired by Riven and the other Myst games more than by Mission Critical -- there is also a nod to 2001), very good voice acting, and with a brilliant progressive-rock-esque sound track. There are some inconsistencies in the story, in that some things can be preformed before you logically should be able to, but nothing that is a game breaker. The story took me approximately 8 hours to complete, and is (more or less) linear, but that's the way I prefer it.\n\nAll in all, a very well designed, melancholy space adventure, well worth my money and my time! I don't say this about games often, but I look forward to playing this one again!","November 8, 2014","true","4.6"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","0"

"J.U.L.I.A.: Among the Stars" has a great ambiance that immediately sells you on the premise of your being a lone human explorer in space, Rachel Manners, working with the ship's onboard computer, J.U.L.IA., and the exploration robot, MOBOT, to solve the mystery of what happened to the rest of the crew.\n\nIt provides good variety on the planets to be explored -everything from jungles and deserts to underwater exploration- as well as a number of puzzles, some of which, however, lack any sort of guidance and will either leave you scratching your head for a good long while or searching google for a walkthrough. That is probably the low point of the game for me, While I will readily admit it's been a while since I last played a game -any game, really- with challenging puzzles, there are quite a few puzzles in J.U.L.I.A. that can only be solved by a trial-and-error approach instead of gathering clues and I usually prefer the latter to the former.\n\nBeyond that, my only other complaint, or wish rather, is that I had hoped the game would go on for a few more hours but I clocked 6 hours and still have some things left for the completionist in me. The music, sound and art design, are high points of the game, all of them adding to the superb atmosphere. There's been mention that the soundtrack will be released at some point and I'm looking forward to it.\n\nIn the end, I think it's a solid point 'n click that leaves the door open for a sequel that I hope comes to fruition some day. In the spirit of full disclosure I did buy the game during the Valentine's Day 50% off sale so it was definitely great value for money in my case. If you're looking for 10+ hours of gameplay that will ultimately depend on your ability to solve puzzles, your patience, and determination not to google a walkthrough. For my part, it makes me hopeful about the point 'n click genre again.\n","March 2, 2015","true","7.0"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","0"

The varied settings, atmosphere and general pacing of the game kept me glued til I completed the game.... but I have to say that it climaxed about 75-80% into the game for me and sort of sputtered in the end. The story got wilder and wilder and introduced some unnecessary layers and characters. The visuals are great and I love the accompanying background music (unintrusive, good looping, sets the mood just right), and some of the main characters are quite memorable, but I doubt I'll remember or care about the story even a week from now.\n\nThe game interactions are heavily flavored with computer assisted interfaces and graphics. This fits in with the storyline and actually works well to frame your limited options. If it weren't for this, I would make a bigger deal from the fact that YOU CANNOT PAN THE VIEW in any scenes. There are hotspots that you can click, and they may let you zoom in\out of points of interests or lets you move between places. NO ANIMATED zoom in\out motion or movement between spots, except for the cutscenes. Most of the screens have animated parts, though (flickering light, billowing dusts, etc) so you'd never think that you're staring at a static picture.\n\nOh, another negative point for this game is that the puzzles are generic ones that are skinned to fit within the game's universe. That's right, (just) visually skinned to fit in. They look right for the settings, but bears minimal logical connection to the storyline. The ones that tied in the most to the storyline that I can think of are the language translation puzzles and the password guessing ones.\n\nI can't say that I'd recommend this game... especially at the current price.","September 21, 2014","false","14.4"," 43 of 58 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","43","58","0","3"

And aside from an akward loading screen here and a wrong soundclip being played there, the game is technically sound.\nIt's problems lie in design. The order in which the you visit the different planets is up to you, but in order to have the story make the most sense, there's a specific way in which you should do it.\nThere's two plotthreads, one focussing on your crew and and the other on the history of the galaxy you're in. However, the focus is on neither and at the end the game just kind off fizzles out with no real impact or consequence. Most researchable item descriptions boil down to the same hing and are of no use whatsoever. There are some really vague plot-devices that aren't properly explained and the one instance where a morale choice is posed seems really out of place.\nNon of that outweighs the experience as a whole, though.

One regret - it's over. I was hooked from the outset and played through this game in 3 sessions. I found it to be a very compelling experience and commend the devs for creating such a thought provoking experience.\nThe graphics are gorgeous and the ever changing UI was both innovative and intuitive. Sounds and music are very apt and the degree of tasks and puzzles keep you going back for more. I found the puzzles to be logical for the most part. A few did require some serious effort but this only enhanced the sense of reward upon solving them. The sense of exploration and accomplishment was high and the situations and encounters very immersive.\n\nIf you like this type of game, I highly recommend you do yourself a favour and give it a try.  If you are interested in space exploration and sci-fi and like to solve mysteries then this game is a must play.

And the fact that they only got on the low end of five digits through their crowdfunding effort. It took me about eight hours from start to finish, so there’s a sizable chunk of content…about average for a contemporary point-and-click adventure game. Most of the puzzles are pretty simple to navigate with some deductive reasoning, but some are rather headscratchingly difficult. I found myself having to consult a walkthrough for each of the upgrades, for instance. Still, the experience more than makes up for this shortcoming.\n\nAll in all, anyone who’s a fan of science fiction should definitely give this game a try. It’s got space exploration, intrigue and a mystery that deepens the further you dig, and even some philosophical debate if you’re into that sort of thing. It’s not easy to make decisions when you’re on your own in an unknown sector of space, after all. And, while I tried to stay altruistic in my dealings with any natives sometimes the “right way” is not always the “best way” to deal with situations.

I really connected with them, and felt that they were fleshed out very well.\n- Even though there is little animation (this game is very much like the Myst series) there is enough to keep you interested, and the scenery and backgrounds are beautiful.\n\nHere are a few things that I did not care for:\n\n- I didn't like the fact that the story was pretty much handed to me before the end was near. I was also disappointed with the ending, because it's kind of a let down.\n- I really, really enjoyed certain puzzles, and when the puzzles were challenging but fun, I thoroughly enjoyed this game.

After saving the ship from an asteroid field she teams up with the ship's AI, Julia, and the team's scouting robot, Mobot, to find out what happened to the rest of the crew. This adventure will take them all over an entire solar system as they explore strange alien worlds. These worlds are beautifully crafted and the quality graphics really make for a strong and immersive atmosphere. The writing is also quite good, Rachel, Julia, and Mobot all have good chemistry together and are likable. All this combined makes JULIA one of those games that make you feel that you're a part of the journey and you want to see it through.\n\nWhen it comes to the puzzles I'm going against the popular opinion in the Steam reviews so far and say that the puzzles overall suck. They don't suck in the Sierra sense of missing something and making the game unwinnable and there's no pixel hunting thanks to Mobot's hotspot button, but the puzzles are just more obtuse than they need to be because the tutorials for the puzzles tend to be kind of bad. There are several puzzles that actually have easy solutions but good luck figuring that out. The last half of the game is also filled with puzzles that are impossible to solve without trial and error which makes it a chore.\n\nJust play with a guide and save yourself the headache because the really good atmopshere and writing make this game worth playing.","September 15, 2014","true","9.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I played through twice just to investigate everything, make different choices, and get almost all the achievements.\n\nI like that you can save whenever you like. If you make a bad choice, you can reload a previous save and replay. However, it would be nice if the "save" allowed you to name the save. The saves just show a picture of the planet you were on and the time-stamp for the save. But since you need to go back to some locations more than once, it isn't always easy to determine which save is the one you want to load.\n\nSome puzzles were easy and others were terribly hard, but that made it more fun.\n\nCaveat: There is an area in the game where I repeatedly ran into a game bug that caused the game to crash. The issue has been reported by a number of people. So saving beforehand is critical to avoid a lot of replay if you encounter the problem.  On Zenobia, the water planet, save before you enter the submarine. The bug occurs when you are figuring out how to deal with the underwater electrifying creature.\n\n[Updated after playing the DLC - Untold Story]\nThe DLC consists of 5 batches of 10 schematics to solve like those in the original game. I really love doing those puzzles, so I was very happy. As you finish a set of schematics you get a "story board" version of the back story on J.U.L.I.A and Rachel.

It has an interesting story and pretty visuals. The soundtrack also matches it quite nicely. It's an impressive showing from a development team of two.\n\nThe puzzles were a mix of basic, straightoward clicking/exploration and some rather arbitrary puzzles towards the end. There were several pattern and decryption games I found interesting, but for the most part the puzzles are more random than logical (fortunately, the majority of them are simple and linear). I would've liked to see more logical puzzles that stemmed from the gameplay and clues you found, and had to piece together, but this was largely absent. The closest it came to that was key codes and the Mind-O-Matic parts that really just amounted to testing your short-term memory (or ability to write things down). The Mind-O-Matics were particularly frustrating because they were fairly arbitrary and it had less to do with having the correct sequence of events, and more to do with having the exact solution the authors came up with (made worse by the lack of a meaningful log mechanic to easily view previously discovered information). I likewise found most of the "history / translation" exercises clumsy and arbitrary, which was unfortunate.\n\nThis isn't really a deal-breaker though, because you don't play this game for the puzzles; more for the atmosphere, music, and story, which more than make up for it. It's a narrative-driven game, and it does a good job of maintaining that without feeling too linear.\n\nIt's a nice story, in an engrossing atmosphere that will keep your interest until the end. It's not really a puzzle game (at least the puzzle elements really aren't so strong, and due to their often arbitrary nature (with the exception of a few solid pattern-matching excercises) you shouldn't feel guilty if you want to consult a guide to help move you along. I wouldn't recommend this at full price, but on sale for 50% off or more, I would say it's definitely worth your money if you like this type of game.\n\nIt's a nice little gem from a two-person inde team. It looks and feels like a game developed by a much larger dev team. Get it on sale and you'll definitely feel that you got your money's worth. It's a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I would rate it at about 5-8 hours worth of content (wasn't keeping track).","February 13, 2015","true","4.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The transition from mystery to more pure sci-fi near the midpoint makes for a game that feels remarkably original.\n\nNegative points exist, but usually seem self-conscious and apologetic.  There's one action sequence in particular that could have easily infuriated adventure game purists.  But it actively makes itself easier in response to player failure.  As such, it ends up working just fine.\n\nThere are some occasional annoying liberties taken with science concepts, but they're usually forgiveable enough to just ignore.

This is a remake/update of an earlier game, which form the looks of it was a bit crap, but here no shortcuts were taken in making this a proper game.\n\nThe standard is way more professional than it has any right to be, the graphics are yummy, the voice acting and writing isn't as awful as you'd imagine. Even the few comedy bits inserted in notes or conversation were funny. Most of the puzzles aren't ridiculously hard, but still challenging.\n\nOne of the endings ends abruptly without satisfaction, and the plot goes a bit (ok, a lot) weird and maybe drags a bit, but overall this was an enjoyable experience of making futuristic screens go bloop bleep.","September 26, 2015","true","9.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Its a point and click style game, but the pointing and clicking never gets old! The story is also great. Manners wakes up to an empty ship, and you play the game trying to figure out what happened to the rest of the crew. There is also JULIA, the ship AI, and MOBOT, the loveable robot that you control while exploring the different planets.\n\nI liked that there was a button that would tell you all the clickable objects in the area. Very helpful. Every planet was gorgeous and looked different from the rest. I liked the voices of JULIA and MOBOT, but Manner's voice sounded too much like she was another AI rather than a human.\n\nHowever, there was a massive game altering bug I encountered. Well, before I mention it, I will say that the developers clearly had a specific order in mind of the planets you visit. Once you leave the first planet and can travel to others, you can travel to any one you want but really there is a "best" option. I noticed this in the beginning and tried to mimic this order based on the direction the plot was going.\n\nWell, I just happened to stumble on an achievement that talks about a hidden planet. Assuming that this was just an added secret to the game, I went and found it. I shortly realized that I accidentally skipped a nice chunk of the game, because all of a sudden the game was ending. If the developers had a sequence of planets that they based the game's story on, do the players a favor and block the player from accessing planets ahead in the sequence!\n\nI did end up going back and playing through the parts I missed, but it wasn't the same.\n\nThe game was good, but it would have been great had I played it in the right order.\n\nAlso, there are no jump scares.","October 30, 2015","true","10.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Some kind of tip/hint system would have been nice for those of us without eidetic memories ;-)\n\nI really enjoyed the sci-fi/space setting and the first half of the game where the story is probably moving too slow for some. The slow pace really helped me immerse myself in the mystery of what happened to the crew.\n\nThen the game tipped its hand and in the latter half of the game I was really mostly interested in finishing, which is probably why some of the later minigames annoyed me.\n\nStill, I was hooked on the story and lore of the game universe and the final twist was welcomed, even if seen before and -- in my opinion -- not really necessary to conclude the story.  I'd go into more details, but I don't want to spoil the game.\n\nGraphically, the still sets are absolutely beautiful; way above par from what I had expected from an indie game.  Most of the animations are stilted and amateurish, however, they are brief and sparse enough that they don't distract much from the overall impression.  The music and sound effects are meaningful and fits with the theme of the game; although the choice of ending credits music is a bit mind-boggling but I'm sure it has meaning for the developers.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, I encountered a few nuisance glitches, but no game breaking bugs.  The game did crash at the very end, but thankfully an automatic save game had me back right before the crash, and I was able to complete the game without problems.\n\nSo in short, a good (7/10) casual adventure game, with mostly worthwhile puzzle minigames.  The launch price tag of €20 will probably be a bit on the expensive side for some, considering the length (~10 hours if you take your time) of the game.","September 13, 2014","true","10.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The game suffers towards the end and the conclusion doesn't quite live up to the story that preceded it, mainly due to plotting issues that made the resolution of the story a bit more telegraphed than I think the author may have intended. The clues as to what happened are a bit too "hint hint, wink wink", and it doesn't take long to figure out what the game seems to treat as a major revelation at the end of the story.\n\nThat all said, the game provided a fun set of environments to explore, and most of the puzzles were engaging without being tiresome or overwrought. There were only a few times where I became frustrated trying to figure out a solution, but there are decent walkthroughs out there for those people that need a little extra guidance to work beyond those stumbling blocks.\n\nAt present pricing, I would recommend waiting for a sale or coupon to pick up the game.

What happend light years from our home and why was she only one kept alive is a mystery. Help her uncover the truth.\n\nLike in almost every other point and click game out there, gameplay is based mostly on clicking on almost static images, looking for clues and so on. There is some backward storytelling through a lot of dialogues, but the best part of the game is story itself and there is a constant feeling that drives you forward to reveal the next tiny piece of the greater picture. Slow paced story revealing is great but once you finish it, everything is revealed and replay value drops basicaly to zero. And if you belong to the group of people that don't like to read or listen too much then this game is not for you. As you go along be prepare for some riddles and some peculiar puzzles but don't worry, they are not Broken Sword level.\n\nGame lenght is fair enough.

The price on the other hand is somewhat high and I would suggest to buy this on action sales - but let's be fair - it is a indie game mady by two people and for what it's has to offer, it is a great game.\n\nTo wrap it up I would definitely recommend this but to p'n'c and sci-fi genre lovers only.\n8/10","February 21, 2015","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

J.U.L.I.A.: Among the Stars.... sort of delivers on this.\n\nThe potential in this game was pretty big right from the on set. Interesting bit of mystery, fairly cool looking world, and a ship you could get attached to.

And boom. Done the second night I played it... And that... right there... is my issue.\n\nOk the plot in the end is somewhat guessable, who are the good guys, bad guys and what not. You see some lovely scenery, there's some funny (if a bit stilted) dialoge (in their favor most of your interactions are with computers so there is that). But it's just not that hard a game to beat.

The interplay between the three characters is humorously representative of what dialogue between a human, computer AI and robot might be like and is downright amusing a lot of the time.\n\nFor me, the whole game is reminiscent of DOS point-and-click puzzle/adventure games, modernised and executed beautifully.

(I definitely searched for a few solutions though, mostly because I was impatient to see the story unfold!)\n\nEven though I could see the ending coming--or where it was headed--it unfolded in a way that was unexpected and genuinely surprising, which was an utter delight. To me that might be the highest praise of all. To be able to surprise and please, even after proving my suspicions correct? That's good storycrafting.\n\nSome of the puzzles are genuinely difficult, but for the most part they aren't usually too punishing, but there are several encounters/tasks that might be considered robust challenges, even for seasoned puzzle gamers.

I'm looking at you, laser beacon!) The permanent UI is overcomplicated and it is sometimes tedious to find the information you are looking for or the next task you are supposed to do.\n- Sometimes too many things happen at once (you are supposed to listen to the conversation AND read the analysis results at the same time - and when the conversation is over, both disappear automatically).\n- Parts of the story feel just shoveled together without much thought or effort - given the sci-fi setting, I was particularly put off by nosense talk about strange "energies" and unheard of chemical elements. Hey, writing good sci-fi is not easy. That's what the "sci" part is for...\n- The level of "handholding" is uneven: sometimes the game feels just pushing you through the steps (when you'd rather do something different) or instantly offer a vital clue to the puzzle you haven't had a chance to understand yet - and sometimes you are just left to jump from planet to planed because you don't realize where does the story continue.","February 16, 2015","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They are boring and they appear at the worst time, when I want to continue with the story I have to find out how I can use a piece of gum, a hook and whatver you fancy to do something which is just plain stupid and not interesting.\n\nNot so here.\nIf you find a tablet and want to access it and it is password protected, then you have to do something. Simple.\nIf an animal prohibits you from going through a room, you have to do something. Simple :)\n\nThe puzzles in this game are fun and you normally don't need Google or a walkthrough, because you can do it yourself.\nIn the whole game is only one puzzle where you have limited time, but even if you fail, the repeating is NOT done in a way to make the game as long as possible, you just start the puzzle again. So it still is fun, even if you fail some times.\n\nThe voices and the music and the graphics are all good.

Of course, if you continue to read, you get some spoilers, sorry.\n\nYou explore the planets of a solar system and find out what happened to the others of your crew. To be able to do this you have to read a lot and think sometimes a bit. You do NOT have to check all spots again and again all the time.\nIF you have to go to a spot you already where, then it is so clear to you because of the story that you don't even think about "where do I have to go".\n\nThis game is great!

I had this on my wishlist for a few months and grabbed it during the summer Sale. I am very happily surprised with how intriguing the game is. The 'puzzles' differ enough to where you are not consistently completing the same exact type of inputs and 'games' to find a solution. The dialogue is rather decent if you ignore the attempts at jokes from the human and two robots in the game. Otherwise, environments are plenty and pretty, characters are established, plot does not seem like generic tripe--STEALTH EDIT: The game is absolutely spectacular and I especially enjoyed the last quarter of the game's plot--and as someone who rarely plays adventure games, I am fully pleased with my purchase.\n\nI can only hope this developer makes another game with similar aspects and I hope that anybody else who reads this and purchases the game enjoys it as much as I currently am.","June 17, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We play as Rachel, a scientist waking up as the only person alive on a spaceship after many years spent in cryosleep. To discover what happend to the expeditions crew, she is helped by Julia, an amnesic human-shaped AI computer, and Mobot, an exploration AI robot. The different planets of an unknown solar system can be explored. I quite loved the space exploration atmosphere. A reference to 2001: a space odyssee is made especially on one of the planet. One can freely explore, find and collect objects and alien samples, analyze them, hack passwords, assemble components parts... Diverse puzzles are encountered on the way. The least to say is that puzzles difficulty goes from extremely easy to easy, which was frustrating sometimes...\nI quite liked the beautiful graphics and the imagination brought in the game to describe alien life forms. The game tries to make you feel like a scientist, but still with a simple approach that maybe make this game more befitting to children.\nThere is one huge mistake in the game one cannot miss. The developpers might have confounded Nitrogen with Hydrogen or another explosive gas, if this could be corrected.\n\nSo, anyway, I might write a better review later, but if you enjoy beautiful visuals, freely exploring places, collecting objects, reading, an AI good sens of humor (Mobot) and dont mind too easy but very diverse puzzles, then you wont be disappointed by this game.","July 20, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First is the overall sense of being alone in space with nothing but robot A.I. for companionship.  The visuals, voice acting, ambient music, screen interfaces and story all set this up rather nicely.  The other thing I enjoyed was the way the game used familiar types of puzzles like substitution ciphers and pipe connections in challenging ways that felt intrinsic to the theme.  The focus is on following clues within the story and puzzle-solving.  No bloated inventory with a bunch of items to combine.\n\nThe biggest gripe I had playing the game was the TINY (caps used for irony) text throughout the game.  There is a lot to read, and textual clues play a significant role, so why is it all so ridiculously small?  There were also a few places where I had trouble with hotspots, particularly at a point underwater when you have a limited field of vision, and there were levers to open doors that were very easy to miss, since all other similar doors in the game opened with ID cards or a keypad.\n\nI never pay full price for a point/click, and this is no exception.

It is because I had very mixed feeling. Expectations were definetely high, this game seemed to have a lot potential. It indeed does, but in the end I find it rather mediocre. There are two reasons:\nPuzzles are unfortunately disappointing. Often poorly explained, utterly hard when you don't know what to do. But as soon as you get to know them, they pse no challenge.\nThere are severeal stages in this game which are frustrating. Example - during one planet landing, you've got to paint a rectangle on screen, matching your clues. You may get superbly lucky and find it quickly (unprobable) or you will spend dozens of minutes just trying find several right pixels. Extremely unrewarding, I wanted to uninstall game because of this. And there are more such an 'obstacles'Except of these nuissances, this game is a typical 'Myst-game'. Static screens, gathering of stuff, doing small puzzles. Plot is interesting, but for me moderately engaging. On the contrary, I liked space environment very much, voice-acting and very diversified locations. In the end I would rate it somewhere between 6-7 out of 10.

However, I did have a hunch one of the mayor points relatively early in the game, so there are few real surprises. Nevertheless, one point that is vital for the story to unfold never became clear to me, even after completing the game.\n\nAlthough the game gives you some control over what you do next, all the story parts are strictly linear. In more than one point in the game, you are not allowed to interact with some object (one which you can see is there and interactable), because the story is not ready for it.\n\nThis is a point-and-click adventure game, but it does not provide the usual combine anything in your inventory with every object in the scene brute-forcing. In fact, there is no inventory and objects that can be carried can only be applied where they make sense.\n\nThe game contains several puzzles, but I considered all of them quite easy. A piece of paper can be useful for some of the puzzles.\n\nThe technical quality of the game is good, at least for the mac version. The only point of complaint is that I could not switch back to the desktop while in-game.\n\nIn total, I did like the game and I do recommend it. However, I also recommend to wait for a sale, since 20 € is quite a lot for about 10 hours of game time.","January 21, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Have made it through a good bit and can say its better than most adventure games I played that are similar. I like the AI that helps you and Mobot is cool. Going from planet to planet is nice but overall a little generic. Not because of the graphics but it just feels like a cheap addon. Other things I like are the plot elements where is mixes well troden sci-fi scripts like aliens or 2001 a space odyssey. But its efective as you try to find out what happened to your crew mates while you were asleep on the probe. The graphics are modern and crisp at 1920x1080 res. Julia is not the best looking game I've seen in the adventure realm though. Some effects are generic looking. Not alot of background animations either until you get to the third planet in the solor system tha tis heavily forested. Sounds and voice acting are advergae but I htough the probe AI and Mobot to be sub-par compared to other similar games. I do highly recommend Julia if you are into adventure games.","September 27, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I usually don't buy new releases on Steam, because sooner or later they tend to go on sale. I also don't like being a 'first wave' gamer - forking out 60$ only to find out the game totally sucks ♥♥♥ *coughDestinycough*. I've been burned too many times before. But, I decided to give JULIA the benefit of the doubt due to its early review metascore.\n\nYou play the role of Rachel, a scientist who left Earth for a 500-year long cryo-sleep to explore a solar system. Rachel wakes up alone on the ship, except for JULIA, the ship's AI. Rachel uses Mobot, a mobile exploration robot to explore the planets in the solar system to unravel the mystery of what happened to the rest of the crew.\n\nI think I got my money's worth. The game offers a good mix of space exploration, mystery, crime solving, puzzles and storyline. Although the storyline is a touch predictable, I still had fun with it. Some of the puzzles were a bit of a struggle to figure out simply because the interface or instructions weren't clear. One puzzle type you do repeatedly to build schematics you find to improve your Mobot unit - those puzzles were a pain.\n\nAside from a few of the puzzles being tedious, the overall UI takes some getting used to. You are given two launch resolution options. Choose carefully - once you select and start a game, you can't play that saved game in the other resolution. I think this was done to make the game playable on tablets, and I can see this as being a good tablet game.\n\nMy only other complaint is Rachel, Rachel is a bit of a whiney prat who doesn't sound like a scientist most of the time. There were several pieces of dialogue that had me going 'really?'... and some of the storyline arcs were a bit stereotyped.\n\nThe planetary exploration, though, was fun. I do feel like they could have taken it much further and done way more with it. I logged a total of 12 hours playing the game, start to finish, and I think they left room for a possible sequel, In the end, you are given a choice. Your choice determines how the game ends. Don't worry, you can go back and try the other choice, too. Overall, I had fun with it.","October 4, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are a couple of simple things like that which once you figure out you are good to go.  Perhaps the only real negative I have is the massive amounts of reading you need to do.

However, Racheal is the last surviving member of an expedition. This is the story of discovery and mystery.\n\nA point and click puzzle infused exploration game. The controls are simple and easy to understand with a well written tutorial set up at each new element that comes into play.\nThere are few varieties puzzles that grow in difficulty yet are not impossible to solve. Putting items to objects are very obvious. Navigation is not a maze, limited to a few small zones. There are a lot of things to look at, and everything not important to the game is a once only clickable affair. Almost the entire game features a hotspot indicator so there is rare pixel hunting involved.\nOverall the game is really linear. It begins with a very clear direction to follow, however later on you will need to explore other parts (planets) to obtain information or items to make progress on one location.\nAll dialogues and descriptions are completely voiced. The only think not voiced are messages, emails and logs left behind for you to find (most times crack). Both AI's that assist Rachel tend to be a bit too human-like and make some rather annoying chatter at times, like telling someone to shut up, or making it obvious they aren't on the same level of understanding of themes and situations.\n\nThe story misdirects somewhat well until near the end. There is always a suspicion that what seems to be a cause, actually isn't the whole truth. You will learn about this alien solar system, learn about the expedition and after discovering the full story, make a final decision that ends the game in one of two ways.\nIt is very well paced, and nicely intertwined as a whole.\n","July 24, 2015","true","10.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Rather than visit planets yourself you send a robot to do your dirty work, in an effort to uncover the events that led to the deaths of your crew.\n\nPros:\n-Great sci-fi story and puzzle mechanics.\n\n-The FMV cutscenes are almost movie quality, they are absolutely gorgeous. As are most of the environments.\n\n-If you're not good at combing scenes for clues, you can bring up clues as to which bits of the environment are interactive.\n\n-The game has reasonable amounts of hand-holding, not too much or too little, for example characters suggest when you might be wasting your time on something.\n\n- I came across no bugs. No crash-to-desktops.\n\nCons:\n- Some elements of the UI are a little small at higher resolutions, so you have to squint occasionally.\n\n- Main character Rachel has quite a wooden vocal performance.\n\n- Suffers a little from service to crowdfunders who got to put a little blurb in the game which sticks out like a sore thumb in the context of the game.\n\nFeel free to read my full review here:\nnoisybark.squarespace.com/orix/2015/8/29/julia-among-the-stars","August 31, 2015","true","13.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The successor is “JULIA Among the Starts” and can only be bought through Steam due to the European VAT Laws.\n\nThe second version basically follows the first version but deviates in some of the puzzles, adds new puzzles, enhances the graphics and interface, and adds new puzzles, scenes and stuff to explore. In the first version I only got to the Ambrosia Quest where I got stuck, maybe a bug. On the second version I was able to complete the game with the help of a walk- through found on Gameboomers.\n\n\nThe second game is very intriguing but is basically a science mystery requiring good sleuthing skills. My critique is it lacks hints and clue as well as direction and some of the science techie puzzling found in science games like the Star Trek games. I also like some shot-em-up action.\n\nBut the game is not bad and I hope CBE can expand on it and come up with a more intelligent game.

I never played the original , so I had no expectations.\n\nPros:\nGreat story and believable characters along with (mostly) good game mechanics and nice puzzles.  A break from the Diablo 3 hack & slash grind I've been up to  lately.  Relaxed pacing and a compelling story had me glued to my chair well  into the wee hours of the morning.\n\nCons:\n-Some of the puzzles were difficult not due to complexity, but instead due to the instructions not being very clear as to what you are doing rules/mechanics-wise.  (First contact language puzzle, I'm looking at you.)\n\n-Also the circuit board puzzles seem to have one "magic" solution that is expected, but twice I made solutions that should have been viable but weren't; and they don't tell you why, they just aren't.  (Circuit board puzzle for underwater unlock, for example)  Most of the circuit boards have to be re-arranged slightly from the expected diagram because they don't give you enough pieces on purpose.  This is fine, but they don't come out and tell you its ok to do that and they don't explain the logic behind why the puzzle has to be solved that particular way.  This is  a terrible analogy, but if I said to make an equation that equals 4, you might say 2+2 = 4.  Then I would say, no you are wrong.  1+3 = 4.  They are both 4, so if I didn't explain, you would get frustrated.  Fortunately this doesn't happen very often.  But it did irk me here & there.\n\nOverall, I give this game a A-.  I would buy a sequel if there was one.  $20ish is good for 12~15 hours of fun and better value than the same amount of time in movie tickets.","September 16, 2014","true","15.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CryonicSuspension/recommended/257690/","CryonicSuspension","CryonicSuspension","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CryonicSuspension/","208 products in account","I have mixed feelings about this game:\n\nThe Pros:\n\n- Gorgeous aesthetics ( graphics and music ).\n\n- Superb voice acting by Rachel. Very good voice acting by J.U.L.I.A. and Mobot.\n\n- I did enjoy the initial sleuthing; trying to figure out what happened to the crew. I enjoyed hacking into datapads, to read diary entries. I really liked the jigsaw puzzle ( scrambled memories ) and cypher puzzle at the end.\n\n- I liked the fact that you could play it hidden-object style or click on a magnifier, which would show you all the hotspots ( I dislike hidden object games ).\n\n- I did find the alien sloth's plight emotionally moving. I was saddened and depressed a few times.\n\nThe Cons:\n\n- Poor pacing of the story. You figure out the end of the game after the first mission ( maybe an hour into the game ). Then there's a reveal at the end of the game, which isn't a reveal at all, since I have seen this plotline done before, in books and a few famous sci fi movies. I was waiting the entire length of the game, for an explanation as to the crew's demise? ( similar to watching a movie, where 10 minutes in, the premise is uncovered, yet you have to wait 1 hour and 50 minutes for an explanation as to why?)\n\n- I found the "translate the alien language"  puzzle and most puzzles thereafter simplistic and tedious. The help file for the alien translation was incomprehensible to me, so I had to use Steam community hub / walkthroughs for an explanation as to what I was expected to do ). I put it down to a Czech-English translation problem.  From that point on, I was never entirely sure if the puzzle was being explained poorly, if I needed a precursor item for the puzzle ( like in the stone blocks manipulation puzzle ) or if I was just bad at the puzzle ( I hardly play point and click adventures ).\n\n- The puzzles were fairly basic. I disliked having to regurgitate the story back into the form of a puzzle. At the end, there is a full on cypher decryption ( the puzzle unevenness was mind boggling - my eyes popped out of my head ).\n\n- Taking scientific samples becomes tedious because nothing interesting happens.\n\n- J.U.L.I.A. becomes antogonistic and annoying, just for the sake of being antagonistic and annoying.\n\n- I don't think that the science crew acted like actual scientists, so I had a hard time believing the diary entries towards the end of the game. The strange behaviours, of a space-faring expedition, just seemed implausible.\n\n- The endings... one of them was OK, the other was just illlogical, implausible and poorly thought out.\n\n\nSmall tips for the final cypher, based on the frequency analysis of letters:\n\nhttp://www.richkni.co.uk/php/crypta/freq.php\n\nWalkthrough for the entire game ( pay attention to the purple arrows in The Story of Ith ):\n\nhttp://www.gameboomers.com/wtcheats/pcJj/J.U.L.I.A.ats/J.U.L.I.A.AmongtheStars.htm","June 16, 2015","true","14.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The art design in the game is quite well done and very atmospheric, but the voice acting just murders that atmosphere.\n\nI neither give this game a thumbs up nor thumbs down, but since Steam forces me to choose, I have to choose thumb down.

A lot of the interface has *no* explanation (a few windows near the beginning do pop up little help-screens, but this stops happening shortly ... and this game is constantly throwing new interfaces at you); in many of the puzzles, I *never* figured out how you were *supposed* to interact with the interface, and simply persisted through spam-clicking and trial-and-error. (The ‘language translation’ puzzle, anyone? Egads.)\n\n2. The parts that *are* explained, are difficult to interact with (why on earth isn't there a *hotkey* for ‘highlight interactable elements?’ I really have to mouse up to the top corner, every single frame, every single location?

However, it's not the reason why I'm writing this review.\n\nThe OS X version in particular is buggy as hell. It doesn't resize properly to the screen resolution, leaving ugly black stripes on top and bottom. The mouse clicks from tapping on touchpad don't register half the time, so you have to actually press the touchpad — something I haven't done since I got my last macbook and open up mouse properties on it to enable tap-to-click. But because the game itself is good, it's quite tolerable.\n\nWhat's really terrible is that further in the game you enounter a puzzle which requires you to perform a drag action. But not an ordinary drag action, but a right-button drag. And may I inform you, that on a MacBook without external mouse this action is simply impossible. There are people who buy mouses because they find them more comfortable than a touchpad; I don't. And therefore, I'm stuck in the game without any way to complete it.\n\nSo, unless you want to invest several hours of your time into a game just to encounter a big "♥♥♥♥ YOU" at the end, don't buy this game for OS X. And, judging by the stellar quality of QA department's work, I wouldn't recommend buying it for Windows either, just in case.","November 24, 2014","false","4.1"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matejcik/recommended/257690/","matejcik","matejcik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matejcik/","235 products in account","Are the authors 15 years old?\n\nBecause if they are, JULIA is a solid accomplishment: a fully fleshed-out game with an interesting story, multiple different gameplay modes, 3D-modeled graphics with some pretty awesome sceneries, full voice dubbing and (apparently procedural?) music.\n\nAnd if not, well. This would have been an awesome game with mindblowing graphics and solid interfaces... in 2003. Judged by today's standards, it's not worth the $20 asking price. But let's take it from the basics.\n\nGraphics and sound\nFirst things first: even though the game looks slick in the trailer, it turns out that in full HD, everything is sort of plasticky. Very much like back in 2003 when ray-tracing was considered state of the art and every 3D model had a shiny plastic feel to it. So, yes. That's pretty much how the game looks like in the flesh, in glorious full HD. It would look pretty much the same in 800x600.\n\nObviously, everything is pre-rendered. Scenes are static, and the warp and landing cutscenes start to annoy you after your third landing.\n\nSound and music is adequate; not spectacular, not horrible. Voice acting is bland but passable.\n\nInterface\nThe UI is my main gripe with the game. Nothing reacts to scroll wheels. You have to wait for an animation to finish before clicking again. Many clicks are superfluous. Basically, the UI is a pain and for all its cyber-like modernity, all it does is slow you down.\n\nEvery puzzle has its own interface, obviously, but most of those are unintuitive and you have to read the help screen before you can accomplish anything useful.\n\nThe HUD of the main point-and-click mode is a little confusing, but small enough that it doesn't matter.\n\nThe Mind-O-Matic, however, deserves a special mention. Whenever the game figures that you've got enough information to make sense of some event, it gives you all the clues in the form of little cards, some sort of outline of a diagram, and allows you to "fill in the blanks" and complete the story. Except all the blanks are in "subject-verb-object" form. And the verbs are often very generic. And subjects and objects repeat. And the game helpfully throws in a bunch of clues that don't actually fit in the schematic and you're supposed to throw them out again. And, obviously, there is no indication whatsoever that you got it right. Fortunately the authors were wise enough to make this optional; you're better off with a pen and a piece of paper.\n\nSpeaking of paper, let's mention that thing where the game helpfully collects passwords and entry codes and important facts in one place for you, but you can't display them while a password input or keypad or a puzzle is open. Wellp.\n\nThe game does earn points for the feature that highlights all active objects, and removes them from view if you can't make more actions with that object.\n\nStory and characters\nLet me just say that i've seen deeper stories in procedural roguelikes.\n\n...eh, it's not that the story is bad or anything, it's just ... not good. The plot does have some potential, it could be interesting if someone skilled developed it further, but that's not the case here. Writing is noticeably dull, dialogues are basically an exposition stream -- maybe because the characters don't have any traits to speak of, so the lines they say aren't "theirs", they are just something the authors decided to tell players.\n\nSpeaking of characters, i don't understand why MOBOT is one of them. It doesn't have a personality, its only role is to comment on things it finds, and these aren't particularly insightful comments either. Not that the other two protagonists (Rachel and J.U.L.I.A) have personalities to speak of, but they at least play some roles. MOBOT is a filler.\n\nThere are more interesting characters to be found among the dead crewmembers, but they're all dead and all we know about them are short diary entries.\n\nAtmosphere\nThere isn't one.\n\nGameplay\nconsists mainly of puzzle minigames. Of which, 70 % are totally inane, thrown in without meaningful connection to the game, just as something to occupy the player for a brief time. Some of the remaining 30 % are interesting, but in most of them you don't even know what you're supposed to do, in the "why exactly am i solving this puzzle and how does the result look like" sense. In many cases, it's impossible to solve the minigame without reading the integrated help, to find out what your goal state looks like.\n\nThe game is definitely not mentally challenging. The puzzle minigames are simple playthings. I don't recall a single instance where you'd have to actually figure out something from clues, using only your head (as opposed to trial and error). The main game consists of clicking on everything, repeatedly where applicable.\n\nSteam reports that it took me about 5 hours to finish the game, which is on par with ad-supported hidden-object drivel on mobile. It's awesome that there's six or seven planets with completely different scenery, but each only has about five screens. The game is pretty broad, but extremely shallow.\n\nConclusion\nGood job guys! When you graduate high school, do apply to a game design major on some good college.","March 23, 2015","false","5.6"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","5","17","0","0"

Point-and-click games have interested me a while; with the low-pace focus on deep exploration and story and lack of cheap action for instant and shallow gratification most games use. But at the same time I've been offput by some experiences demanding rediculous puzzles (like go there, get that pipe, go to a place you haven't been for 5 hours and somehow know to talk to that guy, then solve an impossible puzzle and then get some story).\n\nWhile I used a guide when stuck on a few puzzles, generally it was pretty clear what to do and it was mostly short, fun puzzles that didn't slow down the narrative too much.\n\nThe story itself, was mostly well written and had some minor surprises here and there, but most of all it was just captivating, without being fantastic. The single thing I miss most in video games in general is good story-telling, and even super-classics like FFVII or Chrono Trigger didn't really leave a mark on me. Games that are praised for its story-telling can seldom even get close to competing for truly great works of cinema or literature. I really enjoy my share of Mass Effect or Deus Ex: HR but the narrative and story in those has serious problems and I think many games gets exaggerated praise for story just because the competition is so lacking.\n\nWhile J.U.L.I.A. certainly is no masterpiece, it was still an engrossing experience exploring the world and learning more about the expedition and its crew, the ecosystem of the solar system, and the overall story of the game. The visuals helped create a sense of a fascinating world, while mystery was always part of the experience. The writing was'nt always great, a problem of most games, but I would still say the story and narrative is better than most games out there, even those who pride themselves on storytelling. This game is rather shallow compared to works in other art-forms though. The fact that the protagonist is female doesn't really matter to the game in meaningful ways and I think that's fine, but I gotta say it's refreshing to not always play a Nathan Drake-like white guy hero. Rachel is not extremely interesting, but IMO; her situation is. She is very alone deep in the galaxy, but has company of two (to each other) rather different AI:s/robots.\n\nIf you do buy the game, I suggest playing it in a couple of days like I did, in solitude and maybe with headphones for immersion. I think this is such a game that you lose interest in if you play for short amounts of time and far between. Took me 10 hours in maybe 3 or 4 sessions, and the length of the game seemed perfect to me. Not to short, but certainly not too long. The full price tag seems reasonable, but don't think twice about getting this on a sale!\n\nIll give it 8/10 but would probably give it 7/10 if storytelling in the gaming industry was generally not utterly terrible. This unlikely game has opened my eyes to adventure/point-and-click games and I'm thankful for it.","February 24, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There also aren't any timed puzzles or dying from trying different things (sans one exception).\n\nGraphics look neat and aren't very taxing as they are mainly static screens with effects, which means you can make do with a fairly lightweight computer.\n\nCons :\n\nThere's no easy or central way to review all the information you get during the game, especially discussions, which makes the plot somewhat hard to keep track of at times since you have to remember everything by yourself unless you want to move around to re-read everything.\n\nThe setting starts to fizzle towards the end as the final portions themselves are barely explained and the game mostly concerns itself in fully revealing information you can already infer during the rest of the game, after which you're very swiftly whisked to the end. Thus the last part feels rather disconnected from the rest.\n\nFew puzzles take a good deal of time simply because they are based on trial-and-error and have to be reset every time you fail.\n","June 24, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is NOT one of those cases. Bought it in the summer sale, it jumped out at me for containing several of my favourite elements: Female protagonist. Space. Aliens. Point and click. Puzzles.\n\nThe story was well-thought out and remarkably paced considering that the exploration isn't linear. Because of the variation in the puzzles, the game doesn't get drawn out or dull, and the story itself is quite nice. Though, as a biologist, I find Rachel's lack of adherence to scientific method... troubling. Luckily the AI is there to tell her to calm the heck down.\n\nOne of my favourite aspects is the voice-acting - STELLAR performances all around. Phenomenal. The soundtrack is also quite nice, sometimes remniscent of Firefly.\n\nNow, is the title replayable? Maybe not completely,  the major decision at the end to stay or to return to Earth has a handy autosave point that remains in your saved game banks, so you can easily see the other outcome  but the available acheivements may make you want to replay the game, such as  if you do not use the analyzer onboard the Mobot and instead go to the first planet EVERY TIME, you get the Luddite acheivement, not half bad .\n\nMy only complaint is that the quest log is not nearly as user friendly as it could be.","June 15, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Point-and-click games have interested me a while; with the low-pace focus on deep exploration and story and lack of cheap action for instant and shallow gratification most games use. But at the same time I've been offput by some experiences demanding rediculous puzzles (like go there, get that pipe, go to a place you haven't been for 5 hours and somehow know to talk to that guy, then solve an impossible puzzle and then get some story).\n\nWhile I used a guide when stuck on a few puzzles, generally it was pretty clear what to do and it was mostly short, fun puzzles that didn't slow down the narrative too much.\n\nThe story itself, was mostly well written and had some minor surprises here and there, but most of all it was just captivating, without being fantastic. The single thing I miss most in video games in general is good story-telling, and even super-classics like FFVII or Chrono Trigger didn't really leave a mark on me. Games that are praised for its story-telling can seldom even get close to competing for truly great works of cinema or literature. I really enjoy my share of Mass Effect or Deus Ex: HR but the narrative and story in those has serious problems and I think many games gets exaggerated praise for story just because the competition is so lacking.\n\nWhile J.U.L.I.A. certainly is no masterpiece, it was still an engrossing experience exploring the world and learning more about the expedition and its crew, the ecosystem of the solar system, and the overall story of the game. The visuals helped create a sense of a fascinating world, while mystery was always part of the experience. The writing was'nt always great, a problem of most games, but I would still say the story and narrative is better than most games out there, even those who pride themselves on storytelling. This game is rather shallow compared to works in other art-forms though. The fact that the protagonist is female doesn't really matter to the game in meaningful ways and I think that's fine, but I gotta say it's refreshing to not always play a Nathan Drake-like white guy hero. Rachel is not extremely interesting, but IMO; her situation is. She is very alone deep in the galaxy, but has company of two (to each other) rather different AI:s/robots.\n\nIf you do buy the game, I suggest playing it in a couple of days like I did, in solitude and maybe with headphones for immersion. I think this is such a game that you lose interest in if you play for short amounts of time and far between. Took me 10 hours in maybe 3 or 4 sessions, and the length of the game seemed perfect to me. Not to short, but certainly not too long. The full price tag seems reasonable, but don't think twice about getting this on a sale!\n\nIll give it 8/10 but would probably give it 7/10 if storytelling in the gaming industry was generally not utterly terrible.

It's worth a play, but it's FAR from perfect.\n\nThe story line is actually interesting and I enjoyed it and trying to figure out what happened.  It's not the best story I've seen in video games by a long shot but it's still effectively intruiging.\n\nThe game play is... iffy.  It's really a combination of puzzles and exploration.  The puzzles aren't too difficult except for some are just really annoying.  I admit using a walk through for one part where you were supposed to look through a map and find an area on the map that resembled a crudely drawn map.  I tried it on my own for a while and then just gave up.  Another puzzle I looked up because I had no idea how it was supposed to work, but then found out I wasn't supposed to even attempt that puzzle yet; it was supposed to be done later.  All in all though some were fairly fun to figure out.  Some were just more annoying than fun.\n\nThere was also a problem with the auto saving.  The game crashed on me once and I unfortunately found out I had to redo an entire section.  My advice: Save relatively often.\n\nThis game won't be for everyone though.  Play it if you like sci-fi stories and if you enjoy puzzles.","September 19, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Upon your salvaging of the ship, you learn of the terrible fate that some of your crew met on a planet in the solar system you are orbiting.  Through travel to other planets and moons, upgrading the mobile robot that you send to these worlds, and analyzing data/evidence, you are to use reasoning to draw conclusions and understand the order of events as they happened and to work with a discovered sentient race.\n\n\nI have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  It's not very often that I'm ensnared to the point of trying to get a game finished as quickly as possible so that I can see a story progress.  The story is gratifying and progresses quite nicely.\nFor the most part, this game is a 'Point-and-click' discovery/puzzle' type.  You are on various worlds that aren't entirely habitable by the human animal, so the probe Mobot is sent in your stead.  There is plenty of material present in each of the worlds and the help screens for the puzzles are informative and do not lend to giving away the answer.\n\nThat being said, if you want to finish the game for the sake of finishing it, I am sure there are guides that enable you to breeze through the puzzles.  However, I found the puzzles refreshing and interesting.  The situational placement of them throughout the game is done well and parallels real life puzzles that you may face if you were that character.\n\nThe visuals are wonderful with segments of cutscenes throughout.  The different worlds are stunning and I appluad those designers.\n\nI find that this game is highly underrated and flies under the radar more than it should.  Absolutely stunning.  I'll be playing through again so as to find other things I may have missed.","June 17, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm actually surprised myself how much I enjoyed the game. Many point and clicks I have played the past few years have been a little flat or seem to drag on. J.U.L.I.A. however, did not.\n\nThe Good:\nThe game has a large variety of puzzles so it's not overly repetative and on top of that, they aren't too easy either. In order to solve everything you're going to have to actually learn the game itself. ----The puzzles often times can only be solved if you've payed attention or following the story.\nThe game has a night atmosphere and very pleasing on the eyes as well as ambient which is always a plus to me.\nThere's a lot of depth to the story in superficial details and even some humorous references as well.\n\nThe Bad:\nA few times the voice acting seemed a bit flat or static, however as two of the protagonists are robots it didn't really bother me and sometimes almost seemed to do more good than harm with the characters.\n\nThe Ugly (Indifferent):\nThere were a few parts I predicted, but overall you couldn't guess what was going to come next and each new event peaked my interest quite a bit. Even the parts I could guess, the journey to that point was quite interesting.\nSome animations or parts seemed to take a little longer than necessary, but this is really a minor detail as it doesn't take away from the gameplay or story.\n\n\nOverall: The game to me is quite comparable to some of the Myst series. If you enjoy Myst or a good puzzle point & click with some interesting sci-fi/unique worlds  I'd say try picking up this game.  $20 might be a bit much for some people, but I don't think it's that bad, and if you can get it on sale and enjoy point and click puzzles (That aren't too easy or dragging) I'd get it.","June 18, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, it's the story I became addicted to as I played.  I kept wondering what was really going on, how all the pieces of the overall story fit together.  Each planet does present its own story, but they combine to become something much bigger that the parts.\n\nI apologize if this seems vague, but I am trying to avoid any spoilers.\n\nThe game does contain both simple and complex puzzles.  But it also contains hidden hints for solving some of the more complex puzzles.  It's the hints that make the game go from frustratingly hard to merely challenging.  Of the two times I got stuck and needed to look at a walkthrough, one time I missed a hint that would have helped me immensely.\n\nThe graphics for the game are quite beautiful - not something I particularly notice about games.

There also aren't any timed puzzles or dying from trying different things (sans one exception).\n\nGraphics look neat and aren't very taxing as they are mainly static screens with effects, which means you can make do with a fairly lightweight computer.\n\nCons :\n\nThere's no easy or central way to review all the information you get during the game, especially discussions, which makes the plot somewhat hard to keep track of at times since you have to remember everything by yourself unless you want to move around to re-read everything.\n\nThe setting starts to fizzle towards the end as the final portions themselves are barely explained and the game mostly concerns itself in fully revealing information you can already infer during the rest of the game, after which you're very swiftly whisked to the end. Thus the last part feels rather disconnected from the rest.\n\nFew puzzles take a good deal of time simply because they are based on trial-and-error and have to be reset every time you fail.\n","June 24, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fantastic Story, tricky puzzles and a great dialog between characters make it a solid game for any collection.\n\nThe story immediately grabs you from the start and makes you work to piece together every detail surrounding the events that left you, Rachel Manners, as the only living person on your ship. Aided only by the ships AI, Julia, and an exploration robot Mo-bot, your goal is to find out why your expedition team has lost contact. Sinister, sad and yet strangely compelling,   the plot moves along well with a good continuity. A little philosophical, but never overtly so, it's a good intellectual story, that you piece together with what you find along the way.\n\nThe voice acting is actually quite good. The sarcastic Rachel, paired up with Mobot (who has zero emotional capabilites) makes for some amusing and lighthearted dialog that oddly enough, eases the tension in a situation that would otherwise feel stifling. My only complaint is with Julia's speech. She seems a little erratic at times, switching between emotional and mechanical. It can be a bit jarring. Though, for all intents, being an AI may contribute to her awkwardness.\n\nThe ambient noise is your standard sci-fi fare, but the music is wonderful. In fact, the soundtrack is worth picking up for sure. Not overpowering yet not blending in, it seems to hit that nice balance where you hear it play and enjoy it, but it doesn't distract from the gameplay.\n\nBeing a point and click type of game means a lot of it is searching for objects to examine and completing puzzles. Luckily,  the UI is set up with a scanner to highlight areas of interest, saving you the frusteration of 'pixel-hunting'. (running your cursor all over the screen to look for the very small area that you can interact with.) The puzzles are varied and spread out enough that you're not being hit over the head with them every minute or two, but when you do get one, some of them can leave you scratching your head for several minutes.\n\nMy only complaint here would be that a lot of the puzzle information isn't really specific enough to explain how the puzzle works, leading to a bit more frusteration than is really necessary. A bit clearer instructions on several puzzles would really help out.\n\nOver all though, this game is definately worth a look for anyone into Sci-fi, puzzle or point and click adventures. Rating it a 7.5/10, possibly an 8 if the puzzles were explained a little better. A fantastic effort by a team of only 2 people.
