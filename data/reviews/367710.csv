Ui, the ui in this game is very archiac and hard to understand at first. In particular manipulating objects. So far I haven't figured out how to rotate or move objects if I even can, all I seem to be able to do is clone and delete objects. It took me a while to figure out how rooms were formed as floors were only an option with no walls like the sims and the first three floor options don't actually make rooms. This also factored into the traps a bit as it seemed like the effective range of traps was only revealed to me after I placed them on the map not previewed before, but I could just be being unattentive.\n\n2. The tutorial for me seems to be bugged as I can't control the ghost at all during it forcing me to skip it which if that hadn't happened I think my first pointwouldn't be as big a deal as it was to me.\n\n3.The isometric view means you can't see everything in your rooms effectively, and also you can't place objects right up against the wall closes to you as the spot seems to be obscured, both visually and mechanically you can't interact with it once a wall covers it.\nI don't mind the isometric view I just wish I could place items right up to the closest wall so I could have my rooms be symmetrical in some spots.\n\nFinally the resolution options in this game are limited and as I use a normal tv not a Computer monitor with my desktop I couldn't fix the game to work in fullscreen mode making me have to play it in a stretched window mode. It's only a minor complaint but something I felt like noting.\n\nNow with those points out of the way here are the things I liked about the game and why I think it's ultimately still worth playing if it interests you.\n\nI like the aesthetic of the game, especially the ghost himself he's got a cute charm to me the way he giggles and displays different facial expressions throughout gameplay.\nThere's a surprising variety in the way different humans interact with the house and they're introduced gradually which means you don't get too overwhelemed by them.\n\nThe game progresses in sort of mini levels where you have to achieve a size and trap number milestone, to unlock the next set of objects to use in customising as well as more humans with more complex effects on the game.\nYour ghost also gains a new scaring ability with each stage progressed into and you can use these at the cost of your resource points to instantly scare any humans in an area of effect around you.\n\nThe more scares you pull off in frequent succession the more awareness of your hauntings go's up. With higher awareness more people come to the house both normal people you can scare for points and others like Excorcists Journalists, skeptic bloggers and more that can drain your resources or raise your awareness even more.\nSo you have to manage having enough awareness to make your haunted house popular, but not too notorious or else the Police investigate the house draining your resources rapidly and leading to an almost guarenteed game over.\n\nThe game is surprisingly challenging, if you aren't paying attention you may spend too many resources and find yourself with not enough to keep going as your health and currency are both pulling from the same source. And if you get too carried away with scaring people you might cause one to die of fright sending your awareness meter so high your home will be swarming with cops ending your game very swiftly.\n\nI wasn't expecting this game to be one that required my full attention but it was scanning the map constantly to find certain npcs  Iwanted to scare away before they got to my house or to spook a coward for bonus points kept me constantly looking around the map not just idling on my house and overall I felt it was pretty engaging so far. Gonna play more into it and see how much it draws me in.\n\nSorry for the rambling but I really wanted to get my full thoughts out on this game. It's rough around the edges, especially with Ui and Resolution options, but it's a great foundation and first attempt in my opinion. A sequel maybe that expanded on the tech side of things while addind more content would be fantastic in my eyes.\nAs for this one it's a pretty nice game, I enjoy it.\n\nDamn I wrote a lot about this game...\n\n*edit* I forgot thist part, If this game is in a genre that's not already your cup of tea, I do not reccomend it except that it is exceptionally cheap. It's a game at the price of a tin of pringles. I wanted to point out that I only recommend this game if you are already interested by its core mechanics. Otherwise the poor Ui and lack of direction may only be frustrating to you.","August 21, 2015","true","2.0"," 58 of 74 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","58","74","0","0"

The art style may not work for some, but I liked the unique look, and the idea of scaring people worked at the beginning, in terms of using tactics against specific people. Unfortunately, the game has problems over the long haul with variety, and a lack of things like camera rotation, which in a game where you build your house seems to be a critical missing feature, and bugs that plague the game on more then just a crashing level didn't help. The potential for mods helps it, and the fact that a majority of the money goes to charity also helps it, but in it's current state, it just doesn't pass the “fun” test over the long haul.\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nBase idea and gameplay works at the start especially with strategically defending your home.\nCheap price and most of the money goes to charity.\nPotential for mod support helps the game immensely in the long run.\nLike the art style, it does feel unique and the character designs stand out when looking at them on an individual basis.\n-:\nMissing features like camera rotation are very problematic, especially for elements of building, and the inability to really “customize” your home doesn't help either.\nAt this time, too many crashes and bugs to count, as well as performance issues when recording (FRAPS specifically). I'm not even sure the video as I showed didn't have a bug with the 999999 thing.\nGameplay gets stale after a while due to a lack of variety. You'll be doing a lot of the same thing.\nHas waterfall problems, specifically, when things start going down the drain, you won't be able to recover reasonably.\nUI feels unfinished or just plopped on at times. Elements that should be highlighted when effected blended into the background.\nGame is exploitable in terms of tactics, at least in my opinion.","August 22, 2015","false","6.8"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","33","45","0","0"

I really want to say that this is a solid game. While it does have it's flaws, it offers fun gameplay and hours of enjoyment at a very reasonable price.\n\nPros: A solid sim/strat game that offers good replayability. The audio is decent but not amazing. The graphics are the same. The graphics feel more like they were made for a tablet/mobile phone game than a straight out PC release. But the game runs very smoothly. The only bugs I encountered were during the tutorial. The gameplay is more casual than most of the Theme games, or Sim games, but that actually helps to work in it's favor imo. I could play for 20-30 minutes and feel I accomplished something, or I could play for an hour or more. This is a game that I will recommend to my friends who like sim/strat type games or who like mobile/casual games. For the price it is a serious buy.\n\nCons: The few bugs I did see were during the tutorial. I could not click on objectives, and had to escape out of the tutorial during the beta (so these bugs MAY be fixed now). This made it harder to get into the game at first. The graphics, for a PC game, could be better. For my taste I would enjoy more RPG elements, i.e. levelups, or stats... but that is my own personal taste.\n\nWarning!: There is some controversy surrounding this game because of the #GamerGate situation. I say forget that crap and give the game a try yourself. For the $5 pricetag you get a lot more out of it then most games that are 15-20 bucks on release. I have enjoyed my time playing this game and I hope you will as well.","August 21, 2015","true","1.1"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","30","41","0","0"

It's very clear that this game could've done with a few more weeks of polishing. However, the basic concept is pretty fun. It's very similar to Ghost Master, where you scare the inhabitants and or visitors of your home, except that game is a tad more indepth. Considering this is a first attempt from The Fine Young Capitalists, don't expect any panty droppers... just a simple, fun game where you scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of unsuspecting people looking for a thrill. I think my favorite part of the game is the varied number of characters, their reactions and the character models themselves. A very interesting artstyle to say the least. All in all, it's worth 5 bucks and it makes for a passable first outing.

But those are really the only flaws, and the game isn't really an ultra-deep-sim in the first place so they're forgivable.\n\nThe game is inexpensive, and also very fun - the basic gameplay is simple but addictive. The balancing act of making enough "scare energy" (i.e. Health + Cash) without exceeding a certain level of "awareness" is easily understood yet compelling. The game slowly ramps up the complexity as you play, so you never feel overloaded.\n\nThe graphics have a somewhat cute art style which helps the light-hearted "Addams Family" atmosphere, which is complemented nicely by the (admittedly a touch repetitive) soundtrack.\n\nSo overall, the game is fun, and provides good entertainment value.

And that's ok. Now it's time to haunt your house before you fade away!\n\nTo get to the nitty and gritty the core of this game is to expand your haunted house while dealing with a variety of threats looking to exorcise your ghostly self. The core resource is energy which is replenished by scaring people. But be careful as building your house costs energy too! Also scaring people can raise awareness which results in your house getting demo'd. You have to strike a careful balance between gathering energy to stay in the game and expand while managing your awareness against a variety of people wandering around your ghostly home. Reporters, cops, exorcists, and more will have to be carefully dealt with so they don't interrupt your bread and butter walking energy nuggets.\n\nThe artwork is cute and the gameplay engaging. I don't generally care overly much when it comes to these sorts of games however I find it to be quite enjoyable. It's also about $4.50 which is crazy cheap. For the bad however I do find the interface and controls to be counter-intuitive at times. Zooming in and out feels inverted and you can't for example open the options menu via escape but you have to use escape to close it. It's doesn't really hinder the gameplay any but it does take some getting used to.\n\nUltimately I'd say if this kind of game is up your alley and you have $5 go ahead and give it a go.

Where in xbill you are protecting your network from little Bill clones, in this game you are protecting your haunted house from Exorcists and Home Renovation Enthusiasts.  The main difference is that you are also building the house as you play (unlike the prebuilt network in xBill), and the traps in the house generate energy.  So, it's split between two modes.  Build mode (action is paused) where you add rooms, traps, decor (necessary to keep the bulldozers from coming) and ghost mode, where you frantically try to scare away threats.\n\nExorcists kill you, given enough time, Renovators kill your traps (preventing the house from generating the energy you need to survive).  As the game progresses, the house gets bigger and bigger and you get a second attack (smaller area but uses less energy).\n\nI expect once you get used to the controls, you will probably put a lot of time into this game.  Not so much as sitting for a whole day playing it, but pulling it up when you have an hour to kill here and there. Now, I have only had a few hours to play it, but that's enough to recommend it to people looking for a game in this category.

I didn't expect TOO much for only five dollars, and I'm ultimately satisfied with what I got.\n\n\nTHE GOOD:\n* The gameplay is fun enough.  You can design the rooms to have certain themes and have a variety of traps to scare people (to death) with.  You also get several different "scare powers" that are better used in different conditions.\n\n* It gets pretty challenging as you progress.  With more people showing up, there are also those who will deplete your resources and disable/steal your traps.  You have to watch out for them.  It makes you keep your focus while playing.\n\n* I like the visual style of the game.  They took their time designing the different characters in the game along with various animations.\n\n* The game has some decent humor.  You can click the characters to have them say something (The exorcist will want to "cleanse this place in the name of fettuccine").  There's other funny little things scattered throughout the game.\n\n\nTHE BAD:\n* The tutorial was broken (and from looking at other reviews, it wasn't just me).  I had trouble moving the ghost to the two teenagers, and had to actually click several squares before the end for the ghost to move there.  After that, I couldn't select my scare power, so I had to skip the tutorial altogether and figure out the game on my own.  Fortunately it was easy enough and only took me a few minutes of exploring the UI.  Plus, the more difficult characters are introduced slowly, with messages popping up saying what they do, so the tutorial isn't exactly necessary.\n\n* I couldn't delete/move traps.  I don't know if this gets talked about in the tutorial since I couldn't do it, but it was annoying.  Especially since I wanted to rebuild a few rooms, so the traps ended getting stuck in a wall, but were still considered a part of that room.  Fortunately, the traps still functioned.\n\n\nTHE MEH:\n* The scrolling seems reversed.  I scroll up to zoom out, and scroll down to zoom in.\n\n* You choose resolution settings before the game starts, Windowed, Fullscreen 1080, and Fullscreen 720.  They could have easily put that in the in-game settings, with more resolution options.\n\n* When you right click on a trap (in the build menu, not in the house), you get a message saying "[trap name] not much to say about them".  This is just sloppy.  They could have written something like how the trap operates, or even not have that message come up at all.  At least it doesn't take away from the game.\n\n* The music is decent, however it's a single constant loop.  At least it's a fitting theme that doesn't get annoying.  Not very good, but not bad either.","August 22, 2015","true","1.4"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

I was left on my own to figure out how to spend points, make my house, and scare people.\n\nAfter 3 tries I finally got the tutorial to work to the point where it told me how to build rooms, this was incredibly helpful and I advanced to round 3 in that run. Then the game froze; music still worked but everything was frozen. I shut it down and restarted my save from just after round 1.  Now everytime I load that file it freezes in less than a minute.\n\nIn order to play the game more I will have to start a new game, trudge through all the tutorial text again (or miss any helpful bonus (like a new room) that I recieved in it, and pray that it doesn't freeze like the last one. At this point, I am just trying to complete the achievements but I don't even know if that's possible anymore.\n\nOverall?:\n+Great game. It's a unique concept and the visuals are cute as well. It has the potential to be interesting and fun.\n\n-The controls are horrible. Everytime I have to click on the shop my camera moves and I had to figure out how to move in in the pause screen. Let me explain, when you are in "ghost mode," which is when you scare people and watch people get scared by your traps, you move the camera (which does not rotate) by dragging your mouse to the edge of the screen. When you are in shop/edit mode, which is when you click on the shop to buy/place anything, you have to hold down the right mouse button and drag the screen. Because this was so different from "ghost mode" it took me quite a while to figure out.\n\n-Crashes and corrupted save files. I already explained this but I can no longer access my save.\n\n-Reptetive. Every unique character, such as "Exorcist" "Police Officer" or "Girl Teen," has the same look and sayings as the multiple copies running around. It gets a bit tiring after a while. I can't say that there isn't more variety in late game, as I am unable to get there, but I would like to see more variety in the little snippets of text if nothing else.\n\nUntil the bugs are fixed I cannot reccomend this game.","April 11","false","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have essense that you need to keep you alive but it's also the same power you use to scare humans or build the rooms.\n\nI dunno, there's just not a lot to talk about... but like I said, it set out some basic goals and achieved them with a team of ladies that have never made games before so it's alright for a first game.

Man spielt einen Geist, der sein Dasein damit verbringt, Leute in in Spukhaus zu locken und zu erschrecken. Dadurch erhält man Spuk-Energie, die man benötigt, um verschiedene Fähigkeiten des Geistes zu benutzen und um alle Möglichen Objekte zu kaufen und das Spukhaus auszubauen. Sollte die Energie auf 0 fallen, ist das Spiel verloren.\n\nLevel oder Missionen werden in dem SPiel so gehandhabt, dass man im Grunde immer eine gewisse Anzahl an Räumen und "Fallen" bauen muss, um "aufzusteigen". Hierdurch erhält man neue Fähigkeiten und Objekte und es kommen immer mehr verschiedene Menschen in das Haus, die Vor- sowie Nachteile mit sich bringen. Z.B . Entziehen Exorzisten die Spukenergie, wenn sie das Haus betreten, Feiglinge bringen besonders viel Spukenergie, Handwerker entschärfen Fallen und Reporter lassen die Bekanntheit steigen.\nBekanntheit sorgt dafür, dass die Behörden ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf das Spukhaus richten und Polizisten vorbeischicken, oder, im schlimsten Fall, Bauarbeiter, die das Haus abreißen. Um dem Entgegen zu wirken, muss man das Haus mit ungefährlichen Objekten füllen, um wenig auffällig zu sein.\n\nIm Großen und Ganzen handelt es sich um ein nettes Casual-Game, welches sich ein wenig wie die alten Bullfrog - Managment Spiele anfühlt. Der Grafikstil ist niedlich und bunt, und großteils kann man die verschiedenen Besuchertypen gut voneinander unterscheiden.\nBei mir kam jedoch das Problem auf, dass ich widerliche Grafik-Glitches hatte. Das Menü war nicht richtig zu sehen und ich hatte seltsame Objekte auf dem Screen flackern. Im Win95-Kompatibillitäts-Modus Win95 kam dies nicht auf, aber die Performance litt darunter. Anscheinend haben aber nicht alle Spieler dieses Problem.\n\nAuch ist das Spiel nicht sonderlich erfolgreich darin, Erklärungen und Tutorials zu liefern. Zwar wird erklärt, was man in dem Spiel zu tun hat, aber wie man und ob man Objekte verkaufen kann (man kann nur Gras darüber malen), wie man Objekte drehen kann, oder welchen Effekt welches Objekte auf die jeweilige Statistik hat, muss man selber herausfinden.\nAußerdem sagt das Spiel einerseits, amn soll so viele Türen wie möglich bauen, versucht man dies aber, stellt man fest, dass man an jede Wand nur eine Tür bauen kann, egal wie lang sie ist.\n\nAuch wenn das Spiel bei Weitem nicht perfekt ist, ksotet es nur 5€ und bietet dafür genug Spaß. Nach einigen Upgrades besitzt man wirklich schöne Objekte, um sich ein ansehnliches Spukhaus zu bauen und das leichte Puzzle Element mit den verschiedenen Hausbesuchern hält auf Trab, wenn auch nicht für all zu lange.\nIch denke, dass Afterlife Empire am besten in kurzen Sessions zu genießen ist, dann aber ordentlich Spaß bereiten kann... Sofern man keine Glitches und Crashes hat, dann sollte man die Finger davon lassne. Hoffentlich kümern sich die Entwickler noch um diese Probleme....","August 21, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Feels like an alpha to be honest. I love games like theme hospital but the biggest draw of those games is building your game area and squeezing out every bit of money you can from every square available, here you can't really do much. Each room can only have one scare item in it so can't really maximize efficiency in a large room. As soon as anyone walks into a trap they immediately run clear out of the house, so there's no real point to make more rooms except to fill them with props to distract cops. You can't rotate anything which makes it annoying for someone with OCD that loves decorating in these types of games. It crashes a lot, often times for no reason it'll just stop responding can't click anything or do anything. Huge issue though is you can't delete traps, you rebuild a room with different tiles it'll get rid of props but not traps, once you place one it's there for ever which is especially annoying when you get better traps because people will walk into the first trap and run out of the house completely ignoring all others\n\nI'd suggest drop down walls, that way you don't need to have a full camera rotation but can still see well in the mansion. Rotatable items is a must, really helps decorating a house. Traps that work in different ways, doors that lock behind a character so they can't run out and have to run your terror maze, traps or scares that will chase someone in a specific direction to set off a combo scare or something.\n\nI won this game so didn't cost me, but I wouldn't have felt ripped off if I had. I would've kept it cause it can be fun and I do see potential if they keep working on it. But as of right now? It's hard to recommend.\n\nTl;Dr: A fun game despite some noticeable issues, needs some work but for 5 dollars I'd say it's a fine price for what it is and would recommend it if you're a fan of the old theme style games.","August 24, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I played the beta on pc and I couldn't get the damn tutorial to work and I still can't get it to work...I thought they would get that fixed by now. The options menu isn't really an option menu, there's practically nothing there. The controls are just odd...when I try to move the screen to see the NPCs, it just flips on me and goes to the wrong direction on it's own.\nThere's a lack of direction in the game, there's really nothing that makes me want to play it. Your only objective is to scare the ♥♥♥♥ of people, but I feel like you could just use the vase all day to scare people with and the ghost when you have to.\nIt's just not a finished product, I know the game developers behind AE are amateurs, but if you need more time to fix the game, then reschedule the release date. People will be more understanding if you need more time to fix the game.\nThe game crashed on me 3 times and my friend's computer is pretty beefy (Will edit in the specs in the review later)\nYeah the review isn't really that lengthy or that full in depth. I just can't wright much about it since I don't fully understand the game because I couldn't get the tutorial to work.\nRate: 3/10\nOther main admin's review\nPlaytime (1 hour)\nIt's garbage.\nBetter than depression quest I guess.","August 21, 2015","false","0.5"," 18 of 49 people (37%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","37","18","49","3","0"

I'm a big fan of Haunting (Genesis) and Ghost Master and I was hoping it would be similar.\nGame is fun for wasting a few minutes. It would work a lot better on a mobile platform.\n\nI like the visual style and the NPC responses are pretty funny.  The music gets pretty annoying and I usually turn it off.\n\nUser Interface and User Experience needs some work, tooltips would help, or at least a better tutorial.\n\nJust an example of how the UX could be improved, there were a few times I thought my game locked up, when in fact, it was only because I selected a different section than the ghost.   Some indicator that the game is paused would help.\n\nI played this on a Mac and there were a few lock-ups (or at least I think they were..again, hard to tell with the UI/UX).\n\nEven so, I'm having fun with the game, but there's undoubtably a large room for improvement.\nBe wared, I've heard this game has its share of game-breaking bugs, but I haven't experienced any, so hopefully they've sorted all that out.","September 4, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not very complex so I have a hard time finding myself getting lost in the gameplay for any more than half an hour. Playing in short spurts seems to be the most enjoyment I get out of the game.\n\nI have read before time and again the bugs are still acting up in the game (as I had bought this for my friend and alas, he still cannot get past the loadscreen) and although I have not experieneced any of these problems, it would be reasonable to expect the game to be fixed by now. I hope to hear more from the developers soon, but at this time I cannot recommend this game in good faith. If it hits mobile markets though, you'll be sure to see me there!","January 30","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a cute game, I like it, and I enjoyed playing it. However, it's no longer a game I have much interest in.\nI absolutely do recommend it, but expect the game to crash, for there to be silly glitches, and to eventually stop playing it all together.\n\nIt feels like the biggest issue here was the fact that they got a lot of hate for something as stupid as where money went based on a public voting system. It seemed to discourage the devs, who, quite frankly, were doing a damned good job. If people judged the game and only the game, this would have gone a lot further.\n\nSo, for $5, you get a few hours of fun gameplay, maybe some more if you get really into it. You'll probably be like me and wish that the devs and publishers had the will to do more.\nMaybe one day they'll pick this back up for an update or two, if only to humor people like me.","May 31","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
