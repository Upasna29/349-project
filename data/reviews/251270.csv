Once you get used to them, they become charming in their own way and are more than bearable. In fact, in some parts of the game they shine more than the updated psp versions.\n\nNow for the actual game:\n\nThe story is simple, you are trapped in an unknown place, by an unknown force, Heavenly host elementary being that place. The setting is dark and grim with very adult themes and little to no rest on intense dialogue and scenes.\n\nAs I stated before, once you get used to the art, it almost becomes more enjoyable than its psp's counter part.\n\nThe gameplay is very dialogue heavy, but allows for exploration at your own pace, creeping around the old elementary, not really being sure what to expect around each turn. With the absolutely stunning soundtrack it will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time.\n\nAlmost all of the decision you make will make a difference, with many different outcomes to ALMOST all of the scenarios you encounter. So if you favor a character, make your decisions carefully.\n\nThe pacing of this game might be considered a little slow for some people, but if you like VN style pacing, it will be perfect for you.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nPROs:\n\n- Unique and engaging art and dialogue\n\n- Decision heavy and very interactive\n\n- Stunning soundtrack\n\n- Fantastic setting\n\n- Great pacing\n\n- Edge of your seat story with many lovable characters\n\n- Multiple endings and lots of little extras\n\nCONs:\n\n- The controller support feels a little "off" when using a analog stick on a 360 pad, it almost feels a little too sensitive, however the dpad works great.\n\n- Letterboxing with black borders\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n(as of release day I can't find any other initial faults)\n\nIf you are familiar with the 2008 version and want to play it in English, this is perfect for you.\n\nIf you have played the psp version and want to spice things up a bit with some extra content and original dialogue, give it a go also.\n\nOverall I'm impressed by the launch, it runs flawlessly and I have encountered no serious issues.","April 25","true","4.6"," 215 of 232 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","215","232","9","26"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Noble_Spartan/recommended/251270/","Noble_Spartan","Noble Spartan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Noble_Spartan/","54 products in account","It has finally arrived… The long awaited Corpse Party for PC is now here on Steam!\nNote!Please keep in mind that this is not the PSP version.\n\nAnother note:Also keep in mind that Corpse Party is not for the faint-hearted. If you’re not a big fan of horror games then I don't suggest getting it.\n\n\nI’ve been a fan of Corpse Party for a while, and seeing this on Steam only brings me more nostalgia ever since I’ve seen Corpse Party for the first time. Even though it's not as spectacular as the PSP version in my opinion (which came out after this was made by the way), it still brings out quite the experience and will still give you shivers down your spine.\n\nThe full name, Corpse Party: Blood Covered is an RPG Horror game developed by Team GrisGris and localized into English by XSEED Games.\n\nThe story starts out with students at a school called Kisaragi Academy. They are Ayumi Shinozaki, Yoshiki Kishinuma, Satoshi Mochida, Yuka Mochida, Naomi Nakashima, Seiko Shinohara, Mayu Suzumoto, Sakutaro Morishige, and Ms. Yui Shishido, and they are about to become the new victims of the supposed haunted elementary school, Heavenly Host.\n\nAyumi, who is into horror and occults, decides to do a ritual called the “Sachiko Ever After” because of her friend, Mayu leaving Kisaragi and transferring to another school. After the ritual has been done, Ayumi claims that they all would always be friends… That is until a sudden earthquake occurs and the ground collapses beneath them, causing the whole crew to fall into the abyss below… At least that's what I assume for this version.\n\nCorpse Party consists of 5 chapters, which is the main storyline for the characters. As you progress the story will get more intense and (maybe) more gruesome and frightening as you play. There are also 4 extra chapters, which are exclusive to this version including one chapter which re-tells the storyline from Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, “Tooth” chapter. The story is still the same, but when compared to the PSP version, the dialogue is different, including having different voice actors for the characters and not having it fully voiced, but this game still has its charm to the core. There are even some some minor scenes like the prologue that are very different compared to the PSP version, but it doesn't really change or impact the storyline in any way.\n\nYou can also find and collect name tags of the victims’ corpses that are scattered throughout the school and even find out the causes of their deaths. (Hence the name Corpse Party, hehehe… Okay I'll stop.)\n\nNote that this game is very dialogue heavy, similar to how a visual novel would stand out. So unless you like reading or if you're patient, expect more than just a paragraph of reading. This game also contains multiple endings, one good / true ending per chapter, and multiple bad endings (Only one ending for the extra chapters). You will be given decisions that might either save your fate or cause a traumatic ending for them all depending on the many different outcomes. Make your decisions carefully and wisely. That’s why there are save points!\n\nThe soundtrack is also spectacular to listen to. There will be some moments where you feel like you’re pumped for action and ready to embrace the horrors of Heavenly Host, or maybe some moments where it makes you really shake.\n\nNow the part I really like about Corpse Party is how it brings most, if not, all of the horror elements together into one. Unlike most basic horror games I've seen which mainly only focuses on jumpscares, Corpse Party does much more than that. This is one of the only games I played that literally frightened me to the point where my heart was pumping, body tensed up and at the edge of my seat like if I was in a helpless situation. This is truly a masterpiece when it comes to horror.\n\nThe characters are all-so-lovable as always considered by many fans. Oh good o’ Seiko, we will miss you. :(  That’s one of the reasons why the fanbase is popular, because of the interesting characters, their development, and their relationships with one another. You will learn to either love or hate these characters and this entirely depends on the outcomes of the many different endings you might get.\n\nIn conclusion, Corpse Party is a well done horror game that also well optimised for PC, never encountered any issues. Even though it has its flaws, it still shines in a unique way compared to the PSP version with its unique and some extra content that is exclusive to the PC version.\n\nIt also comes with its own set of trading cards so you could get your Corpse Party theme badges, emoticons, backgrounds, etc.\n\n\nShould you buy this game?\nFan of horror? Sure! Like the series? Definitely! Into extreme blood, gore, and violence? Then this is for you.\n\nIf you really liked this game, then I also recommend playing the rest of the series if you haven't already, the 2 games, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows and Corpse Party: Blood Drive as well.\n\n9.5 / 10","April 30","true","23.2"," 57 of 64 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","57","64","7","0"

Yes, it looks more... primitive than the PSP. Yes, the artstyle is different and more childish. And yes, it's not fully voiced unlike Blood Covered: Repeated Fear, but bear in mind that the PSP version is an enhanced remake of this one game, which is in turn a remake of a PC-98 game from 1996 (Remakeception pretty much).\nNot having the still images the PSP version had, the PC version mostly counts on two factors to spook you out: hearing and imagination. The voice clips and sound effects are bone-chilling, maybe even more than on the PSP, and the gory descriptions are just as accurate and grotesque (Both versions are translated by XSEED, after all, so there are plenty of bits where dialogues and descriptions are identical between the two versions).\nIf we add the game running at smooth 60 FPS, the overall clearer (albeit a bit less detailed) tilesets and THANKFULLY the option of skipping pre-read text, well... you can see why I strongly advice buying this game...\n... well... unless you're those people who don't like reading... or prefer seeing gorefests directly on-screen off to the last detail!

I can't stand it, especially jumpscares. But what I do enjoy is a good story and writing, which this game seemed to contain. Once I was completely certain that this game didn't have any jumpscares, I bought it and blindly dived into this masterpiece of a game, and I didn't regret doing so one bit. So, here is a completely unbiased review from someone who hasn't been in contact with any Corpse Party media before.\n\n+ A great story. Not the best I've experienced in a game, but it's sure up there. I really couldn't put this game down since I got it and it's basically all I've been playing for a while now. The story alone is worth getting this for imo. It's a fairly text heavy game, as there are parts of the game where you're basically only reading text. As you get further into the story, you will begin to realize how messed up the whole scenario actually is.\n\n+ The soundtrack is phenomenal, and so is the voice acting. When I first started playing I had to lower the volume since the ambient music alone spooked me. That loud ringing noise when entering the infirmary is still in my head. Worth keeping in mind is that there is no English VA, but this didn't really bother me personally as I prefer Japanese VA anyway.\n\n+ The gameplay is decent, it gets the job done so to speak. You basically just walk around the school interacting with objects while encountering different types of puzzles, running from ghosts, or accomplishing something before a timer runs out. It's possible to describe it as a hybrid between a VN and adventure game, similarly to the Ace Attorney series. As it's mainly about the story, I didn't feel the gameplay was particularly detrimental to the experience in general. However, you still need to pay attention to what you're doing or you'll stumble into a bad end, called wrong end in this game. Sometimes I intentionally picked a dialogue option that seemed worse than the other to trigger a wrong end, but ended up progressing the story instead. I feel somewhat bad for people who always try to pick the seemingly good option...\n\n+ Since there are a ton of wrong ends to experience, the game seems to last for a long time, especially if you want all of the achievements. There are also quite a few extra chapters I'll be looking to play soon. It took me about 20h to finish the game + a couple of wrong ends, but I'm definitely not one of the quickest gamers out there. I didn't use a guide either, and I found this to help with the sense of helplessness the game tries to promote.\n\n- I really don't have a lot of negative things to say about this. I found that a lot of the characters look very similar so I had some issues keeping up with all the names and who was who. I also found that when watching a wrong end unfold, some of the text would skip when pressing the A button while the text is being written out (I'm using a 360-controller). I also had some issues with controls during a certain chase scene, but I assume this is controller exclusive problem, as I completed it just fine when quickly switching over to keyboard. In addition to that I also wish there was an option to run through the hallways.\n\nNow, to the million dollar question, is it worth 15€? For me, yes, for others, maybe not. It depends on what you feel makes a game worth its pricetag. For the average person it will probably take about 10h to complete it, but personally I don't think a game's length should determine the price of it. I don't regret buying this one bit, and as soon as I heard the menu music I knew I was in for a hell of a ride.\n\nTo sum it up, I definitely recommend this game, even for you guys out there who are as easily scared as me. While I found the game to be overall pretty creepy, it wasn't all about spooks and the story alone made me love the game. Don't let the graphics fool you though, this game is incredibly well done and has a ton of detail put into it. However, I will note that this game may turn some people off since it's more about the story than gameplay. Basically, if you don't like horror or reading, then it probably isn't for you. On the other hand, if you're looking for a superb story-driven title, look no further.\n\nWith its brilliant writing and intense atmosphere, Corpse Party is one of those games that kept me guessing what was going to happen next, and made me actually care about the characters. I will warn you though that it might occasionally freak you out, especially if you're foolhardy like me who tried playing it at night.","May 1","true","23.3"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

There is no combat, you make choices and pick who you want to try to save.\n\nI didn't know what to expect from this game when I first bought it. I saw a youtuber play the original game years ago and was always curious about it. When it came on Steam, the community convinced me to pick it up. And so I did.\n\nImagine Silent Hill mixed with an anime styled visual Novel adventure and retro graphics - Corpse Party is just that! The story is told through 5 well written chapters, each which focuses on different students who are trying to escape the building alive. Each chapter gets harder so the difficulty is gradually increasing with each chapter.\n\nThe game was based off the original psp release so the graphics aren't great and the game feels more or less emulated than anything else. Running the game in 1440p and 4k caused funny glitches such as extra sprites to pop up on screen or other things. It isn't as polished as one would hope.\n\nPros  Great characters\nWell written story\nSurprisingly scary atmosphere for being a pixel art game\n4 extra chapters after you finish the original 5 chapters\nMultiple endings\nController support\nCons  Average drawings and horrible sprites\nOutdated textures could have been updated\nOriginal sprites could not be used\nControls are not tight when using analog on a gamepad\nFinal Thoughts:\nFans of horror should check this one out. It offers a great story despite the horrible drawings and sprites that hold the game back from its full potential.

I personally recommend this version of Corpse Party.\n\nAt least, if you are one of those people who prefer imagination with their horror. I personally found the CGs from the PSP version ruining some of the intense moments in the game. Remember that scene where Ayumi breaks and her pink/white pantsu flashing? yeah. If you absolutely hate that or end up cracking in laughter at how stupid it looks, then get this version. This version also feels more like a horror game with its sound and atmosphere.\n\nWhile I found the premise of Corpse Party as uninteresting, it's how they executed it that makes it really enjoyable. And I always enjoyed interesting storytelling with limited assets. This version doesn't fail to deliver. If you are one of those people, you will like this game.\n\nI also recommend playing this with a guide. It will save you from needless backtracking and enjoy the narrative better. Especially around chapter 5 where if you do something first, you lock yourself out completely from the true ending because you can't obtain a specific statue. It also makes getting the bad endings easier for completion's sake. If you are against this, then be prepared to backtrack a lot. Especially when the perspective of this game can be quite confusing (the stairwell) and the same layout of the buildings confusing you. It can also be unfair like guessing who is what without even giving you a visual or physical description of your target (you'll see what I mean when you get there).\n\nThe inconsistent portrait art style can be a bit distracting, the glaring example is that the assets look like a less impressive version of the PSP art and plopped in with this versions art, to point, Byakudan students. Thankfully they rarely appear that it's almost non-issue.\n\nThis game however isn't free of bugs. Expect the game to crash and burn randomly when saving. Make sure to fill up all 3 slots when you can. You might also want to avoid the 2nd Save Slot in the 5th Chapter. Since the latest update, I cannot save properly on that slot and keep losing progress.\n\nI also have to give glowing praises to this game's soundtrack. I always found it to be the best thing about the CP games and is the mood setter. The voice acting isn't as good in the PSP version in my opinion, but they pass.\n\nSo yeah, it's cheap and enjoyable enough. Go get it.\n\n\n\nps. Yoshiki and Seiko are best waifus and the first bad ending you get in Chapter 5 is my favorite.","May 4","true","19.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","14","18","3","4"

I had never heard of it, but apparently it’s a whole franchise with comics and games. This was a port of some old PlayStation version. So, having known not anything about this game, I was going in blind.\n\nAnd I was surprised. Not sure if pleasantly or unpleasantly.\n\nThe game itself aims to be a horror RPG, though I think it misses that mark a bit. It’s more like a visual novel, but choose your own adventure style. And you do get choices. And there are a LOT of wrong ones. I lost track of how many times I died in this game.\n\nYou die from choosing a wrong dialogue option. You die from missing an item. You die for visiting rooms in the wrong order. YOU WILL DIE in this game.\n\nTo make matters worse, there is no hand holding. No tutorial. You are thrown into the game and left to your own devices.\n\nThe entire premise of the game is fairly decent. You are a group of high school students (and one teacher) who perform an occult ritual. Someone ♥♥♥♥s it up and you end up in a haunted school (in an alternate dimension?) where children were murdered. Your goal is to escape. How you do that becomes more and more clear as you progress.\n\nThe story is very well written. Plot twists run rampant, and nothing in the story was predictable. That being said, there were never any moments where I found myself unable to suspend disbelief. The game does an excellent job of keeping you engaged the entire time.\n\nThe graphics are typical of RPGMaker style games. Most of the characters, aside from pixellated sprites, also have hand-drawn art. The art is good, and matches the sprites surprisingly well.\n\nMy one complaint about this game is the inability to skip certain things. Like the credits. At the end of every chapter.

Personally I was never a fan of horror games but I have really enjoyed Corpse Party. The secret to its success is the incredible narrative and audio paired with the game. To fully experience the game be sure to play this game with a headset. I find that lots of popular horror games use jump scare as their basis but personally I dislike that approach. I have both played the Dead Space series and Corpse Party and I have been very suprised how pixel horror and strong narrative has spooked me far more than Dead Space ever has; Dont be fooled by its lackluster graphics. The enviroments are very well made, but to some the sprites may not be very appealing. One thing I'll admit I dont care for much is sometimes they make very "anime" approaches to dialogue choice and interactions.\n\nOverall I would recommend this anybody who enjoys anime / manga","April 25","true","1.8"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","0"

Having played the psp version, I do miss the better character artwork in the psp version, but this version makes up for it in other updated graphics within menus and textboxes. The music is fantastic, and I appreciate being able to earn achievements now. So far the extra content I've played is enjoyable, and I can't wait to see more as well as play the chapters that have been reworked. This game seems nearly identical to Repeated Fear on the surface, but as you play you will notice the differences and added content.\n\nNow, for people who are new to this game, it doesn't have a ton of action except for certain points and has a LOT of text. It's more similar to a VN style. But, it's a really good story with memorable characters and text. You'll also likely be spending a lot of time replaying parts of chapters to get the true ending, or all of the endings for the achievements, this is just the way all of the Corpse Party games are.\n\nOverall, pleased with the game and the new/extra content, so far worth the long wait for the release.","April 25","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've done all the other Corpse Party games and this PC version is pretty much just as good as the PsP version. The soundtrack seems a little bit different but still fantastic as always. The story is the same as the PsP version, obviously. So that's as good as ever. The only real complaint I have is the complete lack of artwork from the PsP version, instead they used the real old artwork from the PC 98. I'm aware this is because of licensing issues but it still takes away from the game a little bit, in my opinion at least. If you're going to play this I have to recommend also playing the rest of the games as well. Blood Drive and Book of Shadows. At least watch them, if you aren't going to play them. There's plenty of people on the internet who have it on YouTube. You can also play/watch Repeated fear which has the more updated graphics and other visuals. I know Cry did a really great playthrough of that game if you can't find a decent playthrough.There's also a few Anime bits to go along with the series like Missing Footage but they aren't really neccesary. I very highy recommend this game to anyone, really. As long as you can take a few scares and sad parts (and quite the load of reading) this game is a wonderful experience.","April 28","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Corpse Party originated as an indie pc game in 1996. It got a cell phone remake but it was canceled due to the development of this PC remake (the one on steam). In Japan this game is called "Corpse Party Blood Covered" and was released in 2008 episodicly. It got a PSP remake we known as "Corpse Party Blood Covered Repeated Fear" released in 2010 but was called simply as "Corpse Party" by xseed. A 3DS port was released on 2015 in Japan and the english version will be released sometime this summer.\n\nUghh, see how confusing that was? Technically you don't need to play all versions of Corpse Party. If you've played ether psp, 3ds or pc versions you won't be missing out on much. It's the same game with same characters. You can continue with Book of Shadows then Blood Drive for the PSP and Vita.\n\nThe series has gotten a manga series and a anime OVA (I personally don't like the OVA for its many problems), and a live action movie with a sequel on the way.\n\nWell that's great, now how about the actual game? Corpse Party is about a group of students who do an innocent sounding ritual for a friendship charm that goes wrong. They end up in a school that was once demolished and rebuilt as their school. They are trapped in a school from the past with vengeful ghost and traps at every corner. The game sticks to its routes being a RPG horror game that allows you to see the game from a different perspective of the characters trying to find a way back home.\n\nThe game has many endings and as messed up as it sounds you can collect name tags from corpses and find out how they died from the main menu. Depending what endings you get you can unlock extra chapters that expand the story. This makes dying or making the possible wrong choices worth your while.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, like it's psp and 3ds counterparts it has some parts that would take a few tries to get through. The translation done by xseed is a little off like a few lines not matching up to what the character voices are saying or the text box saying something completely different compared to the Japanese version.\n\nCorpse Party is an interesting spin as a horror RPG with retro character sprites. It offers different art style and voices compared to the modern versions of the game for psp and 3ds. Many complaints are from people who are ether misinformed about this PC version or expect this to be a port of the psp game which is the opposite. If you have already played the psp or 3ds version you're not missing out on anything. Just continue with Book of Shadows then Blood Drive. Hope you enjoy.","May 23","true","5.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It is a remake of the original RPG Maker game that was never released outside of Japan. If you have played the PSP game, you will definitly notice some differences. The voices are all diferent (though none of them are better), and the portraits are different as well. The graphics remain the same, but you get to see different things that were originally shown as CG images in the PSP game. There are also different scenarios and changed dialouge, as well as the Tooth extra chapter and a speed up option which is useful for those Wrong Ends with long dialouge. While it doesn't have as much content as the PSP and 3DS versions, it does contain some new wrong ends in Chapter 5 of the game. Even if you have picked up other versions of Corpse Party, this one is different enough to warrent a purchase. My one complaint is that sometimes the text boxes dissapear before I can read them, as some of them advance on their own when the voices finish. Other than that, the game functions extremly simalar to the PSP game, and is definitly worth picking up.","May 29","true","16.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I read a bit of the manga, and it went with a more or less happy ending, I think the True Ending. The anime... Man that just ♥♥♥♥ed everything up as hard as it could for your feels. Despite the fact that I kinda know what's gonna happen, the Actual Game is keeping me interested.\n\nI like how it's split into chapters, and each one has it's own Right End, and one or more Wrong Ends. Certain Wrong Ends are explored in the anime, while the Manga, from what I've read, tries to hold true to the mystery of the Right End. I digress. Each chapter has mulitiple possible endings, only one of which is right. And even the right ending might seem like a Wrong End, but the game will tell you if it is a Wrong End.\n\nThe difficulty progression is kinda ridiculous, First chapter basically walks you through a Right End, and then Chapter Two is like, 'HAAAHAAAAA Good luck, SUCKER!" The way to make a RIght End just gets more complicated, but at the same time there are more Wrong Ends, so it's a very trial-and-error- sort of deal.\n\nNot sure if you can get a Wrong End in chapterA and still move to chapterB. I've been playing till I get the RIght End, even cheating with online guides when I get stuck. *Hangs head in shame* Judge me after you try Chapter 3 with no help.\n\nI digress. It is an amazing story, and the way its played out as an RPG type game makes it even better. It really is kind of a Visual Novel, but you don't just sit there and read, make the occasional choice, you get to move the different characters, It's an Interactive Novel.\n\nAfter Chapter One, be prepared for Wrong Ends.","May 3","true","6.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Unfortunately, it pales in comparison to the PSP remakes, which surpasses the PC version in animation and voice acting (makes dialogue so much lively), potraits (makes characters more realisticly high school), CG (critical for emotional scenes). The only area where the PC version is better is the headphone audio, which is definitely more chilling and better recorded.\nI bought this game, but then I discovered the PSP version, and I just couldn't look at the PC version anymore.\nStill, I'm not asking for refunds, just to support high quality VNs on PC, but I recommend the PSP versions far more (the upcoming 3ds version will be the definite version).\n\nAs for the game itself, its a very slow boiling horror story, it takes advantage of the long play time to lure players to invest emotional commitment to their characters before some are killed off. The results are far more terrifying than your typical gorefest, not to mention it explores deeper themes than simple creepy stories, meaning you'll remember the story for far longer than the likes of Alan Wake or Before Dawn or any Resident Evils (if that can still be considered a horror game)","April 29","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I would like to see a higher quality version, with the fullres images at the endings and cutscenes [for the sake of Blood, if you know me ;D]. If you want to enjoy every bit of it, your gameplay shall reach the 15~20 hours or so, maybe more if you don't know what to do, so it is at a good lenght.\n\nI really like the fact that the original sound in Japanese was present, since I'm a fan of subtitles more than dub. Knowning a little of japanese makes it extra fun to predict what they are going to say when you bat an eye at the translated text. BUT the voice acting of some main characters is not that great and are quite annoying. For my personal preferences they focused too much on the "childish cry"-like voice. I really expected Shinozaki to have a slightly deeper/variable/macabre inducing voice. But some characters are very well dubbed, specially KIZAMI!\n\nSadly, if you want to play the follow-up games, you will find yourself inabled to without a portable like PSP or 3DS. And this is a somewhat considable letdown of the franchise. But still, the conclusion given at the present game, or shall I say, multiple conclusions, are already satisfiying per se.\n\nThe game mechanics are what you might find in current indie Horror RPG-maker based games, with a twist here and there but nothing too elaborate. You may also watch out for some "mistakes" that make the game impossible to continue without reseting the chapter or going to a previous save, like putting a wodden tile at the "wrong" place and then not finding another one or any way to remove the one you placed.","May 25","true","22.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

What I mean by that, is that you can't simply walk by an object and spam the space bar or action button. You need to actually stay still in that one spot, wait for half a second, then press space.

You spend the majority of your time exploring your surroundings to find the right elements necessary to proceed the story, interacting with the objects around you. The way you approach each of the five chapters determines whether you are able to unlock the next chapter or fall prey to one of several wrong ends, with the last featuring different endings varying on how you solved the mystery. Each chapter takes about an hour to complete.\n\nGood story and excellent horror told through imagination are two of the reasons I recommend this title. Although I think the price is reasonable for the amount of time spent on the game, it may be a possible dealbreaker to some as it does not take long to beat it.\n\nControls were also something it seems you had to figure out on your own. If you are like me and struggle: movement is done through the arrow keys or WASD, Z is accept/interact and X is cancel/menu.

You'd think that, with the PC version of Corpse Party, they'd be able to add more to it, right? Simply replaying through the chapters that i'm overly familiar with from having sat through every ending in Corpse Party's PSP release, I noticed two major issues;\nThe sprites are vastly more colorful, making the area(s) appear more vibrant-- this takes away from the overall atmosphere, not that there's much to be scared of. Also, it should be noted that the field of view seems comparatively larger than the PSP version.\nI'd say about 95% of the voices were completely removed. It's not a big issue, but certainly something that definitely added to the game(WHERE'S MY MORISHIGE CRAZED LAUGHTER?!)\nAs for the artstyle, i've read numerous complaints about it. Does it really make a difference? In my opinion, the sprites are creepier than the PSP version due to how deformed they look.\n\nI really wanted to like the PC version of Corpse Party, and i'll probably give it more time to settle in, but as it stands, the game just seems like a shadow of its former glorious cousin, the PSP version of Blood Covered.","April 30","true","5.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It is puzzle and story driven. The haunting enviroments and acompanying soundtrack make this a creepy edition worthy of any horror fanatic even with its classic 16 bit style and you find your self delving deeper and deeper into the title trying to pick up on the smallest details of the story that give lots of insite into the totured souls of this game.\n\nThis games brilliance lies in its ability to make you sympothise with every character in the plot as everything wraps up together nicely and makes this title a unique classic. Dont be put of by its japanese anime style this game has allot to offer!","April 28","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite being just as ♥♥♥♥ed as everyone else, you do feel like a detective figuring out what exactly happened to cause the events of the game through the perspective of multiple main characters.\n\nThe main problem with this release is mostly subjective rather than objective; People like myself who are coming from the PSP version are used to professional quality voice acting and art assets, so we kinda got spoiled on a version that was better made, if lacking in the chapters you'll only find on this PC version. But all in all while it's not perfect I still do wholeheartedly recommend this game.\n\nThere's not much else I can say about it without getting into spoiler discussion, so just take my word for it.","April 28","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
