I think there should be an option to invite friends so that I can do that without having to create or join a server. I think that in the future if things are layed out like this it could be great. Set it up like Castle Crashers or Monaco with a private option and a invite friends option.","July 22, 2015","true","6.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/huntermasterclass/recommended/375790/","huntermasterclass","Hunter Master Class","http://steamcommunity.com/id/huntermasterclass/","90 products in account","Build 'n Bump is a game where one can build a level and play/fight on it. There are various teams and bots to choose from, though a limited selection, it is a small game. The game stands out in local multiplyer, as the game can provide up to six players at a time;two with keyboard and four with controllers. It has Xbox 360 controller support. The game may be fun to play, but gets stale with a lack of people to play with. The game itself is a nice concept and would look forward for future updates.","March 10","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I am a huge fan of level editors, in fact I search the category regularly and it led me to this game. I fell that it is a shame how little content is provided, when with some more work, this could become a much greater game. The price was a responsible choice for the developers to make, considering the lack of a decent single player mode (which in their defence would be incredibly difficult to conceive in such a game). However, if you have a group of at least 3 friends, this is a fun and entertaining game to play, especially if you’re creative enough to play around with the limited objects it provides.\n\nOnce again, I would love to see updates to this game, because as it is, the concept has not been fully explored. Anyone could think of new and interesting things to add to this game, as a quick example, a block which gravity applies to, which can be pushed around and dropped off edges to land on players to kill them, but once again, this is down to the developers implementing these into the game.\n\nI can fully understand that an online multiplayer mode should not be based on port forwarding, and should include a lobby, but people do need to understand that this is a very difficult goal to achieve and even requires money to be put into it, which may be what’s holding this game back.\n\nI have a lot of respect for this game and its concept, and can only suggest that everyone give it a fair chance, instead of spending minimal time in the single player mode and whining for your money back. However it should be noted that to experience the full game and all the fun you could have, you will require a local multiplayer couch party.","March 30","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
