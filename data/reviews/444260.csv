This game doesn't manage to do this, which has deeply disappointed me. Then again, it's not too horrible either.\n\nPros;\n-Interesting combination of adventure, story and running games.\n-Steam trading cards, achievements and partial controller support.\n-4 playable characters\n-Potential (its something new)\n-Two modes (story and run)\n\nCons;\n-No replayability\n-Every run feels very much the same.\n-The most annoying death sound of all time.\n-Slow process from death to running again.\n-No checpoints (only really an issue in story point)\n-You can't save any progress in story mode.\n\n3.5/10","February 19","false","0.4"," 59 of 87 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","59","87","3","3"

Instead of a jumping square you have squared cute animals that run through a sprite landscape. For a quick reactions game and just the story mode the mechanics are OK. But in endless mode you die trying to reach the 10k points.\n\nReasons:\n1. Game runs laggy as hell\n2. Newly in endless mode introduced double size spikes\n3. Sloppy hitboxes - sometimes you die before even touching the spikes or when you are already on the platform above or only close by some water\n4. Spike sequences become unfair at 8k points\n\nThe main problem is like in every kind of this game type: The controls are way too rudimentary. Means you just can control the start of your jump but no faster going down or in-flight adjustments possible. So if you try to ascend spiked stairs every jump must be fitting perfectly or you'll explode immediately. Another bad are the sometimes low exposed spikes like in yellow desert brown spikes. 2/8 chooseable characters are completly useless. Turtle & Dolphin cannot jump over long gaps because of slowness.","June 6","false","8.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

This is why this game gets a thumbs down. It's not good hard, it's stupid hard.\nThe other complaint I have is that with some maps it's difficult to see the actual spikes because they are almost the same colour as everything else.\nI guess if you really hate yourself you could give this a go?","April 30","false","0.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"
