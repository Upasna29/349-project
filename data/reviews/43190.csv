"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mooacnx/recommended/43190/","mooacnx","Miporin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mooacnx/","737 products in account",""Hidden Gem" is the only word I can describe this game.\n\nThe game itself seems to be a little dated, however, the fun is not.\n\nHere's what I thought\n\nGraphics and FXsIt is surprisingly good.\n\nCharacters are well-designed. There are several type of enemies as well as their variations. However, I feel that it could be better if they added some different models for the same enemy, to keep things interesting for the whole round.\n\nGore FX, imho, is better in certain situation compared to newer games with next-gen gore system. As it stands, it serves the game too well. (can be a little too much at times)\n\nMaps are good, seriously, there are better than many newer games of similar theme. There are many neat details that will make you go "WOW", again, maps are good. ;D\n\nGameplaySimple concepts, excellent executions. The game seems to design for soloing, but somehow, they make it so that you have to work together. A competitive co-op kind of gameplay, but encourages playing together.\n\nThis game describes the word 'challenging' very well. It is not hard, but challenging. You will be occupied for the whole round. It is intense, to the point that it might not be suitable for casual players.\n\nWeapons are balanced, imho. They make it so that your starting gear can do something in late round. They are put into 4 categories, Melee / Pistol / Shotty / Machinegun. You get new weapons by upgrading, and each upgrade is really something, not just hit harder. Upgardes are performance-related imo.\n\nAs soon as you jump into the round, start shooting, meleeing. I am honest that you will start thinking of Resident Evil. (especially 4, and the laters) I personally think that ___COM should make their several latest REs' controls similar to this, rather than the awkward controls as they tried to maintain stop and aim from older tittles.\n\nAnyway, actual gameplay can explain better than words:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=546460819\n\nOverallGood game for a cheaper price, if you have some friends to play with, it is worth to try (solo is fine too, though coop is better imo)","November 2, 2015","true","12.2"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","22","23","3","0"

In describing it "Its sorta like Killing Floor..but with more of a Resident Evil 4/5 The Mercenaries 3rd person perspective and execution style melee with fast action.\n\nMake no mistake, Hells Reach is a simple, straight-forward, zombie wave survival game in the same vein as titles like killing.\n\nOverall: If your a fan of 3rd person action shooters with great melee that gives you a good challenge,this is your game.

The goal is to liberate cursed places and survive the assault from the minions of Hell.\nFour game modes are offered: Survival, Battle, Demonizer and Inferno. Each mode can be played on any of The Haunted’s eight maps.\nSurvival simply makes you keep fighting until you die, which is not a particularly engaging objective, while Battle and Demonizer are The Haunted’s efforts at player-versus-player modes. In Inferno, which is the best mode of the game, four players must survive four waves of enemies that increase in number and power over time before fighting Abaddon, a huge boss monster in a separate Hell level.\nThe player is equiped with a handgun, shotgun, machine gun and knife. You will unlock upgrades to these as you kill.\nThe game has also a deep melee system that gives the player an easy way out when surrounded by undead.\nUnfortunately, networking issues can make locating or connecting to someone’s game difficult. The biggest problem of The Haunted Hells Reach is that joining a game forces you to wait until the next wave of enemies, which can sometimes be 10+ minutes until you can finally play.\nin my opinion, if you are seeking a new, unique team-based game to play with some friends, The Haunted Hells Reach is a worthy choice.\n\nSounds 6/10\nGraphics 6/10\nGameplay 7/10\nAtmosphere 7/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","July 29, 2013","true","35.2"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

It's very simple, but insanely fun. You versus the demons of hell; a great combination. You and three others must tackle down the enemies wave by wave until you reach the depths of hell and fight a boss. It is a great challenge and an awesome time. My favorite aspect about this game is how awesome each melee strike and attack is. You have a surprisingly large amount of melee attacks and each will cause you to be showered in a pool of blood and limbs. But beyond that are the upgraded versions of your starting pistol, SMG, and shotgun. Oh, and the knife as well. Each new upgrade gets crazier, more powerful, and enhances the gore. And there is also a nice variety in maps, too. Each one feels different and will require a different setup plan. AS for bugs, well,  I have not encountered any bugs. It runs really smoothly for me as well. To me it's pretty polished. It also looks beautiful.  At its full price it is steep, seeing as how many don't play this game anymore, but if it's on sale I would highly recommend getting it.","March 20, 2014","true","6.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

There was a clan-server, on which three of its members lived happily...\n\nBut then I came onto the server...\n\nEven though they already played for like ten minutes, i quickly went first place. Something they had a hard time to handle.\nAt one point, i could hear one of them complaining over voice chat: "He´s always attacking me with grenades"\n\nBad attempt, considering i cant remember this game having friendly fire. I wasnt attacking him, but the enemys around him.\nLater, i could enjoy the sight of them throwing explosives at me, doing no damage whatsoever.\nTheir rage became undeniable, when we reached the "Mine"-Map. If a player dies in this game, he "respawns" in form of a crystal. The other players must destroy this crystal in order to bring the dead teammate back.\n\nWhen i died, they ignored my crystal... For several minutes... It appears they tried to get rid of me that way, hoping that i´d quit, since they apparently had no kicking-power... But i didnt.\n\nBut thanks to divine justice, their plan was condemned to fail. You see, when a players crystal isnt destroyed fast enough, a enemy NPC will pick them up. These NPCs then stop attacking and run around on the map, on hardcoded routes.\nOn the Mine-Map, this route is bugged. Sooner or later, the NPC will jump down a hole and land in a lava-pit, thus killing himself and destroying the crystal.\n\nThus i came back to live and ruined the clan-members game once again with my skill.\n\n\nFinally, the time had come for the final battle. Time for us four to face Abaddon. One by one they fell like unskilled scrubs, until only i was left.\n\nUnlike them, i wasnt a childish little ♥♥♥♥♥ and would have brought them back a.s.a.p but divine justice struck again:\nIn the final battle against Abaddon, there is no revival. Once a player dies, he stays dead.\n\nThus the three little scrubs had no chance but to spectate me being better than them. Alone, this battle used up alot of time, since i had to fight the boss while dealing with all the mobs.\n\nBut i wasnt giving up, i kept fighting and Abaddons health kept going down. After about ten minutes of watching me, hoping that i´d fail, the first clan-♥♥♥♥♥ couldnt take it anymore and left the server. For a brief second his voice-chat symbol showed up, he was telling his teammates something. Surely it was something like "Guys just leave, he´ll die soon anyway".\n\nThe second followed quickly after that, while the third one stayed for another five minutes, desperately trying to find an explenation that could explain why he and his friends didnt make it longer than five minutes, while i just kept fighting, surviving everything Abaddon threw at me.\n\nFinally, he also left, bailing out in shame probably thinking i would die soon. But i didnt. Yet another ten minutes later, i dealt the final blow to Abaddon, beating the boss and winning the game.\n\n\n\nWhen i bought this game it was like what? 10€? Yeah, money well spent!","July 11, 2015","true","13.3"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","53","21","40","17","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WARDEATHFUN/recommended/43190/","WARDEATHFUN","Rex Draco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WARDEATHFUN/","839 products in account","This is your generic type of humans versus waves of zombies/monsters type scenario. It is very special, but it is definitely something good to come back to every once in awhile.\n\nThis is a third person shooter and it has a nice variety of weapons. You can upgrade your weapon for it to level up to the next tier. The tier system is, however, opinionated on which is better or worse. Regardless, it's a nice take  on a weapon system.\n\nThe monsters are demons, which has a variety of types out there. you'll have the generic not zombie but still cannon fodder like a zombie type monster, then you got the generic winged demon. You got the big orc like guys and then you got these weird tiny bug like things. The diversity is good. There is a type of giant demon that eventually becomes immune to gun damage, whom encourages melee combat since that's the only way to kill it.\n\nSpeaking of melee combat, you have not just the primary weapons or sidearms, but also a melee weapon with different melee attacks like kicking. You probably will not use them all a whole lot, but it's still a worthy try in variety that I wish more games would have. (I miss kicking in games greatly)\n\nWhen you finish the waves, you eventually fight the final boss. The final boss feels cheap at first, but it's possible with practice. It basically is a giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a demon that walks around in lava, throwing lava ♥♥♥♥ at you, all the meanwhile the immune to gun damage guys spawn all over the place trying to attack you while bursts of lava comes out of the ground. It is a climatic ending and it was climatic at first, but it gets old after awhile... like the game itself.\n\nAs I have said before, the game is something you'll wanna come back to every once in awhile, especially with friends. Its graphics are good and so is the lighting, not amazing but good enough, the sound is what you'd want, the characters are kinda over the top in personality like a bad horror movie- which is a good thing - and their design is nice.\n\nThere is a variety of game modes, one of which you can play in a strategy game like perspective and spawn enemies or even choose to play as the enemy yourself. It isn't that fun in my opinion to be the bad guys because you'll die so quickly and you have a spawn timer on when you can spawn more enemies, which might be good for balance and fairness for the humans but it makes you feel bored just sitting there pressing the button over and over again... even cookie clicker is more fun than that. There is a survival mode as well, it's as you'd expect and it's fun as well.\n\nOverall, the game is good. I wouldn't buy it full price, I would consider buying it on sale for around $5. Apparently the developers are hinting something is afoot with the title. We'll see what that means and I'll edit my review accordingly if it any way changes my overall opinion. For now, this is a good bargin title, don't buy it at full price.\n\nPros:\nA good enough variety in enemies and weapons\nLighting and atmosphere is nice\nGameplay is fun for beginners and veterans alike\nA healthy amount of gamemodes\n\nCons:\nNot many hours should be expected to be put in this right away, but it is something you could launch for years to come in every five or so months. This game will get stale pretty quick.\nThe combat seems unbalanced, you could spam some moves and do just fine\n\n\n\nOverall, I give it a score of a 6ish/10. For people that are unfamiliar with rating scales, 6 isn't bad.","January 7, 2015","true","22.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Anyone who likes DOOM or going FAST will like this game. Me, personally? I'm a sucker for games like this. All of the guns feel powerful which should be a thing in more games, the graphics are pretty great for an indie game, the blood and gore make the game look pretty cool, and the game is just overall really fun.\n\nMy complaints with the game lie in a lack of content for it. It was so fun that there's not enough maps for it. Luckily i think you can download user created maps to play on, but those are limited as well. Plus, the community is pretty much dead as a doorknob, unfortunately. Still, if you're a fan of survival/horde mode games, you owe it to yourself to get this.

Just a very action-packed, quick and arcade-y 'kill everything before it kills you' type arena survival shooter. The gameplay itself consist of a mix of gunplay and melee action, combined with tons of explosives (and explosions) and a life-saving dodge mechanic.\nIf you like L4D or Killing Floor, but feel that both those games have slow player characters and are not action-heavy enough, give Haunted a try.\n\nBe warned though, Haunted is definitely on a higher difficulty level then any of the two compared games. Whilst on the lowest of the 5 difficulty grades you might easily survive the first of the four waves, the later ones will usually kill you on your first attempt, with suicidal green-goo spitting maniacs, walking volcanos and Freddy-style nightmare warriors.\nAnd if we start about the highest difficulty level... boy... imagine L4D expert realism with 80% of all infected being special infected :P\n\nThe pros of Haunted are clear: Solid gameplay, tons of action and reflex-based thinking, mixed with a solid note of badassery.\nHowever, I must be fair and mention it's downsides too: There is no character progression, any weapon upgrades you gather in a match are reverted at the end of a level. As well, there's literally no online playerbase for this game. This really isn't a bad thing and I enjoy it a lot in singleplayer, but if you are the coop only type of person, you may want to bring some friends. Lastly, it lacks diversity and is one of those games you just cant play 8 hours in a row or you will grow bored.\n\n\nOverall, Haunted is one of my longest-active games, simply because it's always fun to relax with techno/speedcore battle music via winampw hilst playing a round or two on Nightmare difficulty. Whenever I feel like blowing faces up, I just grab winamp, Haunted, and splode away.\nRating: 8/10","March 1, 2014","true","39.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Now for the main reason why I don't recommend the game is because its dead, on January of 2016 the developers stated they had legal issue which prevented them from developing this game during its release date of 2011 and now they're back to finish the job with a dlc etc... The community and I heard nothing since that annoucement was made, which made us wonder if there was really any intention to revive the game.  No reply was given with questions on the discussion board, I think somebody emailed them and still no answer.\n\nI believe I bought the game in 2015 for $3, I found 1 servers  being occupied by 2 or 3 other people during that time but as of right now I only play with one person that I added from the discussion board which is rare. You can purchase it, add me and some other people from the discussion board to play it but it won't be often.\n","May 2","false","12.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bagonuts/recommended/43190/","Bagonuts","Scarzzypan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bagonuts/","477 products in account","This game has been quite the mix of feelings for me. On the one hand it's good for some laughs, the weapons get progressivly more awesome the more you upgrade them and the Demonizer gamemode is pretty cool when you want to just be a giant jerk and summon minions on your former teammates should you die or kill yourself (much like I do just to summon junk). On the other hand, the laughs start to fade after about 15 minutes, it's very repetitive and the game knows exactly when and where to become an absolutly evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about everything.\n\nThis game heavily focuses on teamwork (Teamwork being the key word) and at times, almost demands you to play with others as opposed with playing solo which would be ok if it wasn't for the fact that:\n\n1. playing on your own is both boring and tedious and\n\n2. there's no one to help you whatsoever should things go wrong and odds are, they probably will.\n\nThat's not to say that playing solo is entirely bad. If that's your thing, you go right ahead and do it, but be prepared for a letdown the further in you go. That being said however, this game actually gets fun the more friends you play it with (God knows how many times I've laughed with each Character's catchphrases like a madman since I like each of them and their dialogs) and allows you to keep playing for longer without that droning feeling. Unfortunatly, that requires 4 seperate friends with 4 seperate copies who may not even want to get this in the first place, so shelling up for a 4-Pack to enjoy this game starts feeling like less of a choice and more of a demand.\n\nAs for Characters, I do like them all as I've said before. Each one comes with "kill phrases" that they blurt out everytime they gib a demon or pick up something very deadly to use.\n\nAll in all, for the current price it is (Note: this was written at the time the price dropped by 75% in the Autumn 2013 sales), it's good for some laughs, some fun and messing around in general. For the full price? I'm sorry but that's asking for too much for what this is.\n\nBuy this only if you really want it and it's on offer, simply put.","November 29, 2013","false","7.6"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gankdalf/recommended/43190/","gankdalf","Gankdalf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gankdalf/","229 products in account","The Haunted: Hells Reach is a fast-paced survival fps made in Unreal Engine 3. You fight massive waves of enemies in a Killing floor-esque style of gameplay but in Hells Reach it feels a lot harder because enemies move faster and some have special abilities to help bring you down. In Killing Floor you often hunker down with your teammates in a choke point while in The Haunted: Hells Reach doing so normally means you all die. Sticking together & constantly moving is the key to winning here. Seperating from your team is basically suicide in the later stages when the waves have more unit variety & more aggressive enemies.\n\nThere's 12 weapons and 6 types of explosives. Each time you kill an enemy with a weapon that weapon gains experience. Each weapon can be upgraded five times and for each time you upgrade it, it changes. For example; the handgun turns into the burst pistol, vendetta revolver, akimbo handguns, akimbo burst pistols and lastly akimbo vendetta revolvers. Depending on what type of enemies you will encounter on a map it will pay off upgrading a certain weapon that you know is effective against said enemy. The ammo is limited so you have to make each shot count. Enemies will drop new ammo at random.\n\nThere is 8 maps, 9 if you count the boss level. Each map has a nice design and special layout that enables different tactics to defeat the waves of enemies you encounter. The maps each have special weather events that make it harder to survive. On Forsaken Canyon there's a thunderstorm for example. It obstructs your sight and random thunderbolts hit the ground. If you get hit you get stunned for a short time. During the time of the thunderstorm you should try to stay away from open areas - which makes it a lot harder to survive against some enemies.\n\nThere's 10 different types of enemy minions & 4 player controlled characters in the game - Caleb, Bruce, Hector & Jacob. In multiplayer they get chosen at random & they do not have any individual special abilities.\n\nIn my personal opinion I think that this was a really fun game to play cooperatively with friends. It's extremely actionpacked & brutal. Like most games in this genre it does get repetative and dull after a while but if you & your friends are looking for a game to play together for a few nights then I'd definitely recommend it. Is it worth the current price of 15€ though? 10€ perhaps. Wait for it to be on sale.","December 23, 2014","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gankdalf/recommended/43190/","gankdalf","Gankdalf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gankdalf/","229 products in account","The Haunted: Hells Reach is a fast-paced survival fps made in Unreal Engine 3. You fight massive waves of enemies in a Killing floor-esque style of gameplay but in Hells Reach it feels a lot harder because enemies move faster and some have special abilities to help bring you down. In Killing Floor you often hunker down with your teammates in a choke point while in The Haunted: Hells Reach doing so normally means you all die. Sticking together & constantly moving is the key to winning here. Seperating from your team is basically suicide in the later stages when the waves have more unit variety & more aggressive enemies.\n\nThere's 12 weapons and 6 types of explosives. Each time you kill an enemy with a weapon that weapon gains experience. Each weapon can be upgraded five times and for each time you upgrade it, it changes. For example; the handgun turns into the burst pistol, vendetta revolver, akimbo handguns, akimbo burst pistols and lastly akimbo vendetta revolvers. Depending on what type of enemies you will encounter on a map it will pay off upgrading a certain weapon that you know is effective against said enemy. The ammo is limited so you have to make each shot count. Enemies will drop new ammo at random.\n\nThere is 8 maps, 9 if you count the boss level. Each map has a nice design and special layout that enables different tactics to defeat the waves of enemies you encounter. The maps each have special weather events that make it harder to survive. On Forsaken Canyon there's a thunderstorm for example. It obstructs your sight and random thunderbolts hit the ground. If you get hit you get stunned for a short time. During the time of the thunderstorm you should try to stay away from open areas - which makes it a lot harder to survive against some enemies.\n\nThere's 10 different types of enemy minions & 4 player controlled characters in the game - Caleb, Bruce, Hector & Jacob. In multiplayer they get chosen at random & they do not have any individual special abilities.\n\nIn my personal opinion I think that this was a really fun game to play cooperatively with friends. It's extremely actionpacked & brutal. Like most games in this genre it does get repetative and dull after a while but if you & your friends are looking for a game to play together for a few nights then I'd definitely recommend it. Is it worth the current price of 15€ though? 10€ perhaps. Wait for it to be on sale.","December 23, 2014","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

THHR is pure adrenaline and doesn't let up.  You are constantly on the go, evading and killing, destroying stones as well as saving your fallen comrades before their souls are stolen.  Don't stand around to long or you'll quickly end up dead as the enemies are constantly spawning in all directions.  Grade A super fast paced and frantic...that's why I like it!  :-).  Don't know why this game wasn't more popular at first release a few years back and it's a shame it was never further developed. Perhaps it was the frantic pace of the game some didn't like.  It's a real gem IMO though especially if you like teamwork oriented gameplay.     THHR is on par with Killing Floor as far as fun factor goes with lots of different enemies and weapons.  The upgrade system during matches keeps you smiling as well.. P.S.

The physics of the rag dolls can be HILARIOUS\n2. It is a survival of waves game\n3. There are awesome explosions and lots of blood squirting action!\n4. You can gain the holy grail of points\n5. On medium with two people is a challange, on hard it is nearly impossible (super awesome!)\n6. There is an achivement called Falcon Punch- Who doesn't want to get Falcon Punch?\n7. Playing Solo can also be fun!\n8.  You get to easily upgrade your weapons.\n9. There is a gernade launcher\n10. The reviews this game has gotten doesn't honestly do it justice.\n\nMy thoughts? I got this game maybe two days ago and have easily put close to 4 hours of playtime into it already.  It is great for a mindless action game that helps to waste time and have fun with friends. I say get it!~","January 31, 2013","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When was the time you played a 3rd person shooter/beat-em-up on the PC? This game keeps it old school. No story, no character progression, no rpg elements, no classes. Basically take everything that was fused into the shooter genre in the last couple of years (perks,rpg elements,xp) and toss it out of the window. 8 stunning levels, 4 modes and hundreds of demons to kill with a combat system that fuses melee moves and shooting in an excellent blend. Liu Kang kick and a shot to the chest from a double barrel? Check. Chuck Norris roundhouse and a hail of bullets from dual uzis? Check. And all that topped with dedicated servers for multi, a level editor and millions of buckets full of blood.

Equip wjich gun you want to upgrade (i always pick the pistol first, but its 100% your choice) and pick the box up. Then BAM you have a better pistol, shotgun or assault rifle! (whichever you chose) I love the creature designas well, its SO refreshing to see NEW ideas, that haven't been used before.
