Rotating the pieces is incredibly awkward. The UI is tiny. The puzzles have only one solution by giving you only the necessary pieces to use.\nI highly recommend Prelogate if you think this game might be for you. It has achievements, and you can finish levels in different ways with challenges (least pieces used, least space travelled by lasers, and one other I think).","April 17, 2015","false","0.1"," 63 of 73 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","63","73","2","14"

The mechanics are basic, match the lasers to their corresponding outputs. However, it also involves a mechanic for combining colors into a single stream and then separating that stream back into its original colors. This is heavily involved in the levels. There are 60 puzzles that start out simple, but soon become slightly more difficult, but all are fairly quick. Some even appear to be created by players, which is really neat. The levels took me 2.2 hours to complete. There is also a level editor, although from my little experience looking at it, it is unclear if you are able to share levels. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles, especially minimalist ones, as that is exactly what the game provides.","May 19, 2015","true","5.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
