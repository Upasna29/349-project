Just cutting gameplay and other mechanical elements out at random won’t do; it really requires surgical precision. And yet, Orangepixel pulls it off so well with Heroes of Loot they make it look effortless.\n\nHeroes of Loot, at its most basic, is what happens when a game like Gauntlet is combined with Roguelike elements. The four adventurers (Elf, Warrior, Wizard, and Valkyrie) are in it for the money and not much else. Once players select their character, it’s on to adventure! Or in this case something akin to an arcade dungeon crawl. Randomized dungeons, quests, and special items make an appearance along with permadeath, but it’s all been streamlined to the point that dying is merely a temporary setback.\n\nThe most miraculous thing about Heroes of Loot’s simplicity is that Orangepixel managed to trim the fat but kept all the fun intact. Not only that, but they seem to have made the fun even more fun. Running through the halls and chucking weapons at enemies is incredibly quick and twitchy, but the controls never get in the way because characters will automatically target whatever enemy is closest to them. On its own, something like this could start to become dull but thanks to the occasional quest room, complete with random quests, there’s always some sort of goal to strive for. Aside from the mass destruction of a dungeon's ecosystem, I mean.\n\nThe second most miraculous thing about Heroes of Loot is that pretty much any complaint that could be leveled at it has already been addressed. Stages are big enough to enjoy a bit of exploration/enemy hunting but small enough that they don’t require any sort of mini-map. The RPG elements never get in the way of the gameplay, but they make a difference with a character’s increased strength and improved weapons. Shops only ever sell one item, and it’s random, so there’s no real pressure to save up for anything in particular so players can focus on the adventuring. Virtually every single aspect of the game has been designed to compliment the core gameplay, and it’s a spectacularly impressive feat.\n\nAnd Heroes of Loot has a gorgeous style. The pixel-art is nice enough, but the way the game carries itself is just sublime – from the short and genuinely hilarious “cutscenes,” to the rousing soundtrack, the fun characters, and the silly dialogue, it’s very much a neat package if ever I’ve seen one.\n\nI’m not so naive as to think that Heroes of Loot will appeal to everybody. However I believe it will pull in both dungeon-crawling fanatics and twin-stick obsessives in equal measure, with its fast-paced, randomly-generated action. You’ll never reach the end of the dungeon, but you’ll have plenty of fun trying to find it.","September 29, 2015","true","16.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","20","21","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/qcxv/recommended/359280/","qcxv","Glypha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/qcxv/","982 products in account","Heroes of Loot is an easy, distilled crossover between dungeon crawler and twin-stick shooter.\n\nTwin-stick shooters often lack RPG development, and dungeon crawlers often lack interesting combat mechanics. The two seem to make an adorable couple, and do entertain initially. There are about a dozen or so types of bad guys to attack, each having their own mechanics, a handful of heroes to choose from with somewhat different characteristics. Items and leveling give a simple but surprisingly effective RPG depth if you aren't looking for any story element other than "explore dungeon and kill". There are secret areas containing extra loot and a quest giver who also delivers upon completion of killing a certain number of a type of villain in a time period.\n\nThe twin-stick shooter within the corridors of a dungeon is a bit unusual at first, and I would prefer some more traditionally twin-stick open areas. The typical level's hardest moment is at the beginning of the level where you spawn within reasonable distance of a flurry of baddies. Once you get a handle on that initial attack, the level geometry usually means there isn't much issue after that and clearing the level is easy. This ease only increases as you stock up on the games small number of items, and reach higher levels. Eventually, you faceroll everything.\n\nThe game is enjoyable as it is, but I'd like to see more variety in terms of the levels themselves, as well as boss battles, which are conspicuously absent. There is no satisfying ending as you push through levels that eventually become easier and easier.\n\nDespite the scaling issue with dungeon and player level, and the lack of variety of levels/monsters, the game is enjoyable and well made. These limitations do reduce replay value, however, and perhaps expectations as to hours spend in this game should be kept low. For the low price of the title, the length of gameplay is reasonable.\n\nA key was given by the developer for review purposes to the Original Curator Group, with whom this review is affiliated.","February 13","true","3.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","1"

I don't think mobile gaming is completely evil and should be sent back to where it came from. To be fair there is plenty to dislike. Microtransactions and other cash grabs. However I still think this is the future of gaming. Getting your game into as many peoples hands as you can isn't a bad idea.\nHeroes of Loot was born on the mobile market and sailed its way to computer gaming shores. The trip has been rough with some bugs and the natives were less then welcoming. Nonetheless Heroes of Loot does have some really fun gameplay and neat features. Unlocking dungeon aspects through progress is brilliant. You unlock new monsters, traps, quests and perhaps some secrets as you play more and more. Slaughtering thousands of enemies like games of old. This all works very well.\nThe problem I found is the core gameplay itself becomes predictable. The AI is kinda dumb. The lack of magical variation/drops makes the Wizard class weaker. Collecting loot is mostly moot with health pieces laying everywhere. Other items like the shield and invisibility cloak are short lived. It just feels like while Heroes of Loot was spectacular and a great accomplishment for the one man team of Orangepixel on the mobile market. Heroes of Loot is a bit short when not in its native land. Despite this, I had fun with Heroes of Loot. It was a fun distraction for 5-6 hours of my life. Killing thousands of enemies and finding all the secret hidden bits was what kept me going. Watching my weapons grow was also vastly entertaining. I wish they had done more of that. Great pixel artwork and use of shadows should be mentioned. With a good base price and even better on sale.\nGrab this game if your a fan of slaughtering mindlessly for hours.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/EwoA4APnefc\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","May 30, 2015","true","4.8"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSquirrel/recommended/359280/","HSquirrel","HalfSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSquirrel/","66 products in account","Heroes of Loot is a very basic roguelike with dungeon crawler elements, where your goal is to progress through the various levels of the game. You fight increasingly difficult monsters along the way, ranging from little skulls that will barely hurt you to long range fiery monsters that will be your doom on many-a-run. This game was ported from mobile devices, and while it may be a fun game to play on your phones and tablets, it does not meet the standards for a PC game.\n\nThe settings are very simple and do not allow you to control much. To start off, the few options available are not very clear. They have unusual icons, that You can’t control the overall volume of sounds and music, and both of these are extremely loud by default. You have to turn it off entirely to get rid of it, which kills the point of having a soundtrack placed in your game. PC games need volume sliders or whatever it might be to control the exact volume of the noise, because many PC gamers may have other audio playing while playing games and you may want to make certain things louder than others. There is the volume mixer, but sometimes there isn’t enough space on that to make it the appropriate volume and honestly, add a volume slider if you’re going to being making games on PC.\n\nThe font has proven to be quite confusing at times. When learning the controls, the messages popping up can be confusing for certain letters, like ‘O’ and ‘D’. These can be easily misread, which makes the controls very confusing and this quite simply shouldn’t happen in games. The font should be very clear, and while it should suit the game and not just be a fancy cursive font all the time, every letter should still be clear and distinguishable to make all the text fully legible.\n\nWhen you first play the game, as you get farther, the difficulty of the game will automatically increase and more difficult monsters will be introduced to the game.This is an interesting concept, but in my opinion it doesn’t work with roguelike gameplay. You should be able to choose your own difficulty whenever you want. This is a vital aspect that makes the game progressively more difficult, and stay that way even when you’re starting a run. Sometimes the scaling can be very steep, and you will start fine but then get pummeled on even the very next floors. The automatic difficulty increase makes it so you can’t control how hard the game is, and can be very frustrating.\n\nThe classes in this game all play very similarly. Of course there are differences, and they are quite apparent in terms of actual character stats and the stat increases as you level up, but generally the play style for all of the classes is quite the same. Classes with shorter range are much more difficult to use, and classes with lower damage are for the most part useless. Classes with higher magic can keep spells going for longer, but spells are mostly uncontrollable in this game, making it pretty useless. As soon as you get a spell it activates, and they aren’t even very common so having a high magic stat will not be very beneficial most of the time.\n\nThe PC controls can be very inconvenient at times, even with the 2 separate sets of options. The standard WASD is available, which is fine, but the arrow key controls are entirely useless because they are so difficult to use. If you don’t like WASD and you want to use the arrow keys anyways, you should be able to customize these controls in the settings, which is also unavailable because of how little you can control in the settings.\n\nOne of the most annoying aspects of this game is that the auto-fire, which in my opinion is a core aspect of this game to truly make it unique and honestly more fun to play from the get-go, doesn’t work properly. You can press any of the given auto-fire buttons (I believe it’s X and A) and it will fire, but it won’t always continuously shoot as it should and you have to keep holding it down to get it to aim and fire properly. On my first runs, the auto-fire would keep firing after I pressed the button once, which was as an auto-fire should be, but later it stopped doing this and I had to hold the button down to get it to aim, which is extremely inconvenient given the control scheme for this game and the other buttons you need to press to play the game.\n\nThe quests in this game, which you can get by entering the rooms that will sometimes show up on the level, are very badly made. It will give you a random quest to either kill monsters, collect a certain type of money or save friends, but sometimes these quests are impossible because the type of monster you need to kill can only be found on much deeper floors or much higher floors so you can’t find enough of them, or the time period is simply too short to be able to find enough of the item given the size of each floor. The quests should always be completable, and since you’re given a time limit, the game should give you quests based off amounts of certain enemies and items that you will be able to find on your current and upcoming floors.\n\nThe graphics are exactly what you’d expect for a game ported from mobile devices, and while it’s not that bad for a roguelike game, I wouldn’t say it’s quite up to par. It’s cute and everything is very pixelated, which is generally a normal thing for roguelike games, but some things are a bit too pixelated and unclear as to what the shape is supposed to be. This isn’t the worst aspect of the game, and doesn’t really affect gameplay too much, but it’s worth mentioning to anyone who finds graphics to be very important.\n\nOverall, this game is quite simply not worth your money. You may be able to get a couple hours of mild fun out of it, but in the end it doesn’t seem worth getting, even when it’s on sale. Playing a short 2 hours of this game, I found far too many flaws for my liking to continue playing and it was just far too annoying and boring to keep going. With so many flaws and things that haven’t been looked into after the porting of the game, it’s not worth the money you spend on it and the little space it takes up on your hard drive.","July 1, 2015","false","2.1"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","24","38","0","1"

While the game is a mobile port and not a lot of complexity is expected, the game falls into predictably rather quickly, and there's just not enough variety to hold your attention over a period of time. In a crowded genre at this point, and even if it's a cheaper game, you've got to stand out in some way, and the only way this game stands out is the OrangePixel specific art style, but that doesn't help the game over the long hall. Too many long hallways waitiing for enemies to die to your constant spam, and you'll feel like you're doing way too much of the same. This may work for the mobile platform, but it doesn't work on the PC release, as there's just too many other options to spend your time with then this.\n\nFor More Gameplay and First Impressions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9lohqGLIGw\n+:\nCharacters have slight differences (key word slight).\nThe art style keeps the style of Orangepixel games and does work in that sense.\nGood humor and “cutscenes”\n-:\nCombat really needed variety. Things become rather the same rather quickly, and you'll be doing the same thing over and over again. This hurts the game rather badly. Too repetitive.\nCharacters with exp/strength feel like they have a lot more benefits then the magic nature due to the item drops having magic be reliant on item pick ups.\nToo many small corridors for the gameplay. Causes horrible bottlenecking, slowing down gameplay.\nEnemies needed a bit more AI or smarts to them. It's really simple and just go right for you.\nHonestly, when it comes down to it, it's boring.","May 26, 2015","false","4.4"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","17","29","3","10"

For example it has mouse support, which doesn't add as much as I'd hoped. If you keep the mouse still for a second the old auto-aim and auto-fire kick in, wasting your powerups.\nWhat bothers me most is that the game doesn't tell you how basic gameplay mechanics work.\nThe dev says it's part of the fun, but in my opinion it's frustrating, because gameplay mechanics are buggy and inconsistent so you never know what's intended behavior and what's a bug.\n\nFor example I had a health-regen potion that lasted me for 15 or 17 dungeons. And then suddenly it was gone without a warning. The screen is waaaay to busy to notice something like that.\n\nEnemy projectiles are nearly invisible (some actually are!). At some point you will encounter an enemy that rushed towards you as soon as you enter a dungeon and kills you within 1.5 second. No idea what to do there. Some goodies are way OP, some work for 0,1 second so are quite UP. Everything seems very unbalanced. Good for a browser flash game, but for 6 euro's I expected more of a game that followed some of the unwritten rules of game-design\n\nOh yeah like all dungeon pixel games it requires lots of luck. Don't get good loot or do-able dungeons? Try again :) But that's the norm nowadays and that's cool. There are also some bugs, like some monsters can hit you 20 times a second without doing an attack and the ram-thing that comes out the wall shouldn't damage you when it stopped moving, but sometimes that also damages you 20 times/second. If you get hit at that speed you don't hear yourself getting hit either, so you might not notice it before you're dead.\n\nI wish I would have just gotten the 3 times cheaper similar android version. Then I would have thought I would have gotten my money's worth. On the pc though... Meh, it's a fun game to waste 10 minutes on... But I could also play ROTMG which has consistent gameplay and doesn't kill you with bugs.","May 27, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I got this game off Indie Game Stand when it was featured for a 4 day deal. With that in mind, let’s get to the quick. I only recommend this game to the most hardcore of arcade twin stick shooter fans. I say that because this is an endless game. Usually, endless games don’t bug me, in fact I love them. I did grow up when arcades were still a thing and played games like Centipede, Ms. Pac-Man and Space Invaders, but this game has so much going on, yet at the same time so...little.\n\nI say that because while the action can get frantic, there isn’t enough variance in character customization or enemy variance. I could had been spoiled by the likes of The Binding of Isaac Rebirth for being the first twin stick shooter I actually enjoyed. This games shops were a joke (only one item, and only the Lens of Truth and Shields were worth getting at most times), the damage you did didn’t seem to scale (and if it did, it was so minor I never noticed unless I was using a Rune of Fire), the enemies never did anything too insane, and the only times I died was when I got bored of everything and didn’t pay attention because the game failed to keep me engaged.\n\nAgain, it MIGHT be the Isaac thing, but this game didn’t keep me and I tried to give it a shot. I’m glad I found it on Indie Game Stand because had I purchased this at full price, I’d be a lot more bitter. Grab it now from that place, or wait for a sale DO NOT pay full price:\nhttps://indiegamestand.com/deal/","August 26, 2015","false","3.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

And even though it is quite entertaining for a few hours, some things it lacks and others it does poorly, combined with a hefty price for what it offers makes this a difficult game to recommend.\n\nThe Pros:Auto-Attack - You can manually aim with the mouse, but if you want to stand a chance in later levels, you should take advantage of the auto-attack feature. While pressing X, the character will automatically decide what to attack. This allows you to focus on your movement and dodging your opponents.\n\nCute Graphics - The creatures look very friendly and the entire dungeon is brightly colored and the sprites are cutely animated. Pixel graphics are something to be expected from this genre, and this game handled it pretty well in my opinion.\n\nRandomnly Generated Dungeons - Each level is randomly generated so you won't feel too bored when replaying it. There are also hidden rooms you can find to get treasure and bonuses.\n\nMonster Mash - This game features a reduced number of monster types, but spams them incontrolably in the later levels, so assuming you don't die from all of that, killing a screenful of monsters is very satisfying.\nThe ConsDifficuty Unbalance - The first playthrough will be the easiest, as you increase the dungeon difficulty alongside your level. When you die, you can only start from the beginning, at level 1, but the dungeon will stay high level. This will proove to be a challenge, but at least it has an upside - you will level up faster and get a chance to even the game.\n\nCharacter Choice - You have 5 characters to choose from, and one of them is an unlockable. Their performance varies, but the way you pay is exactly the same. Not that much of a big deal. You're probably best off sticking with the ranger, though.\n\nShop and Quest System - In an attempt to make it more RPG, on certain occasions you will stumble across shop and quest doors. At the shop you are allowed to decide if you want to buy an item or not... an item. You don't have an inventory to choose from. As for the quests, they are very poorly made, as you are given a (usually too short) time to kill # monsters or collect # items or rescue # people. And the rewards are also neglectable.\n\nMenu Navigation - Speaking of lame menus, the controls are awful. Pressing [Esc] will take you to a pause menu, where you can also see your inventory. Intuition tells you that if you press it again, you will return to the game. Nope. It takes you to the main menu, and when you continue, it resets the current level you were in (randomised). To actually continue, you need to press [X]. Its says it onscreen, but come on... Just.. Why?\nConclusionFor mobile, I think this would be an excellent time killer while you're waiting for something, and it's quite fun for a few hours. But after that it becomes boring and tedious to play, and given the very large price tag asked for this kind of game, considering its features, or lack thereof, makes me unable to recommend this to any paying customer.","August 28, 2015","false","5.8"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","1"

It starts promising, but you'll quickly realize every class plays the same, except that some have a higher magic/attack stat.  Magic is nigh-useless as it is so unfocused, so the stat is as well.\n\nIn theory the gameplay would revolve around dodging projectiles and shooting enemies, but you're either stuck in corriders too small to move in, thus robbed of the ability to dodge, or in open rooms so full of enemies you'd never even know there WAS a projectile, let alone dodge one.  So you just move erratically while auto-firing and hope for the best.\n\nI like the small humourous interludes, they are rather cute.","October 18, 2015","false","3.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Visually it is decent for one of these retro pixel games, but either it does not ever get difficult or the difficulty ramps up too slowly.  I played about 2-3 hours, cleared 48 dungeons without ever really feeling in danger of dying, and got bored of playing it.  Its lack of difficulty and repetitive nature was not enough to keep me stimulated or entertained for long.","November 28, 2015","false","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As with many other RLs when you reach new depths, you encounter new challenges. This game twists that by then introducing those baddies to you earlier in game on your NEXT run throughs. Essentially, your unlocks are a greater challenge.\n\nGameplay is okay, and will only last a few hours. I found myself cruising along until a single slip caused near instant death. Despite the frantic nature of the game, gameplay felt more preventive than reactive.\n\nGrab this one for a fiver if you want some dual-stick RL action for a couple of evenings.","May 27, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A great choice of heroes to play as, enemies have various challenges to conquer and each playthrough is satisfying and unique with responsive controls. There's good challenge without being frustrating or unfair, and while it is described as a rogue-like there's no rage-quitting involved...which is nice. I'm really glad I stumbled upon this game...like the simple joys in life, this was a pleasant surprize and always adds a smile to my face when playing. There's a Heroes of Loot 2 that's just been released, and has some really cool additions to the gameplay of this one...which can be better appreciated by trying this game...both games really are a lot of fun to play!","May 29","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
