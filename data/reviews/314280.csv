I will leave my original under this slight update.\n\nThe game has definitely had some improvements, like the monsters aren't immediately in your face and guns do a bit more damage. You can actually take them down in a single clip. However, it's still not much better. I actually had more issues this time around.\n\nMy character would be in a state of 'falling' while on the ground, so I couldn't pick up ammo or items I came across, until after 30 seconds of jumping and crouching like crazy he decided to actually plant his feet on the ground. This also meant I could not shoot or reload. It happened in most rooms I went into. Bad luck, I guess.\n\nAnother issue I ran into was game breaking, although it wasn't really a bug so much as a bad design choice. I was being gang banged by 3 of them in a hallway, they got me down to low health so I used a health kit, and succeeded in killing them. Then I saved. Big mistake, because apparently if your health is at 3 or 4 ticks, you start to bleed out. So that means when I saved, I ♥♥♥♥ed myself because I only live for about 8 seconds after loading it, then I bleed out and die, with no health kits around.\n\nEverything else is the same. Although they did remove a note at the very start that had pewdiepie on it, and made it into something with a few tips for new players. A nice gesture.\n\n-------------\n*Original July 17th review\n\nWarning: This game is literally made for all the "Pewdiepie" people out there. AHH JUMP SCARE SO SCARY I CAN'T PLAY THIS.\n\nThis game is ♥♥♥♥. No big surprise there, right? It's not awful because it's a mod built on Source, or anything like that. The game works, and controls just fine. The audio and graphics are typical of source games, so again, it's fine. Now lemme get into why I think it's awful.\n\nThe beginning doesn't really give you any direction, or any sort of story. You're thrown into your office, and just left there. You can do a 'quest' where you get this dude his lunch, but it doesn't do anything. You pick it up, plop it in front of him, and he just stares at it. Cool. Awesome. Whatever.\n\nThe voice acting is, as expected, absolute trash. Some people pronounce the protagonists name as "Grobunska", while others say "Grobuskna". I really didn't expect anything amazing from the voice acting.\n\nAfter you leave the police station, and get to the game game, you realize quickly the 'horror' is based around jump scares. There's also spooooooky sound effects that are taken directly from the source engine, and it's really easy to tell they are just background noise. Stuff that just loops to give the illusion of horror.\n\nAfter that are the enemies. Combat in a horror game is really hard to do correctly. You can't be too overpowered, or else it's just an action game, and if you're too weak, there's no point to having combat, unless it is to slow the enemy down. This game kinda falls into the latter, except it wants to force you to fight. At a distance with a gun, yeah, I guess it's not too bad. It takes a ♥♥♥♥ ton of bullets to take down an enemy which makes sense, maybe like 10 pistol rounds. Ammo is pretty abundant though. The real issue though, comes from close quarters, as is usually the case. But in this case, it's awful. Dare I say....broken? An enemy hits you, and makes your camera jerk around, so it's impossible to shoot it. Okay, but what about the melee weapon? Same thing, impossible to hit with them while being hit, and the melee weapons do ♥♥♥♥ damage. Plus, for a short after you are hit, you can't sprint, and move slower than a snail. So, there's no way to kill it, and no way to escape from it, unless you get really lucky with a few shots, or the enemy happens to get stuck on stuff.  90% of the time, you are stuck in a small room with the enemy, so the distance is closed within a second, then begins the head jerking till death. Honestly, ammo should have been very, very scarce, but does more damage.\n\nBut hey, it's a free game, so it's fine right? Not really. Free doesn't mean it gets a free pass on being ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It just means you didn't waste any money buying it, just wasted your time. So, it's a typical 20XX horror game. Jump scares all the time, without any actual horror. It's a waste of 3.9 GB's.\n\n*EDIT* If the game gets patched, I will be more than willing to revise this review. This is meant purely as constructive criticism, not an insult to the game developer(s), despite how it may seem, starting off by calling it '♥♥♥♥'. The world desperately needs good horror games, and support after release is always welcome.","July 17, 2014","false","2.5"," 607 of 709 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","607","709","0","33"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorYeshua/recommended/314280/","DoctorYeshua","Doctor Yeshua","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorYeshua/","32 products in account","Honestly, I saw someone write a 'review' and they didn't explain anything, just said it was awful, but 'good for a free game.' Hearing this simply made me curious. Why did he say that everything was awful but good for a free game? So, I decided to play and actually take notes. Well, I played about an hour of it, and then I quit. Here's a list of the problems I found with the game.\n1): Missing textures. If I'm downloading your game, please provide all the textures. It really removes from the atmosphere when I have missing texture here and there.\n2): Controls. They're not bad, but I was stuck in the beginning because ‘F’ was the Use key, instead of the traditional ‘E’ key. I know that’s not really a problem, but an explanation would have been nice. Sure, it did tell you, after you left the room, which requires you to figure it out first. Little late, thanks. While we’re on controls, the car was absolutely terrible. I flipped the car on accident, and the brake is so horribly done. Could use for some fixing.  Plus, there’s no need to go /that/ fast in this game.\n3): Achievements: I got the Slenderman Achievement, and I don’t even know how. This could just be me, but I looked at a gramophone and hit F, and got it. Did I miss Slenderman, or what?\n4): Stephano was in it. Clearly this is directed at PewDiePie, but I saw a ‘collected 1/3’ pop up, and even though I’m not a fan, I’m also not against him in any way, but I don’t want to have PewDiePie literally shoved into my face when I’m playing a game. Maybe have it in game, but don’t make it a side mission or anything.\n5): Invisible boarders. You had a perfectly fine set up with the entire area surrounded in a log fence, but people can get over those and walk into an invisible wall, which is terrible. Simple put the invisible wall where the log fences are, and then I wouldn’t have gotten my car stuck on the fence.\n6): Animations could use some work. Swimming animation looks really awkward, there’s no animation when you’re driving outside of the tires moving. I.E. Character doesn’t turn the steering wheel, or react at all.\n7): There were several areas where lights were being emitted with no source.\n8): More than half of the notes didn’t have voice acting while some did. This is just odd, either do voice acting for all of them, or none.\n9): Monsters did not feel threatening at all. They shook around when they ran towards you or stood still like they were from Cry of Fear or something. This was far more annoying than threatening or scary. Speaking of monsters, confronting them was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. If two of them got close enough to you, you’re more than likely dead. This doesn’t make them threatening, this makes them annoying.\n10): There were grammar issues, but I don’t really care that much.\n11): The Bolt cutters worked weird. Cut the chain, and the basement doors broke… What?\n12): When loading for the next stage there’s a chance of running into a bug. You’re ported to the other side of the door, and once in a while the game just sticks you there, and forgets to load, leaving you stuck.\n13): So many unnecessary transitions between rooms. The maps not loading anything new, it’s just porting me to the other side of the door.  Opening the door would have been easier.\n14): Unrealistic use for TNT. You DO NOT use TNT just to open a freaking door made of four to five planks of ♥♥♥♥ wood! I had a sledge hammer that could have easily broken the door, and yet I wasted TNT to blow it up. Why?! I could have saved that and used it for something more constructive, creative, or useful! Absolutely terrible, not to mention, I wrote nearly half of that before the TNT exploded. It took forever to go off.\n15): There were way too many loading screens. I felt like I was waiting more than I was playing.\n16): Why was there multiple choice answers/questions? From what I saw nothing was changing up, and it kept going back until I clicked all of them. A cut scene, sure that works, but having me click the questions/answers until all were done was pointless and time wasting.\nI’m sure there’s a lot more, but honestly, there was just so much terrible crap going on that I just couldn’t keep playing, wasn’t worth the hardware space. Not worth it, not even if it’s free.","November 7, 2014","false","1.1"," 338 of 387 people (87%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","87","338","387","43","21"

Mild spoilers.\n\nI have no idea what's happening storywise.\nThe enemies look ridiculous and are hard to beat unless you can pre-empt them.\nYour character's name changes subtly with every person who tries to pronounce it.\nThere is a strong possibility you'll drop a lung laughing at the jump scares.\nIt tries to imitate Slenderman by using what I can only assume is a Source version of ET, and even then they fail to have it chase you.\nAnd I'm pretty sure I missed an item I need in an area I'm now locked out of.\nI got killed by an exploding chest with a russian man dancing on it while "who let the dogs out" played until I quit.\nPuzzles include tilting a Hitler painting to move a bookcase, but only AFTER some enemies have appeared, and articulation of this idea is totally non-existent.\nOne puzzle requires a circular saw. There is a circular saw in the room, but you can't use it for whatever reason. You need one from somewhere else.\nYou will lose contact with the floor and get stuck in jump animation loops when walking over objects like "newspaper" and "stairs"\nOne of the bosses appear twice because... I'm not sure.\nThe rest of the bosses are poorly explained, or just dumb.\nSome enemies are spawned next to doors. These enemies will absorb 15 rounds from the MP-40, but down you with 3-4 knife hits.\nYou will never, ever, pick up the ammo in front of you first.

Not sure if it's there at all, actually.\nFinal boss sucks. Not sure you can even call it a boss.\nYou can't enter the final area until you do some convoluted ♥♥♥♥ to turn the lights on because "it's dark down there". I was holding a torch.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/recommended/314280/","Official_KwS","KidwithSmurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/","827 products in account","I was recommended to play this by Steam and as it was a Horror and Free to Play I decided to check it out. As it was Free to Play, I went into it with the mindset that it may not be too good. Therefore, I am going to explain what I thought of it below and if it is worth playing in my opinion.\n\nGameplay:\n\nPros:\n\n♦ Playable\n♦ Realistic Running Energy (Can only run for x amount of time before having to regenerate)\n♦ Good number of weapons to find and use (This keeps the game interesting)\n♦ Decent length for what the game is (Can take a long time if you keep dying due to the poor enemy spawn locations, the difficultness to kill them and the limited save locations)\n\nCons:\n\n♦ The story was very hard to follow and unclear\n♦ The notes seemed to be randomly placed and make no sense as to why they are placed where they are\n♦ Walking on some areas, objects and items causes you to lose gravity and get stuck to the roof making your character move really slow (Jumping a lot fixes this, but is annoying in the first place)\n♦ Jump Scares were non-existent (There were some but really “Changing Screen Colour and shaking it randomly isn’t scary)\n♦ The “TNT” was glitched (You had to collect 3 pieces located in the dungeon, however if you loaded a save, went through a door where it loaded and you came back, you could pick up the first piece again and it would say you had 2/3 pieces. This was in fact not the case as you only still had 1 piece as you hadn’t found and collected the other pieces located in the dungeon)\n♦ Enemies randomly spawn in the most annoying places (They randomly spawn to try and scare you, which is good… Although, they spawn in places you can’t really escape from easily. This is annoying as it takes a high amount of ammo to kill one enemy and if two or more have spawned near you, it’s really hard to survive. Along with this, if an enemy hits you, your screen shakes making it almost impossible to get an accurate hit on them and it takes them a lot less hits to kill you than it does you to kill them)\n♦ Enemies easily kill you where it takes you a long time to kill them\n♦ If an enemy has attacked you, sometimes (Not sure if everytime), you’ll start to bleed (This is bad as you’ve probably used your health kit in the fight already and then just walk around bleeding and most likely will die)\n♦ Saves are few and far between (Due to the hardness of actually killing an enemy and the easiness of them killing you, this is terrible. You’ll spend a long time walking round finding things and doing the puzzles only to die and end half an hour back and have to redo everything only to hope not to die again)\n♦ Only allowed one health kit at a time (This is annoying as if you have been saving up health and see another kit, you can’t make use of it)\n♦ Repetitive (I mentioned decent length, but due to dying a lot and few save locations, you will have to repeat yourself over and over again)\n♦ At times it’s hard to know what to do (But it’s pretty easy to figure out if you just search around and use your inventory items, but there should be more story as to what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, some things just don’t make sense)\n♦ 0% Scariness (No real jump scares or horror scenes)\n\nGraphics:\nPros:\n\n♦ Horror like\n♦ Graphics seem high quality for a F2P game\n♦ Decent menu graphics settings\n\nCons:\n\n♦ When the Screen Changes colour and shakes to try and scare you (It just looks as though they inverted some colours and is really dodgy)\n♦ Lighting can be fairly dark even with the light sources given such as the torch\n♦ Menu and in-game notes text can be hard to read (This is due to the font style chosen to try and make it look scary. Though it’s more annoying than scary as the notes have to be read to even begin to try and understand the storyline)\nSound:\nPros:\n\n♦ Has volume sliders and speaker setting options (This is excellent to control the volume and how you want to hear it)\n♦ Sounds seem fitting for a horror\nCons:\n\n♦ By default the music is louder than the voice acting in cinematics and when the character reads notes (This makes you miss key parts of the story which cannot be replayed)\n♦ Voice acting seems limited when it comes to reading found notes (This is weird as only some chosen notes are read aloud whereas others you have to read yourself)\nAchievements:\n\nPros:\n\n♦ Decent amount that are gotten throughout the game (Not all at one point or by grinding certain things)\n♦ 11 out of 13 are easy to get (Most are gotten by just playing and exploring the game, not grinding things like in other games)\n♦Achievement for collecting statues without dying, loading or saving (This is only for the pro gamers and can be very difficult, however it gives the game an edge to it for those who found it good enough to replay it)\n♦ When completed achievements get a tick on them (That’s a nifty addition in my opinion)\n\nCons:\n\n♦ There is an achievement for picking up a weapon (However, to get this you have to have donated or finished the game. This makes no sense as the weapon should only appear if the game has been finished or if you have donated, not on the first play through)\n♦ There is an achievement related to “Finding Slender” (This is terrible as the game has nothing to do with Slenderman)\n♦ Random achievement for collecting statues (No idea why we are collecting statues of a random person)\n\nPrice:\n\nPros\n\n♦ Free with no micro-transactions\n\nCons:\n\n♦ Can’t expect much due to being free\n♦ Tries to get you to donate for an achievement (Shouldn’t be asking for donations, if people want to donate they will)\n\nOther:\n\nPros:\n\n♦ Keyboard controls just work and are easily mapped (Despite F being interact/use by default when most other games use E)\n\nCons:\n♦ The random Screen Shake and Colour Change seems to be a Slenderman rip-off but nothing appears\n♦ Some Loading Screen tips seem to be worded incorrectly (Said to “Spend your ammunition wisely” when it should have says Use as ammunition isn’t a currency)\n♦ At one point you see a Slenderman like figure in a window (This is weird as this game has nothing to do with Slenderman)\n♦ Uses the Swastika on the save/load menu screen randomly as though it’s a cool thing to include\n♦ No restore to default when changing keyboard controls (This is annoying if you want to change them back)\n\n\nOverall, the game is free to play and runs well. However, I wouldn’t really recommended this unless you are playing games for a sense of achievement and beating all the games on Steam as there is no actual scariness or things that make a horror good in this game and the storyline makes absolutely minimal sense. Though, I have finished this and for a free game I’d recommend you install it (If you have a spare 7gb) to try it out and determine if you like it for yourself. However, with that said, I personally think the cons out way the pros and wouldn’t play this again myself as it is annoying with few save slots, how easy it is for the enemies to kill you and how hard it is for you to kill them, the poor spawn locations for the enemies, the glitchy stuck to the roof thing, the poor horror events and the extremely hard to follow storyline just doesn’t make me want to play this or recommend it to anyone.","February 7, 2015","false","5.5"," 261 of 314 people (83%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","83","261","314","22","13"

The game consists of 4 chapters, where you'll discover not only the many victims and their hand-written stories smeered with blood scattered throughout the game, but you will come face-to-face with those that did "survive" the doctor's company, and you will wish very dearly that they hadn't.\n\nOverall, the controls will probably need  some adjustments early on, as the key bindings are far from the conventional WASD, etc setup. Brightness settings will need to be optizimed as well, since the entire game is extremely dark. Object interaction and collision can be awkward at times, especially while driving or moving through piles of rubble.\n\nThe horror of the game is a combination of both jump-scares and psychological thrill, especially as the tension rises with the unpredictability of flashes or screeches, as well as the enemies tending to ambush and surprise the hell out of you very often. The World War II-era radio and classical music  consistently set the atmosphere of the game and immerse you within the past.\n\nThe enemies themselves are generally very fast and come at you during the least convenient of times, and if they hit you, you had better hope that you have a med-kit, because the bleeding effect and sheer damage can be very crippling, resulting in a need for constant supply of weapons and ammunition, though the latter can be found in surplus very easily.\n\nPlayability: 6/10\nStory Quality: 8/10\nDifficultyLevel: 7/10\nIntensity of Horror: 8/10","November 13, 2015","true","5.7"," 107 of 118 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","107","118","5","1"

Ugly, poorly designed, bad voice acting, typos all around (I get the game is free, probably made by a single developer who's fisrt language isn't English, but this is just unprofessional). I decided to give the game a chance anyway. Big mistake. I had no idea how to interact with what and there was no explanation on the matter whatsoever. I don't like to be babysat by the game I'm playing but this is ridiculous. In the beginning there is a guy who asks the player to go pick up some food for him, because he's so busy.Then, 5 seconds later, the guy sits at his empty desk and starts doing NOTHING. He's just sitting there for however long you have the nerve to watch him. Lazy b*stard! After you get him his meal he says "Put it on the table" and there is no indication of which table that is or how you are supposed to put the damn thing there. I saw a clip from a later part of the game and it gets even worse... I really don't like to bash independent work like this, but this game is just a waste of time and effort.

A new update to the game improved on alot of the problems. There is still more work to do however.\n\nWhat i liked:\n-The game uses the cry of fear ammo mechanic (which means when you reload any bullets in that mag are gone) which punishes those who always reload after firing 5 rounds in a 30 round mag\n-the weapons feel good as well as a nice variety\n-Fun to shoot those evil things\n-interesting bleed out mechanic\n-enemies spawn randomly keeping tension up\n-good atmosphere\n-voice acting is pretty good (props to the guy that dies first [the character he voiced was Gregor])\n\nWhat i did not like:\n*-Optimization issues (large framerate drops) lack of video settings such as: shadows, Anti Aliasing etc.\n-cliche "they killed my loved ones, they must pay!" plot (should have just stuck with you are a police officer investigating and hunting down a nazi war criminal from WW2)\n-annoying ambient sounds can be irritating to the eardrums (the spot where you first encounter edward)\n-The final boss is a bullet sponge. Which means the only way to beat thim is to A) use your teamates as canon fodder or B)create a barricade and then play peek a boo. (well at least he was a boss unlike the halo 4 didact which was QTE bs).__*the boss has been improved his accuracy has been reduced however i still recomend using step A or B\n\n\n\n*---------------------*\nChanges i liked:\n-melee weapons have been removed, however now when you quick melee it knocks enemies back which is very handy and much apreciated\n-Enemies damage and attack speed have been toned down (very apreciated) players now have a chance to actually survive close encounters\n-2 more random enemy spawn have been added\n-The character will now be able to pick up ammo first instead of phys objects (much apreciated)\n-The diner scene has been improved, it no longer takes forever cycling through dialog with sheizel\n\nChanges i did not like:\n-Inventory now takes a few seconds to open and close as opposed to previous version that you could open up in an instant.\n-the ending has changed *spoiler alert* you now meet mafiosos, i have been unable to find a way to avoid them since the only way to go is either thru the cellar or you get teleported straight away to them.\n\nSide note: A few extra monster spawns are needed in the Library, staircases in rightwing area, the main room at the front entrance of mansion, the room above the diner and after beating the boss statue as well as the courtyard.","June 23, 2015","true","19.6"," 69 of 84 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","69","84","4","3"

A badly written story is one thing but when it involves and references the Holocaust AND Pewdiepie you've made something that crosses a line in sheer awfulness in an actually jaw dropping manner. This needed way more polish and play testing and I cannot recommend this to anybody as it stands. If you ever make another game start from the drawing board and use this game as a lesson.

The enemies (Or at least the one type I've encountered thusfar) move too fast for iron sights to ever really be of any use, running away isn't an option because of their speed, and once you get hit you're locked into melee with them because you're stuck walking for a few seconds (Which I feel is realistic, but unfair given the fact that they're going to be ontop of you in a second flat anyways). Picking up ammo seemed cool at first, until there were props around the ammo, which you usually accidently pick up instead and send the ammunition flying across the room. Also, I made the horrid mistake of using the pistol to save my precious rifle ammunition, which, it turns out, is just as effective as if I decided to huck rocks at starving cheetahs.","July 17, 2014","false","1.6"," 48 of 60 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","48","60","0","0"

I can see the effort put into them, but they still look absolutely ridiculous\nEnemies will DESTROY you, QUICKLY, if you get cornered\nInability to run for quite some time after getting hit is really annoying\nMovement is buggy in some areas\nGrunt if you so much as fall an inch\nFirearms seem to do very little damage\nAre you serious with the torch?...\nAre you serious with that melee weapon?...\nAre you serious with this voice acting?...\nAre you serious with those pics/vids of piles of bodies, and emaciated prisoners from the Holocaust?\n\nIf the movement was fixed so you didn't get hung up on things so easily, if the grunting was removed or at least altered, if the opening had machinima style scenes of the holocaust instead of ACTUAL footage, if you weren't turned into a slug upon being struck, if the enemies didn't look so ridiculous, if they didn't absolutely obliderate you so easily if you get cornered, and if the story was actually interesting and/or made sense, then this would be one worth putting money down for. As is though, it needs a lot of work. I know I didn't play much, and I'd have played more if I found it fun. The overpowered nature of the bland enemies, the glitchy nature of how difficult it is to move around in some areas, the way the firearms feel like BB guns or .22lr, the voice acting, the tasteless intro, and the lacking animation is making it far too annoying/tedius, far too quickly.\n\nSome of the jump scares were alright, but one where I seen a guy zip speedily by in one of the first houses actually made me laugh. Literally said something like "Well, that guy's got a place to go in a hurry." Another one in this little shed thing actually made me jump and waste a round from my Gewehr 43, however then I turned around, got cornered by one of those dumb looking enemies, and was dead pretty much before I could even fire off the final 5 rounds in my mag. That was the second time I got cornered and completely obliterated by one of those duplicated enemies, so closed down the game and I'm going to uninstall it once I'm finished with this review. Put those 4GB to something more entertaining.\n\nIt's free, so there's not really any reason NOT to give it a shot. If you're into FPS horror, especially if you also enjoy WWII firearms, then I suggest giving it a go... but do NOT get your hopes up. It will end in disappointment. This doesn't seem like a game that encourages good accuracy, as the enemies move quickly and sporatically, so I suggest pointing and rapid firing as soon as you see one. That seems to be the only way of dealing with them. Makes things rather boring in my opinion. At least with walkers, you need to actually use your sights, and with enough skill, can put each enemy down with a single shot. When multiple come at you at once, you've got to keep your cool, aim true, and go for the head. If multiple of THESE two headed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s come at you, rapid fire like mad otherwise you'll be dead within a few seconds once the first shot hits you because you won't be able to run.\n\nTo put it simply, I did not find this game to be fun... impressed at the looks of the firearms, and although the enemies look ridiculous you can see the detail put into them (also it seems bullet holes stay on them when they're shot, reminds me of 007 Goldeneye a little), but it doesn't change the fact that they look moronic and their movement is frankly rather annoying.","March 23, 2015","false","0.7"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","36","43","7","0"

Despite the story’s premise being interesting it’s not developed in any meaningful way, the only reminders of a story even existing in the first place being missable notes barely saying anything scattered across the game.\n\nThe typical atmosphere a horror game worthy of that name should possess is completely absent. Even the cat scares are horribly executed and will leave you wondering what just happened. The only scary thing in the game are the monsters, not because of they way they look or sound or anything like that, but simply because even the weakest creatures are unstoppable juggernauts of doom for about 3/4 of the game. They hit like trains, slowing down the player and leaving their aim wobbling all over the place, while shrugging off the completely inadequate gunfire.\n\nThere is pretty much a single effective way to deal with enemies in this game: jumping over a crate and fooling the monsters’ pathfinding so they can either be sniped (while they keep moving frantically) or beaten up with whatever melee weapon is available if they decide to actually get near the vantage point, all in complete safety. Solitary enemies can also be kited around but that’s not a surefire way and only works with melee weapons as the firearms are all either too slow or too weak in what’s probably the least satisfying gunplay I’ve ever seen in a videogame.\n\nThere’s also plenty of bugs, ranging from the chuckle worthy (as if the atmosphere needed to be ruined any further) to the annoying (maps refusing to load, forcing you to go back to your last save) to the game breaking (a map refusing to load no matter what, even after reloading, which forced me to go back to a previous save).\n\nLast, the developer decided to stuff the game with very obvious easter eggs referencing to their favorite youtubers. In a horror game. For some reason.\n\nIn the end the only reason I’d recommend playing this game is if you want to indulge in the morbid curiosity towards disaster that makes human beings flock to train wrecks to take pictures with their cellphones.","July 29, 2014","false","6.0"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

But really, this game has a ton of problems. However, it is free. That being said, it's worth the money. Plus, I actually am having some fun shooting up those Cry of Fear zombies! On the other hand, the game is quite linear, which leads to some very... enraging combat moments, like that time I was stuck in a shed with two monsters that have the speed of Sonic the Hedghog with a chili dog up his butt and as little room as shoebox on roids. yet this game has thought of stooping to lower levels as to steal MORE things from other games like: the Notes and Items menu taken from Amnesia: the Dark Descent, and the communication feature taken from Fallout: 3. While I can see that they were trying there best to please people by adding these mechanics, I still think that aspect lacked a little creativity. Overall, this being a free mod, I can see that they had their limits, and I respect the ambition of the team that put this together. It's just hard for someone who's played fantastic horror games in the past to overlook these flaws, yet I do realize that this isn't a "Triple-a" title, and I think they did a pretty good job at pleasing many people, therefore, all being said, I give this a  6/10.","November 22, 2014","true","2.0"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","69","31","45","22","0"

The enemy A.I. is suicidal and the difficulty of your first few enemies will have you trying again and again to try to pass them. If you are hit by these first enemies you can not move, jump, aim or turn away and firing rampadly does nothing, you die, restart and run across the map and shoot at them because if you are hit once you can not do anything. The later enemies act like real enemies and you have a chance to actually fight back.\n\nThe survival is removed from the survival horror as there are ammunition pickups in almost every room. The health system recharges and the bleeding system is useless. The voice acting is okay voice wise, but volume wise it's horrible, everyone sounds as if they stood on the other side of the room and talked normally, subtitles are a must. Some of the content is right from Nightmare House 2 (a mod that rips everything off from F.E.A.R.) this is not a huge problem as it comes in small clusters.\n\nThis falls victim to what a lot of Indie and AAA companies belive, dark means automaticaly scary. This is not the case, and it really does not work here when things are this predictable. The custom music recorded does hit the "creepy" tone and does keep the player on edge a little. The investment of time is something that annoys rather then being enjoyable as you run back and forth trying to figure out where to go next.\n\nA must skip for the average player but for those wanting to collect achivements, enjoy a well designed atmosphere or have models and maps to copy to your Garry's Mod folder, then those few might want to download.","July 17, 2014","false","1.0"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","30","44","0","0"

At first, i thought this might be great. Excellent looking title screen, good looking screenshots, a decent idea... then i saw the 2d intro art that zoomed into my face to let me see all of the tiny pixels, and the pewdiepie easter egg, and some guy yelling at me to get his lunch. Kinda warned me this wasn't gonna be good.\n\nFirst off, i will say the levels LOOK good at least, from what i saw that is. Looked very well made and polished, and the first actual level was genuinely creepy... up until i actually got into the shack your suposed to enter and not the bathroom that gives you a pointless sniper rifle. "SLENDERMANNN" achivement pop up, random and NESSARY slenderman 'easter egg' tossed in for a random scare as you pick up the medkit. ANOTHER pewdiepie reference in the next room, and a jumpscare of a guy with a bag over his head flying across the room with no animation. None of this was scary, it just ruined the mood.\n\nSkipping the actual begining of the mansion, which made me wonder why my guy wasn't worried about the guys in the bathroom, or the guy with blood on his head,or the monster that grabbed him, the first actual monster in the game was very hyped up for nothing. It looked AWFUL comparied to the levels, and looked like it was ripped from the half life one engine. Did i mention it also felt unthreatening as all hell? Also, it was a bullet sponge and that was all that was hard about it.\n\nLet me go into detail about this one enemy i encountered. It attacks before its attack animation is finished, making it impossible to melee without taking hits. It takes a LOT of punishment for what it being a BASIC(0r maybe ONLY) enemy in the game, and isn't fun to fight.\n\nBack to the game, it had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t instant death trap where you can grab a lantern, just to get swarmed by two of the enemies in tight quarters where they kill you before you can fire two shots. Great fun, right? Also not scary in the slightest.\n\nIgnoring the "NEED SPECIAL TNT" objective and the lack of actual objectives, i found a game breaking bug a few minutes in. Where the german scientist yells at you "I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO MAKE IT THIS FAR", you can walk into a plant, and end up stuck with a dialog box with no words in it and you can't close the game or reload without closing it through task manager. I didn't get any farther than that. I can not recomend this game in the Slightest. Only good thing I can say about it, is at least its free, comparied to paragon shift.","July 17, 2014","false","1.1"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vikriegus/recommended/314280/","vikriegus","ViKriegus Scholasticus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vikriegus/","352 products in account","The Forgotten Ones is an interesting enough game for fans of the Horror genre. While it falls short of many other small independantly developed games, in the same genre. (Cry of Fear comes to mind, when I think of small, independently developed Horror games. That I hold to high standards.)\n\nIt's still a worthwhile title to check out, and waste a few hours playing. Despite many of the negative reviews this title has recieved. I feel that the game is getting a much worse rap than it in all honesty, deserves.\nFinishing the game, and getting all of the achievements. I've say I'd have my fair share of the game, to give it a reccomendation.\n\nHowever, this game is indeed for the niche crowd that does not mind playing with the games mechanics in order to survive.\nIn short, abusing exlpoits in the games engine in order to complete the game.\nNow you may be able to get through the game without resorting to abusing the enemy AI, I for one, found it all but neccesary.\n\nPros:\n\n+Good atmosphere, has a very unsetlling setting in some areas in particular.\n\n+Decent ambient soundtrack and noises, although some can get pretty repetitive when they loop infinitly.\n\n+Varied weapons, and they all feel and sound powerful.\n\n+No Crosshairs, you must use the iron sights if you wish to hit an enemy accurately, and the iron sights are well done.\n\n+Scarce ammo and health pickups, you can only carry one spare medkit at a time, you can only save at certain locations. It really hit homes the survival horror vibe it's going for.\n\n+I really dig the puzzle elements and inventory management system that is included with the game. Though the puzzles are not the hardest. They more than enough suffice for such a small dev team on this game.\n\n\nCons\n\n-First and foremost, the enemies are incredibly hard to survive unless you abuse the enemy AI. (i.e. Jumping ontop of a high placed object, just out of reach of an enemy's attack.)\nThey require lots of ammo to put down, unless you consistantly place headshots. They are very fast, and worse of all, their attacks will stun lock you, making you move to a snails crawl and most certainly will spell your doom, if you get backed into a corner.\n\n-There are several bugs that are common I have experienced. Getting stuck in place after loading an area, requires you go back through the door and back again to move, or in worst case's, a full restart from last save.\nConstantly getting stuck on objects, where you have to pick them up and throw them in able to move.\n\n-The framerate is absolutely inconsitent. I have a GTX 970 SLi setup, and it goes from 200+ to 20's and lower many times. So prepare yourself for a slide show at times.\n\n-And lastly, picking up key items, and ammo is maddening. You have to be a pixel perfect reach in order to pick up anything, and most of the time there is no indication that you can grab it or not, so may pass up some ammo, thinking that you are full for that weapon, only later to realize you can grab it later on, just you weren't approaching it at the right angle.\n\n\nOverall, I would say try this game out, if you are a horror fiend. And don't mind a few glitches and bugs here and there.\nI will warn you that it is tough as nails, thanks to the incredibly reslient and fast enemies.\nIf you don't mind lots of trial and error, than this game may worthwhile for you to pick up.\n","June 26, 2015","true","6.1"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","18","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Suprememessage/recommended/314280/","Suprememessage","Harmonic Revelations","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Suprememessage/","271 products in account","This game wants to be a horror title, that shows insights to the horrors of WWII, while also realistically portraying the human desire for revenge. It manages to do none of those.\n\nOne of the main things I noticed is that the team put so little attention to detail that many of the props with no bottom texture like the filing cabinets (and at one point a dresser) are see-through on the bottom. That's the scariest part of this game: How little attention the developers put into making this a pleasant experience.\n\nThe controls are clunky, ambushes are cheap, enemies have about three frames of animation each, and the voice acting is so fakely German that as someone of Austrian descent I'm kind of offended. Have you considered hiring actual English-speaking Germans? That'd go a long way towards fixing it.\n\nAlso the jumpscares are laughable at best. Monsters cheaply ambush you, but I reacted with anger at how unbelievably cliche it was, not with fear.\n\nThe notes are unbelievably dumb, there were enough typos I almost thought it was translated by a first year immigrant. At one point they spelled 'despair' as 'dispair' on one of the notes in the illogical maze known as the mansion.\n\nAlso for the graphics I could forgive someone for thinking this was a Playstation 1 game, the weapons feel so clunky that it makes me want to go play Half-Life 2 instead, or if not the classics, maybe an actually good source mod. If you're looking for something fun, this is not it. I was nothing but frustrated the entire time.\n\nI will give you five points for effort though, because clearly it took you 'some' time to do this.\n\n_______________________-\n*SPOILERS*\n\nIf you want me to run down the plot of this game, here it is:\n\nYou are a Jewsish detective living in the small town of Nonsensical-Invisiblewallistan in the middle of a country where everyone speaks in poor fake german accents.\n\nAfter doing the amazingly complex task of picking up food for a character that has the same amount of depth of character as the paper bag the food you deliver to him is in. In this police station, time and space are ripping a hole, and the filing cabinets are missing the bottom.\n\nDue to advanced facial recognition technology, your character is trapped within a 10 meter radius of the police station. After this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, you then proceed to drive into lame-♥♥♥ forest, whose name is so cliche it sends shivers down your spine. Your character, apparently sensing the player's presence, begins to monologue, because he falsely assumes that you give a ♥♥♥♥, unlike everyone else. The plot twist is that the player doesn't care either.\n\nYou then come across a trick laid out for you by the devil, a log that if you attempt to drive up to will cause your car to freeze in time and space. Luckily, you only needed to drive about a three minute walk, so you're fine anyway. After checking in to the bathroom stalls that are present infront of a mysterious hotel that also has bathrooms in each individual room, you have the opportunity to pick up a scoped weapon which you will never use.\n\nWhen you go up to the hotel you notice it is locked, but that's okay, because a character so idiotic I forgot his name the second I stopped hearing it thought to have the key to the hotel in his house (Which is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because said plot-advancing 2D character is already inside the hotel, meaning he locked himself inside(?), or somehow broke out, put the key back into his shed specifically for your arrival (Which he detected with his psychic powers) and broke back in. His psychic powers stop functioning in your presence, however, because he dies less than a minute later. I'm kind of glad because the sound of his voice almost made me suicidal.\n\nDespite his death, you figure out that during his off-time from being a Butler he had the time to build a secret tunnel between this apparently unrelated-in-anyway to the story of the game hotel and mansion, probably because his life was hollow and meaningless without feeling like he served a purpose.\n\nAfter this, this game becomes a Simulator about walking through ambushes, backtracking for items, and exposition into a story so cliche that I didn't listen to a single word that the characters spoke between the big bad Nazi mastermind and our Jewish hero, but I can summarize entirely what happened.\n\nYour parents died and you want revenge.\n\nThis would be sad if your character didn't sound like those phone bots that tell you to Press 3 for Spanish.\n\n5/10\n\nUninstalled before beating it because I got lost around the point where I needed to restore power so the 'Dark ones' couldn't sense me. Which is weird because if the Dark Ones are such a threat why was this Nazi mastermind revealed as the game's big bad final boss around thirty minutes earlier?\n\nDon't play this, it's awful.","May 29, 2015","false","1.6"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","19","28","5","0"

(Up and down bobbing can.)\n- HUD can be confusing - inventory screen Use and Drop buttons are hard to spot, and dialogue choices often get truncated.\n- Invisible walls in odd places that you wouldn't expect.\n- Immersion is often broken by pointless "easter eggs" and messages like not being able to use a gun you find unless donating to the mod or something (the message didn't remain onscreen long).\n- Combat is somewhat annoying, as enemies jerk around a lot and cause your view/aim to massively stagger when being hit, which is more irritating than frightening.\n- Scares are pretty much jumpscares most of the time. Very little of it is from subtle or atmospheric triggers.\n- Ammo conservation is also annoying - it seems that reloading when ammo is left in the magazine means you lose those rounds. (A pet peeve of mine, I hate it when FPS games do this.)\n- Ammo magazines can be difficult to pick up even when there's nothing else around them to accidentally grab.\n- Keys are tiny and often extremely hard to spot.\n\nIt's a decent attempt at a horror mod, and I'll probably give it another try soon. For now, though, I can't say I enjoyed it. I had to stop when a jumpscare spawned two enemies that backed me into a corner and massacred me in seconds.","July 17, 2014","false","3.5"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

A lot of models are taken from Half-Life 2, enemies are unkillable if shot other than the head, get hit once by the enemy and you're doomed, and they will often appear right behind you so it's highly unfair. The melee weapon is completly useless, the enemies are spawned in stupid areas, "jumpscares" have models with no animations pass in front of you. There is a useless quest at the beggining, badly hidden easter egg, the slender one I don't even know how I got it.

They move way too fast for you to react, which makes no sense, being how big they are. When you get hit, your aim is completely thrown off, and you can't sprint due to how the enemy attacking you prevents you from running, and the fact that the enemy attacks, again, too fast for you to react. If there was a way around fighting them, that would be fine, but no, you HAVE to fight them. What's the point of allowing the player to fight back if you're going to make the enemies near-impossible to fight? Really, I would much rather have had it where all you can do is run and hide, instead of giving the player the illusion that they can fight back.\n\nAnd of course, the fact that this is literally PewDieBait also ruins it.

Plenty of ammo to grab, not sure about first aid kits, exploring environment is decent, controls are ok (who mixes the USE/Interact function with another button and other stuff too)?

This game should be played by PewDiePie himself to see how he feels about it.\n\nClose combat (melee) with the enemies is bad to you, but to them it takes about 3 hits to get a kill.

IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF BEING SPOILED OF THE MEANINGLESS FIRST 10 MINUTES OF THE GAME, PLEASE REFRAIN FROM READING THIS REVIEW.\n\nThis game is bad and there is no other way around it, everytime this game does something right, it does two things wrong.  When I first heard about "The Forgotten Ones" I was rather excited about it. "Inspired by the first Resident Evil" ? That sounded amazing to me! I love Resident Evil so I ignored the rather negative reviews (something I would regulary never do.) and started my download. When I first played the game, I was even more intrigued with the game showing the player some rather disturbing footage of Jewish concentration camps. But like I said before, when this game does something right, it ruins it. After the Holocaust footage, it shows downright the goofiest opening to a horror game, no, any game, that Ive ever seen in my life.With an opera singing and a "spooky" font zooming in on you like Spy Kids 3D. "BECAUSE THATS HOW YOU KNOW YOUR GAME IS SCARY, WHEN IT WRIGHTS OUT EVERYTHING IN RED BLOOD" It looks like the opening of an old YouTube video more than anything. Speaking of YouTube, the subtitles are down right the most obnoxious thing i've ever witnised in my life. They look like YouTube annotations and half the time something is overlapping the subtitles and you can hardley read them. When you first start the game youre just stuck in an office and don't know what to do. You try interating with things only to realize you arent doing anything. Then you look in the key bindings and realize that the interact key is "F". Im sorry...."F"...? This could be seen as nitpicking to alot of people, but why "F"?? You'd think the correct key would be "E" or the left mouse button, but "F"?? Thats like starting an Xbox 360 game and the start button is Right Trigger. It could just be that I don't have a huge enough expirience with PC games and just don't know, but the whole thing just seems odd to me. Now, im going to take the time to address the big elephant in the room. Yes, the infamous PewDiePie "easter egg". When you leave your office and go to your right, you would have found a big glowing note with PewDiePies face photoshoped on a Poke'mon card on it. Now, you may saying to yourself, "PEWDIEPIE WAS REMOVED FROM THE GAME, ITS IRREALEVANT!" NO, ITS NOT IRREALEVANT, AND HERES WHY I FEEL IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. Having Pewdiepie in your game is the most obnoxious things you couldve done, and before I get hate from everyone and their grandmas, no, I don't hate Pewdiepie, I love his videos. But you CAN'T put something like this in your horror game because\nA. that autimatically puts a target on your head and ruins any chance of your game being taken seriously\nB. Immersion. Immersion is something every game needs to a certain degree. And if theres one genre that needs immersion radiating from it, its the horror genre. And when you put Pewdiepie in your game, it breaks all sense of immersion. Its just not        something you would find in a game like this unless it was cleverly hidden\nC. Its not cleverly hidden. If youre going to put an easter egg with PewDiePies face on it, fine, be my guest, but atleast try to keep it somewhat hidden. Like behined the counter in the cafe' in Chapter 1, Where an actuall easter egg was hidden. Otherwise, people will view your game as nothing more than a joke. Same goes with Stephano statues but on a lesser degree.\nThe reason I bought this up is that NO game developer of this genre needs to ever put this kind of thing in their game. Now that thats out of the way, lets continue.\nLater in chapter one, as you are walking to your car, a man will ask you if you can grab his lunch because he's too busy at the momment, You pick up his lunch at the cafe' and whats your reward??? NOTHING! GOOD JOB! THIS WAS PUT HERE SOLEY TO WASTE YOUR TIME! I don't have a problem with side quests, but if this is the only one and you get zero reward.....why....why would you put this in your game? He dosent even eat the lunch, he just stares at it for eternity. Waiting. WHY? I digress. THEN YOU JUMP IN YOUR RINKY DINK CAR, PUT ON YOUR SEATBELT, HOLD ON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ITS GOING TO BE A BUMBY RIDE!\nNow that the actuall game has started, instead of going over what specifically was wrong with certain areas im just going to over what I didn't like about the game. Lets start off with the plot. I DON'T CARE. The plot is very generic, and very cliche. Another "revenge story" and does nothing to seperate itself from the countless others. It has some other little plot piecing together what hapened in the form of notes, and while some of them can be fairly interesting, for the most part, I don't care. Now that I think about it, there are alot of generic things about this game, like how all the NPC's are just the same boring Half-Life 2 model (including yourself) with sub-par voice acting (Not that I expected a whole lot from the voice department going in to this). The games soundtrack despite what little tracks they have are ok but nothing exceptional, which isnt a bad thing by any means but don't expect anything great out of it. One the other hand, the sound design itself is dreadful, using "spooky" bakground noises at random like say, creaking wood floors in an office, trying to create tension, im sorry, "the illusion of tension" between the player and itself but fails on every level. And half the time the music and voice acting are constantly fighting each other and you cant understand either. I will give credit where credit is do and say that the map design is actually pretty rad, and at times can create a truley haunting atmosphere. However, this is usually ruined by dips in framerate which again, ties back to immersion.  The combat is by far the worst part about this game, Its half broken and its this reason alone why I stopped playing the game to wright this review. First of all, It takes sooo many bullets to kill and enemy which is ok seeing that its a horror game and you NEVER want your player to become too op in a horror game otherwise its just Resident Evil 6 now isnt it? So its actually ok as long as you are from a distance, however, half the time enemies will gang up behined you or in closed corridors and before you know it youre dead. This is extremly obnoxious and irritating, because if you get hit, you cannot hit the enemy, you have to regan your senses, stand up, and by then, the enemy hits you again. And it doesnt take much for you to die either. Your melee weapon on the other hand is worthless so don't even try. The game constantley tries to throw jumpscares at you but none of them are scary, infact the only reason they do this is because the game itself isnt scary at all, actually, its pretty hilarious. The enemy design is laughable and look like rejected Scooby-Doo monsters, seeing them run down the hall  like they have to take a massive dump is rather hilarious and I love it...EXCEPT MY TWO PRIMARY EMOTIONS WHILE PLAYING A HORROR GAME SHOULD NOT BE LAUGHTER AND IRRITATION. This game is buggy beyond belief, The combat barley works, there are some rooms that just flat out give me a headache, there is nothing uniqe about it, and the stamina bar is garbage. The game reliese on jump "scares" because regular enemies couldnt get the job done. I used the word "obnoxious" alot in the review because thats what the game is. "Obnoxious". If I had to rate this game with a numerical score I would give it a 4/10 MAX.

This alone took me many minutes, as the keyboard mapping section of the Options didn't seem to cover an "action" button, and "E" was apparently already taken (and un-remappable).  Trial and error eventually informed me that the key I was searching for was "F" (this would not be the last "key" I would have to find in the course of this cliché-ridden if somewhat enjoyable quasi-mess of a game, just for the record).  My second mission:  To, er, go get some take-away food for some greasy friend of mine in a hotel lobby.  He didn't even seem particularly grateful once I gave it to him - quite dismissive, actually - but hey, you can't always expect substantial rewards for all the good deeds you commit in this world.  I guess that this and a couple of other bits where you get to choose what you say to people - to no apparent consequence - are this game's concession to the oh-so-modern notion of "open-world gaming".  (Thank ♥♥♥♥, it was mostly linear from there on in.)  Then it's into my beaten-up old jalopy, and off into a crazy, incomprehensible world of horror and (mis)adventure...\n\nThe Forgotten Ones is daft, but fun.  Not entirely competent, but fine.  Hardly inspired, but reasonably entertaining, and perhaps all the more crucially, FREE.  It's actually quite scary and suspenseful, thanks in no small part to the excellent sound design (apart from the bits where characters actually TALK, which are borderline inaudible...but perhaps thankfully so).  It's also quite hard, but not TOO agonisingly so (though the combat is frankly appalling - melee weapons being a vast improvement over GUNS most of the time! - but said fights are thankfully few and far between).  Think of it as a second-rate Cry Of Fear - itself a flawed but charming game - then add in a trashy (if lovingly realised) WWII/nazi setting, and you're mostly there.  Not a masterpiece by any stretch, but what do you expect for nuthin'?  Recommended to any horror game fans who can lower their expectations suitably when they're given something for free.  Certainly preferable to a swift kick in the eye, if only by a small margin.\n\nVerdict: 6.5/10.\n\n(PS I somehow managed to get an achievement where I spotted Slenderman...even though I completely failed, in the event, to see him at all.  There's also a bunch of Pewdiepie/Stephano references, and a visit to the Resident Evil 1 mansion.  Welcome to the era of post-post-post-post-modernism, kiddies.)\n\n(PPS Didn't even bother to finish it, though walkthroughs tell me I was close to the end.  I'm sorry, but I simply lacked the willpower to work out where all the valves I had to turn were.  And besides, the end "boss battle" looked decidedly ♥♥♥♥♥ and anti-climactic anyway.)","June 14, 2015","true","4.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","11","17","2","0"

I suppose I should start off by saying I'm most certainly not one for the horror/scary game style, but after a year of keeping this game in the corner of my mind, I finally broke down and tried it out. The Forgotten Ones introduces you to several ideas I actually wish more games would embrace and more developers would try. Instead of rehashed characters/sprites from the Half-Life 2 library, The Forgotten Ones actually attempts originality with creatures and does not bog you down with constant enemy spawn points. While the many grunt enemies require a gratuitous amount or well placed bullets to silence, the several bosses that are strewn amid the chaotic mansion require critical and quick thinking to overcome. Puzzles, although mostly simple find item/use item style, are distanced from each other rather well; however, the enemies you will encounter between puzzles are the real test.\n\nThe Forgotten Ones does have its issues: The enemy AI humorously falters here and there, items do not always want to be picked up, there are save locations instead of quick or even checkpoint saving, and one or two places where you may no-clip through a wall or object and get stuck. Even with all those issues, The Forgotten Ones is an interesting take on the horror genre for gaming utilizing good ideas for cover and trapping enemies to conserve ammunition, a very solid mix of music and terrifying sounds that will keep you checking behind your computer chair, and a satisfying duration.\n\nI most certainly hope you consider trying out The Forgotten Ones, its an exciting, a little rough around the edges, horror First Person Shooter with some serious attention and care in its execution.","February 26, 2015","true","8.6"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","21","37","3","0"

I don't consider my self a horror game connoisseur, but I can tell you very much so that this game is atrociously bad! One of the things that really irked me was the constant references to Pewdiepie. The designer made this game specifically for the "Pewdiebro's" and it absolutely shows. If you make a game oriented towards a certain demographic then you tend to alienate the rest.\n\nAnother thing that proves exceedingly annoying is that this horror game fails scare. Nothing but jump scares and looping ambient noise to give the illusion of horror. This game does not evoke fear it can only startle, and that is extremely dissapointing. Also this the game is very predictable which also adds to the fail factor. Seriously, if there was a betting game on jump scares in this game i would be wearing a golden hat by the end of this game.\n\nAnd the final thing that broke me was the game play. Abysmal; is the word I would use to describe it. This game is mainly centered around combat but has aspects of survival horror. Strangely enough its hard to run out of ammo, but the trade-off here is that the combat sucks rusty nails. You are given guns that do the equivant damage of hawking a luegee at the scrambling monstrosity of the current minute. And to seal the deal when you get hit by the enemey, consider your *ss dead because when you get hit your camera jerks like its trying to give an epileptic person a seizure, making it harder to hit the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But the fun doesn't stop there, oh no no no. when you get hit you also lose the ability to run. Making it f*cking useless to fight in the first place. And you HAVE to fight these things, you can't out run them. Your silly ♥♥♥ will be leading congo lines all across the map trying to find what the hell to do next because you cant find the current item to progress.\n\nThank god this is a free game because if i had payed for this game... Oh my god i would murder somebody!\n\nFINAL RATING: UNGODLY BAD","October 1, 2014","false","2.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

The story was creative, albeit cheesy. Still, it was a fun ghoulish ride while it lasted. The controls are fine and the game functions as it should. No crashes or anything. The sound design is of average quality, it isn't bad, but it isn't great ethier.  Its just mainly stock effects from the Source Engine. Nothing really unusual.\n\nThe voice acting is a hit and miss in certain spots, the accents can sometimes be way too thick and hard to understand. Then theres also times where it feels like the voices don't have much emotion to them. The level design is average, it isn't as creative as it could've been, but it does the job.\n\nThe combat however is where the mod is very flawed, it feels as though you're forced to fight every single enemy you come across. And most of the enemies are WAY too fast to shake off. It espically gets annoying when you get hit, your screen bounces around the place. You can't hit anything when this happens and you'll be dead in seconds.\n\nOverall, The Forgotten Ones is a good mod for what it is, but needs some serious tune ups. I like the developer's creativity and certainly eager to see what he will do next. Hopefully he will make note of what was wrong in this mod and improve upon it in the next project.","August 16, 2014","true","2.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Luckily there is plenty of ammo for your worthless handgun laying everywhere.\n-The story was almost non existant from what I could tell. Typical revenge plot.\n- Collision can be a nightmare. There are items littering some rooms and you can easily get stuck on them.\n- Picking up important items such as ammo can be almost as difficult as killing the monsters due to all the clutter. Your character wants to pick up everything except the item you actually want.\n- Loading between areas can sometimes make you need to restart the game because you get stuck on a black screen. Dialogue boxes can also freeze and make you restart the game.\n\nI did manage to complete it despite the game working against me.

Not one bit. I think the whole purpose of this game is to attract those "Pewdiepie" youtubers who see a monster,  get a spaz attack, then they say they can't play the game anymore. I mean, its a source mod. That sort of defeats the purpose of having a scary game when everything look like a cartoon show. They give you no tutorial what so ever, and they put combat in a horror game. Thats like breaking rule number 1 of horror. The bullets they gave you are underpowered, so its not like your going to kill the enemy in the first place. Another thing, when an enemy jumps out, most of the time your in a small confined room. That makes it difficult to shoot when it runs at you extremly fast along with the fact that when it hits you, your camera swing everywhere. Enemies also have no delay in their attack time so if you get cornered, you are finished. The sound effects are kind of unsettling, but otherwise, the music and soundloops are just little things that come with source. The way items work in the game too is kind of odd. From what I see, you select the itm and click use, like Amnesia. However, when you click use, nothing happens. The item entity doesn't appear on your reticule like Amnesia, instead you have to be at point blank with your target to use the item when you click use, making you vulnerable to any monster that comes near. Another thing I have to say, hiding is useless. It says you can hide, like in normal horror games, but when it comes down to an actual encounter with a monster, they can just sniff you out. I think its default programming in source for the monsters to find you, but othern than that, I honestly don't know. For example, at one point there was a shed outside of the main building you were exploring, and I went inside and picked up a lantern. I heard a monster noise, so I closed the door  and hid in a corner by some shelves. I heard two monsters run up to the shed, bang the door down, tear up my hiding spot, and kill me. They didn't even pause for a second. But all in all, I would not recomend this game to anyone who is actually going to try and play a horror game with the expectations of geting scared or having fun.","July 25, 2014","false","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can't play it because it is impossible for me to get past just two enemies and maybe I am just not good at the game but I play Half-Life 2 and CS:S and other Source SDK mods such as Grey and Nightmare House 2 so it shouldn't be so hard... I would just like the enemies to be taken down a notch because it feels really impossible taking on an enemy that has become so annoying it took away from the initial immersion the game had created so well...","July 20, 2014","false","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game stopped entertaining me during the opening sequence before I had control of my character.  I am not a sensitive person but I found that using REAL footage of survivors and the deceased from the Holocaust was extremely distasteful.  The only thing this game has going for it is that it is free.  Every other aspect is underwhelming and the game is unplayable.

The only reason why I do not recommend this game is because of the combat system. The mutants are way too powerful and disrupt your aiming WAY too much for you to even shoot them. In addition they hit way too much to even let you counter attack and primarily leads to killing you in a matter of seconds. Definitely NOT a good game in my opinion for the absolute bull**** combat system. The hammer... don't even pick it up. Because with the enemies you fight, you won't even be able to land a single hit with that useless blunt. Everytime time they hit you, you move slower AND you get pushed back which prevents you from even getting close enough to melee them. Add their amazing melee speed to it, you're better off shoving that hammer right up your pooper. The guns also don't do enough damage and those things are a LOT faster than you so they end up closing in on you faster than your bullets can kill them. Overall, it has a nice appeal to the visual eye, but the gameplay is just god awful and just not worth your time, honestly.","August 28, 2014","false","5.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I saw this in the free-to-play horror section, and it looked promising, so I decided to try it out in a lets-play. In the course of the two episodes that i did off the bat, I got stuck, mostly because I didn't look for a slightly hidden key, the rest because it didn't tell me that I NEEDED a key. In that sense, the game itself (the environment, the ambiance) is decent. The gameplay, however, is a different story.\n\nNo instructions were given for controls, and, assuming becaue it was made on source engine or a half life 2 mod, I kept using E. Wrong.\n\nThe driving is all over the bloody place, the car will spin out while turning all the time, and is prone to getting stuck ALOT.\n\nThe game is RIDICULOUSLY dark. I turned up the brightness all the way to make for a better video, and its still dark as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe jumpscares were expected, as I knew it was a horror/suspense game, so I dealt with it. BUT. The monster flitting around just gets to be slightly confusing more than startling. I also am a giant wuss, so i jumped at first, props to that.\n\nThe enemies are unnerving to say the least, with Cry of Fear and Afraid of Monsters-like movements, and are ridiculously overpowered. The health also bugs out after getting ♥♥♥♥♥ slapped several times by the first enemy, just look at my second episode for that.\n\nThe sequence while enetering the hotel is also pretty iffy, to say the least. Things happened out of sequence.\n\nAnd lastly, all the character models are the same, just different faces. Just to ask the dev personally, please try to make them a bit more diverse, for atmosphere and such.\n\nOh, and there are pain sounds from the characters in the hometown sequence frequently, and it's a tad annoying. And the lunch "quest". Tell new players where to go at least.\n\nThank you for your time, I look forward to what you will or will not choose to do with this game. I hope you will fix it.\n\n","October 4, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So he jumps around he room, grabs his gun, and runs out of the building as fast as he can; crosses the street and visits the king of garbage and gets stopped by invisible walls everywhere till he finds his car right outside his headquarters.  Then the game goes from looking like crap, and playing like crap, to looking actually pretty great.\n\nThe game has a pretty spooky atmosphere, feels well decorated, has slight jumpscares of reasonable spookynes, and gives you a sense of unease at times when you're not sure what to expect around the next corner.\n\nDon't worry about thinking of saving as a cheat, it saves a lot of time from opening the menu at the same item, and you're going to die a lot; especially if you run around often considering this game suffers from the Obese Man Disorder when it comes to stamina drain, and I believe enemies even drain your stamina when they hit you; so if you get cornered by a couple with your crappy rifle you're probably dead.\n\n\n\nAnyways, what I think of the game;  it's a surprisingly good job.  The game runs smoothly, looks good, is spooky, and pretty fun.  Some parts are kind of lulz such as the time when someone gets killed by a really generic 3d model being rushed by them.  lol  You'll see what I mean.\n\nI haven't finished it yet, but I'll give it a 7/10 in terms of Half-Life 2 mods, I may re-review it once I actually complete it.","March 11, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/recommended/314280/","stragglerastic","Lagg&","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/","292 products in account","So I'll admit flat out that I knew this would be bad. That's partly why I played it in the first place since I have a side project going that someone asked for where I do MST3K style riffing on bad games (albeit more mean spirited as it often turns out to be, but they generally deserve it). This was going to be one such game.  I also chose it because the person behind it was responsible for a horrific coop mod for another very neat mod named Black Snow. This not only missed the point of Black Snow but was also badly mangled both in localization and bugginess. It pretty much ruined the experience for first time players by them thinking it was an official project.\n\nYou could say that my attitude coming into it was not exactly positive. I don't deny that. But this piece of trash was disgusting in a way I never could have imagined. This isn't just hyperbole, it literally is disgusting. Why it's disgusting is evident about 10 seconds into the video below (which is only part 1 of 6 of the series and it gets steadily worse in each one). But to put it bluntly: This piece of trash and the other piece of trash who created it reuses WWII mass grave and concentration camp footage, inserts its own characters as part of that footage and then proceeds to treat everything surrounding it about as seriously as people treat the Black Eyed Peas. And yes my choice of analogy there was intentional.\n\nBut even if we are to ignore that bit of tastelessness the game is a train wreck. It tries hard to mimic Cry of Fear. So hard that it went so far as to (badly) emulate the black screens that occurred during cell transitions found both there and in older games. Now in said older games this was necessary due to technical limitations like memory size and clock speed before either could deal with aggressive culling algos. The transitions were questionable even for Cry of Fear but at least there it could be attributed to it being a modified GoldSrc. But Source could do these maps without issue. There were much larger maps in HL2 itself than this. So pointless at best and really annoying padding at worst.\n\nThe monsters are unbalanced. I see what they were trying to do here too but they failed at it. If you're going to make it 90s survival horror style then add combat mechanics and weapons that are worth a damn. Failing that, actually give people a way to run like you could in aforementioned survival horror games instead of just telling them to do it in the loading screen. Another favored tactic of this game is to either put invisible walls all over the place (a mark of great design right?) or in at least one case spawn monsters and put a literal wall. Or otherwise spawn the monsters such that you get cornered. Prepare for a lot of crouch jumping onto obstacles if you want the slightest chance of winning a fight.\n\nThen there is asset reuse aplenty all over the place. Not just the HL2 assets but stuff that I'm almost certain hasn't actually been licensed. Again.  See Black Eyed Peas reference. Yes there is a certain well known Black Eyed Peas track in this piece of ♥♥♥♥ that dares to use mass grave and camp footage to force drama.\n\nWhat I missed in the video is summarized in the comments by Benjamoose pretty well. Anything else  I missed in the review (I tried to get it all, I hate looking like I'm advertising videos in this stuff) will probably appear in the rest of the series currently being uploaded.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgT96LRNGjw&list=UU9jU7PlxiRNS1JfdUAlQxcA\n\nand yes there are 5 of those little statues from Amnesia (models which I'm sure are used with permission) that are apparently a certain bad letsplayer's fantasy sex toy to collect. Didn't really feel it was worth going in depth for since it's already been hammered into the ground. It's just another drop in a sea of stupid developers trying to bait these people to get free publicity. Probably not going to work for this one.","February 2, 2015","false","4.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

For me I've actually enjoyed playing this game, it also has startled/frightened me a few times with unsuspecting jumpscares. I thought that the soundtrack was great. I liked the guns, melee weapons, and the sources of lights, the enemies, and the voice acting was not that bad in my opinion. But I recommend to play this game at night like I did, in a dark room, so it makes the game seem more frightning.  Of course there are the downsides of this game, and so far there are only 2 things that bug me: 1. Some guns do little damage, making so that you have to use an entire clip to kill an enemy. 2. Sometimes when I load into a room, I'll just randomly take damage. Without the flaws I have encountered in this game so far, this game is wicked fun/scary to play alone at night. The only thing I have found weird is the Stephano collectables. But other than that, I would recommend this game for people looking for a scare in the middle of the night. Great work on this game, I have enjoyed every minute of it, and will hopefully keep on playing!","August 5, 2014","true","1.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

As of now, it's full of bugs and far too hard.\n\nMy biggest issue is the combat and the annoying view bobbing that doesn't completely disappear even when you turn it off. If an enemy gets close and corners you in they smack you around without pause, meaning that even if you try to shoot them your shots are just going to go everywhere because of the violent shaking. Fighting them in open areas is fine, but in confined spaces that players don't know it becomes an issue. Most of my progress with the enemies has simply been due to dying for the aforementioned reason and then going back and killing them "Edge of Tomorrow" style. That isn't fun, and the game quickly stops being scary and starts being annoying after this becomes a regular thing.\n\nI understand that you worked hard on this, but please fix the issues that I and others have pointed out and this might become a somewhat decent horror mod.\n","April 12, 2015","false","2.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

HOLY MOLY!!\nwell it surely has its contra points, its not made with the newest engine which is clearly cause a new engine costs a lot of money and this game is provided for free, im missing in the beginning a little bit the story ( i havent played through the game yet) but its doing what it shall do. scaring the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. its for free so its probably made from an indie developer team.You cant expect perfection. Its better than a lot of games on steam which actually cost money i would pay a price of 5-10 $ for it actually. So its worth the time to play it.\ni played many horror games and own around 350 games atm like: amnesia, alan wake, outlast, dead space, resident evils, the evil within and so on, and this one can keep up in being horrifying.\ni have no problems with the controls i like the way it wont show an aiming point in the middle or it wont show you with what you can interact, like doors. So i seriously dont know why so many of the recommendations are bad. the game is a good game. simply said. and for free. what do u want more. i almost hadnt installed it cause of those negative reviews, but once more i figured out the most people on steam are dumb as ♥♥♥♥ and i will never decide on negative or positive reviews if i play a game or not..people on steam love to complain..about everything..and as soon they are too stupid to do something,  they will shout out that the game is bugged or bad. it isnt bugged..they just suck. U know what real gamers do before they start up a game? they check the audio, video and control settings. i love that this game has no annoying tutorial to show me for the thousandst time how to  crouch or run. and then they would know that the "F" key is the "Use" button. and anyways...if i hadnt checked out before starting the game..i would defenetily do it in the first room after a minute of spawning and look what the "Use" button is...to open the first door and come out of the room. But well..of course i can also run around 30 minutes in a circle, rage quit and post a negative review cause i had not this "total weird idea" to check out my keybindings. This game has no sound bugs, no bugs with textures, no control bugs, not stucking anywhere. It has some bugs here and there but they are not interfering with my gaming. I have played many games where i had to deal with bugs which made it impossible to continue the game or i had to restart checkpoints, or even had to fiddle around in gamefiles myself to get it working. I dont have those kind of problems here by this game. And im a professional game Tester for Gaming Companies (not Indies).\nSome people on steam shouldnt even be allowed to post reviews. use ur brains a bit more kids. thats what its there for.\nThe most creepy are those sounds of doors and steps right behind you and nothing is there.\nalways check out whats happening behind your back there could be something sneaking up. things disappear fast and u really feel like "wait, what, was there something" and u lure carefully around the corner, to figure out mostly..yep there was something. thats a good horror game.\npeople dont know much, such a game is a lot of work, the map design, the animations, the 3d models, texturing, the boning of it, the sound effects, the programming, the voice actors, the storytelling, the videos, the idea, and those guys did it for free. but people compare this to 50 $+ games.","April 12, 2015","true","1.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","2"

I admit that I did not delve very deeply into the game as I am not a huge fan of horror/suspense, but I think this game has hit it on the head of the nail. I am probably going to let my wife, who is into this sort of game much more than I am have a go at it.","May 18, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It was a dumb game for dumb babies and the developers should stop making games forever because they are stupid dumb babies that are bad at making games.

Really I do, especially indie developer games. But this.... This game has got to be the least fun I have EVER had in a video game.\n\nIn a nutshell, heres what happen'd, loaded up the game and checked its settings, ok, the game has a fov slider, and a few customizable things like view bobbing, subtitles etc. Although the interface was hard to read, the fact thats included was none the less not an issue. You start the game in your office, on a phone. I couldnt even hear what was going on, let alone CARE. After all that, you go in your car and youre able to drive what I thought would be a mini hub, kinda like something you seen in lets say demon souls or Super mario 64. nah, it's just an unneccesarry intro level. It doesnt even teach anything to you, just a slow paced intro. After finnaly meeting my first enemy, I was VERY dissapointed. Remember that view bob option earlier? Yea, make sure thats off, cause the animations on these monsters are extremly jittery,  I feel like im drunk. Now I know im only 1.9 hours into the game, but I honestly cant take it anymore. There is just SO much back tracking in this game, and with a limited stamina *You know, cause youre always gonna run from the monsters.* it's just so unbeleivably boring. A few other things i wanted to point out, this developer STOLE, thats right, I said it, STOLE some things from other games/mods. It stole quite a few sounds from the Half life one mod "Cry of Fear" another horror game. The game also features a "Resident Evil" Styled mansion. Literally, just about the SAME exact mansion, but in this games "style". There is also a certain boss fight where you have to "use your enviroment" to kill it. Now at first I though, this is much more like a boss fight than the first two, but then I realise, you guessd it, more backtracking.\n\nAll in all, this game while it may be free, was just not worth my time. I am sorry towards the dev, I mean not to be rude, but you can do WAY better than.... this.","September 25, 2014","false","2.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The fact I made it as far as I did surprises me. Plot is really thin, considering the subject matter. Voice acting is hilarious, at least.\n\nCombat is the worst. As long as you can backpedal, you're good. You will never die to anything. If you do get cornered, though, you're dead. Your screen will shake so much, and you won't be able to aim at all. Puzzles make little to no logical sense outside of "put key in hole". I'm often just mashing F trying to see what I can interact with, and then just cycling through my items. Sometimes this results in bad things happening, like this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDtcGKHoJB4\n\nTo it's benefit, it -is- a complete, free game. There's no microtransactions or anything, you can install it and play it, if you want. I don't recommend it, but you have the option!

The graphics are not much better than what you would find in Half-Life 2. Sometimes this works against the game because there are a lot of reflective effects and that makes it hard to see. This isn't the worst problem.\n\nThe AI isn't really that great, and can be easily thwarted if you stand on something. It will walk up to you, but it can't attack. You can whack whatever is trying to kill you pretty quickly with anything on hand. This isn't even necessary, since there is enough ammunition to kill mostly everything you come across, unless you are a horrendously bad shot. The environment isn't that well constructed and, regretably, this persists to the end of the game.\n\nThat being said, the story is pretty grim, but that is to be expected with a sociopath nazi doctor. The manor is pretty spooky, and the game is thankfully mild with the jump-scares. I just wish there was less ammunition and more room to maneuver and there was an opportunity to hide. Basically, I wish this game was more like Amnesia.\n\nThe controls, music, and voice acting are fairly competent, but the translations are bad. They are not bad enough to be completely indecipherable, but the developers could have done better. They could have definitely done better with the climax and the ending, as the last chapter has a puzzle that makes no sense and a fight that was just not that good. The ending was odd as well.\n\nAll of this being said, the game was fun enough for me to play it all the way through and go after the acheivements.","February 7","true","4.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That's coming from somebody who isn't picky in the slightest, bu that doesn't mean that this review doesn't mean anything.\n(Let's be honest, it doesn't mean anything regardless, but we don't talk about that.)\nTo start, the game looks fine. I'm okay with games looking bad-ish. I prefer if they look about mid to low-high-ish mix, and this one fits into my personal preference under medium-high. If that's confusing, the spot just between medium and high.\n\nSecond, the 'Use' key being F isn't an issue for me, since I play GTA:SA on PC anyways, so my index naturally reaches for it without strain.\n\nOptimization is a thing I can get past. I don't care how my games run, unless it's a fast-paced FPS like TF2, or anything fast-paced for that matter. 15-20 frames is fine with me.\n\n(In case you haven't noticed, this is all based on my personal preference.)\n\nThe car was.... well, it had a learning curve. But i don't know what you guys expected. This is a greenlight indie title. For all we know, it's the first game the person couldv'e made. Regardless, the car was pretty terrible, but you get used to it.\n\n\nSOUND DESIGN: I loved it. Good headphones are recommended for maximum sp00piness. Atmosphere was good.\n\nPRICING: F0CKEN FR33\n\nYA CAN'T BEAT FREE, UNLESS THEY PAY YOU TO PLAY IT.\n\nHORROR: It was actually scary. When an enemy is chasing you, and you start running out of chase room, it gets SUPER intense, to the point where you're hunching over, holding your breath and praying internally that you don't die.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint is, you can't complain about free. It looks okay, it plays fine, spoops are actually spoopy. GG, Devs. GG.\n\n\n8/10","May 12","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I LOVE people who try themselves in gaming, trying to create something (an awful lot of times not-so) great content. There are ideas, stories, whatever.... but no real background to back it up.\n\nThis is probably one the sadly multiple issues with this "game". Let's make out some points for pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n- have some good ideas\n- tries to be more than a scardy horror-esque game by doing some mild puzzles\n\nCons:\n\n- although the game uses Source engine, it's really really really really really (....) messed up! Extremely unoptimized compared to HL2 or whatever Source game you can think of. To make the point: I have a very bad laptop, which can run HL2 maxed out. This game (even with the lowered amount of manipulable objects) runs really bad even when I turn ALL graphics options down to minimum! Outrageous!\n\n- the game's control system is really really awkward, using items from the inventory is a pain in the ***, even if you just step on a book or bump into a movable object, your character will say "ugh" n stuff.... really strange and buggy\n\n- ..... to be continued with the combat system!... the enemies are terribly designed, they look really worse than even HL1 enemies by miles... and that the most basic enemy has to take about one full clip of pistol bullets to die?.... joke.... especially when they don't even react to being shot or hit, only some tiny splatter shows that they actually got shot. Oh, and by the way, they are Super Siamese Twins with attached blades to their hands. Wow...\n\n- the saving system... you can only save at books. Too much like 90s, we are over that thing already, move on...\n\n- There is just no sense in progressing, I was literally walking around to ANY way I can, found items that are most probably will be used much later on.... had no idea about what to do or where to go!\n\n- even the makers could not agree in the damn name of the guy? Seriously, they write it differently than how it's said in ALL the audio speech. And no, it's not phonetics issue when an "N" is said in elsewhere in the name...\n\n\n\nAll in all, it's a HUGE disappointment.

Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)\n\n2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.\n\n3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.\n\n4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.\n\n5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.\n\nFor a Rocky Road Bar:\n1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.","November 12, 2015","true","5.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The soundtrack is pretty great, really gives the atmosphere a sense of loneliness, yet a sense of not being alone. combat is a bit tough, which is the only "downside" i see so far into this game, but you get better weapons further on anyways, so it feels better. This game gives me chills, hell, i could compare it to cry of fear, it's a great game, and if you hate this game because there is easter eggs of pewdiepie, you obviously cannot call yourself a gamer. i highly reccomend this game to fans of horror c:","July 18, 2014","true","2.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

It was kind of a relief, like getting a grip on reality, reading and realising how other people had been through (more-or-less) the same experience I had just had. Jeez that was scary as ..... I'm really enjoying feeling my way around, and getting jumped out-at so I may not go back to the guide this first time around. Although did somehow the Garden Shed get forgotten? I do not want to give a spoiler so I won't go into it - what happens, not the shed I mean... Mind you, the 'Kinda useful guide' kind of gives away more from what it DOESN'T tell you (like the Garden Shed), than what it does. When you have played the game some you will figure out what it is Chronos is writing between-the-lines. And that is that the 'exploring' (sic) side of things, in between picking up things or killing things, unless you are a truly hardened horror-fan (or maybe one of the undead), is the very last thing you will want to be doing as you play the game. You constantly want to be out-of-there, with all this horrible nightmare cleared up by the good guys. But in 'The Forgotten Ones' there is only you..., and some fairly feeble weaponry considering what you will have to face. I don't want to suggest that this turns itself into a gore-blaster, that would spoil the dangerous fear you will experience playing it. There are plenty of games during which you need never fear, because you have a .50 cal - or a zip-saw or whatever, which will decimate, given a reasonable aim and a sensible approach, anything that is likely to move against you. I don't generally play horror games, I'm a WWII gamer at heart, it was the story-line that caught my eye and got me to try it out. So far, I found the game drew me in quickly to become a hellishly scary experience - and it definitely gets my vote. I only downloaded yesterday so I guess I got the patched version, there isn't really anything to complain about. I read some bad-reviews and had those in mind when I installed it, but pleased to say, and I don't have a top-whack pc, the game is running fine for me. The key action for the Hotel got a bit sticky, but a couple of try's and it was OK. Opening it up for user-made stories, that is truly awesome, and in the true gamer spirit. It's getting dark now, so I guess I'll have to wait till tomorrow before I can explore some more...","August 5, 2014","true","9.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

One thing TFO does well which a lot of other mods and games don't manage, is that it makes you reluctant to keep pressing onwards. When you see a dark corridor, you won't want to go there, the fear in this mod is captivated very well.\n\nA lot of people are really complaining too much about this mod. For starters, it is meant to be difficult. A lot of games and mods these days seem to take your hand and walk you through. TFO narrates a good story, and gives you the freedom to explore and look around. You're not supposed to know exactly what to do, you're supposed to find your way and search for clues.\nYes there are references to memes and YouTubers but that's purely for fun and people should stop complaining that these references are in the mod. The monsters are fast and tough, you need to be prepared and fight for your life. So before you slag this mod to pieces, play it, and understand it.\n\nHere's some other good features about TFO:\n\n-There's a great deal of custom and converted stuff, really fun to use weapons, interactive items and notes as well as being able to interact with the environment to search for clues and speculate the mysteries within the mod.\n-Very good and familiar soundtrack, some tracks just really suit the atmoshphere of the mod and will give you chills!\n-Mystery lies behind every corner, you really have to make the most of your resources and sanity, which further makes for a great horror experience\n-Multiple choice weapons, you'll come across different guns and items to take with you, but you'll have to decide carefully which ones will keep you surviving...\n\nNegatives about this mod:\n\n-The monsters can be tough and quick, especially the first few monsters you encounter, you're given a wide variety of weapons to fight them off however. But, these monsters could possibly be slowed down or throw less damage at you.\n-Some of the sounds and music don't seem to sound 100% in sync with the rest of the mod, but it's made very good use when it features.\n-Weapons could possibly do a little more damage.\n-Possibly an extra or more driving opportunities, it's a great feature in the mod that sadly didn't get much use\n\nI highly recommend this mod if you want a great scare and some goosebumps and a pleasant story-telling experience!","July 19, 2014","true","1.3"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","11","26","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/davidstokes/recommended/314280/","davidstokes","Gore007","http://steamcommunity.com/id/davidstokes/","679 products in account","Okay! This game has been reviewed by a lot of haters and some lovers, all extremely enfuriated, or cheered up by some stupid Pewdiepie reference THAT HAS BEEN REMOVED. So first of all, thank you, Developer, for listening to people's opinions and reading comments/reviews. I hope you will consider my opinion as well.\n\nSo here we go: The story begins a bit clichéd (nazis - bad, nazihunters - good), still it turns out to be a decent, budget horror FPS). For the horror part, there are a couple of jumpscares, that - depending on your preferences/sensitivity - can be quite scary. The environment is eerily creepy enough for me, but gaian, horor is a tricky genre since it works a bit differently for everyone.\n\nAbout the FPS part: sometimes it is better to run than shoot back, but sometimes it is just not possible, so the RIDICULOUSLY OVERPOWERED ENEMIES will chop you up in no time. It would be a good idea to allow players to either inflict more damage with one shot/blow OR to take more hits before dying (but not both). Also, please do something about the camera. While stafing in any direction, it is "leaning" as well, which literally (and I do mean it in the strictest sense of the word) makes me SEASICK - and a lot of my friends feel the same way about it. Also, most of the times I want to pick ammo up, even if the left hand is extended, the protagonist picks up some other object (not even necessarily closer to him). So a crosshair might be a good idea, too.\n\nOther than that, no major issues. The graphics and the audio options work fine for me, no crashes, no lags, no errors so far. And about the much flamed voice acting: IT REALLY IS NOT THAT BAD (better than RE1 actually).","July 19, 2014","true","2.5"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","10","24","0","2"

But the first enemy i encountered (a incredibly goofy looking two headed zombie) took so many pistol shots that it rivaled on the border of insanity, whereupon i pulled out the rifle and killed him with one shot. Later i was confronted by not one but two of these buggers, in a very small shed no less. No biggie, i thought, they stand no chance against my rifle!\n\nabout 3 seconds later i had 2 health bars left because i was stunlocked by continuos attacks.\n\nThe game is also VERY much Pewdie-bait as many people have called out already. Within only 4 minutes of playing i found a note whereupon there was a pokemon card with Felix Kjellberg's (Also known as Pewdiepie) face on it. The collectibles taking the form of Felix's erstwhile companion Stephano definitely doesnt help, and only seems to slam down the otherwise great atmosphere this game builds.\n\nBut thats enough of the bad, why did i recommend this game?\n\nWell, the works really.\n\nIts one of the best horror games ive played since Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and thats saying a lot. The inclusion of guns into its gameplay at first left me a bit queezy, as i though we were going to be fighting slow moving zombies and the likes. But no, the guns feel old enough to give you a sense of dread even while holding them because they look unreliable.\n\nThe graphics theyve gotten out of the source engine are alright, but it's still obvious that they had to make some cuts here and there, and i say that literally.\n\nThe ressource management is cool, but the fact that you can only carry a certain amount of health kits is in my opinion a bad choice. The fact that when you reload you dont have a concrete ammo count, but rather a number of magazines, makes it even more hectic, when you dont know whether to reload and waste those last 3 bullets or keep them and maybe have to reload in the middle of a fight.\n\nI've gotta be honest, even if this game cost money i would tell people to get it, because it's certainly better than some *cough* sir you are being hunted *cough* horror games out there.\n\nBut alas, it's free, so go ahead and download it and have a good and scary time, i know i have so far.","July 18, 2014","true","0.6"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

The Forgotten Ones is a decent Horror game, its not a very foreboding horror game like Dead Space or Amnesia, but more of a jump scare horror game in my opinion. I believe there is even a feature to add your own custom story. Overall I recommend The Forgotten Ones if you are looking for a free horror game, it is sure to last you at least a few hours of playtime.\n\nEdit: A warning though, I am sure that at least at some point in game you will probably be more frustrated with The Forgotten Ones than horrified, some of the game mechanics are questionable at best.\n\nNote: Lots of meme and "youtuber" references in here for some reason, alot of people dont like that, but to each there own.","August 5, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Off the bat, I was very impressed with the musical score. The graphics are very 2008, but I do like some of the developer's ingenuity. Aside from a few annoying sound effects that overlapped the quiet introduction dialogue, I was rather impressed with the voice acting. Especially for an Indie game! In keeping with the general theme, every character you meet has a rather comical German/Russian blend of an accent. The ambient sound is very impressive, even in the opening office sequence. I really enjoyed hearing the busy bustle of paperwork, doors opening and closing, and muted conversations from parties unknown. Following a (seemingly) pointless optional food run for a co-worker, a strange angle view of my own car driving, and then a short GTA run in the ol' shaggin' wagon, I entered a hotel and promptly encountered a lightning fast enemy. Tracking it eventually upstairs and to a room, I promptly died when my underpowered rifle failed to kill the mutant ♥♥♥♥er that was gutting me. That became my main issue with the game: playability. If you're an experienced PC gamer, I really do reccomend trying this game for yourself. I just got too frustrated with the overpowered enemies and underpowered weapons. 7/10 for indie spirit!","December 28, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There really isn't a story line to anything. You start off in the police station with, no map. Though, for me, I prefer games without maps where I can go explore, this game you can explore in so that gives it a plus. You can navigate your vehicle, though I was disappointed that I could not choose the prettier maroon car in the beginning, driving is another plus. If you are someone that likes to explore every inch of your area, this is the game for you. There are side roads to wander down, abandoned restrooms, etc. Combat is typical first person, though when an enemy is right infront of you and hitting you, it is difficult to kill it. Best tactic I have developed to successfully get away, back up while shooting and use iron sight (right mouse button). It does take several rounds to kill a monster so leave yourself room to move while you reload. I have not finished the game, I am still battling one creature, one of which I killed then I died right after killing it, annoying. But, it's a decent enough game, though I only recommend it to those willing to get angry at playing.","July 27, 2014","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To be able to call it a survival horror first the player needs to be able to survive the monster, in this case the monster is just too quick and strong to out run and fight.\n3) The guns are too weak. The guns might as well be firing blanks as the guns seem to do no damage at all to the monsters, it neither hinders them nor weakens their attack.\n4) When trying to pick up ammo the player seems to grab the most useless item first, this causes to fling the ammunition accross the room and into some small crevice out of reach.\n\nPlease fix these minor problems and then I'll recommend this game, thank you.","July 22, 2014","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the time, I had to keep on trying to change the settings around to see if that would aid in me playing the game.\n\nThe game is formed around the Half Life 2 engine (source engine), which reflects the price of the game, free.... With that being said, the problems with Source have been here for most source based games. This game is no different, the game bugs out whenever the [alt]+[tab] combo is used. And changing the settings around will only make it bug up even more. After changing some of the settings around, it caused the game to freeze. I had to restart the game and it looped through the title sequence for 10 minutes before I was forced to close it down again. The game is unpredictable with the mechanics and it is really clunky. You can get caught on lots of objects, making the game really disastrous. The loading screen is extremely long to the fact that I could use the restroom and still have time left on the loading. For something that is not complex, the title sequence is not doing it justice.\n\nThe audio levels are messed up beyond comprehension. You can hear another character on the phone, but then the audio gets quieter when the main character starts to talk back to that individual.\n\nIf you die, there is a second or two delay for the death screen to appear. This paired with the fact that the game has no real direction (you are not really informed where to go), hinders the game completely. Subtitles are completely off with the audio at certain points, and the interface with the shop keeper at the beginning is completely unreadable due to the bug.\n\nThis is a free version of the SlenderMan : The Arrival, but it mirrors so much of the slender series that once you play Slender, you cannot go back to these types of games. SlenderMan redefined this type of gameplay, but this game completely mocks the genre. They should have spent funds on making their own engine instead of making a free game with the sub-par Source Engine.\n","April 11, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Again! It doesn't do either of these things poorly. The music is spooky enough without being to much of a distraction, it's raining, it tends to be dark and gloomy wherever you are, and even though the jump scare shouts sound like someone screamed "Bleh!" into the microphrone while gagging on their lunch, the environment you walk through helps to keep them a little bit jumpy.\n\nYou receive a hammer pretty early on in this game. Unless you have a bed to jump on or a barrel to hide behind, it is the least useful weapon in the game (at least as far as I got in the game). If you attempt to pulverize the first two-headed monstrosity you come across, he and his conjoined friend will rip into you like Edward Scissor hands into a shrubbery. Thankfully, two heads prove worse than one, and a carefully positioned protagonist can kill the monster from around the corner with no threat except wasting a bullet. When the game advises you to think outside the box, what it means is the monsters are incapable toothpicks operated by a puppetmaster having a seizure. It may take a few more minutes to mash their brains in when hiding behind an obstacle, but you save a few bullets for those times when a 'surprise jump scare!' monster is right around the corner.\n\nSo as far as action is concerned, which would be the most salient component of this game, it is sorely lacking in intensity: the cookie-cutter monsters all die when shot/stabbed/bashed enough; monsters appear at predictable intervals; the stiffness of the monsters lessens the scariness.\n\nIf you're interested in save and retry experiences where you have to anticipate the monster and reload when it kills you, you may enjoy this game. It is haunting, in a sense, the jump scares are good, I'm just not interested in the action portions, which feel deadened to me.\n\nStill not really sure what the plot was supposed to be other than "Big creepy evil guy does creepy evil things go!"","December 13, 2014","false","1.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the time, I had to keep on trying to change the settings around to see if that would aid in me playing the game.\n\nThe game is formed around the Half Life 2 engine (source engine), which reflects the price of the game, free.... With that being said, the problems with Source have been here for most source based games. This game is no different, the game bugs out whenever the [alt]+[tab] combo is used. And changing the settings around will only make it bug up even more. After changing some of the settings around, it caused the game to freeze. I had to restart the game and it looped through the title sequence for 10 minutes before I was forced to close it down again. The game is unpredictable with the mechanics and it is really clunky. You can get caught on lots of objects, making the game really disastrous. The loading screen is extremely long to the fact that I could use the restroom and still have time left on the loading. For something that is not complex, the title sequence is not doing it justice.\n\nThe audio levels are messed up beyond comprehension. You can hear another character on the phone, but then the audio gets quieter when the main character starts to talk back to that individual.\n\nIf you die, there is a second or two delay for the death screen to appear. This paired with the fact that the game has no real direction (you are not really informed where to go), hinders the game completely. Subtitles are completely off with the audio at certain points, and the interface with the shop keeper at the beginning is completely unreadable due to the bug.\n\nThis is a free version of the SlenderMan : The Arrival, but it mirrors so much of the slender series that once you play Slender, you cannot go back to these types of games. SlenderMan redefined this type of gameplay, but this game completely mocks the genre. They should have spent funds on making their own engine instead of making a free game with the sub-par Source Engine.\n","April 11, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There really isn't a story line to anything. You start off in the police station with, no map. Though, for me, I prefer games without maps where I can go explore, this game you can explore in so that gives it a plus. You can navigate your vehicle, though I was disappointed that I could not choose the prettier maroon car in the beginning, driving is another plus. If you are someone that likes to explore every inch of your area, this is the game for you. There are side roads to wander down, abandoned restrooms, etc. Combat is typical first person, though when an enemy is right infront of you and hitting you, it is difficult to kill it. Best tactic I have developed to successfully get away, back up while shooting and use iron sight (right mouse button). It does take several rounds to kill a monster so leave yourself room to move while you reload. I have not finished the game, I am still battling one creature, one of which I killed then I died right after killing it, annoying. But, it's a decent enough game, though I only recommend it to those willing to get angry at playing.","July 27, 2014","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Im not quite sure if theres more than one level all i know is as you progress further and further into the game it gets ♥♥♥♥♥ier and ♥♥♥♥♥ier! You start off in some town and your first job is to get food for some dude. then you go to your car and theres a painfully slow cut scene that you cant skip. Then I didnt realise that after the cut scene you can continue to drive the car. Anyways, you go to this building and you get a torch and theres a buch of dead bodies inside the bathroom but if you look in the stalls you see peoples feet and can hear them. anyways... So then theres a house and you get your supplies like a gun, a key, and some ammo and a hammer. then after getting the key you walk out and this flying who-who-the-♥♥♥♥-knows-what flys across the room... like WTF?!? so you leave and go to a house. well you use the key to get in and as soon as you walk in youre greeted by an ♥♥♥ hole who asks you some question and no matter your answer he dies but then while hes talking some weird ♥♥♥ creater pops up and screams and youre like "alright..." wo you start to slear all the rooms and theres a creature and it pulls some scooby doo ♥♥♥♥ with the doors. then you get the the top floor and this two headed ♥♥♥♥ing creature charges threw the door with kniffs and if you dont have the rifle, basically he butt ♥♥♥♥s you... but if ou manage to kill it, save the game, because after you drop through the hole youll be greeted by another one who runs around the corner and again if you dont have the rifle, it butt ♥♥♥♥s you again but atleast this time on a bed. So if you manage to kill it, you proceed outside where theres a guy standing in the window. well he disapears, and you go inside and can take a lantern and some like baby with a knife in it pops up on screan then goes away. well if you were smart like myself and closed the door, you have visitors! there are 2 of those two headed butt ♥♥♥♥ers waiting outside for you! good luck because it takes a ♥♥♥♥ing clip to kill their asses and you dont have enough time to reload!

At the beginning, it felt like a free-to-roam kind of feel when I was able to step out of the car to discover hidden items in the bathroom, or the small cottage at the right of the house. I like that kind of thing. However, there are actually a few bugs here and there that still need a bit of fixing:\n\n- It doesn't happen often, but whenever I go through the right door in the courtyard that leads to the staircase, it leads me back out into the courtyard for some reason. When I go back in, it leads me to a dark room where I get stuck and have to load the game at my last save point.\n\n- Another sticky situation is when I get out certain doors still holding "Shift + W", and get stuck on the handles in the center of the mansion.\n\n- Doesn't happen often, but when the butler (I forgot his name) of the mansion speaks about waiting and not to do anything stupid, I hit him with my hammer, and he just wonders off not getting hit by the rushing monster that's supposed to attack him.\n\nDespite the bugs/glitches:\n\nPros:\n\n- Variety of weapons\n- Free horror game\n- Atmospheric\n\nCons:\n\n- Short\n- Enemies seem to be... twitchy-like\n- Hitting a wall or object with a melee weapon displays bullet shots\n\nI hope in the sequel (if there's going to be one) provides longer gameplay.","March 15, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is very good for the ambiance and the graphics are outstanding.  The game is a little confusing at start, but once you get the hang of it, the game has me hooked.  There is a small learning curve to how to movement, but easy to catch on.\n\nPros: 1) Stunning music to go with this type of game.\n2) Graphics are outstanding, even it's dark.\n3) Movement is easy with a small learning curve.\n4) Good storyline so far, excellent job.\n\nCons: 1) The graphics can be a bit choppy.\n2) A little laggy at times, and confusing to where to go.\n3) Save places are hard to find at times (might be just part of the game though).\n\nFor people who want a good game with a good storyline and re-learn gameplay, this is great.  For those who want a 'run 'n'gun' game, this is not the best for you unless you want to move to something different.  I love the game so far, and am really glad Greenlight gave it a go.  I hope that more people will give this game a try, the stunning work involved making it and it hard to step away, even you are just looking at the graphics in the game.  Way to go group- keep up the work!\n\n-Fox\n\n\n*Edit-\nThe zombies that come at you are more like cut & paste critters, and they are a lot faster than you could be.  The lack of ammo makes it very difficult to beat them, even with a -few- headshots to them.  I still like the idea, don't get me wrong.  Developers put a lot of work in the feel of the game, it just needs some refining.\n\n-Fox","October 29, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean, for a horror shooter, it's alright.\n\nOkay, essentially, this is a more modern version of Nightmare House 2, only with Nazis and a freak ton of weapons. While it does play nicely, the enemies are very mean. I remember when I first saw one of the enemies zip by in the hotel, I thought, "He better not be that fast..." To my surprise, he wasn't; he was just SLIGHTLY slower. These enemies can gain on you in no time flat, so you better have ammo and a lot of stamina. Plus, they seem really Cry of Fear like in the animations.\n\nThe story is cool, though. Test subject of a Nazi scientist seeks revenge and has to fight demons and other abominations.\n\nWhile I don't like the Resident Evil styled collection system (Go to far side of map, get item, traverse back to other side of map to activate something that is all the way back across from where you found the item), it's still okay. For what it is, I suggest you get it. It's fun.","December 13, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dont get me wrong.  The idea that he would create a game of this nature and plot wise I think was very cool.  But when writing a post of a review of a game one should at least attempt to way the pros and the cons of the game to provide real feedback.\n\nThe plot was good.  But there are many lets say, bugs in the game.  The game itself needs some serious fine tuning before I would go ahead and give it a thumbs up.  I might be a dumbass and admit that I could not figure out how to grab stuff at the first part of the game, or even what to do.  the options settings does not explain enough at the beginning of the game to gain a full and complete understanding of the controls or what was even needing to be required before moving on.  Sometimes when writing parts of a game, one forgets that they are not just writing the game for ones self but for others to play it, so as the desinger obviously had a clear and precise idea of what he wanted to accomplish, in the end I think he just missed the crucial part of others that had no idea what was in his head when he planned each area step by step.  And if one plays a game beyond the point of interest, the game never gets finished.  Clarify points of interest in the game and have better tutorials and I think it might turn out to be a very cool game in the end.  But for now I have to say I would not recommend this game.","March 25","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well if you consider different voices and a change of wardrobe good, you clearly need to have your definition of good checked. Seriously.

That said, the game is wholly broken. Unbalanced weapons, horrible AI, confusing/tedious puzzles, plot holes, etc. This game is hard to get through due to the fact that it provides little direction in where you need to go and what you need to do. Certain key items are used in places where you wouldn't expect to use them. Other times items you'd think would be useful in a situation have no use at all.\n\nBut again, the creator is working on this game as we speak and I'm thankful for that. Because of it, I'd recommend The Forgotten Ones. It's a complicated mess, but it's slowly but surely "getting there".","February 2","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dont get me wrong.  The idea that he would create a game of this nature and plot wise I think was very cool.  But when writing a post of a review of a game one should at least attempt to way the pros and the cons of the game to provide real feedback.\n\nThe plot was good.  But there are many lets say, bugs in the game.  The game itself needs some serious fine tuning before I would go ahead and give it a thumbs up.  I might be a dumbass and admit that I could not figure out how to grab stuff at the first part of the game, or even what to do.  the options settings does not explain enough at the beginning of the game to gain a full and complete understanding of the controls or what was even needing to be required before moving on.  Sometimes when writing parts of a game, one forgets that they are not just writing the game for ones self but for others to play it, so as the desinger obviously had a clear and precise idea of what he wanted to accomplish, in the end I think he just missed the crucial part of others that had no idea what was in his head when he planned each area step by step.  And if one plays a game beyond the point of interest, the game never gets finished.  Clarify points of interest in the game and have better tutorials and I think it might turn out to be a very cool game in the end.  But for now I have to say I would not recommend this game.","March 25","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is very good for the ambiance and the graphics are outstanding.  The game is a little confusing at start, but once you get the hang of it, the game has me hooked.  There is a small learning curve to how to movement, but easy to catch on.\n\nPros: 1) Stunning music to go with this type of game.\n2) Graphics are outstanding, even it's dark.\n3) Movement is easy with a small learning curve.\n4) Good storyline so far, excellent job.\n\nCons: 1) The graphics can be a bit choppy.\n2) A little laggy at times, and confusing to where to go.\n3) Save places are hard to find at times (might be just part of the game though).\n\nFor people who want a good game with a good storyline and re-learn gameplay, this is great.  For those who want a 'run 'n'gun' game, this is not the best for you unless you want to move to something different.  I love the game so far, and am really glad Greenlight gave it a go.  I hope that more people will give this game a try, the stunning work involved making it and it hard to step away, even you are just looking at the graphics in the game.  Way to go group- keep up the work!\n\n-Fox\n\n\n*Edit-\nThe zombies that come at you are more like cut & paste critters, and they are a lot faster than you could be.  The lack of ammo makes it very difficult to beat them, even with a -few- headshots to them.  I still like the idea, don't get me wrong.

I mean, for a horror shooter, it's alright.\n\nOkay, essentially, this is a more modern version of Nightmare House 2, only with Nazis and a freak ton of weapons. While it does play nicely, the enemies are very mean. I remember when I first saw one of the enemies zip by in the hotel, I thought, "He better not be that fast..." To my surprise, he wasn't; he was just SLIGHTLY slower. These enemies can gain on you in no time flat, so you better have ammo and a lot of stamina. Plus, they seem really Cry of Fear like in the animations.\n\nThe story is cool, though. Test subject of a Nazi scientist seeks revenge and has to fight demons and other abominations.\n\nWhile I don't like the Resident Evil styled collection system (Go to far side of map, get item, traverse back to other side of map to activate something that is all the way back across from where you found the item), it's still okay.

Off the bat, I was very impressed with the musical score. The graphics are very 2008, but I do like some of the developer's ingenuity. Aside from a few annoying sound effects that overlapped the quiet introduction dialogue, I was rather impressed with the voice acting. Especially for an Indie game! In keeping with the general theme, every character you meet has a rather comical German/Russian blend of an accent. The ambient sound is very impressive, even in the opening office sequence. I really enjoyed hearing the busy bustle of paperwork, doors opening and closing, and muted conversations from parties unknown. Following a (seemingly) pointless optional food run for a co-worker, a strange angle view of my own car driving, and then a short GTA run in the ol' shaggin' wagon, I entered a hotel and promptly encountered a lightning fast enemy. Tracking it eventually upstairs and to a room, I promptly died when my underpowered rifle failed to kill the mutant ♥♥♥♥er that was gutting me. That became my main issue with the game: playability. If you're an experienced PC gamer, I really do reccomend trying this game for yourself. I just got too frustrated with the overpowered enemies and underpowered weapons. 7/10 for indie spirit!","December 28, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I launch game on computer, game crashes. Open task manager and find that game is Half Life 2 mod, which is a game I do not own. So I launch it on my bfs computer and it works fine. Which was annoying as hell.\n\nStory is hard to follow, a ceiling fan killed me, car got stuck on top of a fence, enemy spawn is super annoying...game play is quite repetitive.\n\nGame includes achievements for finding Slenderman and Justin Bieber. Wat.\n\nThe Forgotten Ones is playable, and you get what you'd expect for a F2P game. Wouldn't recommend to someone looking for a horror game with a decent plot, though.\n\n\n\n\n","June 30, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is very good for the ambiance and the graphics are outstanding.  The game is a little confusing at start, but once you get the hang of it, the game has me hooked.  There is a small learning curve to how to movement, but easy to catch on.\n\nPros: 1) Stunning music to go with this type of game.\n2) Graphics are outstanding, even it's dark.\n3) Movement is easy with a small learning curve.\n4) Good storyline so far, excellent job.\n\nCons: 1) The graphics can be a bit choppy.\n2) A little laggy at times, and confusing to where to go.\n3) Save places are hard to find at times (might be just part of the game though).\n\nFor people who want a good game with a good storyline and re-learn gameplay, this is great.  For those who want a 'run 'n'gun' game, this is not the best for you unless you want to move to something different.  I love the game so far, and am really glad Greenlight gave it a go.  I hope that more people will give this game a try, the stunning work involved making it and it hard to step away, even you are just looking at the graphics in the game.  Way to go group- keep up the work!\n\n-Fox\n\n\n*Edit-\nThe zombies that come at you are more like cut & paste critters, and they are a lot faster than you could be.  The lack of ammo makes it very difficult to beat them, even with a -few- headshots to them.  I still like the idea, don't get me wrong.  Developers put a lot of work in the feel of the game, it just needs some refining.\n\n-Fox","October 29, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dont get me wrong.  The idea that he would create a game of this nature and plot wise I think was very cool.  But when writing a post of a review of a game one should at least attempt to way the pros and the cons of the game to provide real feedback.\n\nThe plot was good.  But there are many lets say, bugs in the game.  The game itself needs some serious fine tuning before I would go ahead and give it a thumbs up.  I might be a dumbass and admit that I could not figure out how to grab stuff at the first part of the game, or even what to do.  the options settings does not explain enough at the beginning of the game to gain a full and complete understanding of the controls or what was even needing to be required before moving on.  Sometimes when writing parts of a game, one forgets that they are not just writing the game for ones self but for others to play it, so as the desinger obviously had a clear and precise idea of what he wanted to accomplish, in the end I think he just missed the crucial part of others that had no idea what was in his head when he planned each area step by step.  And if one plays a game beyond the point of interest, the game never gets finished.  Clarify points of interest in the game and have better tutorials and I think it might turn out to be a very cool game in the end.  But for now I have to say I would not recommend this game.","March 25","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It starts off with a story. Not a very well developed story... but it is enough to make you jump at every sound and movement and constantly watch your back. When I did meet my first enemy, I nearly slammed my mouse into my wall, which is a good 2 feet away. The gameplay mechanics take a little while to get used to but they are not bad ones. The amount of ammo that they give you is pretty good until you start encountering more enemies, then it slowly drains because you jump and fire off half your shots at the sky in terror.

I launch game on computer, game crashes. Open task manager and find that game is Half Life 2 mod, which is a game I do not own. So I launch it on my bfs computer and it works fine. Which was annoying as hell.\n\nStory is hard to follow, a ceiling fan killed me, car got stuck on top of a fence, enemy spawn is super annoying...game play is quite repetitive.\n\nGame includes achievements for finding Slenderman and Justin Bieber. Wat.\n\nThe Forgotten Ones is playable, and you get what you'd expect for a F2P game.

The worst thing is the combat my god the combat it's stiff and just dosent work and all the guns do no damage making it really unfair and hard and almost unplayable the next bad thing is the pacing it's really slow and fells like nothing happens the intro to the game is to long and the starting place was horrible i was stuck for 30 min cause i could not find the key to get out the aparment next time i restared the game i found the keyes the game forgot to spawn them oh well can happen to any game also the voice acting is horrible the main character is supose to be russian but its clearly an american puting on a bad accent lot's people complained aboout the pewdiepie easter egg so they had to take that away i did not mind tho i thought it was funny. I don't wanna hate on this game cause it is a cool game and concept the combat pacing and voice acting just ruins it i know it's free and im asking alot but still if you're planing on downloding the game don't no mater if it is free i would wait for it to get updated if it ever gets updated that is. It could be a good game i mean the part in the beginning when you go in to the house and something flys past you're screen and makes a noise and all you have is a pistol so you're scared to go foward cause you saw that something bad went past it needs some serious work on the combat and some faster pacing and some objectivs that tell you what you need to do and where you need to go that would help alot since it's a free game i can put up with the voice acting if it gets some loveing it could be good game but as it stands no stay away.\n","December 26, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The beginning of the game has a few spooks, but as the game goes on these spooks get less effective as you get used to it. However, that does not subtract from the games fun factor. The puzzles and atmosphere of the game are both great. I really like the game's concept and while the story is perfect, it still fits in with its concept appropriately. The monsters are pretty spooky and that goes well with the game. The beginning of the story however is very vague as you pick up the phone, some guy tells you where to go and you're off. I would've loved to see a more cooperative story.\n\nI also understand that this game has changed A LOT since its first release, and when I looked at other versions I've seen how different it is compared to the version I downloaded. The game is also very short and that rather upsets me. I have 4 hours total time on the game when I finished my first play through, and that may be shorter as I had to restart from a certian point. I really would've loved a longer game.\n\nNow I'd like to dedicate a paragraph to Dr. Schienzel. His accent sounds more Russian then German, even though he's mean't to be a Nazi physiscian. His uniform is a bit messed up. His uniform doesn't look that might like a German uniform and more like a party costume of a German soldier. His collar tabs are on his shoulders and on his collar are no collar tabs (its the small details that count). And if Schienzel worked at a concentration camp as Josef Mengele's right hand man, wouldn't he be in the SS like Mengele was, not the army? And the painting in the main mansion hall, is that mean't to be Schienzel? I ask this because thats a painting of Josef Mengele, or is it mean't to be Schienzel honouring his boss?\\n\nLook to give an overall conclusion, I found this a very fun game to play. While not the most horror oriented game, still great to play. "To be continued". I can't wait until this game gets a sequel.\nGG","April 22","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But other than that it is a fantastic game, and I would definitely recommend that you give it a try with a friend, especially if you are a fan of horror/adventure games. I wouldn't mind paying a few dollars for it, if some more time was put into the game mechanics. This is a great game for such a low budget. Great Job!","May 3","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has alot of cons, like the unclear plot line and the dodgy glitches but for a free game it's one of the best. It has more atmosphere of the mysterious and Bohemian post World War 2 Europe than you can shake a stick out of, which is consistent throughout the entire game, and is undeniably chilling. And who realy cares if there are a few Pewdiepie references?","April 8","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Co-op? The only good tag for this game is Indie. And bad Indie at that... Controls are hard to use. Only certain parts of an item/door can be pressed. Yet for a 1st person shooter that it has claimed to be, there is nothing to mark the center.","May 30","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Disclaimer: I can still sleep at night, I think. Any way, I would say this game deserves a 3/10 for realistic movement as it is very "gmod animation like" but the items,vehicles,buildings,etc. are actually (in my opinion) a 8/10 in "general realisticness". The gameplay is also an amazingly well done asset. I would give it a 10/10 for as far as I've gotten. Overall, because this game is so well made in the other assets, the realistic movement is EXTREMLY outweighed and doesnt even matter. I give this game a total rating of 9/10. I personally wish the best of luck to anybody planning on playing this game as you might become a hermit looking for more games like this one.","May 22","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
