I picked this up in the Apogee pack, most of which I had as shareware when I was a child.  I am of course much older than the demographic audience now, and I had a blast with this game when I was a kid. It's still a very challenging platformer at higher difficulty because the game has quite a bit of depth for players who which to go for the perfect run, The RNG can be a bit unfair at times and the nature of the monsters not moving off screen seems unfair at first, but this can be used to your own advantage when you are out of ammunition. Matching images while spelling out words (much like spelling out NUKEM in Duke Nukem 1&2, it must be in order)  still trips me up from time to time. So the game gives you a good amount to keep track of at a higher difficultly. The music is pleasant, and none of it is phoned in. My only complaint is that 'Orange', because of the EGA pallet, appears red. Definitly a buy for a young child, and a welcome addition if you are looking for something to trip you up mentally as you try to remember where NOT to drop into a mismatching image, which spoils your run, wastes you ammo, and potentially can kill you.","May 19, 2015","true","4.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

There are worst Apogee games for learning English.\n\nIf, like me, you're in it for the nostalgia, I suppose it will do it for you. I had fun strolling down memory lane while playing it. It's dated, yes, it has that old DOS platformer feel to it that you'll either find charming or dated and annoying.\n\nThe game ran smoothly for me, though it did suffer from some lag issues. The soundtrack is not exactly the finest the video game world has to offer, so I had no trouble muting it and listening to other music as I played. The lag still became annoying when trying to make jumps, though.\n\nPersonally, I prefer this game to Math Rescue, which sounds dumb considering they're essentially the same game, but I think it comes down to two reasons - A) I have much more nostalgia for this game which I played way more than Math Rescue back in the day and, B) I've always preferred English to mathematics.\n\nThe game is kinda easier than Math Rescue, mainly due to having way less enemies, but neither game is exactly going to test your might as a gamer. Also, Math Rescue had "puzzles", for lack of a better term, that required you to think. Word Rescue, however, just says "Match the word to the picture." The only real "challenge" is not accidentally landing on the wrong picture by mistake.\n\nIf you're not in it to bring back some childhood memories of being in school and waiting for computer class to begin so you could play the likes of this and Math Circus, you're not going to enjoy it. If you are, I'd say the €5 is worth it.","April 15","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Used a picture already? Doesn't matter, that picture will continue to appear. Trying to dodge an enemy by jumping, or trying to speed your approach to a picture you need by falling? You'll probably hit a picture you didn't mean to, which means another enemy spawn. Touched an enemy? Hey, you get to start the level all over from the start. Want to run along those rooftops? Too bad -- you better jump, because if you take one step you'll fall through! Finished the level? Hooray, you get to sit through an overly-long door unlocking animation... and still might die on your way out (helloooo start of the level!).\n\nI'll say it again: even for the period, this is an outright bad platformer. Don't bother, unless you are looking to scratch a serious nostalgia itch.","November 8, 2015","false","0.2"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","3","14","0","0"
