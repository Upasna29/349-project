If you don't like games without goals, this is not the one for you. Shu's Garden is one of those peaceful games with an enjoyable and colorful world. It's a game you can play to relax, relieve stress, and just forget about your day to day life. A game doesn't need an end and I think people forget that. In this game one must travel and encounter unique events on their own randomly. There is no goal, it's just a nice free roam. The game features gravity, allowing the player to jump to new planets. The music is enjoyable and doesn't annoy after a while. If you need a little relaxing escape, this game will not disappoint.","August 11, 2015","true","1.8"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","40","41","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/urnbont/recommended/393350/","urnbont","dangerhighdoltage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/urnbont/","1541 products in account","Shu is pretty darn adorable, fuzzy-wuzzy and spreading seeds all about.  You get to play as a furry yo-yo bouncing between planets in a sort of 2D Super Mario Galaxy way - except no stars or mustaches.  While some say the game is a chill experience, I personally felt it leans toward something a very young child would enjoy with a parent.  There are no goals or levels to finish, instead you just explore, eat, plant seeds, and bounce about.  I happen to have a 7 year old daughter, so we gave it a nice long gameplay due to the all ages rating.\n\nFiring up the game you have some options to jump from one character to the next.  A few other of Shu's cousins, a turtle, a giraffe with very stiff joints, and a bee.  Of those the easiest to move around is the bee, but it's not very interactive compared to the rest.  The turtle and giraffe controls were stiff in our opinion.  We generally enjoyed playing as the Shu family and would eat plants, jump from planet to planet, and sow seeds repeatedly.\n\nMy daughter was surprised there were no levels or goals. She was actually a bit confused when I explained it to her.  She bounced and ate trees for a half hour or so, but when I turned on my controller to play co-op with her the game took on a new dimension.  It was immediately clear to her that now we could play hide and seek!  That went on for an hour as I would jump to the farthest planet and she had to figure out where in the galaxy I went.  With the vegetation looking a bit similar, it's wasn't obvious where I would land.  A few times she got upset and I switched her to the bee so she could find me easier.  The best moments were when we collided into each other while bouncing around.  That was a little girl giggle-fest. :-)\n\nWith the brightly colored art direction, well done controller ( xbox ) handling, and charm I'd say this is a good title to get if you are either a parent looking for a fun game experience with your child, or someone who enjoys non-objective gaming.  If you don't like games without goals or levels, I'd steer clear away.  It's just not a game with goals in mind.  As for age range, I think somewhere around 6 or under is probably going to hold their interest the longest.  Have fun playing hide and seek if you can.\n\nDisclosure:  a review key was provided by the developer","January 31","true","1.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","2"

I really didn't see much else to do in the game.\n- Lacks content, after about 15mins I didn't see anything else of interest\n\nI'd reccomend this to those looking for a relaxing experience or for people who are new to gaming and want a very easy game to delve into.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeadshotToTheFace/recommended/393350/","HeadshotToTheFace","It's Dingle!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeadshotToTheFace/","603 products in account",""Um......" that was the first thing I said after playing this game. It is really rather strange. The art is kinda cool and the music is sorta neat. But there are no instructions, guide lines or goals at all. I know thats really part of the point of the game, but there really isn't much to do in the game and it doesn't capture my attention at all. It's almost like they tried to do what Proteus did and make a kind of anti-game where there are no goals, no objectives, no story, no instructions, and nothing to do but look and listen. Proteus got away with this because there was a sence of wonder and mystery. It made you want to go explore and see the world. In this I couldn't find that element of wonder so I lost intrest very quickly. I'm not sure the game is worth $4.99 so I can't recomend it.\n\nEDIT\nI liked the game but I didn't like it enough to justify the 5 bucks.\n(I'm keeping the original post unedited for posterity and laughs; you don't have to read it.)","August 11, 2015","false","0.1"," 13 of 57 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","13","57","0","6"
