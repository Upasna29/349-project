"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zulmetefza/recommended/40420/","zulmetefza","zulmetefza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zulmetefza/","1229 products in account","It is awesome.\n\nIf there is a thing which is under appreciated in Steam, it is this game. I know it sounds a bit exaggerated but it is not. If you like Match-3 games, you will definitely enjoy this one. And if you don't like those games? You may enjoy this if you have any friend that enjoys those games. Since it has local coop, with different players for keyboard and mouse.  Yeah, it is that unique.Sounds non-playable? It is not. I have tried doing the missions with my sister.\n\nFirst of all, I should explain what is going on here. Tidalis is built upon a very unique mechanic called streams. Normally, in a match 3 game, you are supposed to check out the screen for any connected same colour areas, or try to create them. While you are at it, you also try to calculate the next steps, for that looking above from your next move's location would be enough. Each step is basically the same thing, algorithm generates new blocks to ensure there will be next move, while you are supposed to find the next move. In a sense, this is what makes match 3 games a bit puzzle like.\n\nTidalis is more hardcore than that. Being connected does not ensure your move will be resulting in erasing those blocks. You actually have to rotate them conveniently, so that once you make a move which resulting a stream, stream would pass all the same colours. What is more, streams does not stop when they encounter a different colour. They move up to two squares, searching for a block with the colour of its origin. Sounds confusing? It is a bit confusing. So, basically, you are not trying to build colour "areas" to eradicate the blocks, you are trying to build "pipelines" to ensure once you start a stream, it will travel as long as possible in the screen, touching as many as possible blocks with the same colour. So, it is quite possible to find a move destroying 200 blocks, even when they are non-connected.\n\nAnd like in match 3 games, it is also useful to think about the combos, what will happen when the new blocks fall below. But since all of the board is so interconnected when it comes to possible moves, if you are trying to be fast, you will definitely not be able to calculate all possible streams across all the board. If there is no time constraint, you can design your stream maze so that, with one click, you can erase all of the board. I guess you can see how Tidalis gets nearer to puzzle genre than your average Match 3 games. In some of the cases, there really is only one correct move, but it is not that it is the only possible one.\n\nWhat is more? There are two game modes in Tidalis, and also skirmish like thing, which u specify victory conditions to play the game at your pace. Non skirmish modes are Puzzle and Adventure. Puzzle mode is basically what the name implies. There is a board at your disposal, and you have only one move to make. If you choose the correct move, you will trigger a chain reaction, causing a new stream each time, clearing the screen. There wont be any falling down blocks from above. And you will win. It is that simple, and fits in the same game mechanics. To be honest, I finished like %20 of the all puzzle levels, it is not that they are not enjoyable, but I liked Adventure more.\n\nWhat about Adventure. In adventure, there are 115 levels. Each level has some specific objectives like, get a 10 combo, get 4000 points in 60 seconds, don't lose in x seconds etc. But as you progress through the levels, it gets even more complicated, since there are like 20 different new type of blocks, and around 15 special powers coming into play. There are also new board modes, which can alleviate the streams upwards, fill the screen with water and bubbles and blocks do swim in them, which can increase the gravity, so streams fall down much more faster etc. It will sound weird, but this is the first game that uses the objectives of the new level as a reward for the last level. Yes they are that different and unique in themselves. I was like, "oohhh what will happen in this mission" each time, and it kept me playing more once I passed a level.\n\nWhat is more. There is an inbuilt mission editor. There is not steam workshop, but developers used the forum to collect good puzzles to include them as additional missions. You can feel the love they put in their first such game. There is also a perfect extra adventure consisting of 65 levels which is done by OneMoreNameless. They are even better than the original game in terms of surprising the player with building upon existing mechanics, and telling a story with the missions.\n\nSo, why is this game overlooked by so many? First, they try to market this as if this is a casual game. It is not. I can assure you. It is not a casual game at all. After you learn what is going on, mostly there is not any tooltips to help you in your quest. They constantly change the mechanics, the objectives, correct heuristics to reach victory, the tempo, in short, there is not any constant thing in the game which will cause a casual experience. But since it is the first local coop match 3 puzzle game, I guess they tried to reach the general audience to build their customer base on that feature.\n\nAnd related to that, they used childlike graphics. Really bad graphics, that does not convey how intricate the mechanics are. And to add it up, the game has the worst story and plot twist one can imagine. Why is there even a story to this. I dont know. The story of whole game can be summarized with a punchline, other than that whole dialogs are nonsensical, even for children. The smartest character in the story has an IQ of 40. There is also a really bad "voiceover" which does not serve any purpose other than signalling who is speaking with a croak, or whine. The same croak everytime when a specific character talks. Ugh. It is really bad.\n\nI dont know whose idea was having a story, characters, and voice over is a must no matter how bad they are. But that person was wrong. This game would do so much better without the story, dialogs, and "voiceovers". Together with "casual" graphics, they undersell the game, definitely. There are so much going on under the surface.\n\nWhat can I add more for negative sides? There are not any bugs I am aware of, and I played this for more than 30 hours. But there may be a need for some tweaks here and there, I already reported them to developers, but they are not no-brainer tweaks, so to sum it up, technically game works perfect. So this was not a negative. What is negative is, balancing is a bit overlooked, there are more than one level (like 5ish) where success heavily depended on random generation of the board, and you wont succeed no matter how perfect your moves are. That might be a side effect on insisting random generation for a game with so many constraints, and I cant see a way of correcting it. But my job is not correcting this.\n\nWith all the caveats I mentioned, there really is a hidden gem over here. If you are good with trading and stuff, you might find this game from a trader for as cheap as 0.15 dollars, while I think it worths even full price. If you enjoy puzzle games or match 3 games, or both, you wont regret if you get this.","September 29, 2015","true","30.4"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","23","23","0","2"

I started playing this game thinking: "Well, if I got this game, might as well try it for a few minutes before I get bored and move on". Lesson learned: don't judge a book by its cover! This is an excellent addicting puzzle game with a new twist on match-3 and tetris, but definitely the best I've played of this genre! I don't even usually like match-3 or tetris games--this is for any puzzle lover! If you check how much time I spent on it, plus the fact that I've written 2 guides for it, you'll know I totally recommend this game!\n\nPros:\nAddicting new dynamics to match-3 and tetris, creating a really fresh gameplay experience\n115 adventure levels and 69+ puzzle/brainteaser levels (I've even found an extra 70-level fan-made adventure mode in their official forum)\nIncludes editor and you can exchange levels with fellow players\nColor-blind blocks available, as well as many other models if you don't like the original\nLovely piano BGM\nBeautiful background graphics\nA LOT of gameplay modes, each feeling unique, not just something to pretend there's more content (there are so many modes that you can't even find them all in the main adventure)\nCo-op mode with distinct gameplay\nYou can really feel the difficulty rise as you progress in the game\nHandicap options if you think the game is too easy/hard\nEven now the devs are always ready to support you here in Steam forums\nCons:\nYou need to send files outside the game to share levels\nThe game is definitely for adults, since it gets hard pretty quickly, but the theme and story is rather childish (you can skip the story, though)\nIt has a lot of unexplored potential, like the many game modes that weren't used\nPlaying online co-op mode is really hard, since it has barely any active community\nThere's so much terminology that it takes quite some time for you to get used to it (like "chains", "combos", and "color reaction")\nBought on / for: Indie Bundle 3 by GreenMan Gaming for an average of US$ 0.60 (R$ 1.47). Seriously, taking out the 10 hours of idling, I still paid less than 2 (dollar) cents for each hour of fun. Even taking the bus to the beach is more expensive! (not that we nerds ever do that) Even if I'd paid full price, it would've been worth it.","October 5, 2014","true","53.3"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","1"

A little like Tetris but much deeper. Its basic rule is to eliminate 3 blocks of the same colors. The difference is that the block is directional. Player have to adjust the direction of every block to chain the stream through as more blocks as possible. When a set of blocks is eliminated, one or more new streams appear to connect more blocks of different colors. The more sets of blocks are eliminated continuously, the more the combos are. This mechanics makes this game deep, complicated and engrossing. This game uses many different conditions to limit player's move, thus making it much more challenging. Finally, the background music is beautiful. Recommend if you just wanna relax peacefully.","December 10, 2013","true","3.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The cute visuals and music just seem to meld with each other creating a mesmorizing experience which you have to see and hear to believe.\n\nVisuals (9/10)  The tiles are very beautiful, and the colors are just right for a game such as this.  With the feature to change different styles of tiles, it just adds to the variety and niceness of the game.  The backgrounds are nice and clean, and the overall effects such as wisps when you make matches, the special tiles that change the aspect of the game are nicely done.\n\nMusic (9/10)  The music for this game is not overly thrilling, but it does add to the overal playing experience.  It may be a slight bit repetitive, but that's fine with a puzzler when sound is not all that you should experience when playing a game such as this.\n\ngameplay (8/10)  Yes, there are a truckload of different gameplay options such as sun/moon, gravity, water and even the staple of Zen.  When put together they just simply make a wonderful gaming experience. Some of the modes (even put together with other ones) can definitely make the game harder or easier, depending on which modes you have enabled.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 8.5/10 for the features it has.  I would definitely recommend this game to my friends if they want a good puzzle game that is both satisfying and difficult (if it needs to be).","March 9, 2014","true","10.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Tidalis is a supremely polished and smooth game that has a metric ton of features. The trailers and screens don't do justice to the sheer amount of content that the game contains, and it's a nice tonic when compared to the occasional Early Access flop that you see on Steam. There's clearly a lot of love that's gone into the creation of Tidalis.\n\nFans of puzzle games will find a lot to admire. The gameplay is very solid with a bewildering array of game options. The adventure mode doesn't take itself too seriously, has a decent sense of humour and is as challenging as you want it to be - handicap adjustments can be made at any time, though the default difficulty provides a good test without inducing baldness. The brainteasers offer another dimension, and the level editor is sound. Multiplayer is available in all modes and works well. Special mention to an excellent OST to round things off. Perhaps I'm sounding overly positive, but I was genuinely impressed with the level of quality that this game presented.\n\nThat being said, it's ultimately held up by its own genre limitation - if you're a puzzle game fan, particularly match-3 games, then fantastic! I'd urge you to pick this immediately. But for others, it might all get a tad too samey over the course of the game. Despite some varied gameplay mechanics, it all boils down to the same core principle at the end of the day, and if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea then it might not be worth it.\n\nI'd still recommend it as an excellent example of what a good puzzler is all about; depth, difficulty and variety.","May 12, 2014","true","32.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Blocks of various colors drop from the top of the board, and the player can click any block to cause a stream to move in the direction(s) the arrrow on the block points. If it hits one of the same color, it's redirected in the way ITS arrow points, up to 3 blocks each step. It's a simple premise, but Tidalis contains an almost limitless number of spins on this basic format with special modes, block types, speeds, gravity, and any number of other ways to mix up the formula. for the price which this game frequently goes for, it's absolutely worth the price.\n\nMy one negative aspect to this game is the adventure mode - it's very long, and a large number of the levels rely too heavily upon luck of what the board looks like in its initial state: many levels are only rarely winnable, so it can be frustrating to try to work your way through the campaign and have to restart a level repeatedly just to get favorable conditions.\n\nAt any rate, it's unique among match 3 games, so if you're looking for something that feels both familiar and unique, you should give this a look.","February 13, 2015","true","12.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It leads to the occasional brain-teaser, and is nicely done.\n\nThe music to the game is nice and restful, and the graphics are… well, it’s a tetris/bejeweled hybrid. Do NOT expect high end graphics. The background artwork is at turns nice and creepy though.

Tidalis is basically Tetris on steroids.\n\nLike Tetris, multi-colored blocks will fall down your screen at regular intervals. If you match up the blocks correctly they'll be cleared, but if too many blocks stack up (to the top of your screen) you lose. But that is where the similarity ends.\n\nIn Tidalis you create "streams" to clear your blocks, and with clever positioning it's possible to use streams to clear blocks all across the play area. As blocks are cleared more streams can be created allowing you to create combos that give you extra points. It's really cool to plan out a chain reaction and see it pay off!\n\nAlso, there are about two dozen special blocks to spice up gameplay. Some of these are generally helpful, such as a "quad repeater" -- if one stream goes into the repeater, four come out, meaning you can get some really nice chains or combos going. But some special blocks are generally unhelpful, such as an "idol" block, that will halve the score of any chain that touches it. Usually there are only 1 or 2 special blocks used per level, and you're given a briefing on exactly what they do before the level starts. This is good as it prevents players from getting overwhelmed from the sheer variety possible.\n\nSpeaking of variety, there are a ton of different victory conditions to keep things fresh. Remember how I said that quad repeater blocks are generally good? Well how about a level with quad repeaters where the victory condition is to score the smallest chains possible, and the loss condition is to score too many large chains? In that level you'd actually want your streams to avoid the quad repeaters to keep your chains from getting too big!\n\nThere are also items that you can use in some levels, for example one item will remove several blocks from the play area and put them in your inventory, allowing you to re-arrange them at your leisure.\n\nThere are also many different game modes. For example in "Graviton" game mode your streams are affected by gravity, meaning they do not go up as far, but they go down much further.\n\nFortunately there are several tutorials for this game, and a Custom Game mode where you can experiment with all the multitude of options.\n\nThere is also a Versus mode where you play against other human players, and a Co-operative mode where you work with other human players to beat a level! There is a level editor included so you can create your own levels from scratch!\n\nFinally, there is Adventure mode, which is the main single-player campaign. Whoever heard of a Tetris-genre puzzle game having a single-player campaign with a storyline??? I think that was a pretty nice treat. There are 115 levels in the campaign, with another 100+ optional "Brainteaser" levels. If you get stuck on a level you have the option to skip it, but I'm pleased to say I was able to make it through the whole campaign without having to skip any levels, so the difficulty level was about right. The Brainteaser levels are quite different from normal levels. In Brainteaser mode no blocks fall from the top of the screen, you are only allowed to create one stream, and you have unlimited time to postion your blocks and ponder your one move.\n\nI thought the soundtrack for the game was well done. It is a mix of both cheery and soothing piano tunes.\n\nIf there is one criticism it's that the single-player storyline seems to be geared towards young children, but the difficulty level of the puzzles is geared towards adults. But it's not good to be too critical on that point, I'm astounded the game had a storyline at all!\n\nIf you like Tetris-style games or really any puzzle games at all you should check out Tidalis.","May 18, 2014","true","33.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

What Would Appear to Be A Typical Match-Three Puzzle Game is Anything But Typical.Genre: Tactical Match Three Puzzle Game.\nDeveloped & Published by: Arcen Games\nPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nTidalis has a match-three mechanic in which you create "streams" to match blocks together. Instead of drawing matches, you initiate a stream from a single block in the direction you want it to go and match other blocks. Those blocks' direction can be changed on the fly and you will want to. These streams can be manipulated in all sorts of weight with gravity, obstacles, water and much more. It can be insane trying to achieve the objective(s) of each puzzle and there are a lot in the main campaign. This can create some rather unique combinations and mechanics that I haven't seen in any other match-three puzzle to date. There's a very long single player campaign and a silly multiplayer mode as well.\n\nPC Settings\nAll expected PC settings are here though resolution options are a bit funky. Its due to how the art is rendered and at high resolutions, the game will look smaller and vice versa. Multiplayer worked last I checked as its peer-to-peer and is pretty amusing for a puzzle game. Key bindings, AA, V-sync and more are included.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nTidalis was what started me into the hobby of reviewing games. As such, this review is not how I would do things today, but I'm leaving it up because it's important to know where I came from. I wrote the review in two parts. While it's rough around the edges and then some, I feel that it still holds up. But my final thoughts: This is my favorite traditional puzzle game to date. Tidalis has something both casual players and hardcore players can enjoy. The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is superb and the gameplay is well polished. There's a lot of variety and depth to the stream mechanic which is quite surprising. It's argued that the depth is its greatest weakness but if you're like me, and are tired of dull puzzlers, then you should give Tidalis a try. Recent updates have patched up any remaining bugs Tidalis had and gave it a Linux version as well.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Beta Review of Tidalis[kingisaaclinksr.com]\nTidalis 1.0 Review[kingisaaclinksr.com]","March 9, 2013","true","18.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But in fact I think that Tidalis isn't interesting enough to be honestly recommended, or maybe to only be to mega fans of puzzle games. Indeed, there are a lot of possibilities in the gameplay and the different modes and it can hold some players in front of the screen for a good time, but the difficulty is quite insane sometimes and very irregular all along the adventure.\nSome achievements are quite hard or at least very long to unlock, but you can get most of them by simply letting the game play by its own. Yes you're reading well: By its own. So where is the reward? In contrary, most of the hardest levels are useless in the adventure, rewarding nothing at all, and can easily be skipped if you lose (which will arrive quickly if it's hard).\nSo what is the purpose of this game? To beat some puzzles from time to time maybe, or literally go through the adventure, but clearly avoid playing too long at once, it could annoy you very quickly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/recommended/40420/","pogobeta","Pogo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/","467 products in account","Kind of a mess.\n\nIt's a little misleading when people compare this game to Bejeweled or Tetris in any sense that suggests it might be a "clone" of one of those games. Yes, blocks drop in from the top of the screen and are arranged in a grid, but that just sets it in the same genre as those other games. Several people have referred to the game as "Match-3" and that's an extremely far-reaching interpretation of the term.\n\nTo be honest, I thought that the core mechanic of this game was actually pretty interesting at first: Clicking a block fires a little energy stream, and the energy will travel to like-colored blocks a short distance away, continuing in a chain and redirecting based on the direction of the arrows on the blocks as the energy arrives. If a chain includes 3 or more blocks, those blocks are destroyed, points are scored, and there is potential for cascades. The player must manually rotate individual blocks in order to specify the path of the energy stream; doing so before beginning the stream makes it easier to manage.\n\nThe problem is that it gets boring very quickly - or, more accurately, it fails to hold interest. It's not so much that it's boring to play, but it's chaotic and it starts to feel very arbitrary . You scan the board, looking to determine which color of block has the best potential for a big combo, then you start arranging your combo; all the while more blocks are being dropped in from the top of the board. You fire off your stream, and it travels around over so much of the board that you can't really do much to set up another color while this one is in progress, and you just hope that the rest of the blocks are already arranged in a way that will give you a lucky cascade. As you get used to the game, you may get more adept at planning out deeper combos in advance, which I suppose is what they refer to when they call this game "casual appeal, hardcore depth", but even if you're good, there's an inherent clumsiness in clicking and dragging to change the direction of the arrows on these little tiles.\n\nThe game does offer a wide variety of variant modes and special blocks. I don't particularly enjoy most of them, but I appreciate the work that went into adding them, and I like the fact that they can be used in conjunction with one another. Unfortunately, it's very easy to make the game exponentially more chaotic in this way, especially considering the game has a "randomizer" option that switches on any number of modes and special blocks.\n\nMusic and SFX are okay, but they get a little grating after a while. Many of the sounds that play are little jingles, and they can be dissonant with the music depending on when they play. It's especially unpleasant when you set off several combos at once, as it plays a separate instance of the SFX for each combo, all layering on top of each other along with the music. It's a bit much. The art is okay, though the characters and creatures are a little on the grotesque side. Some of the background images are very nice, but you don't really get a chance to pay attention to them while you're playing the game. One of the more jarring visual elements comes when a level ends. A high-saturation color overlay is placed over the screen, either in green (for winning) or red (for losing), along with some screenshake and little firework effects.\n\nIf you are at all concerned about your Steam achievement average, then I would skip this game entirely. You're almost guaranteed an achievement your first session (there's one for winning and one for losing), and there are LOTS of achievements that deal in long grinding and super high scores (100 million points in a single combo?). It's possible to set up a custom stage that will just generate nonstop combos, if you don't want to play for hundreds of hours. Also be aware that even if you earn an achievement, it won't be awarded to you until the level ends.\n\nIt's an interesting idea, but I don't think it's strong enough to stand on its own All the modifiers and custimization may add a little novelty, but not enough to save it.","March 19","false","4.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It also has a pleasant sense of humour.\n\nThumbs up all the way, you won't be sorry playing this puzzle game.","June 3, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You can change the directions on each arrowed block, allowing you to set up chains that weren't there before. It gets more complicated from there, with special blocks that stop streams in their tracks, others that need to be smashed on the bottom of the playfield, and others besides.\n\nTo be honest, I've found the default difficulty rather easy and relaxing, which is how a casual puzzle game should be IMO - a casual puzzler should never frustrate the player with arbitrary difficulty spikes, it should be the mental equivalent to a light morning jog - only enough exercise to get the blood pumping, and the brain slightly warm. In what I've played of Tidalis, the only place I was continually having difficulty was the "get 7500 pints in 4 minutes" stage, and that's purely because it was pure RNG luck-based bullshoel.\n\nThat's the main criticism I have of the game - there's an element of randomness that's slightly unwelcome in a casual environment, though not the same sort that plagues "pay-to-win" crap like Candy Crush Saga, thank goodness. The other gripe I have with the game is the bizarre cutscenes, which are needlessly distracting and try-hard unfunny to boot. but I don't want to sound too harsh on the game - it's a great little time-waster, especially for 79p during a Steam Sale, or as part of an indie bundle (or for free from a Steam friend, thanks Broodje Gezond!). There's some nice, folksy piano/flute-led music there, too, if you're into that kind of thing.\n\nOverall, yeah, I'd recommend it - if you can get it for cheap or free. It's not really worth £4.","June 24, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/irishcream/recommended/40420/","irishcream","Whiskey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/irishcream/","718 products in account","Tidalis is a casual "falling blocks" puzzler by the developer Arcen Games. The basic premise of Tidalis is that the player must define the orient of each block, fire a beam from one block of a particualr color and that beam travels through like colored blocks in a direct that depends on the player-set orient. If three or more blocks are hit they are elimited. Losing in this game usually is caused by having the game area fill up with blocks although some levels have other special conditions. Win conditions vary per level; they may have the player eliminate a certian number of blocks of a certain color or eliminate a certian number of blocks in a limit number of moves.\n\nI personally didn't enjoy Tidalis or think it's a very well design game. Maybe my limited time in the game suggests I didn't properly give the game a chance, but with the limited scope of a casual game like this the time I spent should be sufficent to determine the quality of a game. The concept of the game might seem good on paper, if you enjoy these sort of games, but actually playing the game failed to inspire or be an enjoyable experience.\n\nThe game encourages getting combos. When blocks fall due to the block underneath them being eliminated would also trigger and potentially eliminate additional blocks. In practice, however, the chance that this would happen was fairly rare. One could, however, attempt to tediously line up moves in advance. Again this might sound like a good idea but in a game like this where quickly lining up moves so the board doesn't, this process becomes a mental chore. When triggering a block it will take several seconds for the move to resolve and the player is unable to trigger additional blocks. If falling blocks are trigger the player is often forced to wait for them to impotently resolve before proceeding. Many times the necessary blocks aren't even available and I am required to wait for fate to smile upon me in the form of the blocks that I need. As a result of all of this, the gameplay feels slow, tedious and not particularly satisfying.\n\nTidalis doesn't support USB controllers - there may be a way to use a controller by adjusting the key bindings but seeing how the game is played I have a hard time seeing how it would work.\n\nIf you're looking for a game of this type, there are better options out there.\n\nScore: 2/10","December 15, 2013","false","0.8"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

The cutscenes and music are probably a matter of taste (personally, I liked the music but skipped through most of the story), but if you want to just sit down and relax, they create a comfortable and immersive atmosphere. The tutorial does a great job at introducing the game mechanics and there is a huge variety of different game modes. You can even create your own puzzles or play community-created ones. Last but not least, it has full Linux/SteamOS support. If you like games like Tetris Attack or Bejeweled, this is certainly for you.\n\nIn campaign mode, however, there is one major issue that you should be aware of: More than other puzzle games I've played, victory is often a matter of mere luck. In some stages the victory conditions are impossible to plan ahead for; on many occasions I had to restart a level several times because the blocks on the board didn't leave any sensible moving options. While in Bejeweled the board is cleared when you're out of moves, this does not happen here. On one occasion, for example, you're supposed to create large combos but at the same time are not allowed to move the majority of blocks. If they're not in a useful position by chance, there's simply nothing you can do, which can be extremely annoying.\n\nIf you believe that you can cope with this problem, I recommend this game to you.","July 22, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a hard one to review though... I love it, but friends I've shared it with haven't been blown away by it. It has a very niche appeal (but thankfully at least has a demo)\n\nThe way I see it, it's a casual game for those who don't do casual games - partly why I think it's not been a big winner in the review department. It's too silly and looks too simplistic for the more "hard-core" gamer (or those who wish to avoid the likes of Candy Crush at all costs... and rightly so) but is too complicated and difficult for those wanting said Candy Crush style\n\nIt's match 3, but with a considerably refreshing edge. Instead of shuffling blocks so they're adjacent - The game is all about "streams". Basically, when a block is clicked, it will fire out a stream of its colour. If the stream hits another block of the same colour, the chain will continue... and so forth until 3 or more blocks have made the chain. Cue points, disappeared blocks and a little 'woop'. The really cool bit is that the blocks have directional arrows, which dictate the direction a stream will fire... and you can rotate them.\n\nSo not only are you looking for combos, but you're also having to redirect the blocks on the fly, often in a frantic rush to keep a chain going. It's considerably engaging and very fast paced for its nature - Particularly as you're often in a race to make combos to ensure the board doesn't fill up.\n\nAdventure mode is where the fun really sits. 115 levels that make use of all sorts of game mechanics - you get a brilliant range objectives from clearing a certain colour, not clearing a certain colour; aiming for large combos, keeping tiny combos... The variety is superb and means each level really feels quite fresh and unique - instead of just grinding the same objective over inreasingly harder levels. It gets ruthlessly difficult later on, leading to some weirdly intense levels,  thunderous victories and profuse sweating for such a "casual" title (ok, maybe the last one's just me...)\n\nDespite this, the game has an utterly gorgeous, relaxing backdrop. The music is exceptional (especially the title music) and, whilst some complain of the cartoony graphics, I find them to be very pleasing. The story is silly, but adds to the informal charm - it's all very "lovely" and the humour's dry and inoffensive. Think Spongebob: Light hearted, silly and a very ridiculous. If hearing "Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?" makes you want to gauge your eyes out - this game will probably have you doing the same. If you started singing along - you should be fine.\n\nThe only downside is that, beyond the adventure mode (and the puzzles hidden within it), there isn't a huge amount else. You can create your own levels and there's multiplayer - but none have really seemed to stand out or show much in the way of replayability. Adventure mode has a decent longevity to it though (think mine took about 19 hours, excluding puzzles)\n\nTo me - It makes for one of those feel-good games you go to when you want to shut everything off for a while, but still find yourself challenged. It's zen and it's intense - which appears to have been both its blessing and its curse","April 3","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a hard one to review though... I love it, but friends I've shared it with haven't been blown away by it. It has a very niche appeal (but thankfully at least has a demo)\n\nThe way I see it, it's a casual game for those who don't do casual games - partly why I think it's not been a big winner in the review department. It's too silly and looks too simplistic for the more "hard-core" gamer (or those who wish to avoid the likes of Candy Crush at all costs... and rightly so) but is too complicated and difficult for those wanting said Candy Crush style\n\nIt's match 3, but with a considerably refreshing edge. Instead of shuffling blocks so they're adjacent - The game is all about "streams". Basically, when a block is clicked, it will fire out a stream of its colour. If the stream hits another block of the same colour, the chain will continue... and so forth until 3 or more blocks have made the chain. Cue points, disappeared blocks and a little 'woop'. The really cool bit is that the blocks have directional arrows, which dictate the direction a stream will fire... and you can rotate them.\n\nSo not only are you looking for combos, but you're also having to redirect the blocks on the fly, often in a frantic rush to keep a chain going. It's considerably engaging and very fast paced for its nature - Particularly as you're often in a race to make combos to ensure the board doesn't fill up.\n\nAdventure mode is where the fun really sits. 115 levels that make use of all sorts of game mechanics - you get a brilliant range objectives from clearing a certain colour, not clearing a certain colour; aiming for large combos, keeping tiny combos... The variety is superb and means each level really feels quite fresh and unique - instead of just grinding the same objective over inreasingly harder levels. It gets ruthlessly difficult later on, leading to some weirdly intense levels,  thunderous victories and profuse sweating for such a "casual" title (ok, maybe the last one's just me...)\n\nDespite this, the game has an utterly gorgeous, relaxing backdrop. The music is exceptional (especially the title music) and, whilst some complain of the cartoony graphics, I find them to be very pleasing. The story is silly, but adds to the informal charm - it's all very "lovely" and the humour's dry and inoffensive. Think Spongebob: Light hearted, silly and a very ridiculous. If hearing "Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?" makes you want to gauge your eyes out - this game will probably have you doing the same. If you started singing along - you should be fine.\n\nThe only downside is that, beyond the adventure mode (and the puzzles hidden within it), there isn't a huge amount else. You can create your own levels and there's multiplayer - but none have really seemed to stand out or show much in the way of replayability. Adventure mode has a decent longevity to it though (think mine took about 19 hours, excluding puzzles)\n\nTo me - It makes for one of those feel-good games you go to when you want to shut everything off for a while, but still find yourself challenged. It's zen and it's intense - which appears to have been both its blessing and its curse","April 3","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally had trouble with this game.  It was made overly complicated because of the use of direction arrow path stream matching...of sorts.  Maybe you will have more fun than I did.  Frankly I admit I can get lost in a parking lot, and I found this utterly confusing with figuring out which direction I had to turn.  Happy I only lost two bucks and some change.","March 26, 2012","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
