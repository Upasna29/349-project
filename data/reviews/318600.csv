Let me start with the positives..art style, ambient sound and the soundtrack...all top notch! Relaxing at one moment, then a few moments later trying desperately to find the items I need to keep my girl alive. It's this constant battle of emotions that makes this game so darn enjoyable...\nFor not having a story yet "the game grips you" and only makes you want to see what the writers of the final release will be able to conjure to deepen it's hooks into your heart. Yep, I said heart.\nCouple other things worth noting, First, I started the game with mouse and keyboard but found the gaming pad much easier to play the game. Gaming pad first! Secondly, put on some headphones, hear the game, feel the water and enjoy the lighting as the game cycles day, night and weather.\nOk, now for the negatives...don't have real deal breakers, 1 box on the starting island seems to be sunk every now and then into the eart, other than that..it's all good. Highly reccomend.\nOh yeah, as far as my 13 year old sons thoughts on the game...it's not league of legends.

Most of the games in the genre are so grotesquely nonrealistic that I physically cannot bring myself to play them; even if the nonrealistic elements are implemented for "exciting" gameplay.  I love this game.\n\nThe Flame in the Flood is probably the closest thing I've found to a semi-real survival game.  You cannot carry much, at least early on, you are interacting with plants/things that actually have practical uses [Cattails, Dandelions, Yucca, Aloe], and you're at risk of exposure, dehydration, starvation, and fatigue.  Most survival games place a gross amount of emphasis on food.  The reality is, human beings have been known to survive for well-over a month without ingesting much of anything.  This game does food well.  It isn't the dominant focus, but it matters.  Most things you consume are small and meager, giving you just enough to continue trudging forward.  The purist in me loves this approach.\n\nWater and exposure seem to be the larger issues, as they should be.  Though, I'd like to see exposure increase punishment, a bit.  Getting wet in a survival situation is about the most god awful thing that can happen.  It takes a hell of a lot more than a nap and 4 hours [if you rest in game, you can rest for 4 hours and dry out] to dry out.  Sitting next to a fire might do it, but the dehydration aspect is usually brutally punishing if you've yet to secure a reliable water source.  Typically, as little as 4 hours of exposure to cold or heat is enough to suck the life out of someone.  I haven't played for long, but so far getting wet has felt relatively inconsequential [perhaps i'm just on a lucky streak].\n\nThere are some things that I don't love, though.  I liked having such a tiny inventory, initially, but it does have some drawbacks.  Namely, I am spending a lot of time in my inventory menus, juggling things around between myself, my pet, and my raft; crafting things, to consume other things, to make space for other things; you get it?  Sure, I could leave some of this stuff behind, and I am sure I eventually will, but early on everything feels so valuable, it's a shame to leave it behind.  In a lot of ways, I am spending more time tabbing through menus and running back and forth from my raft to store things than I am actually playing the game.  Unless, of course, that's what the game design is meant to be, but I suspect not.\n\nI'm not sure I really have the solution for the game's inventory spacing issue since it does add a layer of realism.  One potential solution would be to allow the player to loot something and have it automatically stored on the raft/pet if the raft/pet already has part of a stack.  Less real, but they could graphically have the pet run back and forth from the player and raft to increase the realistic appeal.  The same method could be implemented for crafting things [IE. directly pulling the items from raft/pet].  This already exists, sort of, but requires proximity.  Not sure it's a bad thing, but I can see after many hours of running to and fro it possibly becoming irritating.  Another simple solution would be to increase starting backpack size by a few spaces AND increasing the overall stack size [most things stack to 10, it seems].  Nothing too extreme, but for certain plants [cattails], it might be a nice QoL change.\n\nThen, there's the occasional annoyance of a plant, like yucca, growing in an incorrect biome.  This is purely a "me" thing, but it definitely annoys me.  And the fact that every animal, which I actually like because it increases enjoyment, is a blood thirsty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - easily explained away by the "end of the world" scenario.  Oh, but the crows calling wolves, should definitely be Ravens.  Ravens are much more notorious for alerting wolves than crows are.  Even going so far as to fly above things, screaming.\n\nWhat really sucks me in and is particularly endearing, for someone like me, is the game is mostly accurate.  They even have ash cakes in the game!  A friend and I refer to these as "♥♥♥ cakes" cuz they usually taste like ♥♥♥♥, but hey.  Sure, the recipe isn't realistic, but it's the thought that counts!\n\nI should really just email the devs and offer my obnoxious help.","December 19, 2015","true","4.0"," 224 of 256 people (88%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","88","224","256","36","10"

After 79 days of struggle, I almost made it to the 150th milestone. I wish I had the strenght to keep on for even just one more day, instead of collapsing so close to my goal, but it's been one hell of a ride alright. Nature's not been kind to me for the past 20 days, luckily I saw it coming and filled my raft with jerky, ash cakes and dandelions for good measure. Still, wildlife has its ways of letting you feel unwelcomed, but I did not lose hope. At least not until the last 5 days. As I was biting into my last jerky, I knew it was the end of the road. Time to take drastic measures. If I am not wanted, I shall just ride into the sunset as far as I can, without looking back. No more stops at scrapyards only to find some nuts & bolts in an abandonned car and a pack of wolves ready to greet the juiciest peace of meat they ever saw in the last few weeks. No more suicidal moves onto the river for some grubs and lumber I don't even need anymore. It's time to ramble on.\n\nThe crazy thing is, once you accept your certain death, you almost feel relieved. You made it through the hardships of the beginning, then as the wheel started to turn in your favor you began to gain confidence, too much confidence, leading you to some stupid, regretful decisions. At midpoint the monotony started to kick in, replacing your fear for survival with a daily grind as much comforting as it numbs all your senses. It's only 50 days in on your journey that you slowly began to realise that all good things must come to an end, and the abrupt decrease in plants was no stranger to this. Without it, no game, no cooking, no juicy meat, only grubs and scraps. The wildlife wasn't a giant supermarket anymore, you lost a few ranks in the food chain, again. Back to square one, only this time bring your own tools. It kinda felt revigorating at first, I have to admit. A way to keep things fresh, and to keep you on your toes. Then after a few days where you visit any spot you can find, devoid of anything that could help you eat, you realise Mom Nature has a grand scheme, and she's gonna starve you out. Except if you just want to take the easy way out and drown yourself into the river.\n\nNo, screw that, challenge accepted! I'm just gonna go as far as I can, and if I die, it will be on my own terms! Acceptance is pretty easy, and so is closure, I'm already pretty worn out by the ride anyway. The good thing is that I don't have so much to care for anymore, my only concern is to give Aesop my finest survival gear so that his future owner will put it to good use, after that I am golden. I just need to stop every now and then to rest, eat and hydrate myself, and I'm back on the water again. Feels like when I was a kid and we would embark on road trips with my parents to go on vacation. Everything under cruise control and smooth sailing. I worry about the occasional storm, but it feels like forever since I last had one pouring on me. Along the way, I manage to scrounge some extra bits of food that allow me to push my journey even further. If wildlife is mean-spirited, the river can be kind-hearted at times.\n\nAt long last, the day finally come. I won't sleep tight tonight. Actually, both as an act of defiance and as a way to let go softly, I managed to get every bit as exhausted as hungered, which should help alleviate the pain a bit. As I push myself away from the dock one last time, I feel strangely upbeat. One last ride. Make it count. Your raft is worn out just like you, one bad corner and you could end up down the drain, but you know that's not gonna happen, not on your watch, not today anyway, you have a destiny to fulfill. And I have to admit, it sure feels great for a last day: the sun is rising nice and easy over the horizon, the rapids let you sift through the river without any hiccup on the way, you can even hear yourself mumbling one of the great tunes that accompanied you during your journey down the river.\n\nEventually, the waters take pity in you as they calm down to support you during your last stand. You collapse of fatigue on your raft, only seconds before the starving pins you down. You take one last look at your trusty companion. Go Aesop, you're free now, find someone else that will love you as much as I did. You're down to 146.9 miles, and your journey ends here. If you think about it, you chose your way out, only a handful of explorers can take pride in that. I sure am gonna miss the ride.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood thing I can just start a new one right now, then.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm usually not one to post review of Early Access games, but this one seems pretty fleshed out already. We should expect less crashes, less visual bugs and some gameplay tweaking along the way, but at core the game plays and feels great.\n\nBalancing is the main issue right now. As of any rogue-like, the early game depends a lot on your luck and your knowledge of the systems, so you're bound to die a lot at first, which is by no mean a problem. You learn with every game, so you can survive 4 days during your first playthrough, then hypothetically 8, 16, 32 and so on. The campaign isn't implemented yet, only the endless mode, basically a version of the game where you're gonna die anyway, so you have to make it for the longest streak of days, or travel the furthest down the river, depending on whatever you fancy. That's the best thing about the game in my opinion, time and mileage are not ultimately tied together. When you get on your raft, you get to choose whether you need to scavenge every location, stock up on supplies, take a minute to craft and manage your inventory or even take a breather, or alternatively if you feel you have enough on you (or not enough space to scavenge anyway), you can just powel through, get on the rapids and quickly get down the river in search of better lots.\n\nThe game is best played with a gamepad, right now it's even mandatory if you want to get through the rapids without smashing your boat at every single rock. Once you get the hang of it, the game is a blast. The sole feeling of getting on your boat with your dog, sifting through the calm waters, listening to some amazing tunes is amazing. And then a giant storm happens, the rain come down pouring on you, and you just have to seek shelter, and the game get even more amazing. Once you're down 100 miles (60 days in, my longest streak for now), monotony starts to kick in, every lot you step on is literally a wasteland, except for the few plants scarcely available. That's when you realise hoarding on medicine and water won't get you any further if you just die of plain starvation. End game is all about embracing that fact, visiting any location with the slightest hope of finding enough resources to craft some traps that would help you hunt some game, gasping in delight to the vision of dandelions of cat tails on the ground, all the while avoiding in the best possible ways the wolves and boars attacking you. When that day finally comes, however, it's time to let it go. So you just cram your best survival tools in your trusty companion's bag, knowing that they'll come handy to whoever comes accross Aesop, and that person happens to be you, on your next playthrough.\n\nAs much as it is imperfect at the moment, The Flame in the Flood is a very compelling experience, granted not for everyone, but if you like the Open Wide, if survival of trekking is your thing, or even if you're just fond of the art style, I urge you to try it. As of now it's only a rough gem, but with enough polish, it can become a real diamond.","September 28, 2015","true","24.2"," 152 of 175 people (87%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","87","152","175","18","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ColaCastTV/recommended/318600/","ColaCastTV","MelanCola","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ColaCastTV/","110 products in account","Because I'm a sucker for rogue-likes, I immediately snagged this game up in early access. Not only that, but the art style and soundtrack were a major draw for me. While I liked it in early access, there were many bugs (some of them quite funny, like an invisible Aesop) that kept me from truly enjoying it.\n\nFast forward to now, I've just finished the campaign for the first time and consider most of my worries for the game allayed.  I was particularly worried for how the campaign might play out. With the addition of occassional characters and plot points, the campaign was a pleasure to go through and had me hooked. First and foremost, I consider the narrative to be one based on hope. That first time you set sail on your raft with the rising sun is a magical moment that I believe alludes to that motif. Throughout the campaign, the narrative is consistent but with each new encounter you can't help but question whether there's something worth 'hoping' for in this post-societal landscape. Overall, a beautiful story and compelling experience that made surviving through it well worth it.\n\nWith that said, mechanics-wise, this game is a survival game. It can, at times, be unforgiving in its delivery of events but not in the way that requires praying to RNGesus like other more recent rogue-likes. In terms of the survival mechanics, you have to worry about your hunger, thirst, and fatigue. I spent a good chunk of my time planning around these - how much to eat and when, what to look out for, what expansions to build for my raft, etc. I enjoyed this part of the game.\n\nNow for some things I didn't quite like. Echoing the criticisms of a few other reviewers, the UI has its issues. My biggest gripe is with the quick use menu for your inventory. With the amount of functionality (medical supplies, food, traps/weapons) crammed into it, its not as efficient as it could be. When you give things more flexibility and functionality, their usability typically takes a hit. There have been many times where I'd sustain a wound from a wolf while trying to quickly pull up tainted bait in the menu. To work around this, it's become habit for me to run back to the raft's safe zone, go back into the wilderness, and throw the bait as fast as I can to the wolves trolling the area.\n\nOther UI issues include the crafting, sorting, stacking, and dropping of items. These tasks take more time than they should. For example, you can only drop items individually. So if you have a full stack of dandelions, you'll need to repeat the process of dropping 10 times. In conclusion, there's a lot of great draws to this game like the art style, the music, and the story but its clunky UI is really dragging it down.\n\nTLDR;\n\nWhat I liked:\nArt style\nMusic\nStory\nBalanced gameplay / Not completely based around luck\nSurvival mechanics\nWhat I didn't like:\nUI/UX\nRelated to above, the tedium of navigating the UI\nOverall: If survival rogue-likes are your thing, I definitely recommend this one.","February 24","true","18.4"," 78 of 85 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","78","85","2","1"

IS DEATH.\n\nOR\n\nDeliverance 2: The Wolf Awakening\n\nFull disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nThere's something romantic, captivating, and thrilling about Americana!\n\nNo, really!\n\nStop laughing!\n\nIt's the cultural backbone of America; an amazing amalgamation of hundreds of years of the human experience, the human spirit... unique to the United States. And while it's been conveyed extensively in books, films, television, and music, videogames (Kentucky Route Zero and a few others notwithstanding) have had trouble capturing that wily spirit.\n\nUntil now! Maybe!\n\nThe Flame in the Flood is a new Early Access indie rogue-lite survival title.\n\n“What's to set it apart from the LITERALLY dozens of other EA indie rogue-lite survival titles?” A wary reader might ask.\n\n“GET OUT OF MY HEAD! HAVEN'T I GIVEN YOU ENOUGH SACRIFICES?” I would likely respond.\n\nThis little indie rogue-lite survival title is set on a river in Appalachia (the place with all the mountains, squirrels, and pictures of the Great Depression) after some catastrophe turned Appalachia into a gigantic, swirling death river – presumably a moonshine explosion. You and your faithful doggy companion Aesop (sporting sunglasses for some reason) must endure the dangers of the river, her shores, her rapids, and folk music.\n\nIt's your standard survival game fare – pick clean your surroundings, learn to make new tools to survive, rest/sleep at a campfire/shelter, keep an eye on your constantly waning health, and continue to travel down the great procedurally generated river (all the while Aesop plays the miserable pack-mule sidekick). The Flame in the Flood current-ly (teehe, river joke) only has the one "endless" mode but promises a campaign further in development.\n\nLet me address the good parts right away. The music (acoustic pieces and ambiance) is excellent and evocative. It really lends to the immersion, putting you right on that rickety raft as gross, brown water splashes your face (with your mouth wide open and you swallow some and have to get shots and it's the worst birthday ever). The aesthetic is gorgeous... part Double Fine title, part The Long Dark, part Don't Starve, all great. The textures are bright, sharp, and lovingly crafted. It's just a sight to behold and, if you're anything like me, you'll get super lost in it all – the music playing twangy banjos and ♥♥♥♥; the river opening up before you, belching up old lost houses and farm equipment; the sun high in the sky, illuminating the roiling rapids.\n\nBut you better snap out of it because you're already ♥♥♥♥ing dead.\n\nYep, you died!\n\nNope, start over!\n\nThis game is punishing with a capital P. I starved to death in two days – two days! The main character must have some sort of serious metabolism issues. And God help you if you break a bone early on your travels, that's pretty much a kiss of death... you know what? Scratch that – God help you if you take any sort of damage at the beginning of your travels because you're in for a pretty quick downward spiral. See, you have to find plant matter, loot, and all manner of scraps to scrape together splints and stitches and whatnot. And sometimes it will take a while to find everything you need (the rest stop islands you can dock at throughout are generally sparse). So (frustratingly) you're going to die – a lot. And then you're greeted by the continue screen and you replay the same damned unskippable cutscene over and over and over again. In just the first few playthroughs I experienced pretty much the ABCs of death - if it's in the game, it can kill you.\n\nBesides being unforgivingly difficult The Flame in the Flood's raft controls are a little more than wonky. I understand the idea – the river is wild and crazy and it's not the easiest thing in the world to navigate, sure. But boy is it annoying to slam into debris or some big ♥♥♥♥ sucking rock when you've spent the last two minutes doing everything but herniating yourself trying to move out of the way (this reviewer did not herniate himself in the attempt). There are marinas you'll encounter on the river that you can stop at and improve your raft but they're few and far between and it'll be some time before your raft is pleasant to use.\n\nSo what more is there to say? This is a promising title. It needs some polish and A LOT, A LOT of balancing. Aesthetically it's breathtaking , exhilarating even. Every time you kick the bucket you get to see how far you've gone and it made me want to get right back on the river and get further still. When you lay a trap it's laid out before you LEGO-style, built before your eyes. When you craft something, anything, it's all complimented with stirring guitar riffs. It's hard to dislike this one:  it's got style.\n\nI think it's currently way too punishing (and could use some more solid tutorialization) and the raft controls are kind of rough. There's a few graphical glitches here and there (floating, menacing wolf eyes on the water, collision issues) but otherwise it's a solid little game. If you have any lingering doubts, however, I HIGHLY recommend holding off on this one - watch how it develops. I'm giving The Flame in the Flood a hesitant recommendation – lots of potential, equally a potential flop.\n\nIf anything sinks this title it will definitely be the price point, not the river.","September 24, 2015","true","5.6"," 78 of 99 people (79%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","79","78","99","33","6"

You guide a young girl named Scout and her dog Aesop as they attempt to navigate a flooded land on her raft - in search of everyone else. Campaign mode isn't terribly long, but there's a lot of replayability in Endless Mode.\n\nIt's all about survival. You start with nothing, but by gathering raw materials here and there, you are able to craft: medical supplies, tools, weapons, traps, clothing, and upgrades for your raft. There are four hostile creatures that you often come across - snakes, boars, bears, and wolves, as well as a few very rare creatures. Each can be deadly in its own right. At the cost of some of your precious materials, there are simple tools and weapons you can use to defend yourself from them and harvest useful skins and meat. You can also devise ways to play these creatures off of each other. Why not lead that pack of wolves to the bear, and while they're distracting it, you can pop into its den to see if it's got anything useful inside. Instead of building a trap to catch some rabbits, why not chase them into a snake?\n\nAlong with meat, there are wild edibles you can harvest to keep Scout from starving, but you also need to keep a look out for clean water, and safe places for her to sleep. You'll have to find ways to treat any number of conditions she may come across - from insect stings and venomous snake bites, to dysentery and broken bones. The increasingly cold weather also poses a threat, and there's pressure to find or craft better clothing for her.\n\nAs they journey down the flooded river, they pass areas where they can dock their raft and search for supplies, but they can't stop everywhere, so sometimes you have to choose. What's more important, landing at that camp with a fire where Scout can cook some of her food before it spoils, or docking over by that liquor store in the hopes of finding some alcohol and rags to make bandages or a torch?\n\nIn the end, you always come back to the peril of the river. There are many ways to die, but the most common - hands down - is drowning. I've kept Scout alive for months from all sorts of encounters with hostile wildlife, just to lose her to the river in a matter of moments. It can get pretty tense when the raft has run into a few too many rocks or debris, and they have to cross white water country - all the while desperately looking for a Marina where Scout can repair the raft just enough to carry her onward for a few more miles... a few more days.\n\nA few things to note\nThe dialogue is textual, and choices are straightforward.\nThe audio is really well done, from the natural ambience to the sound track and instrumentals that never get tiresome.\nThe graphics are stylized, but clean.\nThe community has been friendly and helpful.\nYou're meant to die - fairly often at first. Gaining some of the achievements will take Scout to the point of death, and some actually require her death.\n\nAt the time of this review, The Flame in the Flood just recently exited early access. There have been quite a few complaints about audio and startup crashes. I had some issues early on, but since the last few updates the devs put out, I haven't had any problems at all.\n\nThere are a few bugs/exploits here and there, mostly involving the achievements. The devs have been quick to recognize them and say they're working to correct them. There are plenty of achievements that are challenging, but still fun.\n\nThere is a LOT of inventory maintenance which...is frankly annoying early on, but as you play, expand your inventory, and learn what you need to stockpile and what you don't - it becomes a little less of an issue.\n\nI've had a lot of fun so far. Over 80 hours in, and I'm not at all bored with it. Because of its linear nature, It's very easy to pick up and play just for a little while, or for hours on end.","March 8","true","87.0"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","42","44","2","0"

Visually pleasant, good soundtracks, simple gameplay mechanics.\n\nBasically you try to survive in a flooded world by always going forward where the current flow. Collect, create, repair, cook, etc. just to move on. In story-mode there'll be some sort of final destination or ending.\n\nThe surviving ways aren't that much detailed and complex, but enough for the game to be entertaining. The basics are there; nourishments, clothings and tools. Places visited by navigating with a raft but it's designed so that you are always better moving forward.

The exploration areas are fairly small and are usually defined by a structure (churches, shacks, abandoned busses, gas station etc.). In these regions the structures and crates can be searched for supplies and the wildlife harvested (or if the means are available, hunted). If it's safe there might be a chance to make a fire to warm up our hero, or rest allow them to rest in one of the shelters... if not it's usually due to the wolves; usually evasion (or just getting back on the raft) is preferable to combat.\n\nThe enjoyment of this game is found in the setting, visuals and meandering exploration of wanting to know what's a little further down the river.

This game is for you.\n\nEarly Access only has endless mode, which makes you sail (endlessly) on a raft down river to find a better signal for your radio. Your resources are scarce so you'll have to make do with what you find. Thankfully there's a dog to accompany you on your travels, Aesop, that also acts as a inventory mule.\n\nAlong the water you'll find settlements, loot and workshops you can stop at at your own leisure. You'll need to scavenge these places for food, water, items and more to be able to craft whatever you need to stay alive. Also, pro tip: When it rains, use your jars to fill them up with unpolluted clear water!\n\nThe Flame in The Flood needs no excuses to kill off unprepared adventurers - quickly. If you don't pay attention to your core metrics (hunger, thirst, temperature, etc.) you'll eventually start perishing. Stepping on poison ivy or trying to do a hand shake with a boar will cause cuts or broken bones that'll over time start festering if left untreated. Drink polluted water and you'll get an infection and stay out in the cold too long and your fingers may freeze off.\n\nDespite it actually being a gloomy, manage as long as you can before you die simulator, it's a charming experience and very beautiful set on a backdrop of the finest country bluegrass music you'll ever hear. Adding to the vibe of a wastelandic backwater America perfectly.\n\nA survival game that actually requires you to think ahead if you want to get far. And even if you don't, there's still a terrific atmospheric country soundtrack to ease your passage.

The music is awesome, and the art is amazing.  With that out of the way, here's a little about the game:\n\nGameplay involves using your raft to navigate a river.  Along the river there are different locations you can stop at to forage for supplies.  There are a few different classes of locations, and each class has a different pool of items, services, and enemies that might spawn there.  You'll need to decide when to stop based on your needs at any given moment and your ability to defend yourself should enemies await you.  Along with genre staples like hunger, thirst, body temp, and fatigue, you need to manage a few things about your raft. Repairs, reinforcements, and hull upgrades motivate the collection of supplies beyond simply food and water. They way that those two systems (your body and your raft) interact with each other is engaging and it serves at the meat of the gameplay experience.\n\nThere isn't really combat like in Binding of Isaac or even Spelunky. Instead, combat plays more like a puzzle game where you choose to use consumables to kill, trap, or flee from animals. The catch, though, is that most of the ingredients you’ll use to dispatch animals (and in turn gather food and fur) are also useful in upgrading your raft.  Will you use that lumber to build a fire and cook meat, get sleep, and craft medicine? Or will you use it to expand the cargo hold? What about a rudder to help navigate the rapids? This is a game about choices more than it is about dexterity.\n\nThere are two game modes: campaign and endless.  Mechanically the two modes are identical, however in campaign mode you come across set pieces that feed you atmospheric story elements which culminate in a pretty satisfying ending.  There are two difficulty settings in this mode, and I'll call them "kinda easy" and "ball shatteringly difficult." I can't remember what they are actually called.  In the easier mode, each of the set pieces serve as checkpoints that you can respawn at if you die.  In hard mode, it's permadeath and there is a shortage of item spawns.  I wasn't able to make it more than 30 minutes in hard mode, but I was able to complete easy mode in about 6 or 7 hours. I'm not sure exactly.  I was extremely thorough in my playthrough, though.  The difficulty in endless mode is a near perfect split between the two difficulties of the campaign, and while there is permadeath in endless mode, your dog serves as a between-playthrough storage container that you can pack with a few essential things when you start to feel the sweet embrace of death.  He’ll be waiting for you when you start again.\n\nOverall, I’d recommend it.  It’s a beautiful game and the story that unfolds in campaign mode is actually really well realized - the way it illustrates certain game mechanics (specifically the dog) is very clever and it gives the in-game universe a sense of hope, perseverance, and loneliness that’s hard to explain unless you play through it.  The moment to moment gameplay isn’t the most exhilarating or physically demanding in the rogue-lite market, but for what The Flame in the Flood lacks in dexterous gameplay it more than makes up for in atmosphere, theme, art, and music.\n","February 25","true","21.4"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","22","24","4","1"

Upgrading your boat and traveling down the river is a equally as important as docking and scavenging for supplies. Staying along the river helps eliminate the possibility of exploring too much, which I find I do a lot in more open survival games. Now, that may turn some people off, but it really shouldn't. the game feels big enough as is. There's plenty of islands to explore and they'll never be completely the same due to the procedural generation. I really love that combination of the sailing and docking, it's excellent.

It is virtually impossible to progress passed the first 12 or so days without starting with a decent inventory in your dog.\n\nIn my opinion this mechanic is not remotely fun. You simply have to keep restarting with the same basic starting gear until you get lucky enough to die with the correct items to be able to easily progress.\n\nI simply do not understand the extreme positive ratings.  The game isn't hard.  The mechanics are simple.  At its core the game is extremely easy.  It takes a while to figure out exactly what gear you should carry, what gear your dog should carry, and what you should store in your boat.  After that the game is 50% luck and 50% perseverance.\n\nThe game isn't hard.  It is frustratingly monotonous.  Perhaps that is what other like.  The game is a lot of getting unlucky and starting over.\n\nFirst few play throughs were all right.\n\nEdit:\nAlso the inventory system is terrible.  You have to move items constantly between yourself and your dog.  You can't craft with items carried by your dog.  You must move the items from the dog beside you to yourself.  With that you can't even drag and drop the items.  You must individually select the item and choose from a dropdown where you want to move the item to.\n\nA lot of tedious micro mangment.\n\n\nThe crafting system is horrendous.\nAs an example you need Braided Cords for EVERYTHING.  Braided Cords have one single ingredient Cat Tails.\nSimple right?\n\nTo craft a hammer you need Braided Cords and Flint.\n\nWhen you are new to the game the menu shows you what items you can craft with what you have.\n\nWell the system does not recognise simple things like that if you have Cat Tails and Flint you have the necessary ingredients to make a hammer.  It specifically will say you do not have the items needed.  Any intelligent crafting system would automatically craft the intermediate component for you or better yet not have a useless intermidiate part.\n\nAs a new player you must look through everything and fumble around and search to find out what actually makes what.  You may have the exact ingredients needed to craft what would save you.  However the system will show no notification as you have the raw components and have not went through the pointless system of crafting that single item into a different single item.\n\nSounds simple, but this alone puts an annoying unnecessary learning curve into the game.","February 16","false","4.9"," 99 of 159 people (62%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","62","99","159","7","1"

And boy, it sure does not disappoint. Either I've been very lucky in backing mostly successful projects, or I've got a well-honed sense for detecting bologna, but this is one Kickstarter/SEA project that did exactly what it promised and that very nicely.\n\nSo aside from the highly attractive and tasteful low-poly art direction and the superb soundtrack, the gameplay is highly enjoyable! You don't see that very often, sadly. It does this refreshing back-and-forth between scavenging gameplay (the player character on foot evading predators and grabbing loots) and rafting gameplay (steering the player character's raft down the river). I say refreshing not because it's some revolutionary new paradigm in game design, but because the two alternating gameplay modes refresh your energy and desire to keep playing. This War Of Mine does a similar kind of thing, and both games do a very addictive "one more turn" thing dangerously conducive to all-nighter play sessions.\n\nWhile the controls are supposedly optimized for a gamepad (ideally an xbone from what I understand), the game handles just fine with Mouseboard and Key. Been playing it that way since alpha and no issues. Really, the only place where it might hit a snag is aiming that darn bow Scout (the player character) is able to craft in the mid/late game. Possibly it's easier with a stick, but I couldn't tell ya. Can't be any worse than whiffing 90% of shots trying to aim it with a mouse. However, there is currently a small discrepancy in the two control schemes in that the gamepad controls allow you to pan the camera and look ahead of where Scout is walking, while there does not appear to be such a binding or capability in the keyboard control scheme. What's up with that, devs? But I'm reasonably confident they'll get around to fixing that sooner or later. Right?\n\nGenerally speaking the game, while not super difficult or mind-bogglingly complex (which is by no means to say it's "casual," far from it!), is a treat in all of the ways games can be. Visually, musically, in terms of refreshing and satisfying gameplay modes, and in terms of high replayability, TFITF will not disappoint! Highly recommended for any fan of Rogue-like games, low poly art, and lovely folksy music and atmosphere.","February 25","true","34.2"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

I think there could be some improvements, the crafting system seems a bit overburdened, certain simple items such as "Bandages" require finding fairly hard to find items to craft. Anyway my spoken word is far better than my written one, so here is my first look "and attempt" at surviving in the game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHPj9KebU2Q\n","September 24, 2015","true","10.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

Falling off the raft or getting rained on is a fine recipe for hypothermia.  Eat bad food you get sick. Don't get me started on the wolves and boars. T_T\n\nLuckily the awesome crafting system helps you along the way; seamlessly adding new recipes as you scavenge new ingredients.  Bandages, thermal clothing and medicine not only keep you going but just make a lot of sense given the worlds you're in.  They used real survival guides to develop this stuff... so no, you can't craft a shotgun.\n\nBy the art director from BioShock the graphics are definitely top notch with a unique and sharp style.  Everything from the character design with their exaggerated by simple features to the procedurally generated river/locales are perfectly executed.  The visuals of this game give me goosebumps and add a lot of weight to the gameplay.\n\nThe soundtrack by Chuck Ragan is the perfect thing for your journey.  I'm not a fan of country but this is like outlaw rock/country and it works very well.  If you watch the trailer and enjoyed it there is more where that came from, guys. It's all good. The other sound effects are equally well thought out and I really enough the tone that plays when crafted, oddly enough.\n\nThere are still a few bugs here and there but nothing that won't be polished out with full release.  The dev team has shown their merit with the game up to this point and I'd expect nothing less.\n\nThe story itself is also little thin; wandering the barren emptiness and the occasional intractable element are there to paint the mood but I'd like a little more in the way of character development so I could get to know the history of the world a little better.  I did die a ton and the game is a bit random so I may have just not gotten far enough along.  Hard to say.\n\nAll in all I really hope everyone gets their hands on this game! It's an epic journey and one of the best indie titles you'll pick up this year!","September 24, 2015","true","10.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

Loss and wonder, a world that was, and the world that is... You can feel it, the idealized world by a society that never was, and see the world like really is: drowned and lost. The way it sounds... The music is just incredible, a immeasurable sample of emotional and inspiring melodies. All said by music, art, architecture... No words needed. The nature is alive in every sound effect. The game feel very well in terms of control, you just can do it with WASD, clicking or with a controller, the movement is very smooth and easy. Interacting is a nice thing and the differents options you have it is displayed in a menu, like a list. The crafting tree is large and thoughtful (to clothes to traps to medicines...) but sometimes crafting logic isn't the smarter thing, not in the way you want it to be, cannot use the wood and metal from the many structures to build traps? or to repair my raft? or why I cannot take shelter in that house when a wolf is chasing me? kinda like that. When you arrive to new places you feel the anticipation, emotion and curious about what the place might bring, but sometimes the place looks more useful and full of thing to collect, but the game says is useless to you. I really would love the possibility to scavenge in the inside of the buildings too. Maybe more animations (when you fill the jar with water for example) or more variety in the procedural generation of the scenarios. All this survival and scenarios is maybe too mechanical in some aspects, I want expect something more natural and organic in the futures updates, but, by no means tarnish the incredible adventure that this group of developers put before us, because is a marvellous world, rich and deep, to explore and discover, to get lost on it.\nStrive to see another dawn. The endless river. You cannot go back, you have nothing more to find, nothing more to loose, leave yourself behind, just go, with the river flow.","September 24, 2015","true","10.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taosaur/recommended/318600/","taosaur","taosaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taosaur/","101 products in account","The killer feature here is atmosphere. The music, artwork, lighting changes, weather, and the way you move on the river combine to create a world you want to come back to. The campaign has enough progression and diversity to offset the kind of repetition you see in a lot of procedurally generated games. Playing with a controller is highly recommended over keyboard and mouse. The crafting elements are on the simple side, but quite satisfying for a survival sandbox veteran. The raft upgrades are more conveniences than necessities. What's more important is upgrading your clothes to survive the elements, and getting the supplies to remedy what ails you. It's not a game about defeating enemies, but finding what you need to survive the day and moving on, day after day after day. The story elements in the campaign are few and far between, especially early on, but they're well done.\n\nOn the whole, an easy recommend to any kind of survival fan. Expect to die a lot and start over while learning the ropes, and there's always the possibility of getting dealt a bad seed (a map with a cat tail shortage in the early regions is not a lot of fun), but if you're willing to learn what it takes to survive, it's a unique, rewarding experience. I don't know what kind of replay value the endless mode will have for me, but I've already had my money's worth from the campaign, about 80% through.","February 29","true","29.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Simply put, you are a placed into a survival situation following a flood. You meet a cute pooch that aids you in your journey. He finds loot, alerts you of wild beasts, and accompanies you along the river.\n\nVisuals: The game truly reflects its own style and immerses the player into the environment. The art style of the game is original and gives a "Nightmare Before Christmas" vibe. Awesome.\n\nGameplay: Your main goal is to last as long as possible by visiting riverside locations and scavenging for loot that you can craft into a multitude of items to help you stay alive longer. You use a raft that you can modify to help navigate the river and white water rapids more effectively and increase your survivability off the water. The farther you move downstream, the more challenging the experience becomes. All in all, this top down survival game is a pleasure to play, and focuses on the environment and atmosphere to create a visual experience unlike most games today.\n\nComments: However much I enjoyed The Flame in the Flood, I found that at times I was wishing for something more to this game. I played for a couple of hours and didn't feel like the difficulty was up to par with some of the other survival games I have experienced, such as The Long Dark, or This War of Mine. Another comment I have is that the pup that accompanies you doesn't seem to stop barking. There were times where I began swearing at my screen because every time I passed by a patch of dandelions, the dog would continually bark until I either picked them, or ran away, where he would begin barking at something else. Please fix your dog The Molasses Flood, fix it...\n\nConclusion: All in all, The Flame in the Flood is a great game for being early access and I can't wait to see the final product of this game. If you're looking for something to enjoy and immerse yourself, away from the screaming children that now seem to populate CSGO, this is the game for you.","December 17, 2015","true","2.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I'm a big fan of open world, exploration, resource management type games (GRAV, Don’t Starve, Minecraft, Torchlight, etc.).\n\nFavorite part: The Art Style is BRILLIANT! Very refreshing! The music is also relaxing and immersive.\n\nThe "Lazy River" parts of travel are serene. Borderline meditative, yet short lived. The serenity is swiftly displaced when white water rapids put you back on your toes.\n\nA great part of this game is the developmental opportunity the devs have in front of them. The existing tedious nature of the game and menus will surely be improved upon, but it's not game breaking. If anything, it's a nice change of pace to the auto create features of more contemporary games. However, the menus are pretty inconvenient, especially the scrolling required to get a quick look at the desired item schematic. Other than that, I’ve yet to find any game killing mechanics. There was one point where I starved to death. That was miserable and I felt helpless.\n\nAlso, apparently, keeping the “rare” gear in Aesop’s satchel will carry over to another game? Might just be a bug. Not sure. Definitely doesn’t aid the roguelike aspect of gameplay. But, I don’t mind the aid this early in the game. :)\n\nRecommendations:\n\nCoop mode (2 rafts, tie them together as an upgrade, getting split up while sharing inventory could be a fun dynamic, etc)\n\nDog Abilities (Sick em, distract, hunt, etc.)\n\nCanibalize the dog (I know it's dark, but say for the survival aspect that you can eat him, and lose his inventory space as a hit to your available inventory)\n\nArrows that require tinder instead of saplings.\n\nThat is all for now. :)","February 21","true","25.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

It's what I've been looking for in a survival game and more. Its actually has challenging (that means you WILL die, but thats the whole point of survival, to learn to die less?) and progressive gameplay with difficult but fair and exciting threats (which includes much more than the wildlife).\n\nThe looks, audio (especially) and style of the game create a really unique and atmospheric environment which is as impressive as it is daunting (I've never had the urge to experiance the end of the world, but if I could tag along here, I've done worse...)\n\nIts even pretty replayable in endless mode thanks to the idea of the journey you're on, bringing a desire to go back and make those changes that might get you through an extra day. This is coupled with the random islands, meaning ou'll have to survive using some different means. However thanks to being well thought through, this encourages a change in your plan rather by scavenging the right stuff for the occasion rather than alternating with good and bad luck or just using a fixed plan.

The idea is to go farther and farther and get better equipment along the way.\n\nUnfortunately, this is about survival and the system is really well done, so you’re gonna need to eat, drink and sleep constantly ...and take care of yourself. If you die, it’s back at square 1. I somehow managed to have 2 broken legs, some intestinal parasites and the flu before I died eaten by a wolf. Normally something like that would discourage me for a bit but I dove back in immediately, just to see how far I could go before my character keeled over from exhaustion.\n\nVery enjoyable experience, well worth the money even though it’s not even fully released.\nWatch me drink contaminated water here : https://youtu.be/4o8y_F51wKA","October 9, 2015","true","7.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

The enemies annoying and tough (the snakes are my mortal enemy), but still defeatable - I really liked that you could lure most of them into dangerous situations rather than deal with them directly.\n\nThe backstory was short and sweet, but there could have been a *little* more splashed about.

The crafting system and the rafting systems are pretty good though more often than not you'll find yourself crashing your boat and dying or unintentionally stepping on some ants and getting a deadly infection. These dangers though are what make the game fun and challenging. I almost find myself comparing it to FTL mostly because they're both about going on a journey and I die about ten minutes into both of them as well. The soundtrack is relaxing and really fits in with (and helps create) the game's atmosphere. the game manages to be both beautifully stylised and graphically impressive, artistically due to the famous video game artists who helped create it and graphically due to being made in unreal engine 4.\n\nPros:\nChallenging\nGreat music\nInteresting way of combining survival and rafting sections\nPretty\nLots of potential\n\n\nCons:\nMaybe a bit too challenging\nStill in early access so maybe wait a bit\nNot enough flint for basic crafting recipes\nRafting straight into an island\n\nTo summarise I think this is a great game, definitely worth your time and money, but maybe wait until a few more features are added/polished.

After playing for some hours I think this is one the best games I have played for a long time.\nSome people will say that it is too hard or too unforgiving, but I think it is perfect. Survival means a bit of planning, which is possible, but it also means you will not know in what situation you will end up next. This will cause you to plan for one thing and end up in a situation you will not be prepared for. This is really challenging, but it is very rewarding surviving such challenges.\nThe graphics might not be the very best, but they fit the game really nicely. This in combination with the soundtrack makes that you get sucked in to the game like none other.\nAnother positive thing about this game is that, although it being an early acces, I have yet to come by any game breaking bugs.\nI can honestly say that I am looking forward to what features will be added to game and I really hope that the developers will not take any steps towards making this game easier, and if they do, they will make it an option.","October 3, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can't tell you how much I've been enjoying this unique and awesome art style. It's like you're playing inside of a painting. 10/10\n\n2. Awesome soundtrack. Holy ♥♥♥♥ the sound track is amazing.

It's only in BETA yet its still so damn good. 10/10\n\n3. It's hard. 8/10\n\n4. Great Gameplay. 8/10\n\nCONS\n1. The dog barking is extremely annoying. He barks at EVERY resource he comes accross.\n\n2. A few glitches. So far I haven't come accross any annoying or game-breaking glitches, but it's worth noting. Here's a list of a few glitches:\n\na. The animals sometimes glitch through the floor\nb. When you board your boat your person glitches around the place.\nc. When loading a save it takes a while and sometimes shows no water.\n\n3. Not much defense. Yeah there's a bow, but the arrows take up a decent ammount of resources and it takes a few shots to kill an animal.\n\ntl/dr\nOverall an amazing game. Overall I give it a 9/10.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? GO GET IT.","November 30, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On some stretches of game time I spent more time shuffling things about in my inventory just so I could pick up the one thing I needed. This isn't helped by the fact that the game isn't paused when you're item-sifting.\n\nCons aside, I can recommend this game as a "gorgeous thing" and will probably be jumping back into it soon.\n","May 14","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The Flame in the Flood, an Independent Rouge Like game developed by The Molasses Flood. If independent studios can do one thing right, that one thing would be making rouge like games. In Flame in The Flood you play as Scout, a small girl trying to survive hoping from island to island scavenging for food and supplies. There are plenty of dangers throughout the world, Starvation, Dehydration, Injuries, Wild Animals specifically wolfs, and Disease. Also the river itself isn’t just a peaceful canoe ride while listening to my girl Ann Taylor while painting with Bob Ross. It’s a brutal wasteland filled with jagged rocks, uprooted trees, rusting cars, and sinking houses.\n\nA pretty common occurrence within Indie Games is once again we have this spectacular art style, it looks as if I’m playing within a painting. Every single surface looks hand painted, and the soundtrack this game has fits so perfectly with the scenery it creates this great visual and auditory feeling that’s hard to match. But just as swiftly as these feels enter you they can be stripped away into an addicting panicky chaos. Like when you stumble onto your first Island at the wrong time of day and get mauled by a wolf, barely crawling your way onto the raft to make you escape.\n\nThe game is just as much of a survival game as it is a rouge like game, most of your time will be spent scavenging throughout every island, crafting more useful items, and managing your hunger and thirst. You’ll have to endure in some hunting if you want to survive in this world since the further you go down the river the colder it gets. You’ll have to kill Rabbits, Boars, and Wolves to be able to craft better coats, boots, and hats. There are a variety of crafting options within the game and it honestly didn’t feel like a terrible nonsensical bore. Also a huge part of your time will be spent managing which items you want to pick up and when to craft them into their next tier of item, for example, Sapling into Tinder.\n\nThe river in my mind is super neat, I love the fact that it’s always flowing downstream, if you miss an Island there is no going back. Also it’s a last line of defence against wolves. You can just flee the island hobble onto your raft and try to survive the brutal rapids till the next glimmer of hope, an island with a church. Filled with lots of supplies for healing your wounds and will probably become your favourite island in the game. There is one problem with the river, it’s a little bit difficult to manoeuvre through the rapid parts but to combat this what I did was tried my hardest to stay in the slower sections of the river and take my time.\n\nNow the game isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, there are a couple annoyances that I had with it. Maybe it’s just me but I swear to god every time I lit a fire it would start raining 3 seconds after. Every single time. Another minor issue is your dog companion barks every time he finds something. It becomes so annoying that you’ll be driven to muting the game and listen to your own western sly guitar music. The campaign mode in the game takes FOREVER! It’s not a one session game at all, I played for 3 hours and I hardly made it halfway through the game. For a game that kills you so quickly it makes it damn near impossible. However there are checkpoints at the start of each new zone, which there are 10 zones, I only made it to 5. You really need to be on point and paying attention all the time to visual and audio cues or you will die and you will die a lot.\n\nEither way all that stuff aside I really did enjoy the game I I think that everyone should at least give it a shot, I give the game a 7 out of 10 it’s a pretty great game and I feel you should pick it.","May 15","true","15.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The difficulty curve is high but I'd be ok with that if there was a way to get into the game and build progress and develop. But there isn't, you can only carry over 6 items with the dog and meeting any wild animals early on is a quick death. Raft upgrades are a dream that would need grinding for and finding the right elements and then have it all blown away when you die because you werent crafting weapons.\n\nFor the money there are better games out there at this level which offer a better gaming experience and give you a chance in the game. This just seems to offer the same few zones over and over without much opportunity to craft what you need to take the game on, other than relying on luck.\n\nIts a shame as the presentation is great.

And The Flame in the Flood seems to put emphasis of making the most of your current situation at all times, as the game isn't exactly going to make it easy for you. Resources are scarce and are tied to the environment that it comes in, so those looking for a long-term challenge will find something here. You'll die repeatedly, and for some people, that's going to be great. But here's the problem: the game goes a little too far for me with its mechanics, as the specific afflictions being tied with specific cures end up causing a reliance on some luck: luck that may drive you insane. But for me, the biggest problem with the game: Crashes, and the loss of progress. I'm not seeing it with other people: but at two separate runs, my game crashed, and I was unable to continue that run, as the game would start up, and then be on the load screen indefinitely. It immediately soured my experience on the game, and ended up putting it behind the 8 ball. Even with my other criticisms of the game: it's aesthetic at times not complementing the feelings the game is going for, the lack of story and narrative woven into its fabric, it all comes down to the crashes, and means I can't recommend the game.\n\n\nLists:\n+:\nFor survival fans, the game is brutal, and they'll probably love it. There is a sense of realism that the game has, as it's not apologetic about it.\nThere's a reasonable amount of crafting options.\nThe rafting sections are a nice change of pace and is especially fun when it throws lots of rocks and tight turns.\nThe soundtrack is lovely. Good country soundtrack that complements the survival in question.\nTraveler difficulty was a good addition for those attempting to get into the game.\nUpgrades actually mean something. They aren't just incremental changes that barely affect things: they are absolutely necessary to survive and cause real hard decisions that have to be made.\n-:\nThe Crashes and the corruption of save files. The biggest item in this list: this killed the game for me, and that's a major problem considering what it ended up doing: corrupting my save file....twice.\nWas able to also get myself stuck in the environment at one point, unable to move.\nThe game for me lacks punch. While the white water rafting at times was exciting, the game's lack of creative options made it hard for me to continue on over and over again. It's tedious nature just didn't do well for the type of player that I am.\nYou like micromanaging your inventory, boy do I have the game for you! Seriously, a third of my time was organizing ♥♥♥♥ back and forth, because while you'll end up needing all the items in question, your inventory space isn't exactly going to make that easy on you.\nThe game leaves you to the elements, and sometimes, you learn the hard way. Look, I'm willing to take a bump or two in the name of progress and learning mechanics, but sometimes the game is just silly. Since when is poison ivy red? I mean, I get it, it's a natural color to make people stay away from it, but when it goes against the other realism the game has....that's a major problem.\nThe character models....well they scare me. I know it's an alternative style and all, but I honestly couldn't stand them.","February 24","false","7.6"," 37 of 72 people (51%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","51","37","72","7","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034115180/recommended/318600/","76561198034115180","Shadow","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034115180/","29 products in account","BEFORE READING\n\nI have to say that I'm pretty picky at the game since from alpha, and I've seen the progress it made through since then. And now I must say I'm really satisfied with the improvement they've made. This WAS probably the most frequently-read and most influential negative review on this game. around 300 voted on this review and a whole lot more read it. I willingly changed my oppinion now, and recommend this game to everyone who's interested in a game on this theme. I believe that means a lot, good work devs.\n\n====================Alpha Release Review===================\n\nOVERALL\n\nI most definitely WILL change my review in the future, this review is only based on current version, and the negative review is just to make sure that more people could read this, and to motivate the developers to work on it. I still recommend to try the game even in current version if you like this style, even it is not polished enough.\n\nIt is no longer too hard in current version. Resources are still in scarce, stack numbers are low (1,5 or 10). You can't take too many with you even if you keep throwing away overstocked ones.\n\nNote: difficulty lowered a bit after 2015 Sep 25 update. Which give us a more welcoming start.\n\nMUSIC\n\nI'm pretty impressed by the music and sound effect actually, I wasn't expecting it to be so good. Fits the games style and scenes perfectly. I don't use the word perfectly very often, but personally, I do feel it is flawless.\n\nPLOTS\n\nNone available yet.\n\nMANEUVERABILITY\n\nCurrently, like other players mentioned, how far u go is unlikely to be related to maneuver, strategy or resource management. It is just blind luck - running into a shelter when you are in the rain, happened to find a fire when surrounded by wolves, looted some lumber when the raft is almost apart (and you also run into a shipyard), and if that didn't happen, no matter what u have, u are most likely to be dead, no matter how good you've done so far. I hope resources are more abundant in the future, or alternatively, allow us to carry more. (either by increasing stack number or increasing slots) This are ways to increase inventory slots in the game, but you would be dead 90% of the time before you can get to make the upgrade.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThis game is fast paced and punishing, but fun though, to be scared by boars and wolfs that you didn't noticed, and that comes with a price as well. It is doable to doge attack from boar (it charges in straight line), but it is difficult to survive even one wolf if you don't have the means to kill it or means to heal yourself after been attacked. Speaking of which, you can't just go grab a weapon and kill the wild animals like in other survival game. This game requires more ... indirect ways to defend yourself against attacks, probably because the setting of the character is a little girl intead of some strong guy.\n\nFrankly, in a survival game like this, I don't really buy the idea of been istantly cured after applying bandages and medicines. I'm hoping for more of a process of becoming better and becoming worse when sh*t hits the fan. A medical interface like the one in Project Zomboid or in NEO Scavenger is what I'm looking for.\n\nApart from that, I feel really bad for not being able to plan my next step, I do understand the developers want to randomize the path ahead, but at least provide a certain degree of planning and knowing what to do (maps of roads ahead in the future perhaps, oh, i mean rivers, lol)  And I feel even worse not even having time to plan. Under current version, you simply DO NOT have time to manage all the items you are carrying. Mainly because the all the stats are dropping soooooooo fast. You could easily realize that at least 20 or 30 percent of you stats dropped after you messing with inventory for a while.\n\nUI & CRAFTING\n\nActually, spending a lot of time in inventory management is also partly because the click-menu-interface is just not time-efficient, click and drag approach could make things a lot easier, and I definitely suggest this implementation to be made. Some UI implementation should be made to save excessive time spend for things like arranging items, and dropping items (currently u only get to drop item one by one, what if i wanna drop a stack of dandelions? drop it 10 times! lol.)\n\nCrafting system is a bit problematic, it switches you back to the first item on the list every time you craft something. You have to scroll back to where you were, if you want to continue to craft this item. This sometimes upsets people, because the least the player would expect is to be able to continuously craft more of the same item with only one more click. Currently, there's no drag and drop or drag and move, no double click quick craft, no item swap feature (especially important when u r fully loaded.) It takes a long time only to deal with the interface. If there’s only one thing that could fail this game, I have enough reason to believe it is the UI.\n\nI'm looking forward for the future updates in this game. It has potential, but if no implementations are made, it wouldn't become a good game after all.\n\n====================After Spt 25, 2015 update===================\n\nDifficulty change after Sep 25th helped in a certain degree, at least loots becoming a bit more, and raft become more maneuverable, and it is now easier to avoid crashing into obstacles. Also fewer wolfs to run into in the first few days and miles.\n\nWith the changes made, you have a fair chance to survive for like 3 or 4 weeks and go over 50 miles. Even over 100 miles is possible if you are lucky and careful enough. No implementation on UI & crafting, still feels repetitive.\n\nOne more thought, people would also expect a bit more progressive feeling after every death in endless mode. It simply make people would gradually lose interest starting over again and again without getting something more, something makes u feel accomplished. I don’t know how and what to do, but Devs needs to think on that.\n\n====================After Oct 29, 2015 update===================\n\nStack number rises a little bit, which is good. Finally some means to defend against wolf except traps and tainted meat - bows and arrows. I can feel the game is getting better day by day. However, still no drag and drop interface for items, which I considered a very essential feature for a game like this.\n\nI would be more than happy to give this game a positive rating with this feature added. Although I still hope for a health pannel with more detailed info addressing every part and aspects of my body (like NEO scavenger). I also hope time pass slower, and wear out or get hugury slower. I simply like slower paces, so at least, I hope there'd be an option for player to choose their own pace upon formal realease.\n\n\n====================After Dec 23, 2015 update===================\n\nLots of new contents added, allowing more items to be made, finally have bears in the game!\n\nSpec changed quite a bit, making food in scarce, and weather more severe. More challenging even from early on, but I doubt that means more fun.\n\n====================After Feb 24, 2016 update===================\n\nI have say that, the release made this game really a lot better. Meet up with most of mine expectation now. Mouse interface is good, inventory system is good, crafting system is good, difficulty at a very reasonable level, you could go on for hundreds days like this once u start to get a hang of it. Apart from some minor bugs that a few other reviewers brought up (that don't really affect gameplay that much), I have to say that there's no reason that I should keep a negative review at this point.\n\nTo warp up, this is a game that you must try, and I'm sure you'd know why it is worth-playing after reading through my super long review.","September 26, 2015","true","52.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","9"

Crafting, discovery, exploration, all done in a fun and interesting way - with a female protagonist no less, which is always nice to see.  I won't spoil anything, but there are many little nuances that are so well thought out that you are surprised when you stumble across them despite the fact that they make perfect thematic sense.  The user interface is very friendly and accessible and everything just makes sense.  It may not have the flash of one of the bigger productions, but I know that I've certainly made worse purchases for $18.  My favorite part of this game must be the fact that no little injury or damage to your raft is insignificant.  The battle of attrition certainly piles up if you let it, even something so simple as not paying attention to your fatigue can be costly.  This is an excellent game and is worth your time and money.

I do have some issues with the game however, but don't let this deter you from buying this when it comes out of Early Access. I am merely speculating on a game in beta and hope the implications of this review will, hopefully, get everyone to buy a copy of this game.\n\nFirst and foremost, I like this game. It's a survival genre game that tends to lean towards a dynamic nature side where you are a young girl, the main heroine of the story, rafting down a furious flood to an unknown destination, the flame in the flood if you will, that will (likely) end in your demise (e.g: starvation, dehydration, mauled to death by the local wildlife). It currently has no story (which i'm sure the devs will fix soon when it comes out of Early Access) but it's clear that you don't need much of a story to interpret what her purpose is in this game (I'll leave it to you to decide what you think the story is). As it is, it's a dynamic environment, using randomly proceedural generator to mix up what you encounter brilliantly, and often leads you to either a great gathering find or your imminent death. You feel nature's dynamic chao in this mechanic and it works well in tune with what the heroine wants to do: survive.\n\nSpeaking of her, our main protagonist is silent, yet she emotes well from her actions and no amount of gasping or grunting can even come close to how the player understands her when she heels over and falls to the ground because of exhaustion, or how she limps when she has a broken limb. It's never a surprise if she becomes fatally hindered because the actions will always show before the prompt, giving you enough time to think fast for her survival. From an animator's standpoint, it's brilliantly created.\n\nThe artwork is fantastic and beautiful. Her palette colors compliment the environment around her and the shadows are nicely shaded. Props to the art team, you've done well even in conveying what an incoming rock is in the turbulent river.\n\nMusic and soundtrack is terrific and really gets you into the game's environment as you sleep with the crickets chirping and the mysterious voice singing softly in the background.\n\nFrom a game design standpoint, i'm divided. To begin, the game design towards the beginning is great. It establishes things right from the get go (without being intrusive with the billboard notes in the starter camp) and you get some chances to survive quite conveniently without hindering you later into the game (stepping in fireants to then find some aloe on the same island, breaking a bone in a raft crash and healing with the splint you get towards the beginning). It's definitely forgiving towards the early game, but then it spikes up dramatically with the difficulty affect two things: your survivability, and your forward prep. Two things i believe are essential to the game.\n\nThe animals are quite the interesting elements in the game. The boars are purely territorial, and if you're out of their range then you can freely sneak around and try to search and gathering and slip away into the night. However, wolves are shown to be hungry, vicious predators. They hear your dog, they don't care about territory much and a prompt warns you about them (with somewhat of a deterent) to show just how serious a threat they are. This is very skewed difficulty and it doesn't even take ten minutes into the game before you encounter these obstacles in the way of your gathering mission of survival. They're especially abundant in the city areas and it becomes this mad dash to survive as long as possible on the raft before being starved, dehydrated, and/or exhausted onto an island where you're just too weak to even scare off the local wildlife away. This deeply disappointed me and I felt like no matter what, i couldn't get past them unless I got lucky with the right materials for the one solution possible: the trap. I'd like for the developers to fix this aspect (not necessarily nerfing) to better accomodate the player in the long run and give the player some type of edge other than the trap.\n\nThis leads me to my second point, the trap seems fairly important. You're shown rabbits whom outrun you and can escape your grip and (obviously) rabbits are shown to be a food item. You're told that the one item that you get immediately (the sapling) is key in making traps. And yet, there's no further hints beyond that. It's different for the other things because you're left with room, and the tools, to experiment. This is the "ah-ha!" factor that gives these types of survival games their edge. It just makes sense to use the bottle when near the raft because thats the only body of water readily available to you and you have the water filter (the tool) to make that work. But the trap is the only mystery to me and it leaves me wondering what the trap really looks like. I kinda imagine it to be a box with the sapling and a carrot underneath, but then again i'm not quite sure and the developers should definitely look into this not as a disappointment, but as an opportunity to apply the already done experiment design format of the game.\n\n\nPlease don't mistake my thumbs up w/ a long description of the minor issues to be negative. All great creations must undergo some amount of critical analysis. Plus, I believe this is a really, really, really great game. It's relaxing, fun and high-spirited. It almost feels real and that's rare in a game in this industry these days. The only reason I gave more words to the negative aspects is to give the developers a highly detailed description of the problems so that they can, hopefuly, take initiative and fix it and in turn make it better. I recommend it, definitely.","October 22, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game looks beautiful, the music sounds great. You have a dog and a boat. On top of that, it has many realistic survival elements. Furthermore, a sh*tload of potential for the near future, although it is definitely worth the money already to me. Actually, I got this game as a present, but it's worth €20,- (and more) if you even remotely like good survival games. Alright, the whole concept of going downriver on your raft while coming across all kinds of little islands, mostly containing wolves, boars and/or buildings, while not being able to land on the riverbank, is not really realistic, but it's beautifully executed.

The game introduces the weather elements, getting sick and curing ailements like broken bones and rashes, scrapes and more. As you travel down the river to uncover more elements of the story, the game gets harder and harder. Upgrading your raft along the way is key and once you have finally mastered the game, you can go to endless mode where you can continue your journey indefinitely.

That said, I am very happy I backed it on Kickstarter and I would encourage people to pick it up--the team knows what they're doing and they've kept to a strict aesthetic to both the gameplay and art. It all fits wonderfully, seamlessly even, and that's very impressive.","September 26, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game has changed and improved immensely since the initial beta release, and the developers have ongoing discussions with the community about what should be fixed or changed. Overall, I've enjoyed the game a lot. Here are a few more details regarding likes and dislikes.\n\nLikes\n-Diverse crafting system\n-Expandable backpack and raft storage\n-Customizable and upgradable raft\n-Great music\n-Dynamic environments that change as you progress down the river (i.e. turning from forest to city around the 5 mile point, and everything looks completely different)\n-Aesop the dog is a nice change of pace as a sidekick\n\nAreas of Improvement (None of these are really dislikes, but rather things to be improved/fixed)\n-Difficulty: Of course a rogue-like game is supposed to be hard! That being said, a game that is TOO hard becomes frustrating and ultimately not fun. This can include: 1) Reducing the spawn rate of wolves and hogs. It takes quite a while to find 2 flint, craft a stone knife, find supplies for a box or snare trap, trap a rabbit, kill it, find supplies for tampered meat, then feed it to a wolf. This doesn't apply to hogs as you need to build a spear trap, which is also very time consuming. And it's very likely that you'll encounter hogs, wolves, or both at the same time before you even get to craft the knife. Most of the time, I died trying to set up snares for rabbits because a wolf or hog kept bashing into me since rabbits almost never appear without a hog or wolf close by.\n-Raft controls: The raft controls are still a little wonky, especially with a controller. It would also be helpful to have more key mapping options. The controls are something that can be easily fixed and are not inherently a problem with the game, just a general idea.\n-Add an icon legend: An explanation of the icons for islands would be helpful so players know what items may or may not be there (i.e. a church symbol typically means shelter, searchable boxes, and a fire, but can sometimes have a well/water pump.) It may also be helpful to add danger levels. More dangerous islands could also have more loot.\n-General bug fixes and glitches: 1) My character kept getting stuck standing next to the door for shelter when prompted to sleep, which resulted in her death when hogs and wolves kept attacking me. I think this was because Aesop got stuck somewhere else, and my character was waiting for him to enter first. Maybe include some sort of fix to automatically bring Aesop to her when prompted to sleep? 2) Throwing meat at wolves didn't always work correctly. The wolf would eat it, run away, attack me, then die, whereas it should eat it and immediately die. Wolves also tend to get stuck in rocks, or freeze, only to reappear right next to me and attack me.\n\nFor a game that has only be in beta for about 2 months, and only on Steam Early Access for one day, The Flame in the Flood is leaps and bounds ahead of most other Early Access, and even fully released, games. It is clear that the developers are highly invested in TFINF. They followed through on their Kickstarter goals to the letter, even after the surprise development of an Xbox One version. They consistently update the community and follow up on suggestions and community feedback. I seldom buy Early Access games, and I even less frequently back Kickstarter video game projects (TFITF and Yooka-Laylee are the only games I felt comfortable backing, knowing the development teams behind them).\n\nFinal verdict: This game is definitely worth buying, even in Early Access. As the game changes and updates, especially when the campaign goes live, TFITF will continue to be a fun and dynamic experience that is worth $20.\n","September 24, 2015","true","38.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You play as a girl with a dog whose sole job is to survive. You do that by getting on your raft and traversing the rapids while stopping periodically for supplies and food. You can die in numerous ways such as by starvation, wolf attacks, hypothermia, and exhaustion. The learning curve is somewhat steep but after a while you get the hang of it.  However this does not mean the game is easy, as you could die from a sudden misstep such as thinking you could take on three wolves.\nThe game features a campaign and an endless mode; the campaign took me 9 hours without touching the endless mode.

Some of the screenshots don’t even look like screenshots, I’d swear they were drawn. I’m not sure why the dog is wearing glasses though, that’s a bit odd. I’m not even sure if they’re glasses, actually. The whole game just looks weird and wrong, but beautiful at the same time. This is one of the few instances where looking “wrong” is actually a compliment.\n\nThe visuals combined with the soundtrack give the game a great sense of atmosphere. It’s one of those games where each run takes a just a little bit longer than you should probably be spending playing the game, but you keep playing anyway, because you’re instantly invested in what you’re doing. And then you’re late for work and your girlfriend leaves you and your life is ruined, but it’s okay because you made it 20 miles or whatever and who needs love anyways, it’s overrated. I would know.\n\nThe game consists of small, isolated areas. Once you’re doing scavenging one island, you get on your raft, and move on to the next. As you’re moving downriver, you have to dodge oncoming objects to avoid damaging your raft. It’s a simple concept.\n\nAs someone who usually isn’t a big fan of survival games, I really enjoyed this one. I usually get to a point where I feel comfortable, then get bored and die because I wasn’t paying attention. The Flame in the Flood doesn’t wasn’t like that. Instead of trying to build some tool or machine that will progress you to the next tier in the crafting system, you simply gather food, water, and supplies, hoping to survive just one more day. This makes every moment feel important. You’re constantly moving downriver, looking for a nice patch of yucca to hold you off until tomorrow.\n\nThere is a lower difficulty setting, which gives you a more merciful amount of food and supplies, as well as allowing you to save at checkpoints. There are also two gamemodes: Endless, which is self-explanatory, and Campaign. Your goal in the Campaign mode is simply to reach the end of the game by moving downriver. I’m terrible at these sorts of games, as I lack any real patience, and so I haven’t managed to get very far, but I feel like the Campaign mode alone will keep most players occupied for quite a while.\n\nThe Flame in the Flood has an almost arcadey feel to it, simplifying survival yet retaining what makes it so fun, and all while maintaining it’s haunting atmosphere. While The Flame in the Flood didn’t make me love survival, I certainly enjoyed it. If you’re looking for something tense with a sense of adventure, this’ll make for an exciting weekend.\n\nMore more verbal garbage visit: http://probablysanny.wordpress.com","March 7","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/APDickery/recommended/318600/","APDickery","Mattias6689","http://steamcommunity.com/id/APDickery/","5 products in account","The Flame in the Flood combines survivalist style play with the all or nothing desperation that I have come to expect from rogue-like games. Story mode is interesting enough and for those who care to dig it offers a rather interesting take on the post societal genre that refreshingly enough has nothing to do with zombies or world war III. The game also includes a continuous survival mode for endurance runs and keeps track of your records for day's survived and miles traveled. The developers are continuously involved in tweaking and patching the game as the need arises, and in my experience have been quite helpful.\n\nThe games main protagonist, a young woman who is only known as Scout, is introduced via Aesop, a friendly and mildly help canine. Aesop discovers Scout taking shelter at a long abandoned camp and presents her with a rucksack and a radio, prompting her to investigate its mysterious signal for lack of any other direction in life besides not dying. From here her, and your primary concerns are gathering resources to stay fed, hydrated, warm and dry. Sleep deprivation, hypothermia, starvation, parasites, infections and a whole host of other maladies are your first foes in this quest to live to see the end of the river. Don't stand around thinking about things too long though,because every moment that passes in the game you get just a little bit hungrier, a little colder, a bit more tired and bit more thirsty. Do Not Idle. Once you get used to managing these necessities, or not, you are introduced to the other dangers of the wilderness. Boars, wolves and bears deal more direct forms of life threatening injuries that will demand attention, assuming you live long enough to treat them. Direct combat options are limited to nonexistent in this game and most of your defense comes in the form of traps. In later stages a bow is obtainable, but it is very slow to aim and does little damage compared to the spear trap. Parish the thought of a stand and fight game, planning and guile are your safest bet, and when that fails run like hell. Everything is faster than you in the the wilderness though, so you'll need to be ready to do some quick thinking and fancy dodging if you want to avoid getting gored full of holes or torn to ribbons. Similarly fancy piloting is required to progress down the flooded remains of backwaters, towns, cities and industrial sites that are now the big river. Old cars, trees and sometimes whole barns float along side, and frequently into the side of your raft. Repairs quickly become necessary and carelessness can land you trapped in rocks or smashed repeatedly into the sides of islands as you struggle against the tides to free your junk raft from impending doom. At times the river is almost a little too unforgiving, but It lends itself well to the overall atmosphere of the game.\n\nPros: The soundtrack grabbed me from the start, I believe it was made specifically for this game and it's clearly tailored to the atmosphere of the title. At the time I'm writing this the game has two difficulty settings, Traveler and Survivalist. Traveler offers checkpoints and moderate scarcity of resources which allows for a much easier learning curve for beginner or casual players. Survivalist is more like a true rogue-like with permadeath, scarce resources and a more rapidly dwindling set of vitals. However, even on the more difficult survivalist mode your canine companion, Aesop retains his inventory on every restart. This allows you to hold over some items from the previous play through for a small step ahead at the beginning of your next run.\n\nCons: Bouts of bad luck with loot generation can deprive you of essential materials, leaving you frustratingly without recourse as you slowly succumb to the elements. While at times this instills a very appropriate sense of dread and despair that comes from a tough survival style game, other times it just feels as though the game is working against you in ways that break the immersion. This combined with a lack of flexibility in certain crafting recipes can leave you pulling your hair out and asking yourself why you cant just use a your steel knife to do your flint blade's job as you starve with an inventory full of trap parts and nothing to put them together with.\n\nThere were a few instances where prolonged runs of rotten luck became the death of me, but if you're careful and clever it's still possible to get out of tough spots. Once you get the swing of things, there's really nothing quite like dragging your bloodied broken body back from the brink of death, nursing yourself back to health and hitting the big river again in stride to live another day. Or not. All in all I enjoyed The Flame in the Flood. Its shortcomings, however momentarily frustrating, didn't prevent me from playing over and over again. I look forward to seeing how this title continues to polish up and I'll certainly be coming back for a few more trips down the big river. Enjoy.","March 5","true","34.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For example, in my fourth game, I was really short on cat tails. Even though I visited every place I could on my way, I found some (more than those fixed 4 before you set sail for the first time) in region 3 where I barely got to, because there is really a hard time to survive without cat tails (or saplings). Also, could the game please be more straightforward, that it won't let me continue from my checkpoint? Because last 2 times I died (in region 6 and 7) it asked me which checkpoint I want to load, and even though I selected the last one, I had to start again. So there are few possibilities.\n1) The game hates me... :(\n2) The game likes me, but likes to troll me :(\n3) There is something wrong with the game\nIf 3) is true, could you please fix it, so I could finally see the ending?","May 3","true","19.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Other times the difficulty and ease of navigation just seem so damned randomized, but maybe that's the point, given the theme. I associate the word game with fun, and slogging through "The Flame In The Flood"at times is definitely not fun. I think what Indie developers lose sight of within their abilty to create anything they can imagine is the fact that they are trying to make money selling games. Games should be fun. If you are frustrated with a game to the point that you stop playing it, it means it isn't fun. If you sold a million copies of a game that only 300 people actually bother to finish I wouldn't consider that to be a success. It means you ran a really great marketing campaign and your game was well received by people who hadn't played it yet. You won't survive in this industry being a one trick pony. Make something great that people associate your name with. Keep them coming back. That's how you got here isn't it? your company couldn't sustain itself? Be better than that.\nI'm going to go ahead and give this review "recommend" status, but I am really on the fence.

CHECK.\n\n- Do you enjoy a game that offers a challege every time you play that is easy to learn yet difficult to master?  CHECK.\n\n- Do you think you'd enjoy a game where you get to float down a believable natural acting river that requires precise and accurate hand-eye coordination to master it and be able to float where you want to go?  CHECK.\n\n- Do you want a game that even in early access oozes quality and shows the developers true passion for creating a high quality game as good or even better then what they envisioned when they first thought up their game ideas?  CHECK.\n\n- Do you want a game that requires inventory management, offers crafting, and requires thinking ahead to be prepared for all the elements nature can present?  CHECK.\n\n- Do you want a game that is so addicting, it almost feels as if it's calling you back to play it again hours after to stop playing it?  CHECK.\n\nOkay, you get the point!  This is a well-oiled game that truly shows how fine an indie game can be when developers put their heart and soul into trying to make a perfect game that exceeds their lofty goals while making sure they make it both beautiful to behold and a joy to play.\n\nDeliverance might be a movie many of us remember starring a river even more memorable then it's star Burt Reynolds, but The Flame in the Flood is a game about you, a dog, and mostly a river that offers plenty of white water rapids, tons of close crashes, and heart pounding adventure on the many islands along the way.  While Deliverance might be a good movie we still remember from more then 40 years ago, The Flame in The Flood is even more epic, more fun, and in my mind is much more the quality of the movie "A River Runs Through It" then Deliverance.  A lot of games these days are "good" (Deliverance) but very few are fine enough to touch our soul (A River Runs Through It)\n\nMy Score already in Early access is a 99 out of 100.  (Value 40/40, Fun 30/30, Controls & Bugs 19/20, Graphics & Sound 10/10)\n\nI've reviewed over 100 Steam games to this point, and no game has ever scored higher in my book.  That says something!  This game will and SHOULD move to the top of the Steam sales charts very quickly.. and I believe it will stay there for a long time!\n\nThis game is a masterpiece.

It was a bit rough around the edges when I first played the game, but it's come a long way since then. The improvements to the crafting and inventory system alone are worth praise. Beyond that the amount and quality of content that has been added is also praise worthy. Control is fluid and easy to pick up both on and off the river. The difficulty of the game has been addressed as well as previously it was near impossible to survive for more than an hour. I highly recommend buying this game as the developers have so far done a great job improving the game and adding content.\n\nAlso, the music is fantastic.","September 24, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

This game is likely to bring you over to the frusturating world that is Survival, but if you are already playing those types of games The Flame in the Flood is just an interesting distraction at best. I know people are going to laugh at my measley half hour when I say what I am about to say, but let's put it this way: I play the LONG DARK. The Long Dark is a much more hardcore survival experience than this game will ever be. The crafting system is weak, the rafting system is NOT what i expected and honestly this feels like a child's introduction into survival games. Finding a place to sleep at night is a joke. All you have to do is get into a raft, go to the first island with a building, walk up to the building and boom bam, sleep. I also find it very weird that time goes by so fast. Like 3 days passed when I was rafting to the closest island 300 meters away. Why? The wolves just don't do it for me either. They look like mangy chupacabras for one and for two they are easily out ran. In the long dark I have to take longer routes through confusing forests just to avoid getting eaten by wolves and bears on the way to a fishing hut. Also there are no parasites in the food, no pain killers or anti bodies. It's just not a realistic experience at all... I've probably offended a lot of people, but I prefer a type of game where I'm guaranteed death from the start, this game just seems very arcade like. It's a shame because the only reason I bought the Long Dark was by a fluke, I actually meant to buy this game. I'm glad i didn't. I longed to play this game for a while but when I finally got it today it just wasnt worth it. Like the top line suggests, I don't recommend this to people who want a true survivalist experience. Go play the Long Dark if you want to play a game that challenges your survival instincts. As a game this isn't so bad. It's well made, has it's own "challenges", beautiful artwork and graphics, etc. It's just not for me. IF I had a daughter or little sister I would buy this game for them. This is one of those rare moments I struggle with a thumbs up or thumbs down. Games aren't so black and white, life isn't either. Steam should know this. So even though I place a thumbs down, know I do not hate the game, it just isn't for me.","April 25","false","0.4"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","1"

It feels more frustrating than anything to try and avoid floating houses and other debris, and the further you go, the more difficult it is to navigate the rapids, which just adds to the frustration. The controls are stiff and clunky, and it's often a pain in the ♥♥♥ to try and dock in as many locations as possible, which you're pretty much obligated to do if you want to have a chance to finish this game.\n\nI kinda like the idea that the stuff you leave in the dog's backpack carries over your next playthrough, but I also think it's pretty silly, and too much of an incentive to just ''give up''. If things are going badly, you can put your best stuff in the little guy's bag and commit suicide to give you an advantage on your next start. Not very survival-ish. I prefer to tempt fate until my very last breath, but to each his own.\n\nThe music is alright for a little while. The acoustic parts are even rather lovely. But when you're drowning and a man from the Southern US sings an upbeat country/rock song about friendship and survival, you kinda feel like throwing your mouse through the window and never play this game again.\n\nIn my humble opinion, The Long Dark is a notch above this one. And it's Canadian. Go play that instead.","March 30","false","6.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","3","9","2","0"

I'm telling the character to row in a direction and nothing responds in any way. Considering this is part of the main gameplay loop (river/areas) the game will constantly make you crash into obstacles despite you trying to avoid them as you drift into them uncontrollably.\n\nThe island sections are ok, but are very luck reliant about what materials you find.  One run you'll find nothing but building materials so you will slowly starve. The next will be the opposite and every hit on your raft will be essentially permanent.","February 26","false","1.8"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","41","9","22","3","3"

Learning from previous mistakes to survive better the next time. Learning how to scare away bears or avoid boars giving you a laceration and eventually leaving you with a severe infection.\nThis is a game I can see I'll be spending a great deal of time with. The UI is simple and functional. The controls are very easy to pick up quickly.\nI can't wait to spend more time with the game and I'll update this review if my opinions change in anyway.\nIf your a fan of survival games or games with high amount of replayability i'd recommend this highly.\n","February 24","true","0.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

The survivalist element is really awesome and realisytic, the art style is great, the music is great, and so on.\n\nThere are two problems. The first problem is the most important: During trips on the raft, you have basically no control over what your raft does, so whether or not you hit obstacles is completely random. This means that your ability to progress in the game is hamstrung by poor controls, rather than your ability as a player. For me personally, I've given up on the game for just this reason. I simply can't progress any further without crashing and dying.\n\nThe second problem is less important, but still makes a big difference. There's no tutorial. This might not sound like a big deal, until you realize that you don't know how to drink water. It can be raining, there can be puddles, there's a freakin river, and still you don't know how to drink water. It took me forever to figure this out, and it took pure guesswork on my part. That isn't a "steep learning curve," that's just bad game design.\n\nAside from these flaws, I'm sure this is a great game, but I have to give it a thumbs down, almost entirely due to the raft problem.","March 19","false","1.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

That's already a point against it in my book, but the visuals and music are so enticing I backed it on Kickstarter.\n\nIf I lost because of my own bad judgments and occasional bad luck, I'd probably stick with it, but when I lose because I can't get the damn controls to work on the river or the bloody cursor vanishes again when I'm trying to run away from something or select a menu option to open a door or eat something then it's just not worth the pain.\n\nPlaying on Mac with an attached monitor (which may explain the vanishing cursor) and using keyboard (which may explain the janky river behavior).\n\nIt's a damn shame because there's a great deal to appeal to the non-twitch-&-click player here.

It maintains an immersive world, and a pretty aesthetic while also providing a game that is replayable and filled with content. There are two game modes, one allowing you to pursue a narrative and another that allows you to try to survive as long as you can. The crafting makes sense and seems to have a decent amount of content to find and create.\n\nPros\n---------\n+ Great texture work and overall aesthetic\n+ The color schemes used are great\n+ Gameplay provides a challenge and is rewarding\n+ Large amount of content for the price\n+ Interesting world to explore\n+ Entertaining characters\n+ Great soundtrack\n\nCons\n---------\n- Harm that isnt always telegraphed well (ants behind buildings, thorns in hard to see places)\n- Performance bumps and a crash (seems to be fine now)\n- Weird (feature?) that selects a item partially down in your inventory (last used?) on opening and then when tried to scroll through it resets to the top\n\nOverall\n---------\nReally solid game for the price and provides an interesting world for you to survive in.

The Flame in the Flood takes many of the concepts of the typical survival game and improves it making it a fun and enjoyable experience in a rogue-like fasion. Sure food and water are priority as always but this time environment plays a much much more important role. The game is also pretty brutal. Make a mistake or ignore some items and it may bite you in the butt much later on.\n\nStory wise the game focuses on Scout, a young girl who is in the middle of post-societal America. Along with her is a dog by the name of Aesop who has the ( uncanny ability to find other young girls after they die).  There main storyline in the campaign has Scout and Aesop looking for a radio signal. There's not much in the way of storyline after this but it doesnt' make the feel of the game anyworse. There are some oddball characters here and there that Scout can talk to but otherwise Scout is by herself with the dog. Everyplay through you do has different feel as the enviroment changes and priorty changes. At its core the games story is about you (Scout) and your ability to deal with the true main charater of the main; the River.\n\nGameplay focuses on the typical survive, get food, and get help. However the big shift is on the river and the weather playing a much larger part. Going down the river itself is a challenge. With the change in currents and random changes in weather pattern the game becomes much more intense. One moment everything is nice as the current is going a snails pace but then the next second thunder roles in and you can barely see. Disease and sickness plays a role making medical supplies a godsend. One of the most important things as well is that items that are put onto Aesop carrys over into the next playthrough. Meaning if you die in a run, the next one you start up will have items from the prevous carried over. This game is pretty difficult and death is not uncommon so it gives your next poor Scout much more of a fighting chance.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is amazing to say the least. Really puts you into a feel good state when you're heading down a river with nothing but the clothes on your back, a dog by your side, and a chunk of hope. And when things do start to go bad the game has no problem putting you into the state of panic.\n\nThe controls in the game are a bit of a problem if you're using a mouse and a keyboard. It can feel off putting, but it is still manageable. A controller is much better and feels much more responsive. The river section of the game has much better flow with a controller rather than mouse and keyboard.\n\nThe Flame in the Flood is a great indie game that really came out of nowhere. It's an enjoyable experience through and through and as quite a bit of replayability. Although it may be frustrating at times, its quite a fun one. Highly recommend for anyone looking for  a great survival indie game.\n\nPros:\nGreat Gameplay\nFantastic Art\nGood Soundtrack\nHigh Replay Value\n\nCons:\nLacking in story department\nClunky mouse and keyboard controls\nInventory Management gets tedious at times","February 25","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Death doesn't lead to frustration, but provides a learning experience and surge of determination. I found it extremely easy to pick up and even pretty easy to master (at least in "traveller" campaign mode, I suspect the other mode is a lot harder).\n\nIf there's any greviance with the game it's that I seem to spend about a third of my time running between the dock and the island, trying to furiously reorganize my inventory. I really wish that a) players could organize their inventory by clicking and dragging, and b) that there was a "consolidate" button that recognized when you had items that could be stacked and did it for you. I would take the former over the latter, but both would be extremely useful.\nDespite inventory management quickly becoming a central component, on balance it feels more like you're forced to make strategic choices of risk and reward (great for a survival game) rather than slogging through an unwieldly chore.\n\nThere isn't much of a story here (and it honestly feels like one big allegory for you-can-guess-what) but the characters that exist are fun enough to come across, and have multiple sets of dialogue throughout your playthroughs. Paired with a soundtrack and art perfectly suited to backwater exploration, The Flame in the Flood is a great addition for anyone looking for an absorbing survival rogue-lite.","March 18","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first, is that fact that, as a drifter on a mighty nameless river, you can't stay put anywhere.  No setting up shop in some idilic grove and living off of the land forever.  Once you've cleared out a spot, or decided to run from the wildlife, you need to keep heading downriver.  No chance to tun back once things get rough.  All you can do is press on and hope for the best.  The second is in the presentation.  Cartoony survival games are nothing new (fans of Don't Starve will be the first in line to point that out), but the folky Southern charm of the game shines in the music and limited interactions with NPCs.  The soundtrack is very fitting, though there are a few points were the lyrics pop so loudly that I can't hear the howls of the wolves as they prepare to rip me apart.\n\nThe survival does lack depth in some areas.  Don't expect to craft any buildings or a vast array of deadly weapons.  All you can do is work on your raft and make traps, as well as a bow that's clunky to use.  Most of the time you'll find yourself running from every enemy, which can make for some annoying parts late in the game when every island has a pack of elder wolves.  The Flame in the Flood has a short campaign mode with a decent story to go along with it, and after completing it I was satisfyied and felt no real need to throw a bunch of hours on endless.","March 19","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It deserves a more 55/100ish rating.\n\nI really don't understand. I bought this game the first time I saw it in early access, played it around four hours or so and loved it. I think I had it lock up on me once or twice, and the audio go out once, but nothing I wouldn't expect from an EA title.\n\nNow though, my first time going back to it after full release, it's just... worse in all ways.  Load times are long, so much so I think the game has locked up, same holds true for going into/out of the options screen.\n\nThe game has also gotten boring. I don't know exactly how to explain it, but there are subtle things with the design that have changed that make the game more annoying to play than it was before. It has nothing to do with the survival aspect, or being tougher or anything like that, it's just slightly different in a way that bugs me. I think it has to do with the items. I did play Story mode for the first time, so I can't say if it's the same now in Endless mode or not.\n\nI still love the graphics in this game, and the music and sound design are amazing. The controls on the river are still beyond maddening (my last playthrough I died because the current stopped carrying me and just pinballed me left and right against some land and a rock that was jutting up, even when I tried to boost away).\n\nI don't want to say this is a baaaad game, because it's not. It's just not great, and in my opinion has gotten worse since full release. It does deserve to be played if you like these types of games, but I'd suggest waiting for a hefty sale.\n\nWindows 10 64bit\ni7 5930 OC to 4.2GhZ\nGTX 980Ti\n16GB Ram\nInstalled on a 2GB HDD","March 16","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The protagonist looks rather genderless and I really enjoyed that! So it basically comprises of two modes: the river mode and the exploration mode.\n\nIn river mode you gotta swerve from obstacles and get to the docks of interesting places. It is simple enough and throughout the game you get the opportunity to upgrade your raft, thus making it easier to maneuver.\n\nExploration mode is different. Each place you stop there's some interesting stuff to do and hazards you gotta avoid. After a while it was just too easy to survive and I believe Event AI could've been better implemented.\n\nA lot of bugs affected my experience and I got some achievements I didn't deserve (such as the Animal Friendly) and I didn't get achievements I actually deserved. Also the soundtrack would stop all of a sudden, it was really weird. To be fair, I bought this game the same day it was released and I bet the developers fixed most of the bugs I just mentioned. If you're reading this you'll probably have a better experience than me.\n\nOh, I'm not coming back for the endless mode. I felt the campaign mode was already dragging enough as it was.\nAnd there's a chord progression on the theme song that reminded me an awful lot of Bob Dylan's "Hurricane".","March 9","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The devs did a great job so far, the soundtrack fits the game very well, and it's a fun take on survival games.  It can be pretty tough to get the hang of and the lack of inventory space is limited at first but once you get a pouch or upgrade your raft, your main struggle will probably be keeping warm.\n\nThere is no real story aside from what you make of it --  especially with the campaign ending it gives you, (which I think suits the game perfectly).  It would be nice to see some different characters/companions to choose from in the future, but I'm content with what it has now.\n\nAlso, it seems I was wrong about the vege/animal friend achievment...you can lour boars/wolves into snakes and even use their fur, so-long as you don't eat their meats!\n\n---\n\nJust played a-few more hours and finally got past the first bit...this game can be pretty tough at the start but quickly becomes relitively easy once you get the hang of it.  My game was cut short because of a hard crash though.\n\nApparently a wolf will never kill a boar and any animals killed by snakes or bears seem to count as you being the one killing them...so the vegetarian and friend of the animals achievment is unfortunately based more on luck than not killing/eating them. :(\n\n---\n\nThe game currently has some annoying bugs like docks covered in rocks, areas in the river that will infinitely damage you, and disappearing text above any loot.  I'd also like to see a better camera system as I'm not keen on running into a thorn bush hidden behind a building.\n\nI'd really like to enjoy this game as it's a nice take on the survival genre but it needs patching first.\n\nThere also seems to be alot of down-rating of anyone critical of this game at the moment, even if they point out numberous problems.","February 25","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

For example, in one of the playthroughs I couldn't find any new food in a mile.\nAlso, if there is an animal on an island, it would follow you forever.

It has a weirdly peaceful feel to it that never seems to settle into just being repetitive.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple. Make your way down the river while scavenging for supplies, avoiding threats, improving your raft, and trying to stay alive. Based on the pleasant artwork, I assumed that it wouldn't be too difficult on the lower settings, but you definitely have to manage resources and threats carefully. You don't start the game with a whole lot of storage, so you have to be careful in stockpiling things that you'll need. I got overconfident in a few places and wound up with broken bones that did me in.\n\nLater on, it actually gets a bit easier on the regular difficulty if you're managing your supplies correctly and making the necessary upgrades to your raft and gear. You still can't be too careless with your raft, because up until the last sector repair supplies (which are also upgrade materials) were really scarce.\n\nSo where does the peaceful part come in? It's a combination of floating down a river, which is an idyllic kind of scenario, and the soundtrack, which the develops were heavily involved with. You've also got a dog, so when you're not being chased by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off boar or trying to figure out how to kill a bear, it feels more like an adventure. Mechanically, I do wish the dog was a bit more heavily involved in gameplay beyond helping you carry supplies (he barks at stuff you can interact with, but if you're paying attention, you should be fine), but I still like it.\n\nFurthermore, reading the developer's notes make it clear that this was a project they put a lot of feeling into, down to the names of dogs you encounter, as well as the creation of the music. It comes across. I'm looking forward to replaying this on a harder difficulty as well as doing endless mode and seeing how far I can make it.","May 12","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

More in-game guidance would help, as would better setting of expectations. I died 5 times by the same boar (respawn checkpoint) before reading online that until I had certain items I'd always die - ended up having to restart from scratch.\n\nAdditionally, a glitch in securing checkpoints meant I was stuck at a dock (post repair) smashing into it constantly until I died. This all amounts to a whole lot of frustration and subsequent disengagement in the game.\n\nHere's to hoping most bugs get squash ASAP.\nCheers, Marshy.","May 15","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's simple crafting mechanics and navigation, mixed with the art style and sudo story all make for a fun little game for a first time indie dev team. Also the OST is great if your into sort of country, blue grass kind of stuff.\n\nAs for the story, well there sort of isn't one really. There is but I think your suppose to really make it up your self as you go along. There was a flood that destroyed the majority of the world and you are a survivor is the majority of it.(If you can get to the end of the campaign there is some pretty interesting stuff going on there is all I will say.) There are random encounters to talk to and some quilts that tell you some stuff but nothing is fully explained and that's part of the charm as to why I personally like the game.\n\nI played the campaign on easy and cant imagine doing the harder difficulty where item drops are lessened and endless mode holds no appeal to me. I came for the story, got what I could out of it and now I'm done. That's the only real problem this game has is that there really is no replay value.\n\nBut as I said at the begging, I like the game for what it is.
