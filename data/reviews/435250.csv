It's pretty simple, weights only 53!!! Mb, but it's still awesome and very fun to play. I've spent countless hours with this game over those years, and i'm glad to buy this awesome game on steam\n\n+Charming ugliness of the old game\n+Blood and gore - you can dismember zombies (as well as spiders and skeletons) on shot AND they can still chase you after your shot half of their hear or arm (i once had a zombie chasing me without 2 arms)\n+REALISM - you can shoot the sword or armor plates out of the attackers hand.\n+Awesome music\n+Perfect in it's simplicity, you can play it like once per week and never get bored\n+4 difficulties and 3 gamemodes\n+A lot of different guns\n+Replayability\n+As 10 years old game i was glad to find out that it perfectly works on win7 x64 and it has HD resolutions\n+Cheap as hell\n-Mouse sensitivity can be super high even at lowest settings\n-Some levels can be super god damn long, like, zombies never stop spawn :)","April 25","true","0.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","14","18","4","0"

It's fantastic. I've been palying this game for years, purchased it from their site right before it was taken down because of Akella.\n\nThis is from a time when indie titles were tucked away from the public, when you found them by accident or only word of mouth.\n\nPros\nRuns at over 400fps at 2560x1440 on my system.\nEasy to pickup game play\nTons of enemies\nTons of weapons\nNice level variety.\n\nCons\nThe damn enemies run at just the right speed to usually get one hit off on you when you cross paths.\nTrees... running backwards and hitting a tree screws you pretty bad lol.\nTook so long to get on Steam!\n\n100% recommend this game!\n","January 16","true","8.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","11","16","3","0"

Just picked it up, and this game was definitely worth $5. If you're one to complain about graphics, look elsewhere. This is a solid shooter, and although there are things that it could improve on (lack of melee attacks, kinda repetitive at times, etc.), it's absolutely worth your time.","February 14","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I enjoyed it as I did when I played the demo.\n\nIt can be repeatitive but don't let that steer you away from giving it a go. It's a fun time waster and it has some cool features such as the monster damage. Things like armor pieces falling off when you shoot them, limbs getting blown off, bullet holes, that kind of thing. Which for its time was pretty advanced. Sure other games did it too but for an indie game it's a pretty impressive effort.\n\nI don't know if it's just my system but it does this odd "fast forward" thing at the start of a level before returning to normal speed. I don't remember that happening in the demo.\n\nAll in all it's fun and that's what counts. I recommend giving it a go.","March 28","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
