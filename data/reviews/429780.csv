"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trashygirl/recommended/429780/","trashygirl","lily.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trashygirl/","58 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDisclaimer I just want to make it clear that this game is not like bunnyhopping on csgo, css, gmod etc...\n\nTo all the people who have said "maybe they didn't want mechanics/the game to be the same as bunny hopping in source games"\nIf they did, maybe they shouldn't sell it as "right back to...when hopping, strafing and sliding were all the rage."\nThey should probably make it quite obvious that they are going to change the mechanics as the mechanics are what make bunnyhopping, well bunnyhopping.\nDon't sell your product as something that it isn't I reviewed this product coming off what they have specifically advertised it as a "remastered" "all in one" game made for bunnyhopping (with the inclusion of sliding). If that's not what they were going for, they should make it much more obvious that it is not, instead of literally selling it as it, I don't want people getting their hopes up and falling in the same trap as I did.\n\nIntro This is coming from a very experienced bunny hopper, thousands of hours actually bunny hopping on source, csgo and gmod.\nCheck my youtube if you want proof or whatever.\n\nFirstly, as a disclaimer, I am giving no credit to the looks of this game visually, it does look very good yes, however it's made in the unreal engine, pulling off visually appealing games is very simple due to the lighting in the engine and the high resolution textures in the engine already.\n\nMechanics/Gameplay (most of the review and is very important.)\nMap Design\nSound/Options Menu.\nFinal Thoughts\nMechanics/Gameplay This game is done in a very poor way, let me explain.\nStrafing in the source engine is done by sync, the way that it works in short is if you have a +left (mouse movement to the left tick) along with a +moveleft (left strafe tick) in the air, then you gain speed.\nThis means that as long as you are doing this, you will gain speed and with autohop, when you land and jump again you will not lose this speed.\n\nThis is the core basics to bunnyhopping in any source engine game.\nBunny hop league is made in the unreal engine, and the mechanics are no way like the source engines'.\n\nBunny hop league in its current state, when you strafe in the air while turning your mouse you gain speed, however you dont keep your speed.\nAlso, its not based on sync either, it's literally the further you strafe, the faster you go, so if you wanted to go fast you have to do 180 degree turns just to go fast, and you have to keep up these strafes because you actually lose speed, until you go at the base movement speed.\nThis completely kills the whole point of the game as you aren't able to keep your speed properly, nor does it replicate the original mechanics coming from the source engine.\n\nMy point is, this game is actually awful in terms of making a game to replicate bunnyhop.\nIt doesn't replicate the mechanics, only the maps which causes an awful experience to old players and new ones.\n\nMap Design *edited*\nA basic lesson you learn when remastering or creating a game of another is that you can't change the mechanics of a game, and keep the same map design, or vice versa.\nIt just doesn't work, the maps design doesn't fit with the new mechanics at all.\nDue to the way you get acceleration with the new mechanics there is no way to go fast without it just being a difficult mess with overly wide strafes, you cannot skip blocks either when you go fast because as soon as you stop having big strafes you LOSE SPEED, so you cant actually keep the speed you made which is core to bunnyhopping in the way it is.\n\nSo even if these mechanics were intended to be in the current state that they are, the maps that have been made for them are not appropriate at all, all the block spacing and placements are very strange and force you to have very small strafes, which with the mechanics of the game, make you go slow, so you are either going very slow constantly, or going fast and failing miserably or having a very awkward time doing 180 strafes.\nAdditionaly, the blocks on the maps are almost all the same size all the time, it's almost like you did no research into bhop map making at all, difficulty scales really well with block size and you seemed to have just been blind to it the whole time, and with the mechanics of the game being off, it's really difficult to land on blocks that small.\n\nFinally, about map design, on a few of your maps you have areas where you have to travel up a vertical area using jump pads, these are so hard to do as an ex source player due to the mechanics just being so off.\nIn these sections, you need to strafe a lot to keep your speed, this means doing mutiple 360s in the air and turning very fast.\nIn source, doing this action and gaining speed is quite hard to pull off, but once mastered you can control your speed.\nIn BHL, as I said before, the more you turn in the air, the more speed you gain, which ends up just making you go stupidly fast and its impossible to control, with the combination of this and the small blocks, these sections are actually hard as ♥♥♥♥, unless you throw all skill out the window and just dont strafe and "W" it, which isn't fun.\n\nSound/Options Menu."Firstly, No sound?\nAt all?\nNo sound effects at all?\nEven for the menus????"\nMy exact words, when I booted this game up on my stream.\nI know this is early access, £2, but you shouldn't be allowed to sell a product, and expect things like this to not be critiqued, very dissapointing, you couldn't of just spend a day making placeholder sounds and putting them in before releasing the game?\n\nThe menu options is even worse.\nYou appeal to the competitive bunny hop community with the release of your game, you must of understood this, and with that, your controls options are completely empty apart from sensitivity, which is a SLIDER.\nPeople want to replicate their controls from the game you are taking from, give us a value please, not an ambiguous slider which doesnt give us any way to see how close/far away we are from the exact sensitivity we have been playing on for years.\nNo movement bind changes too, please put basic expectancies in your game before releasing it as a sold product.\n\nVideo options, got the basics down at least, resolution changes, graphics quality changes, gamma changes.\n\nFinal ThoughtsThe game has a lot of potential, when I saw it, my first thought was "Great, this could be the game that brings all the bunnyhop community together from csgo, source, gmod etc... and bring them to one game, and really iron out all the problems that the source engine has and make bunnyhopping great again"\nBut this just isn't the way to do it honestly.\nYou really have to perfect the way that source engine strafing works if you want people to take your game seriously.\nThe game looks nice and the idea is amazing.\nPlease research maps, there are so many amazing css maps, just spend an hour or two on gamebanana and check out and playtest maps, get some diversity, see how they play out, watch top level css players, get a feel for what high level play looks like, it will help you out so much.\nI want to love this game and I want it to have the potential to bring the bhop community together, but you really have to make some serious improvements, at this point it's not even worth the £2.00 to spend on the game.","April 28","false","0.3"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pcpie2/recommended/429780/","pcpie2","-pcpie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pcpie2/","48 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGood idea to bring bunny hopping to a newer engine, but it needs a lot more work one on the strafing and the feel of the game before its fun to play. I don't think it should copy the strafe style from the source engine but rather make something new that still feels very nice to play if not better. imo it would be best to make something that encourages you to strafe smoothly rather than something where you just have to spam strafes in order to go fast.\n\nI would only recommend buying it at this time if you're curious about it and want to support the developer. I'm saying that mainly because of the lack of content, there's only 7 maps in the game right now plus a tutorial map. I think it would be a good idea to allow people to make custom maps and upload them for other people to play, even though the game is no where near to being finished i still think it would be a good idea, because i don't think it would cost much effort to do so and it would make the game a lot more interesting. I wouldn't say its worth buying right now if you're just playing it casually and are not interested in the development of it, but i'm sure it will become a very good game as time goes on.","April 28","true","2.2"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","14","19","2","5"

And i feel you need to like raise the speed cap and add other styles to the game so that a player can learn new styles such as legit/halfsideways etc... I know this is early ascess but you can go many ways with this game i reccomend you go the way that players would want like the way of bhopping in css and csgo. And more maps with less fans would be nice xD. But make some really interersting maps with differnt shapes in the bhop it self.

One issue I have at the moment is that the ambience only plays when im moving, which is very annoying, and there's no way to turn it off. The bhop feels a bit better in this version. Also why do I slide off the black and white platforms in the "pure" map?\n\nNow for how you could probably improve this in the future. I reckon you could probably add something like a level editor so people can create levels to improve the longevity of the game. You could also probably add some form of multiplayer, or even just a chatroom function as a big thing that drew me towards bhop was the banter that happens in chat and over mic.\n\nAlso, why is my fps capped at 60?\n\nEDIT: Another thing that happens a lot is sliding off of platforms or clipping the edges, what's up with that?","May 14","true","1.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Also, strafing will sometimes cause you to lose your speed. (Have you ever played source bunnyhop with sv_airaccelerate set lower than 100? it's kind of like that. Crouching is heavily affected too.)\n\nGame runs great on low settings, and has been improving a lot with every update.\n\nI would suggest adding a global leaderboard or something for world records so that we can at least compete for top times. This game has potential, but a lot of things about it are inaccurate to "real" bhop. With that said, I'll be interested to see how it progresses with new updates. Also maybe a different style for start zone prespeeding.\n\nI will update/rewrite this review as the game itself updates","May 14","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Find out what is the madness.\n*For this review I am grateful to the developer, which has provided the key of the game. However, this had no effect on my professional opinion.\n\nTell me, are you oldschool player? Can you remember Quake, levels of "bunny hopping" and\nthe feeling of loss to the bots on Nightmare difficulty? All of that is here. Except for bots. And guns.\n\nBut the developers from PolyDigital gave us an opportunity to remember those times when we tried to break the record for "bunny hopping" in the distance and minimum time spent. And with this - to remember the feeling of despair and madness of failures and immense happiness upon completion.\n\nThe project itself is a set of rooms, the passage of which boils down to one - special jumping across the platforms. For beginners there is a training room, which will show the basic movements.\n\nConsidering that at the moment of writing version is 0.1.1, and the game is still in the "early access", I can only note that the graphic component is decent, though not without problems. But with the sound is a more serious problem - it does not exist, except for the end of the level. But looking back on the game version - it could be forgiven, and there is hope for further development.\n\nFinally it should be said about the complexity. I was not able to pass through a training level. The game is really hardcore and for some it will be test not to throw it into the far corner. The game is worth to learn these movements and go through another block. It is worth the broken into the wall mouses. Just try it.\n\nMore reviews in our curator group: Dreams of Genesis","May 7","true","0.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","6"

Using source engines values, sv_accelerate and sv_airaccelerate are way too high in this game compared to any bhop server I've been in. If I strafe slowly I barely gain any speed but if I do an instant 180 I gain a ton of speed which shouldn't be the case. Also when not hopping I can prestrafe a lot of speed which shouldn't be possible with correct settings.\n\nGraphichs are nice and shiny, and I assume you'll be adding leaderboards/servers in later stage of development.","April 29","true","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
