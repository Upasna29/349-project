"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Katzilla/recommended/237930/","Katzilla","Katzilla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Katzilla/","142 products in account","Transistor is the second game from Supergiant Games, the developers of the critically acclaimed Bastion. Those who have doubts about whether this game lives up to Bastion's expectation can be at ease: Transistor delivers and more.\n\nStory:\nYou play as Red, a famous singer in the city of Cloudbank. One night after a performance, a group of people, the Camerata, attempted to kill Red with a strange, green sword, but she was saved by someone.\n\nWaking up, she found herself next to the corpse of a man, stabbed by that same sword: the Transistor. The sword starts speaking, and not only that, but seems to know her. Urging her to pull it out of the corpse, the two start tracking the Camerata down, seeking answers, while fighting what seems to be robotic creatures sent to hunt them down.\n\nBut things may not be as they seem.\n\nThe story of Transistor seem simple and straight-forward on the surface, but most of it isn't handed down to the player, instead inferred and concluded from various hints noticed in the environment, character interaction and character profiles. It encourages the player to seek answers along the main character, and leaves a lot up for interpretation. That's something I like in a game.\n\nOne downside to the story however, is how short it is. It's far too short, the game is far too short. You'll be left wanting more, even with "recursion", playing a second play through with your stats intact.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is a mix of Action RPG and traditional turn-based RPG, using the Turn() system that I will touch upon soon. Red is able to equip up to 4 slots of "Functions", essentially abilities, upgrade those functions with up to two functions a slot, and assign functions as passive abilities, for up to 4 passives.\n\nIn battle, Red wields the Transistor. In Diablo style, she can use the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the keyboard to select an ability, then the right-mouse button to use that ability. Abilities can be offensive, such as shooting a long-range beam or a destructive shockwave, or supportive, such as turning invisible for a period of time or turning enemies friendly.\n\nThe Turn() system adds a new depth to the action RPG. It allows Red to stop time momentarily in order to plan and input a certain number of commands: attacking, setting up traps, maneuvering around the map to escape enemy clusters or get behind obstacles, you can do all that. But once all commands are preformed and the Turn() bar is depleted, Red is left (almost) unable to attack until it recharges again; use Turn() at your own discretion, balancing attack and defense.\n\nThe game offers the choice of "limiters", handicaps that increase the difficulty of the game in return for better EXP awards. There are achievements you can only get by using limiters, the hardest achieved with all 10 limiters. In addition, there is a "sandbox" unlocked in-game that allows you to tackle specific-themed challenges, like a speed challenge, or a Turn-planning challenge.\n\nGraphics:\nTransistor uses an isometric point of view, being able to go in all 2D directions. The sprites are smooth and look good, but the highpoint of the graphics is the artwork. The character portraits, whether in-game or in profiles, are drawn beautifully. The artist, Jen Zee, did a brilliant, detailed job, and it shows even on the OST cover.\n\nSound:\nHere is where Transistor really shines. The game's OST is amazing. From Ashley Lynn Barrett's beautiful voice in The Spine, In Circles, and other songs, to Darren Korb setting up poignant, melancholic instrumentals that fit the mood perfectly. Tracks play hand-in-hand with gameplay, showing up at specific times for maximum impact, further heightening the experience.\n\nI highly recommend getting the OST along with the game, if you can. Well worth the extra bucks.\n\nSummary:\nTransistor is a beautiful, enjoyable game. It has a bittersweet, albeit short, story that forces the player to think. Brilliant soundtrack, and beautiful artwork. The gameplay won't last you long, but there is decent replayability in it. Try picking it up immediately whenever it's on sale.","October 4, 2014","true","14.2"," 621 of 655 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","621","655","5","11"

Beautiful graphics and the alluring, lullaby soundscape create a marvelously intriguing atmosphere that is sure to appeal to nearly any gamer.  The narrative is interesting, but doesn’t explain everything and leaves a lot of room for interpretation.  Together, these aspects create a very entertaining, albeit somewhat short, experience.\n\nProbably the first thing you will notice is how aesthetically pleasing this game is.  If you are someone who enjoys games with graphics that feel like interactive paintings, you will definitely enjoy the art-style in Transistor.  Complementing the beautiful art is the serenading, sing-song soundscape.  These elements are perfectly crafted and blended to create a truly inspired atmosphere.\n\nThe game drops you right into the thick of the narrative, and things are slowly explained as you progress through the story.  However, the explanations of things are far from “spoon-fed,” and much of the story is open to interpretation.  The tale unfolds during gameplay for the most part, so things stay lively rather than there being many plot-development inspired lulls in the action.  Be aware that because of this style of narrative gameplay, the game is very linear and it will continue to usher you from one spot to the next with little room for exploration.\n\nThe combat and actual gameplay mechanics are an interesting blend of RPG elements, isometric hack-and-slash, and turn-based tactical planning.  You will gain experience as you play and can unlock new abilities which can then be combined in various ways to keep things fresh as you progress through the game.  A dynamic difficulty system, Limiters, is another appealing aspect of the game.  Using these, you can increase the difficulty of the game in various ways (more enemies, stronger enemies, less access to abilities, etc.) which allows you to customize the gameplay to your skill level.\n\nOne downside is that the game is rather short.  However, you also can’t even unlock everything in a single playthrough no matter how thorough you are— so the game is clearly designed to be played through at least twice.  That said, I personally would have much preferred if the game was twice as long with the ability to unlock everything in one playthrough.\n\nIn short, Transistor is a very well designed game that certainly has a very unique identity.  This underlying novelty combined with the charming atmosphere provides a truly enthralling gameplay experience.  I would say any all-around gamer will enjoy this game, and obviously fans of the genre(s) even more so.  Expect 8 to 15 hours depending on if you want to do everything and play through a second time.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","August 10, 2015","true","15.4"," 302 of 324 people (93%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","93","302","324","14","3"

Yeah that one. Let's begin:\n\nAesthetics: 10/10Well as you can CLEARLY see from the screenshots and the given link above, Transistor is absolutely breathtaking. The game takes the cake for visual and musical extravagance, as both mix so perfectly well with one another, that it become evidently difficult to express in objective terms the splendor that it creates in the brain, how so very atmospheric this game is, it's more of an emotional virtue than one being explainable through words alone. People have been coining the term 'art', which by no means is an understatement, the aesthetics of the game, voice acting (haha three actors, funny), music and graphics are as I rarely say, perfect.\n\nStory/Characters: 9.50/10Rarely does the medium of gaming (especially in this day & age) employ such precocious writing and superb storytelling, Transistor applies to this small margin of games. A game that truly respects the intellect and free thinking of it's players, requires an intelligent producer, no? Supergiant deserves an excellent applause for their creative usage of the mechanic of replayability. To truly cherise the game's universe, one must complete the game several times to unlock all of the information that is present. A truly cherishable quality Transistor has, is it's two characters which create a sense of dread and unknowingness with each other. Their relations throughout the game serve to state implicit subjectations on the world around them, Red through her interactions on the OVC and the Transistor's commentary. A huge contrast to each other which creates a sense of accepting lack, one without a body and one without a voice.\n\nMechanics/Gameplay: 8.75/10As an RPG game, Transistor holds a creative candle in the rat saturated tunnel that is the RPG industry. Of recent years, the well known RPG's of it's time have begun to show how dated their mechanics hold up in our era (yes you, Final Fantasy). This is why the liberty to experiment and employ new ideas is so vital in our industry today. Transistor is unique in which that profiles become the tools of the trade. Transistor can be played as a turnbased game or as a free action one, which by the way, both work very well in concurse with another. You have 13 functions (abilities) to use in your kit, yeah I know that's a small amount, but guess what? for every function you have, you get the ability to fuse with another, and for every fusion you have with another function, you get to fuse with another! So this means there are roughly 22,283,705,698,113 combinations of Transistor functions. (Transistor Wiki, Cited) That's a lot of unique ways to fight your enemies.\n\nFinal Verdict: 9.50/10It's hard to see why in this day and age producers don't want to experiment with their products given that the industry would absolutely kill for it, but then again, since when do producers even listen to the demands of the consumers? Transistor is a beacon of hope in the dark hallway that is the gaming industry, and hopefully you can agree with me, that this game is something special.","October 24, 2014","true","11.8"," 326 of 364 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","326","364","4","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/10112/recommended/237930/","10112","Joe10112","http://steamcommunity.com/id/10112/","184 products in account","(WARNING: LONG COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW, READ EDIT 4 FOR OVERALL SUMMARY)\n\nThis game is created by the same makers as Bastion, which is one of my favorite games ever. Upon loading, Transistor is visually appealing, and Logan Cunningham (Rucks in Bastion) makes a reappearance which is exciting. Controls are fluid, music is amazing--I'm very excited to play through this game!\n\nEDIT 1: After playing for about an hour, I must say that I think all the expectations I have had for this game are met. Unlike Bastion, which was more of a go-get-em game, Transistor really makes you think and analyze your tactics in battle, especially with the new "time stop" system where you can plan out your actions (each move you make will cost part of your "energy bar"). There are plentiful save points, and a nice level-up system to improve your skillset. The game is mysterious so far, and I think it really fits into the mood. However, some people might dislike how the story isn't really clear, and you're just following the path without much reason until (supposedly) later on in the game when things will be made more clear.\n\nMy only qualms with the gameplay itself are the somewhat repetitive nature of the fights (although each fight calls for new tactics), and the somewhat tricky level-up system which seems a bit arbitrary. The upgrades arn't clearly defined as to what exactly they do. Overall, some parts of the game feel like I'm not sure what's going on or what I'm supposed to do to upgrade the Transistor with, but that just adds to the mysterious nature of the game at the beginning.\n\nEDIT 2: Having come across the first "boss" now, I really think that I can speak for all people when I say--wow. The way in which the "characters" speak is amazing. The fight had me on my toes, really making me consider the best way to defeat it without losing too much health. I was blown away at how the screen colors changed and blurred as I started to lose more and more health.\n\nEDIT 3: After tinkering for a while at an Access Point (checkpoints basically), I think I figured out exactly how the upgrades work. The Transistor has four slots which hold a primary ability. Each primary ability has two secondary "upgrade" slots. In addition, you have four passive slots. You will collect "cores" which you can slot and re-slot at any Access point. For instance, I could socket Crash() into Ability 1, with Break() as its "upgrade" to have a medium-damaging medium-range attack that mini-stuns (opposed to the regular melee-ranged attack without the Break() upgrade). Or, (normally), you could leave Crash() as Primary Ability 1 (melee-range attack) and Break() as Primary Ability 2 (Long-Ranged attack). Or, you could put one into your passive once you get more cores. There are also "Limiters" which increase the power of the enemies you face (similar to Idols in Bastion), but reward you with more EXP. Indeed, the customization is insane in this game--I can foresee myself spending quite a bit of time customizing once I obtain more cores. Play how you want to play--fighter, stealth, assassin, long-range--just customize your cores to fit your playstyle! Extremely well done, albeit a little confusing at first to figure out the customizations. Only qualm might be (if any)...there are TOO MANY choices!\n\nEDIT 4: Finished the game, Steam says it took me ~5 hours overall, but this doesn't include the second playthrough (Recursion Mode) which I think I will be playing soon. Overall, I think this game is a worthy successor to Bastion. However, I still prefer Bastion. Why? Bastion was a bit more clear-cut and easier to process. The Calamity happened, fix it. In this game, it took until halfway through the game for me to actually realize most of the protagonist/antagonist/story arc. There were also quite a few "did not expect that" moments, which can be both seen as positive and negative overall. I personally was confused at the ending--in a way, for me, not much closure, but I accepted it. I could see it going over poorly with lots of people however. This game feels a lot darker than Bastion for sure, and I really thought that the narration in some parts was quite hefty and really tugged at my conscience. It definitely leaves you with a lot to think about and has more going on beneath the surface--you will want to play this game with a very open and sharp mind. Great to discuss as well.\n\nAlso, remember to check out all the OVC Terminals--you definitely don't want to skip those as a fair portion of the story and development relies on you reading and filling in the blanks from the information given at them (Thanks to Dragonfire973 for reminding me!). Also, when you have time, make sure you socket all the functions into every slot (Primary/Secondary/Passive) and read up on all the information unlocked.\n\nPros:\nAmazing Artwork, Beautiful Soundtrack, Superb Narration. I expected nothing less.\nLots of customization for how you want to play the game.\nStory-arc similar to Bastion, so this story will feel somewhat similar.\n\nCons:\nSomewhat repetitive battles, but interesting nonetheless.\nOften confused as to what really was going on story-wise (not much explanation of what was going on), but this could be intended.\nNot much closure for the ending, but definitely lots to think about. Really made me think about the whole story after the credits had rolled.\n\nScore: 9/10\nA very nice game overall. The aesthetics of the game are unmatched. However, some people might feel like the game is a bit confusing to wrap your head around. I preferred Bastion's ending to Transistor's, because Bastion was more clear and provided some closure. Transistor left me wondering what really happened and left me with too many unanswered questions. However, it did leave me with a lot to think about, and I want to go through the game again to see if I pick up anything I missed the first time through.\n\nIf you have any doubts on buying this game, your doubts should be dispelled--this game is worthy of your $20; a beautiful second game released by Supergiant Games.","May 20, 2014","true","5.1"," 518 of 602 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","518","602","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auspexao/recommended/237930/","auspexao","AuspexAO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auspexao/","786 products in account","I feel like I need to set the record straight on Transistor. The biggest complaint I've heard about it is that the story is inscrutable and there isn't much of it. First of all, that is not true, but more importantly it just doesn't matter. Transistor is a masterpiece because you don't have to be a detective to enjoy the game. It is, at its very root, a simple love story. If you can appreciate that much and enjoy the beautiful art and incredible music, than you have a game well worth buying.\n\nBeyond that there is the mystery of Cloudbank to uncover, and the many philosophical questions to answer. We are taught to value the voices of each person and try to create a consensus that serves to make everyone happy. Transistor toys with the idea of a "vote" vs. a "choice." Transistor is not preaching any answers, and that's why I think the narrative may come off as weak. We have villains who could be heroes and a main character who reasonably and selfishly just wants to pursue her own life without getting embroiled in any political machinations.\n\nThis is a supremely beautiful work of art and in so many ways that I will easily recommend it to everyone. Explore the world of Cloudbank for awhile and decide how much you want to discover. I promise that even a short trip will be a memorable one.","December 29, 2014","true","12.6"," 267 of 292 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","267","292","7","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/237930/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Transistor is a sci-fi themed RPG action game, developed and published by SuperGiant games (the same guys who brought us Bastion), releasing on PC in mid 2014, and then later in that year on PS4, and then got a further port to IOS in June of 2015.\n\nGame play in Transistor takes a lot of elements from Bastion. The camera angle is in an isometric point of view as you control the main character, Red. You traverse a series of locations fighting enemies, known as the "Process". A nice feature which has been added which is where Transistor differs from Bastion, is that you can either fight in real time, or in a planning phase. The real time plays very similar to how any isometric action game would play out, however the planning phase really adds an element of strategy to this title; you have a limited number of commands you can carry out before needing to recharge, these commands include moving around the scene and casting your various spells and abilities.\n\nAs you progress through the story, you will come across other characters who have fallen victim to the Process, and you will take over their souls and learn new abilities and powers. You can either use these new abilities as straight up spells/attacks to use, or you can also enhance your current spells/attacks with the new abilities, granting unique effects, such as adding an area of effect technique on an ability. You can also have up to 2 of these abilities being used as a passive effect on Red, so are in effect all the time.\n\nTransistor is a stunningly gorgeous game. The art style on show here are some of the most perfect graphics I have seen. This game should be one of the front runners for people trying to get the media to understand that video games should be classed as a form of art.\n\nThe story in this game almost had me tearing up at the end, it is one of the most heart wrenching endings to a game I have ever played. Along the way you come across a series of plot twists, and at one point you even think the  story is ending only for it to take a dramatic turn and continue. Words cannot fathom how gut wrenching I felt at the end, I encourage anyone who has already got Transistor, to play it and finish it just to experience the final scenes.\n\nMuch like Bastion, the audio is one of, if not the best feature of this game. The narration whilst not as good as Bastion's (because that was pretty much perfect), it still sets the mood of the game, and carries the plot through to conclusion extremely well. There isn't much voice acting in the game, actually Red doesn't speak at all, until the end of the game. The sound track to Transistor has been released individually, has sold phenomenally well. Some of the songs actually remind me a lot of a sort of James Bond movie soundtrack.\n\nI have to admit, the lack of a tutorial in Transistor does knock it back a little bit, but once you actually are able to work out what all of the interface means, and how to properly carry out the fight scenes, the gameplay becomes second nature and you are able to blast through hoards of enemies without batting an eye lid. The end boss is something of a sufficient challenge as well, resulting in me having to replay it at least four times before I was able to succeed in beating it.  Another nice feature to be seen is, that you can actually implement your own difficulty barriers in game, such as allowing enemies to do more damage to you, BUT you get some sort of reward in return, such as more experience.  You are able to chop and change these "barriers" as and when you please in the same way you can with your spells abilities.\n\nTransistors levels are all extremely well fleshed out, allowing you every opportunity to venture off the main track and down alleyways and into buildings with no real specific plot line to it, letting you explore the gorgeous world this game is set in. You are also able to use terminal computers scattered around the world, allowing you to dig deeper into the lore, and some times interacting with them to complete surveys and sign petitions should you desire to.\n\nA full playthrough of Transistor will take you just under eight hours. This is one of the few games that I can say I have finished more than once, just because of how good it is. There isn't any side missions in the game, but they aren't needed, just because you will be so immersed in the main story that you wouldn't want to do them anyway. Even though the ending of the game is the same regardless of the route you take to get there, the gameplay is such a high quality, that the replay ability is still there, because you will just want to experience the sheer fun you have whilst playing.\n\nSadly I did have a couple of issues getting Transistor to run properly; firstly the game does not support anything higher than 1080 resolutions, whilst this isn't a massive issue given that 1080 is still the standard, it would of still been nice to see it in there. Secondly, I had to delve into the registry of my PC to fix and issue with the game also not loading into full screen mode correctly - if you run into this issue, the fix can be found in this thread on the Steam forums.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/237930/discussions/1/540743128801543513/\n\nTransistor is another absolutely stellar game by SuperGiant Games that everyone needs to play; some of the game's original ideas, the graphics and soundtrack are some of the best I have ever played in my fifteen years of gaming. Lord knows what else these guys have in the pipeline, it can only be amazing given their track record. For the low price of £14,99, you need to pick this game up. It has been known to go as low as £3 on Steam, which is I would almost class as day light robbery if you can get it for that price. Do not hesitate to pick this game up for the full price.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Seriously, if you decide to buy this (and you probably should), make sure to crank up your volume, put on your best headset and maybe slap some glue on its speakers so you can never take 'em off again. Trust me, you're not gonna want to.\n\nSo what do we have here? Let me just sum things up:\n\n- Logan Cunningham: check. The voice behind Rucks from Bastion is back, do I need to say more?\n- Story-telling through narration: check. This is done in almost the same manner as before, with one minor difference I won't mention for those who'd rather find out on their own.\n- Gorgeous, vibrant artwork by Jen Zee[jenzee.deviantart.com]: check, check and check. Jen is one of my favorite artists and she no doubt has outdone herself yet again.\n- Breathtaking musical score: no comment. If you're still not sold by words alone, check out the soundtrack on YouTube and draw your own conclusions.\n\nWhat's different from Bastion?\n\n- Combat mechanics: confusing at first as you'd probably be expecting action-packed hack n' slash, but in the end it boils down to being a curious hybrid of Frozen Synapse's tactical gameplay and some of Bastion's core mechanics, all mashed together into something I find difficult to describe. Personally, it also reminds me of The Bureau's "Battle Focus", just minus all the slo-mo. Powers and combos are there: as before in Bastion, you'll probably spend some time looking for a perfect skill combination to cater your own playstyle, which is a fun experience in its own right as there are quite a few options to pick from.\n\n-Game length: I finished it in under 7 hours with most of the challenges completed. While it IS a lot shorter than Bastion, you still get access to New Game+ upon completion so you can blast your way through it again. I still find game's length disappointing however, so if you're really concerned about that, I'd strongly advise you to wait for sale.\n\nIn general, Transistor is still as charming, well-paced and beautiful as its predecessor: you can absolutely tell they're both cut from the same cloth. But, while Bastion was somewhat more experimental in terms of narration, Transistor takes a bold step forward and puts even more information at your disposal than before. Which is probably a good thing. That is, if you like reading. Well, you've come this far, so I'll just assume you do.\n\nIssues I ran into so far:\n\n- My only and the main gripe with this game: abnormal, seemingly random freezing. I'm not talking "locking up at checkpoint saves" kind of freezes, either. I had to ctrl+alt+del at least 6 times due to it completely freezing up on me, "hl2.exe has stopped working"-style, with looping sound and everything. AFAIK this is a common problem at the moment of writing, so you've been warned.\n\nP.S. Hold TAB while you're in game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/237930/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","I am a huge fan of Supergiant Games' previous game, Bastion. Topping that game was a tall order, but I think they've managed to equal, if not better it, with Transistor... though I guess that depends on your personal tastes. First of all, if you have not yet played Bastion, I implore you to do so. If you have played it, and liked it, then I can definitely recommend checking out Transistor. Both games share some common fundamental elements: isometric action gameplay, a set of diverse weapons, amazing music and visuals, and stories moved forward by in-game voiceover. In the case of Bastion, the voiceover was provided by a narrator. In Transistor, the voice is that of the soul of a "dead" man within the main character's weapon (the Transistor). The other main difference is in the way combat is handled. While combat in Bastion plays out in real time, in Transistor you can pause the action at will (on a cooldown) and plan out a set of actions (or "functions" as they are called in game) that will play out in rapid sequence. So essentially, Transistor is more of a strategy game.\n\nThe game takes place in a city called Cloudbank. You play as Red, a singer that's lost her voice after an attack by an organization called the Camerata. Red wields the Transistor, an object that can absorb the essence of people, who in turn, become "functions" that can be assigned to your combat loadout. The gameplay loop consists of clearing out groups of enemies, collecting new functions for the transistor, and then combining those functions in all sorts of different ways. There are 16 functions, each of which can be used in one of 3 ways: as a primary action, as an upgrade effect for a primary action, or as a passive effect for your overall loadout. With 4 passive slots, 4 action slots, and 8 upgrade slots available to assign your functions, you can imagine how many different possible combinations there are to experiment with. And man, is it ever fun. There's plenty of room for experimentation to find what works best for your play-style. It's a brilliant combat system. The only negative I would say about it is that it's a bit confusing to figure out at first, as the game offers little in the way of explanation. It doesn't take all that long to get your head wrapped around how things work, but the early going might be a bit confusing.\n\nVisually, the game is just absolutely stunning. The environments are so gorgeous that I would eat them up if I could. The story is somewhat inscrutable (which I've heard brought up by people as a negative on the game), but there is plenty of information available within the game to flesh things out if you put in the attention and effort required. But ultimately, I never felt any of that really mattered too much. At its heart, the main plot is simply a love story, and that's all that really matters in the end. The other highlight of the game for me was the music. As with Bastion, music has a huge impact on the game experience. The music is consistently outstanding throughout, perfectly setting the mood for each area you traverse. There are also a few vocal tracks spread throughout, which are particularly good, especially the ending song, which was the high point of the game for me.\n\nI guess my only disappointment with the game is that there just isn't more of it. The story can be completed in around 6-8 hours I would estimate. After that, the game allows you to "recurse" through the story again indefinitely, while keeping all of the upgrades you've acquired, and making the enemy encounters harder each time. This is nice, and worth playing through at least once, but really, there's only so much you can go through the same few areas and watch the same cutscenes, etc, no matter how much you enjoy the gameplay and visuals. But what is there is excellent and worth the asking price. So in summary, if you liked Bastion and the turn-planning combat of Transistor sounds interesting to you, definitely give this a look. Or just give it a look anyways. Games like this just don't come around every day, and need to be experienced. I can't wait to see what Supergiant does next...","January 3, 2015","true","22.2"," 91 of 105 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","91","105","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/237930/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Uniting both action RPG mechanics and an engrossing world, Transistor isn’t just a spiritual successor to Bastion, it’s a full blown messianic triumph of beautiful art and sublime game design. Supergiant Games have exceeded their previous work with a game that marries fluent action RPG combat with sublime tactical planning & customisation. Yet that would be just half of Transistor's charm as the world, characters and narrative unfolds like an origami swan, leaving you to marvel at its gorgeous art design, intricate architecture and unique atmosphere.\n\nThe story begins with you, Red, claiming the Transistor from the body of a dead man. From there you begin to uncover the city of Cloudbank, why everyone has gone and what The Process is - sentient machine aggressors within this fallen Rapture. That reference is deliberate as there’s a little touch of Bioshock within Transistor - a fallen city, the mystery of its unravelling and tragedy yours to discover if you’re willing to put in the work to unlock its true secrets. This is made all the more acute by how Transistor welcomes you into its world with no fanfare, no menu screen. Just a fade from black opening up on your journey with the Transistor, voiced by the rich tones of Logan Cunningham, against The Process and their mysterious overlords - The Camarata.\n\nTo say any more would spoil the joy of discovering the details for yourself. Supergiant Games had deliberately kept details of Transistor to a minimum until release and it’s thanks to this blackout that’s made discovering the games systems, people and places a genuine joy.\n\nIt’s difficult to review Transistor without referencing Supergiant Games previous work - Bastion. That’s because its influences are plain to see with the same isometric-style viewpoint, similar art-style and even the same narrator. While those similarities may appear as merely iterative steps on paper for Transistor, they are in practice the opposite. The art style has evolved to be not just gorgeous, moody and atmospheric, it now conveys the spirit of Cloudbank without ever explicitly showing it in such a way that you feel part of that city, not just an observer with a controller.\n\nCombat is real time action-RPG based with four main skills available at one time. You can freeze the action once your Turn() bar has filled at any time and then plan out your attacks methodically. Once done you can unfreeze the game and Red will perform her balletic combat attacks with the Transistor. This appears at first to just be a cool looking feature to break up combat scenarios but very soon it becomes essential to besting The Process.\n\nIn this frozen state you can see the damage you are likely to cause, the effect different attacks can have in combination with each other and use it to quickly get behind enemies to deliver backstab moves. There’s nothing quite like positioning yourself correctly, freezing time and then delivering a quick series of moves to destroy everything. I’m not especially clever but by Jove, Transistor made me feel like a combat genius.\n\nAs the story progresses you’ll acquire more skills and this is where the combat evolves from those mechanics set down originally by Bastion. Instead of just swapping out skills when you want a change, every skill can be slotted into a secondary or tertiary upgrade slot to augment an already installed ability.\n\nFor instance, the basic attack move you start with is Crash(). You can then modify it with a skill like Bounce() which will chain attacks to multiple targets. Or with Cull() that sends enemies into the air. Or you could use either of those modifiers as one of the four main abilities. Cull(), a basic uppercut move and Bounce(), a skill that sends out pulses of energy.\n\nThis enables you to define the combat system in any way you want it. Like aggressive frontal-assault tactics or stealthy concealment? Perhaps turning a few enemies on to your side floats your boat? Or maybe just a blend of different styles? Transistor allows you to do what you like with this combat system rather than force you down a particular road.\n\nThe only restriction is if your health is reduced to zero in combat. Instead of death, one of your abilities is overloaded and will require at least two trips to an access point in order to recover. Then there are the Limiters - status effects that reduce your capability in combat but with the rewards of increased experience. As you can tell, what appears as a simple combat system in the beginning soon evolves into a complex and involving way to deal with The Process.\n\nThe way that combat is combined with the narrative is just as intriguing. As you use these new abilities in different ways or combinations it unlocks more about the person you acquired them from in the first place. Slowly the pieces of this mysterious world start to come together as you become more adept at combat. It encourages creativity and a deeper understanding of the mechanics you're working with on order to unlock the secrets of Cloudbank.\n\nBut It’s not all dark alleyways and moody lighting as you’ll have access to a ‘backdoor’ - a safe haven separated from the unrelenting assimilation of the Process. This serves as a menu to access the different challenge rooms Transistor offers. Here you can test and refine your combat skills and increase your level. Or you can just kick back and listen to the ridiculously awesome soundtrack while lounging in a hammock.\n\nThis densely packed experience is made up of small touches like that. From the way Red drags around the weighty Transistor, to how she combs her hair with her fingertips when admiring a view, with the best of all being her ability, at the touch of a button, to hum along to the excellent soundtrack.\n\nBefore playing I didn’t expect to be fully enraptured by Transistor, thinking the spectre of Bastion would haunt the experience too much. But neither did I expect Transistor to take that formula and evolve it into something so sublime and handcrafted that tears would roll down my cheek as the credits rolled. From its combat mechanics and customisation, to the narrative and the visually appealing art-style, this is an experience to be savoured, to lock yourself away in the confines of your gaming boudoir and revel in its luxurious design and perfection.\n\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 8, 2014","true","43.1"," 84 of 104 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","84","104","0","4"

I beat it in about 11 hours, although I'm only about halfway through with Achieves.  I think this is a bit of a silly metric, though.  The more key question to me is "was it a good experience?"  I would say "absolutely".\n\nTransistor is a deeply beautiful and atmospheric game, with a bittersweet story told through powerful narration and themes.  It also effectively uses game mechanics to pull you 'into' the story and world.  It has a 'hum' button.  There are several scenes where the controls and gameplay shift to make the player 'feel' the scenes.  It is one of the best examples I've played of a game avoiding ludnarrative dissonance and in fact using gameplay as a narrative aid.\n\nTransistor left me with that same feeling of satisfaction I get after finishing a good book.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/puzzlefox/recommended/237930/","puzzlefox","puzzlefox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/puzzlefox/","201 products in account","I know, negative reviews on overwhelmingly recommended games won't win me any popularity points, but hear me out.\n\nIt breaks my heart to not recommend this. I had really high hopes due to how amazing Bastion was, and I went into this knowing that it is nothing like Bastion, so my dissapointment doesn't stem from that. Let me start off by saying that the combat customization is pretty neat, the art is nice, and the music is really nice.\n\n- The story just isn't that good. Futuristic world is being destroyed by virus-type-invaders and your sword/companion is the key to beating it. The ending is very predictable and there isn't much character development at all. There is such little story that I can't even expand on that without spoilers because of how little story there actually is.\n\n- The atmosphere is pretty but has very little variation. I got really tired of seeing the same grey blocks over and over.\n\n- The enemies have very little variation. You have turrets that buff/heal, fast dogs, floating objects that shoot beams at you, a mortar, am aoe tank, and guys that spawn suicide bombers. Not much else, the listed enemies all look exactly the same throughout the game; the only difference being small buffs as you progress. There are three bosses, each more forgettable than the last.\n\n- The combat is very tedious, and because (as above mentioned) the enemies lack variation, every fight feels the same. There are some great ways to customize your skills and buffs, but everything just feels the same. Since your last shred of action bar can perform skills that would normally take a huge chunk of action bar, every turn you take is just skill stacking just the right way so you can get the big one in at the end for free. It just feels exploity.\n\n- The backdoor area (a special zone where you can access challenges): probably my least favorite thing about this game. The trials are all (save for one) time consuming, tedious and pretty pointless. I did all the trials with very little to show for it other than maybe a level and a half and music tracks unlocked, which as far as I can tell, can only be listened to in the backdoor area.. A place that quickly becomes chore zone. Every time I finished trials, I was more than ready to leave.\n\n- No replayability. There just isn't. Restarting with all your skills would be nice if the skills weren't so bland. It's just doing the exact same thing over and over again a second time.\n\n-The game is incredibly short. I have 7.7 hours logged and I even took my time. I explored thoroughly and didn't move between areas until I knew that I had explored the whole area. I read all the dialogue and accessed/read/listened to/replied to all the terminals and still only got 7.7 hours out of it with no interest in or reason to begin ng+.\n\n- One of the things that irritated me the most is this game has an amazing soundtrack.... but it is hardly utilized in the game. When your in combat, you spend most of your time in a pause-type attack planning phase.. during that phase, the music is replaced by the same humming.. so you spend a lot of time listening to that one track that is her humming the same tune over and over. When you're running around/exploring, the sword is talking the whole time (not a bad thing) and you cannot hear the music at all.\n\nThe game was probably overhyped to me, which is probably why I feel as dissapointed as I do. If you love SuperGiant and love hearing Logan's voice (like me) I'd recommend getting it on sale. Otherwise, you might be dissapointed.","January 4, 2015","false","7.7"," 736 of 1,129 people (65%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","65","736","1","45","25"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/237930/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","For all their hundred-million dollar budgets and hundreds strong development teams, it feels as if indie games have all but entirely eclipsed those of AAA developers. Transistor stands at the precipice of this phenomenon, an unprecedented achievement in artistic vision and game design that I hesitate to review for fear of not doing it justice. Supergiant Games, creators of the outstanding Bastion, have not been resting on their laurels, returning after three years with an experience that has completely toppled any expectations I previously had for it, leaving me stunned and in awe at the scope of their vision and the skill in which they execute it. Transistor is, simply put, a masterpiece.\n\nTransistor isn’t the story of a falling city; of the rebel group, Camerata, letting loose a viscous process to annihilate the city of Cloudbank to be rebuilt to their designs. It’s not the story of the many characters filling its voluminous backstory, fleshing out a fascinating futuristic dreamscape that is so similar yet different to our own world. No, it is the story of two people, or more accurately the relationship between a girl and her sword. The dynamic between Red, a singer who has had her voice stolen, and the Transistor, a talking sword now housing the soul of a deadman, is what drives the narrative. Despite Red’s inability to talk, the Transistor’s dialog creates a tangible connection between the two; an emotional tie that makes the continued suffering of Red, and the guilt expressed by the Transistor (who somehow feels responsible for what happened to Red), incredibly real and heartbreaking.\n\nIt would be too easy to write Transistor off as using its many narrative tricks to hide the fact that its plot is fairly straightforward, because it’s not about what happens throughout the story, but the relationship between its two leads that makes it so compelling. All too often games will try to force characters to depend on each other, whether through arbitrary mechanics or cliched victim roles, but Transistor sidesteps this issue by having the two characters literally rely on each other to survive. They need each other, and its for this that the narrative manages to create such an effective emotional connection with these characters; similarly causing you to despise those that have put them through so much distress. As simple as it may sound, the nuance of every line and its delivery is no small feat, and a true testament to the writers and voice actors behind them.\n\nI could go on at end for how emotionally invested I became in the characters of Transistor, but it’s the finesse of its gameplay that truly astounded me. Aside from some mild exploration, the experience is entirely focused around its incredibly deep and rewarding combat system, which seems outwardly inaccessible but is shockingly intuitive once you get your hands on it.\n\nCombat can be broken down most easily into two phases: real time and the planning stage. During the former, you can use any of your abilities at will, but enemies in turn can also move and attack, which becomes an issue with the long build up required for most attacks. This is when you transition to the second phase, which then turns the game into a sort of strategy RPG, freezing time and allowing you to plan out your moves (which will then be executed near instantly when you leave the phase) with the only restraint being the action bar which is used up with each move you make. It's not an entirely unique formula, but Supergiant Games has carved out an incredibly fine tuned and complex niche for itself, with the sheer number of different ways you can approach an encounter.\n\nEvery action you make is the result of a function you have slotted in, which in turn can then have additional functions slotted on top of themselves, as well as passive functions which give you boosts outside of individual moves. However, none of these are separated into classes or otherwise excluded from being assigned a specific role with the rest of your abilities. This creates an incredible amount of options for you to experiment with, with each function you unlock having three unique abilities onto itself (if not more when combined with other functions), and new functions being added regularly as you progress and level up.\n\nSupergiant has also found a brilliant incentive to getting players to try out new combinations they might otherwise never use, by tying every bit of backstory to a specific function, which then needs to be used in all three slots (technique, enhancement, and passive) in order to unlock all of a character's biography. It’s a fantastic way to almost entirely fix a common problem of getting stuck in a routine of the using the same abilities the entire game, and had me constantly swapping different functions in which kept the combat fresh the entire game (even after having beaten it I haven’t used every combination there is, creating a ton of replay value on top of the already included new game plus mode).\n\nBastion was an undeniable artistic treat, but in comparison to Transistor it might as well be a rough prototype of a game. The art design of every single frame is unbelievably gorgeous, from amazing architecture and environmental designs, to characters and even the subtle yet beautiful sparks that spring forth from Red dragging the Transistor around. The dark color palette matches the somber mood of the narrative, but it does so without bringing you down with it, leaving enough brightness and pure beauty despite the events happening around you to make you feel like you’re on a vacation to a fantastical city in the sky. Darren Korb once again returns to deliver a soundtrack that surpasses what I even thought he was capable, with a layered and elaborate score that still feels as raw and personal as he's known for.\n\nTransistor left me floored. What Supergiant Games has accomplished is hard to properly put into words, as even with all I’ve said I can’t help but think I’ve barely scratched the surface of the praise I wish to heap upon the game.

An incident occurs that leads you down a path of no return. In the process, you receive the mysterious weapon known as the Transistor and the powers that come along with it.\n\nGameplay consists of real time combat mixed with an optional turn-based system. At anytime during normal combat, you can pause the game to plan and queue up attacks. This proves immensely helpful when you face large numbers of enemies at once.\n\nAs you progress through the game, the Transistor gains new powers. These can be used in either active (attack), support (supplement attack), or passive modes. The level to which you can customise powers to complement your playstyle is one of the highlights of the game.\n\nThe visuals of the game are another strong point. The artstyle is stunning. Great use of colours and imaginative design bring out the vibrancy and beauty of Cloudbank. This is a city you'd want to save.\n\nVoice acting and music is stellar. The soundtrack is atmospheric and easy on the ears, while the voice acting is filled with character.\n\nThe plot can be ambiguous but if you pay attention it makes sense by the end of the game.\n\nThe only downside is that a single playthrough lasts 6 hours or so. Some may find the $20 sgd pricepoint too high for that length, although there is a new game plus option that provides some replayability.\n\ntldr: A polished, unique Indie action rpg albeit a little short.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/recommended/237930/","JiveSoulBro","Jive Soul Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/","85 products in account","So you've read the reviews praising Transistor for its amazing scenery, the detailed hand-drawn sprites, the phenomenal soundtrack and maybe even read a thing or two about the gameplay which included words such as "time stop turn-based abilities" or "active and passive weapon functions" and you're left wondering... Is it accessible? Beauty being in the eye of the beholder and all, can the layperson appreciate the final product?\n\nAnswer: maybe not, but don't let that stop you from trying. New experiences build character and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is Transistor a new experience. It's just that Transistor is a game where the protagonist gains experience faster than the player behind the screen. Consider the following: you earn "functions" which can be used either in your weapon slot or as a passive buff to a function already in use, adding its properties to the active weapon. That's the active and the passive system! THAT'S HUGE! Do you realize how with four weapon slots (your four face buttons) and five functions, you already have twenty different configurations? Well hold on to your hats because there's a whole lot more than just five functions to play with. Try sixteen. Add to this secondary passive slots for player buffs, extra upgrade slots for weapons and a memory cost per function to manage and that's a lot to take in!\n\nThere's more. The whole time-skip ability pauses the game and allows you to plan out multiple actions in advance, at the cost of a cooloff period wherein no function can be activated. It's something that can certainly bite you in the ♥♥♥ if abused, so you want to hold on to it like a panic button. Or spam it constantly what with the correct build and enemies. Really, you don't know and the game doesn't provide you with much opportunities for experimentation. Enemy encounters are fixed and unique in nature; and although the game provides you with a Practice Mode, it's more target practice than battle practice.\n\nTransistor's greatest flaw resides in its extraordinarily linear story mode. There are no collectables or side quests, so if the story mode has a reputation for being short, that's only because there aren't any branching paths anywhere. There's nothing to look out for, all unlockables are gained by leveling up and earning XP is done exclusively by defeating enemies. Whom do not respawn and appear at fixed intervals. So your whole adventure feels like riding a conveyor belt: move to enemy encounter, defeat enemies, save at conveniently nearby terminal, repeat with the occasional story break.\n\nAlthough we commonly hate repetition, human beings learn by doing the same thing over and over again. Adding THE OPTION to redo a segment would be welcome and giving players a minor incentive to do so would go a long way in getting them acclimated to the active/passive system. There's no lack of technical info as the configuration screen offers you all of the hard numbers for your functions, but you want practice in addition to theory. Bastion provided "dreams" which were just waves after waves of monsters to defeat for extra shards. Practice Mode offers no such incentives and the targets don't fight back. For all of their efforts at writing a story, it seems as if the developers have forgotten to build a playground.\n\nThus I'll make my final verdict as simple as possible: buy Bastion first. That's a good game regardless of your sense of aesthetics (review available here). If you've enjoyed Bastion's stylistic direction, consider Transistor. Despite the change in setting, you'll recognize much of the artistic sensitivities that are the hallmark of Supergiant Games. Otherwise, you probably won't have the patience to appreciate Transistor. Regardless, you have to recognize the ambitiousness of what's ultimately a very simple concept at heart: make every weapon also act as a power-up. You can't fault that, and you want other game developers to crib the idea. So buy the game and encourage simple ideas that are complex in execution. We'll get more practice out from the other games.","November 29, 2014","true","15.3"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","2"

The game is developed by the people behind Bastion, but the 2 games have very few similarities, it's hard to compare them. Every aspect of Transistor is flawless, for now, no cons come to my mind. But I will try to review what I can.\n\nPros: Stunning sci-fi cyberpunk art style and setting\nAmazing voice acting\nWonderful, atmospheric soundtrack, one of the best I've heard in an indie game (purchasing the OST is very much worth it)\nInteresting and creative character designs (I can't go into detail here, might spoil it)\nAll the things I have mentioned above go together so well to create the rich, detailed world of Cloudbank\nInnovative combat: you can switch from hack-n'-slash mode to a strategic, turn-based one, and you should still plan your moves very well\nGame has a way of letting you figure out the story and lore on your own: if you skip any OVCs, you'll barely have an idea of what's going on, and you'll lessen the great experience\n(Trying to avoid spoilers as much as I can here) The story is memorable, and leaves you at some moments in suspense, and other moments just thinking about what just happened - it is unique and far from those 'good vs evil' cliché RPG plots\nLots of ways to customize your character build as well: you can combine up to 3 moves or 'Functions' and test how they work, you can add 'Limiters' that increase the challenge lvl but yield more rewards, etc\nGame is also strategic in a way that you should plan your battles well\nCons: Game is linear and does not have too much room for exploration\nThe story can be too short, and even vague for some people\nOverall Rating:9/10 - Transistor is more of an experience to me, than a game.","May 11","true","7.0"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monukai/recommended/237930/","Monukai","monu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monukai/","1200 products in account","A heart-wrenching tragedy wrought with loss and sorrow, a bittersweet love story the likes of which are never seen in video games, an unbelievable experience that's as breathtaking as it is unforgettable——these are just a few of the things that Transistor has been for me. And don't think that I lavish the game with verbose and flattering descriptions idly either, this game swept me from my feet the moment I loaded it up and delved into the imaginative world it offered. Rarely have I been so immersed in a game and never before, not even in Supergiant Games' previous game Bastion, have I felt so emotionally involved in a game's story——it was refreshing to experience a game where I felt a surge of raw emotions... from frustration, to despair, to grief. And to add icing to the cake, this game's audio and visual presentation blows every other indie game out of the water... each time I step away from the game and come back to it, I'm still shocked to realize just how beautiful a game it truly is.\n\nRed, the character whose role you assume, finds herself in a strange and unsettling predicament after being attacked by a mysterious organization known as the Camerata. With the help of her companion, the Transistor (a.k.a. Breach()), she must seek answers from this mysterious group and fight the newly arrived threat of the Process. The Process comes in many forms, and Red with the Transistor in hand, must face off against them. The combat in this game is a hybrid between fast paced action and tactics. Red can be equipped with up to four active Functions and four passive Functions (essentially abilities). Each Function can also act as an upgrade for Function already equipped as an active ability. This allows for quite a lot of customization. Furthermore, there are Limiters, which act as a way of increasing the challenge within the game. Enable a handful of limiters and you'll easily find yourself tuning and customizing your Functions to overcome some of the harder encounters and challenges. There is definitely challenge to be had in this game if you seek it, and exploring all the customization options is one of the highlights of the game's combat system——some of the Function combos are ingenious and finding such a badass combo is always a joy.\n\nAnd while the game's combat system is superb, I'd probably rate it as the weakest feature simply because every other aspect of the game is so near perfection. The audio and visuals of the game are no exception. Anyone who has played Bastion should know from experience alone to expect something amazing when it comes to how a Supergiant Games' game should look and sound, and despite such high expectations they wouldn't be disappointed with Transistor. The game is just mesmerizingly stunning, to the point that it's hard to describe in words just how remarkable it is. It has to be played to be appreciated at the level it deserves. From gorgeous hand drawn scenery, to the hauntingly beautiful lighting, to art filled cutscenes... this game is beautiful. Audio is no exception either with solid voice acting (the voice of Rucks from Bastion voices the Transistor), perhaps the best original soundtrack in the entire industry which I could write an entire second review on alone, and don't forget Red's incredible humming prowess.\n\nAlthough the game presents perhaps the most extraordinary sensory experience in the indie scene, to me the true selling point of this game is the story and the way it is presented. There is a lot going on in this game and it's worth getting involved in. Read what's happening at the terminals, read the bios, listen to the audio logs——it pays off. But most importantly, listen to what Transistor says. Stop and listen. Pay attention. And when Red responds to Transistor via typing, just don't quickly read what she says but feel what she says. Following the connection between the two is what sucked me into the story and got me involved with it in a much more personal way. There is a lot of character depth for both Red and Transistor, and an equal depth in regards to the relationship between the two. Putting myself in the shoes (or heels, I suppose) of Red was a surreal experience, and feeling the pain, frustration, longing, and love through her perspective is what made this game something special.\n\nThe developers put love and care into making this game. The story is strong, no doubt. But I think what makes it stand out is that the developers built this game bottoms up starting with the story. Scene by scene crafting the perfect medium to tell this story, at every point making critical decisions about what music to be playing, what visuals to show, what Transistor's monologue should be; at every cutscene and at every interlude, deciding how best to portray the story through artwork and song. And by my reckoning it worked, they took a story and found the best way——the perfect medium——to tell it, and the product is Transistor. I've seen people refer to video games as a form of art before, but Transistor joins a miniscule list of games that I have played and feel as if I can share such a sentiment having played it.","August 4, 2014","true","14.8"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HawaiianApe/recommended/237930/","HawaiianApe","HawaiianApe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HawaiianApe/","488 products in account","Another banger by Supergiant Games.\n\nLet me start by saying that Transistor's music is absoultely fantastic. It's composed by Darren Korb (also did the soundtrack for Bastion) it has a futuristic feel to it with a little bit of Noir in there. It's also neatly integrated into the game and its story. The protagonist is a singer for crying out loud.\n\nHer name's Red, she's a singer, and her friend is now a talking sword. That's all you get at the begining of the game. Transistor's story is open ended, surprisingly heartfelt and imaginative. There are no clear-cut solutions or ideologies, the characters have their (sometimes questionable) motives, and it's hard to say what's what at times. The game is also very subtle about its themes. Very much like Bastion, you can speculate and fill in the gaps with your friends. Fun stuff.\n\nMuch like the story, the gameplay is brilliantly crafted and also very much open ended. Every bit of it is customisable, and the game makes you feel like you're in control of its systems. To simplify it- it's a real time action RPG. By pressing the right trigger you change it to a turn based structure, but it's more of a special power. The "turn" lasts only a short while but you can trample over the enemies without consequences as they are frozen in time, and you have a bunch of tools that can do the trampling.\n\nRed has a large selection of abilities to chose from, each ability has three functions- active, powerup and passive. You can attach unused abilities as powerups for the ones that are active, or you can use them as passive powerups for your statistics. Some abilities deal damage, some persuade, some create distance between you and the enemy, which you will need, as the enemies are tricky to handle (when they're not frozen in time that is). You will have to mix and match, see what works best, and then change it again. The game encourages experimentation- change your character's presets as many times as you want, it's easy and free of charge. The game's too forgiving? Obliterating enemies left and right? You can make the enemies harder and gain more experience. It's all customisable. Supergiant Games definitely built upon the already well made systems seen in Bastion and greatly improved them.\n\nHeck, the whole thing's really well made. And, well, gosh darnit. Ain't this the prettiest darn game I have ever laid my blue eyes upon. This game's graphics are something special, tell you hwat. Inspired by Art Deco, its futuristic vistas are just... Just beautiful. A little bit confuisng to get through at times perhaps, but with these looks, hey, who's complaining.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that its story is too short. Now don't get me wrong, the story is really well made and doesn't drag, but you can finish it in 5-6 hours. Now, that's great, I like a well made story, if it has to be around 6 hours to present itself the right way, the way the author intended, great. but you WILL want to play more of it after you've seen the ending, and it is a shame that you will have to start up New Game+ to do so.\n\nThe good news is that the New Game+ mode is really well made and has some additional stuff in it. Everything transfers and the difficulty ramps up. Heck, they even change up the enemy spawns, so it's definitely worth a second playthrough. Plus- there's no way you're going to reach the level cap during your first run through Thransistor, so there's a bunch of new stuff you'll get to play with.\n\nWell, that's a minor gripe, this is A+ material for sure. It's obvious that these guys know what they're doing, and every part of this game has been meticulously crafted with much passion and hard work. Whatcha gonna do next Kasavin? Cause whatever it is, I'm listening.","November 6, 2014","true","6.0"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

There are some game breaking power combinations you can create that make it impossible to lose. The game is beautiful, the combat is interesting and what eventually really won me over, was the story. Towards the end of the game, you finally start understanding the story. It's not even that it is told to you, no, what happens is you get more and more of it via text in your powers, text in the limiters, just from everywhere. I didn't fully understand the impact of those until later.\n\nOnce you are done with your first run, you kind of question some things, so what do you do, you play again.

No.  However, it's a somewhat flawed game, at least from a gameplay standpoint.  First, the good.  The story is...largely unimportant/boring, but the characters and the world built in are amazing.  You feel very much drawn in with our silent heroine, Red, and her chatty admirer trapped in a cybernetic sword.  It creates a narrative experience where you are there more for how the characters and world interact than the story.\n\nGraphically, the game is quite distinctive.  Think Bastion meets Cyberpunk 2020 or Shadowrun.  It's very much a detective noir cyber punk world and feels dark, gothic, but also futuristic and techno.  The effects onscreen can be quite a sight to behold as well and the art style itself is quite beautiful, using 2-d hand drawn in conjunction with the sprites and 3-d action in combat.\n\nSound design is where the game shines.  An amazing voice cast, beautiful music which fits the mood perfectly, and relatively satisfying combat sounds make it a joy to listen to.  The tracks are good, but the vocal pieces in the beginning and end of the game are probably the best part of it.\n\nOne thing I will say about Transistor that I love and wish more games would do is it feels organic.  You have, for example, several areas that are completely unnecessary, not story related, and which you can skip, but not skipping them builds the world and the characters, feeling like we get to know them through their actions and choices.  Like ordering a pizza after trying to be murdered.  I'm dead serious and it actually ends up being a nice quiet moment between heroine and sword.  Also, Red can hum or flourish the sword, if for no other reason than because that's what the character would do, even if the gamer chooses not to.  Feels very much alive.  The world itself is very distinctive, even if it draws heavily from noir and cyberpunk.\n\nNow, the bad.  Like Bastion, it seems to go for an action RPG route where you can choose your moves in real time, with the option of a system freeze time, string together combos, and plan your battle more strategically.  This is where the game starts to suffer.  You cannot play one or the other.  Largely, the game requires you to use this "turn" system and when you use it, you are left vulnerable for up 5 seconds while a bar recharges.  You cannot attack and are slower than all the enemies and their projectiles, so the game is VERY frustrating at times in this regard.  Also, your health drains at an insane rate, even on the easy setting, and when it drains to zero, you lose one of the four moves you can map to the face buttons until you die.  At times, this will happen multiple amounts in battle and it takes several battles to recharge, as you can only recharge the lost abilities at specific points.  So, you may not die, but the game is very unbalanced in terms of what you can do and how much damage you take compared to the enemies.  It has an option to increase difficulty in exchange for more experience, like in Bastion, but honestly, the game feels not hard, but frustrating enough without it.\n\nThere is also an area like the Bastion which is meant to be a training/cooldown place, but...unlike the Bastion it feels kinda shoe horned in.  There seem to be several features, like the added difficulty, thrown in because "hey, we did it in Bastion and people liked that."  Standing on its own, without comparisons, it's...unnecessary, but inoffensive.\n\nOn the whole, I liked Transistor, despite the story not gripping me as much as the characters did and the gameplay being often very frustrating.  I'd say play Bastion first, because Bastion is just a better game, but if you're looking to kill 4-6 hours and the issues I mentioned with gameplay can be overlooked, the experience is well worthwhile.\n\nTransistor is flawed, but still a gem.\n","October 14, 2014","true","5.8"," 74 of 113 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","74","113","0","9"

It's seriously one of the most stunning games I've ever played. When I rank games in my head, listing them with all their faults in mind, all I can say is that Transistor is the ONLY game that I've played that has no faults.\n\nWhere do I start? Gameplay. Transistor does a fantastic job at letting you customize your moves. The pacing is fantastic- it does a very good job at easing the mechanics for you early on. For example, you start with a quick jab, and a long charging shot. Eventually you get an attack that is like a weak AoE. Pretty simple stuff, yeah? But then it tells you you can apply similar properties of powers to another, like combining them. Now your long-charge shot can split into multiples. And THEN you can apply powers to yourself, and not your other powers, to change up gameplay. The flexibility in powers allows for such a massively open-ended way to play. It's a simple 3-choice system that really allows the player to pick how they choose to play.\n\nThe story is pretty interesting. It's nothing fantastic enough to win awards, but the way that they present you the story makes it interesting. Cloudbank is a mysterious place, and their little terminals and hints in dialogue makes you keep guessing what it really is. The characters, though, are rather lackluster save for Red and the Transistor. There are only 3 voices in the game, and one of them is simple grunts and humming. The Transistor character, voiced by the same fantastic narrator from Bastion, is the main spotlight for his character. The other characters, the Camerata, aren't so fleshed out.\n\nThe art and sound styles are fantastic. This shouldn't really be a point to deter anyone, as these are just aesthetics. But when something is so stellar and outstandish in a game, I need to point it out. This game has STYLE. It's a beautiful, artsy, cyberpunk experience that's complete with everything that you need to keep you immersed.\n\nThere's really only one problem with this game. I want more. It's so good, but it's a straight-forward story game that won't take you longer than 10 hours. I want more of Cloudbank. I want more of the Transistor combat. I want more, more, more! The ending made me satisfied, but I was sad that it was over.\n\nDo yourself a favor. Buy this game. It's very, very good.","October 27, 2014","true","42.6"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","0"

The art and music are outstanding, though very similar to Bastion, as is the attention to detail.\n\nThere are loads and loads of programming references, which I found absolutely delightful, being a software engineer.\n\nYou don't have to be a software engineer to enjoy the game, though. Like Bastion, the game is perfectly accessible to anyone. It's been described as an RPG-lite, but there's plenty of gameplay complexity. The combat is a mix between ARPG and TBS.\n\nThere are even a few "puzzles" (game calls them "tests") thrown in, where you are challenged to win a fight by utilizing your abilities in specific ways. These tests are a way of educating you on the combat mechanics.\n\nThere's plenty of strategy involved, including the ability to make combat more difficult in exchange for a small exp bonus. I played at effectively the highest difficult setting and enjoyed the challenge. I'm probably going to continue through the second playthrough for additional challenge.\n\nThe first playthrough is fairly short, but never feels tedious, either. The second playthrough can be taken to extend play time by quite a bit. I like the game length. Some might complain about the price point, but I think it's fair for a quality indie title like this.\n\nThere are stability issues at the moment, but they are rapidly being patched, so I expect those to mostly be resolved soon. I mainly encountered problems with the optional "tests" deadlocking (?) and requiring manual process termination. Glancing at the forums, this seems to be related to the online features, which are understandably more difficult to test prior to release, so it's not exactly fair to ask "don't these people test their game?"\n\nAlso, there's not much character development and no real character interaction (though there's plenty of good voiceover). Some might miss that, but it didn't bother me. The focus is on atmosphere. I liked the way the game slowly revealed the backstory and made you work for some of it - revealing character biographies if you used your abilities in different ways.\n\nI liked the story, though I may be biased given the theme :)\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this.\n\nDisclaimer: I only played 30 minutes into Bastion so far, so I'm not very qualified to compare the two titles.

Throughout my 4 hours playthrough, never once did I feel that the map was bland.\n- Soundtrack. Just speechless. Darren Korb blew me away with the soundtrack in Bastion, and did it once again with Transistor.\n- The story was decent. It was simple enough and did not drag itself out for too long.\n- Took me 3.9 hours to complete the game. However, I did not do any challenges which would have extended the game by an hour or more.\n- The game's combat was not too easy and not too difficult. It never once made me feel like the game's combat was too easy to the point where it was basically cheating nor did it made me feel like the game's combat was too unfair and unforgiving.\n\nI felt that 3.9 hours was the sweet spot for me with this game.

Would they be able to recapture the magic with their sophomore release?  In short:  mostly.\n\nWhat made Bastion memorable to me was the music and atmosphere.  Mechanically solid, but aurally and visually delightful.  With Transistor they flip this a bit.  The real hook, the most fully formed part of the game, is the combat mechanics.\n\nMake no mistake, the audio is still miles ahead of most competitors.  Darren Korb does superb work with the music, though admittedly my tastes favor the folk blues of Bastion to the synth jazz of Transistor.  Logan Cunningham once again able to run laps around most voice acting in games.  Overall the entire atmosphere and audio portions of the game fall secondary to Bastion, but there is no shame in taking second to a game as strong as that.\n\nThe mechanics are the area where it stands on it's own.  They use a unique system of abilities, with each function able to take either the form of an ability, modifier for another ability, or passive support role.  The myriad ways these interact can lead to many tactical situation.  The game also strongly encourages mixing and experimentation, as the narrative is largely unlocked by using an ability in each of the 3 roles.  There doesn't seem to be any overpowering combo, though each can feel that way when used correctly.  Many games feature a wide array of abilities you can equip, but few do as good of a job encouraging you to experiment and resist using the same strategy throughout.\n\nOverall, a hearty recommendation.  While I rate it slightly lower than Bastion, their idea of a sophomore slump is still to embarrass the competition in writing and audio.","June 20, 2014","true","10.8"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/recommended/237930/","xelios","Xelios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/","4973 products in account","From the creators of the beloved Bastion comes Transistor, a game in which you take on the role of Red, a musician living in the city of Cloudbank, whose voice has just been stolen during an attempt on her life. Red finds herself pulling a greatsword, Transistor, from the body of an acquaintance, whose consciousness has been transferred into it and can actively communicate with her through it. Transistor proceeds to serve as the narrator of the game and a contrast to the now-voiceless Red.\n\nTransistor is set in a technological era where pretty much everything can be digital, even one’s entire being, and disturbingly easy to take ownership of, manipulate or destroy. This technology has also brought certain comforts, and citizens find themselves voting on the weather and what color they’d prefer for the evening’s sunset. Cloudbank seems on its way to being a utopian society for its citizens until, one day, influential figures begin to disappear, one after another. An army of intelligent robots that serve as the city’s defense has been activated and begins… processing people. Red must fight her way through the Process to stop it, find who's causing the trouble and recover her voice.\n\nThe real stars of Transistor—sorry Red—are the function system and the hybrid battle system, where you can use abilities in real time and/or pause and plan your actions step by step on a tactical grid, then unpause to watch them unfold. Abilities, or functions as they’re called in the game, are absorbed by Transistor from the bodies of citizens you encounter as well as through leveling up. The function system is modular and synergistic, allowing you to mix and match and change your skills freely at checkpoints, with hundreds of potential combinations and effects.\n\nA simple attack function, such as Crash(), can be augmented with other functions so that it chains to additional enemies, charms them, has an added area of effect, fires more quickly, is more powerful, pulls enemies toward you, or becomes available for use in real time while your tactical turn is recovering. Each function may be used as an active skill, support for an active skill, and/or a passive skill. If, at some point, you attempt to research the strongest function combinations, you will find that almost every player has a different opinion; so many viable combinations is a hallmark of great design that doesn’t pigeonhole you into using cookie-cutter ability combinations throughout the entire game. This is where Transistor truly excels and the new game+ rewards you with additional copies of each function to play around with and more challenging encounters to test them out on. Self-imposed penalties called limiters, similar to the idols in Bastion, provide the option to challenge yourself further.\n\nEverything else in Transistor plays a supporting role to the combat system: The art is beautiful, but the locations are not very memorable and only serve to funnel you from one combat encounter to another; the soundtrack is solid but lacks a single track remotely as memorable as Bastion's vocal tracks; the narration takes a backseat because, although Transistor talks a lot, he really doesn’t have much of importance to say; characters other than Red and Transistor are never really fleshed out or present in the game other than to have their lives summarized in three-paragraph text dumps on the ability screen, where you’re left to decide their overall relevance and whether they should mean anything to you at all. The developers left a lot of holes for the player to fill and, whether this was intentional or not, for every player who manages to make sense where there seems none, another will be left scratching his head. Unlike in Bastion, additional narration of story elements does not take place during the optional challenges, which I feel is a missed opportunity to rectify this.\n\nFor me, Transistor was ultimately the story of two individuals amidst chaos and despair; everything else was incidental and incohesive, and I was unable to appreciate the story much at all until I looked at it this way. Confined to these two characters and their story, it was touching, with a powerful conclusion. Regardless of whether you come away from the story with anything meaningful, Transistor is still worth playing for the excellent combat.","August 24, 2014","true","19.4"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

The game is set in a unique and engaging world, and a range of intriguing characters are regularly hinted at.\n\nDisappointingly, the story remains surprisingly lightweight given the cracker start, and the game finishes with both the world and the characters remaining enigmatic and unexplored.\n\nGameplay is primarily combat in a modified “real time with pause” style, which suits me great and has a ton of potential. You have the ability to combine a large number of different powers and effects, creating some genuinely interesting combinations. Unfortunately there is little variety in enemies, and consequently, combat lacks depth and replayability.\n\nI feel bad being critical about a game this good, but for a game only a few steps away from having been a genuine classic I can’t help but reflect on what might have been.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/237930/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","Product received for free\n\nI received Transistor as a part of a between-friends Secret Santa gift swap and it took me around five and a half hours to get to the end once.  I used the Xbox 360 controller the whole time.\n\nA singer without a voice and a talking sword.  This duo has a front-row seat for what looks like the end of the world...  Transistor should feel familiar to those who played Bastion before since it too is an action RPG with an isometric angle.  Instead of landmasses floating in the sky, the setting is a city in the process of uncontrolled change.  And instead of a young man with an ever-growing arsenal of weapons, our heroine instead drags the titular Transistor behind her, and she uses that for a variety of attacks.\n\n"Red, we're not gonna get away with this, are we?" is the line that starts the game, spoken by the sword sticking out of a man to the woman standing over the two.  No backstory, no introductory cutscene, just this scene and cutting to gameplay as she takes the sword with her.  The sword knows where to go, so you move on...and then the cubes come and with them, enemies.  You start with two attacks and four slots to put them in to start, and you get more attacks through the story and as you level up.\n\nCombat's interesting because of the "Turn()" feature.  You can fight enemies in real time, but Red is no warrior and several attacks have windup times that leave her open.  Using Turn() stops time and allows you to queue movement and attacks that eat up your "planning" bar.  When you confirm your setup, Red will zip along and do all of the attacks at lightning speed as the enemies move at a snail's pace.  The tradeoff is that then you can't use any attacks until the planning bar refills, though you can move.  Red only has one movement speed, so using Turn() to approach, strike, and retreat is always a good idea.\n\nAnother neat thing about the combat is how your unused attacks can buff your other attacks or even Red herself.  Crash() is one of the starting moves, a basic melee-range attack that can stun enemies.  Applying it as an upgrade to another move makes that move stun.  Applying it as a passive reduces the damage Red takes as well as renders her immune to slowdown.  You eventually unlock two upgrade slots for your attacks and four passives for Red, but you have to mind the MEM limit taken up by your powers, each of which eats 1 to 4 MEM.  There are quite a few combinations to try out, and you can get interesting combos like a ranged AoE that charms and poisons anything it hits, or a summon that spawns two helpers that slowly heal you.\n\nAnother interesting thing is that all of the powers are tied to character bios and you unlock information as you use the power in the active, upgrade, and passive slots, though this is completely optional.  You get some background info as well as circumstances leading to their disappearances in the wake of the chaos going on, so the game indirectly pushes you to try new combinations.  The game also takes a different approach to lives.  You have a health bar that naturally depletes as you get hurt, and when it empties, you get fully recovered at the cost of losing access to the move that used the most MEM, and it won't come back until you visit a few save points.  Lose all four of your set powers and game over.\n\nI really liked the game's visual style, art deco mixed with digital aesthetic, giving it a weird retro-futuristic vibe.  The enemies are mostly white robotic constructs that attack you with lasers, there are white cubes that pop up to show an upcoming fight and to be used as cover, and you drag a big green sword behind you that looks a bit like a circuit board (which also leaves behind circuity sparks as you move).  The game feels like it could take place entirely in cyberspace, especially considering some of the prompts (finding the Transistor stuck in the man's chest reads "User: Logged Out"), but it's left ambiguous.  The music is great too, though I really took notice in a couple of places that play songs that Red wrote and performed in-universe, like "The Spine" playing when fighting the first Younglady at the big poster or "In Circles" gradually getting corrupted during the first boss fight.  Given Red is currently mute, the Transistor makes comments about the situation or the things you interact with.  I know the narrator in Bastion was pretty love it or hate it, but I didn't mind him and I never would've guessed it was the same guy voicing both characters.\n\nAs far as difficulty went, I found the game on the easy side, but that might've been due to the power combinations I used or prior experience with these kinds of games.  YMMV of course, but I only lost my health to the first boss once and the last one twice, though I came close a few other times.  If you know what you're doing and have a good setup of powers, you can probably handle anything.  The game slowly introduces you to new mooks to fight and their upgrades, at least.  The game is pretty short, as in, "one night of gaming" short.  It doesn't overstay its welcome, but I honestly wanted more.  There are optional challenges that give you a preset list of powers and tasks you with a mission such as "survive for 90 seconds" or "kill all enemies in one Turn()".  There's a New Game Plus feature where you go back through the story, fighting mooks in their strongest forms, and you can opt into the Limiters you unlock by leveling up which increase the enemy's powers in exchange for you getting more EXP out of fights, to the maximum level of 30.  You get another set of the same powers you earned the first time through, so you can really mix things up on the second loop.\n\nShort but sweet.  Transistor is a bit more than just Bastion: Cyberpunk, but those familiar with Bastion should find this a great fit.  It's pretty light on the RPG even though you level up, as you don't allocate stats and the biggest choices are which of the options you go for when you level up, not that you permanently lose anything you skipped.  It's pretty appealing for those who like customizing since there are 16 powers and you can combine any unique power together twice, so there are a lot of combinations to try out--and the game tracks which ones you've used at that!  Kinda wish the story was longer, but it wraps itself up nicely even if it's short.  There's some replay value but a lot of it comes from the optional challenges or just trying new combos to decimate your foes.\n\nYou'd probably like this one.","May 4","true","8.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

First of all, the art style is simply amazing. I mean did ya look at it? It's fabulous. Secondly, the soundtrack is WHOASH. You might end up not enjoying the game but still love it because of how good the music is. It's off the chain man.\n\nThe gameplay. Let's just say that it's a real sauce ball platter when it comes to this aspect. Transistor uses a battle system that is both unique and delicious to the stomach. It allows you to attack enemies in real time or using the neato "Turn" ability to plan out your attacks. Both options are viable and they are both quite satisfying.\n\nTransistor is not without it's flaws however. The game is pretty short only taking me around 7 hours to beat. The game is also extremely linear offering no sense of exploration. The game will keep you going on the path of destruction without much say. HOWEVER, transistor's replay value is boosted thanks to it's wide selection of weapons which allows you to experiment and find tons of different strategies and slam dunk homeruns to use throughout the game. So you don't get to explore the world much but you do get to explore your vast arsenal of abilities. Making different loadouts was pretty fun, and that's where a lot of the replay value was found for me.\n\nFor those of you who played Supergiant's last game Bastion, you should be right at home with the new role that voice actor Logan Cunningham plays in this game as the voice inside the transistor.  Similar to Bastion, the main character is silent and the voice in the transistor will speak for her as she journeys through the city of Cloudbank. It is a slightly different role compared to the role of the narrator from Bastion, but it is executed very well and at the end of the day I was just as impressed.\n\nThe story is also one of the biggest dunks this game has to offer. I found it very interesting and engaging, however once the game had ended, I was left with many unanswered questions that were never resolved.  This may annoy some players, but I actually found it refreshing that the game challenges you to think about these questions and come up with interpretations for yourself.\n\nAt the end of the day, this game is GODLIKE.  For those of you who are looking for a large amount of content in this game, the 20$ price tag may be too steep. And that is okay, but I believe that this game is such an awesome experience that the price tag is justified even if it doesn't last you as long as most games.\n\nSo yeah, Transistor gets a rating of "11/10 reverse gorilla dunk". Thank you for your time.","June 12, 2014","true","28.5"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/237930/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","When I first looked at Transistor I thought it would be somewhat similar to Bastion. It had the same graphic style, an isometric view and a narrator (which is actually a 'character' this time; in the form of a talking sword). But, I'm happy to say that I couldn't be more wrong.\n\nYes, it has all of the features I just mentioned but it's not just a simple copy. There's so much more going on here. Transistor has a deep (and a little bit confusing) story and a combat system that as equally deep. The lore reminded me of Dark Souls where you have to piece things together yourself and not everything is trying to be explained.\n\nThe graphics are amazing, but are, unfortunately, this time limited to full HD resolutions and not anything higher. Despite that it all still looks like art, and it really is eye candy. Absolutely wonderful.\nThe narrator is doing a great job as far as the voice acting goes, even if it's a bit stiff and sometimes feels unemotional. The music and sounds are all excellent as well.\n\nLet's get back to the combat system for a minute. Like pretty much any RPG out there, your character will level up after several battles and once you level up you're allowed to choose a certain skill and passive upgrade. When you first start it's just that, a skill. But level up a few times more and you'll have several skills. This time, however, skills can be combined to make an even more effective/deadly combination. So, for example, let's say that you chose the skill to teleport in an instant. Combine it with Charm (which temporarily transforms an enemy into an ally) and you'll be zipping across the map converting enemies, making your battles much easier. This was just a poor example, by the way (blame my memory !). Of course, this also works the other way around, resulting in entirely different skills every time. It's a blast to play with and it's even more fun to experiment with these new skills on real enemies. You'll see that certain combinations will do ridiculous amounts of damage and that others, while still being useful, need some slight tweaking in order to be effective. It's pure brilliance.\n\nTransistor is on the short side, however, and it can easily be finished in 5-6 hours. I think I explored every area carefully in my playthrough, but I didn't do most of the (optional) challenges. So I think you can add another 2 hours to my numbers if you want to do all of those. And after that, you can start New Game+ with all your current skills intact (which will make the battles more fun right from the start).\n\nIn the end Transistor is nothing but a brilliant, deep little game. If you call yourself a serious gamer you should absolutely play this. I liked it even better than Bastion, and that's definitely saying something.\n\n[Rating: 91/100]","May 31, 2014","true","9.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","1"

The game has everything I adored about Bastion with a deeper disposition.\n\nThe game's combat system features both real time and tactical elements which I feel does wonders for varied playstyles. The function combination system also gives you a ton of choices seeing as you can mix and match 16 different functions as actives, passives, and upgrades.\n\nThe musical quality of the game is also quite excellent. It goes beyond what you would expect as far as ear candy goes. I also noticed that compared to Bastion, the songs in this game have a more direct message. They're not just catchy, they really fit into the story. If you think the soundtrack for this game is stellar, wait until you hear the humming added in!\n\nHere's a sample:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5slhV7pUNf4\n\nAs far as the story goes, Transistor really runs it deep. There are large gaps in the game that I still don't understand even after completing everything (while reading/listening to all interactables). I feel these gaps (some of which are open to interpretation) should at least be partially expanded on. Despite this, the game did not disappoint. I just wish they had alternate endings like they had with Bastion.\n\n10/10 - Everything about the game was very good, but the 10 rating comes from the insanely captivating music.

The RPG part is the usual leveling and acquiring of various attacks and abilities. The tactical side has you planning your moves and attacks during your 'turn' and during 'their turn' you run away. An interesting aspect in this game is that any ability can be used as an active ability, A passive ability or as an enhancement to an active ability. Gives a lot of different combinations to play with and the game encourages you to try them all out. It's also the main reason I'm considering playing again immediately. Something I rarely do.\n\nStory wise, You're Red, A super pop star, and something bad happens. Fortunately your over-sized all-purpose weapon talks to you and fills you in on what's going on. Well, The talking stick doesn't tell you everything. A lot of background is given through text and I found the setting it painted compelling. So much so that I wanted to explore and experience more of the city. I kind of interpreted that as a reflection of Reds' yearning for a part of her life that has been interrupted. I saw the fatalistic vibe as Reds' also.\n\nVisually the city is pleasing, clean and precise. While the more personal moments are done in a nice watercolor style. The music, Except for one stand out song, seems mostly ambient. Though there are some excellent subtle things done to the music, I wished it wasn't so subtle. Something to save for the next game perhaps.\n\nOverall, While the gameplay is excellent, The narrative seems more like an interesting experiment if not entirely successful. But I'll be there for SuperGiants next game sight unseen.","August 15, 2014","true","37.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

Videogames have tried to take that spot over the years, ofering now a great tool for writers and devs to reach their audience in ways movies can't.\nThis level of inmersion is often used to put the player in other character's shoes, offering experiences with more or less background. Transistor favours the storytelling in spite of some of this inmersion, making the player an observer, not giving you absolute control, getting carried by the events, giving  you a broader view of what it has to deliver. And what a way to deliver it.\nTransistor executes flawlessly everything it attempts. It doesn't offer you the latest in graphics, the best music or the most action-packed gameplay, but it makes sure you enjoy every last bit of it. Don't take me wrong, the hand drawn graphics look gorgeous, the music is great and the gameplay is very, very enjoyable, but it's the way it delivers it to the player, what makes Transistor one of the very best games I've ever played. And I've been around since the 80's.\nThe game takes all the good things from Bastion, all kinds of influences from our day, and builds a vivid, original world, so full of life and personality it makes everything else look so run-of-the-mill, so old and used. It tells the oldest Story ever told, a Tragedy. But it's the characters, the world they inhabit, the references to our world, the little details, the pauses, the many readings anyone can take from this story... It's more than just a game, just a story. It's an interactive piece of art.\n\nTo sum it all up, don't miss this experience if you're looking for something else than quick, mindless fun in a game, because you'll be missing a classic. This game is gonna be high up in the history of videogames, at least as one of those "hidden gems", and will bring you memories (and probably a smile) when you stumble upon it in some years.\nIndie games are offering new, fresh, great ideas and masterpieces like Transistor only proves that it's a very good time to be a gamer, enjoy it while it lasts.","May 23, 2014","true","22.6"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","5"

There was a lack of enemy variety, and no real strategy needed to get by them.  Bosses were kind of a pushover too.\n\nEven tho I found this game disappointing, I'll likely give future games from the developer a shot.

Bastion had extremely tight and hugely enjoyable gameplay, and it seemed like Transistor was discarding that for a slowed down, more strategic approach. I could not have been any more wrong.\n\nTransistor provides a system that is pretty easy to learn and grows in complexity and versatility as you progress, allowing you to really tailor your abilities to how you want to play. Unused abilities become modifiers for your equipped abilities or modifiers for your character herself, allowing you to constantly alter your playstyle. You pick the pace at which you fight, choosing whether to focus on fighting in real time, or relying more on using the “time freeze” mechanic to stop time and allow you to plan a whole flurry of attacks in quick succession.\n\nRegardless of this flexibility in playstyle, if your health hits zero, instead of dying and starting over, you lose one of your abilities randomly. This serves an elegant two fold purpose. On one hand, it provides punishment for the player who failed to stay alive, removing an ability that that player specifically wanted to use. On the other hand, because that ability is now removed from the game for a while, the player is forced to mix and match and experiment with whatever abilities are left in the ability pool. To stay alive, the player must adapt.\n\nAnd there is some satisfaction to be had from being forced to adapt. By forcing your hand, Transistor challenges your creativity, your willingness to change the way you think or to try something new. It sits on the precipice of balancing hugely gratifying gameplay with a breathtaking world and a resonating story, and does not disappoint.\n\nYou should probably go buy it.","October 31, 2014","true","14.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Woot woot, the same narrator from Bastion!\nThe difference: the combat system is not quite the same as Bastion's. It's not so much a hack & slash, as much as it is a *tactical* combat-system game.  Ahh how to explain this..? It's quite unique.\nThere is a 'time-stop' system which allows you to literally -pause- to analyze and plan out your combat moves in advance. Each ability and number of steps you take around the "field" require a certain amount of 'energy' - so you are limited by an energy bar and its refresh system.  Therefore, you have to be efficient in not only the abilities you choose, but your movements across the "combat field", etc.  It's remniscent of other games to me that I had enjoyed very much.. so that was not an issue for me, personally! -- it was quite a delight. :)\nWhat I especially enjoyed was the way that you can experiment with and mix up all the different abilities you pick through leveling up. Each combination results in something different, and you can only have 4 active ones in combat. You can literally mix 2-3 learned abilities together for one unique ability / result - so there are multiple possiblities.  You also have passive ability-slots which you can use those ability cards for, as well, and they play a completely different role.  There is quite a flexible customization system. :)\nAlso, if / everytime your HP goes to '0' in combat, you lose and are disabled from one of your 4 abilities; which you can only recover at a later time. :o Additionally, if you want to challenge yourself further, you are able to raise the difficulty by implementing an in-game system called "limiters" -- a very similar system to Bastion.  The more limiters you use, the more rewards (more xp). Funfun!\n\nAll in all, I loved the game so much that I took my time with it and did not want to rush through it.  I recommend that you don't either to enjoy the narration, soundtrack, and immersiveness for the total experience. Luckily, there is an option for a second playthrough so you can have the opportunity to level up some more and unlock abilities you had missed out on before and try different combinations! :)","May 23, 2014","true","18.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","3"

The first one being Bastion, this game has big shoes to fill. Lucky for us, Transistor is every thing we expected from the creators of Bastion, with a few nuggets of surprise thrown in.\n\nTransistor, like Bastion, is a top down isometric RPG, that features amazing visuals and audio. Unlike Bastion, Transistor is a pseudo-Turn based RPG, the melds turn based mechanics with real time combat. The combat system overall feels familiar, but fresh, and original at the same time.\n\nI think it goes with out saying, that this game is gorgeous in every was possible. Amazing illustrations, backgrounds, composition, color pallet, and the sound design matches the visual in quality. It's just a top shelf experience that you won't find in other games.\n\nAll this is great, but keep in mind that Transistor is fairly short, and there's not a lot of incentive to come back to the game other than the possibility that you'll like it enough for a 2nd play through. So for those who are feature, or length centric, consider this your warning. But do keep in mind, when approaching games like Transistor, you're not paying for the amount of game you get, but the quality of game you'll get to experience.\n\nPros:\n- Incredible quality in visual and audio\n- Unique blend of game mechanics\n- Piles of attention to detail\n- An experience all gamer's should have\n\nCons:\n- A little short\n- Very light on content","June 28, 2014","true","25.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The fighting is innovative and clever and makes you want to try out all the combinations.\n\nThe game is not without flaws though - it is highly linear and constantly pushes you through the quite short story arc.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/recommended/237930/","suspectfenster","fenster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/","150 products in account","Transistor is a game developed by Supergiant Games, who are well known for their stylistic action game Bastion.  Transistor definitely borrows from Bastion's strongest suits; notably it is brilliantly compsed and absolutely beautiful.  The story is extremely esoteric (certainly moreso than Bastion), but not unsatisifying.\n\nWhere it differs from Bastion is mostly in gameplay; Transistor still is still an action/RPG where you traverse levels, attack bad guys, and level up, but the game plays much slower almost as a strategy game would.  Enemy encounters are isolated and you can use a "Turn" to essentially stop time and plan out your attacks, which will then carry out in nearly zero time.  Just like Bastion, you're offered a plethora of ways to deal with enemies.  Instead of weapons, you use "functions", which are essentially castable spells and abilities   Each ability can combo with other abilities to alter them, or can be used in a passive slot to provide a permanent buff.\n\nThe result is an insane amount of combinations, and you are incentivied to explore them because using abilities in different ways unlocks more information about the story and the characters which are a part of it.  In Bastion I found myself finding a weapon that I really liked and sticking with it for the rest of the game (even though many weapons are equally viable).  The story mechanic in Transistor subtlely pushes you to try different combinations, and in doing so, you often stumble into even better combinations that you probably wouldn't have realized existed otherwise.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend Transistor.  Most fans of Bastion should enjoy it -- although the amazing art and music is immediately noticable, it is definitely a slower burn in terms of gameplay and the early parts of the game take a little while to get into.  As more abilities and the true nature of the game unveils itself though, it is very well executed and an absolute joy.","July 26, 2014","true","9.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/237930/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","This game surprised me to hell and back. Seriously.\n\nWord of Note: At the time of writing, I have not beaten the game. This "Review" is more of a "First Impressions" than a proper review, so please keep in mind that the game may have a few more surprises down the line that may completely change the gameplay or atleast alter it drastically! Review will be updated accordingly after I beat the game if anything new pops up.\n\n*I also won't summarize the Premise of the Game's Story as the game itself starts you out completely in the Blank and shows you what happened.\n\nVisual-wise, pretty dang amazing, albeit a few scaling issues with buildings and such. This game is the epitome of low-poly modeling and hand painted textures. The enemy models and landscapes are very simple looking as far as modeling goes, but the assets/textures used on everything gives the world life even if the places are deserted, it invokes a tone of lonelyness and helps you figure out somewhat, what exactly happened that there's not a single soul around. When Red moves around and drags the Transistor (Sword) it leaves a trail on the ground that disappears shortly after, but helps mark direction, additionally, some moves can leave holes in the ground depending, and won't disappear until it's replaced by the same "break' textures elsewhere. Enemies themselves are presented as robotic creatures and are reminiscent of Kingdom Heart's Nobodies in that same way - as creatures sent to hunt your player character, but are mindless in nature.\n\nThe Soundtrack is also quite a treat! Boasting pretty impressive Lyrical compositions that gives it a bit of a Noire feeling and are pretty well varied. Additionally, Red can hum alongside any given track, effectively making a sort of "remix" to that particular song. Soundwork is also pretty well done, the Transistor does it's charging noises, it clings and clangs when slamed unto the ground, there's a subtle noise for steps, for the trail the sword leaves and enemies make their odd creature like noises when they're going after you. Voices are also excellently done. Red doesn't speak, but you can hear her sing in some flashbacks, the Transistor also serves as a sort of narrator to help divulge neat little extras. Something the game does, that I really dig, is that the way he speaks to Red, sort of feels like he's talking to the player aswell, giving it a 4th wall kinda feeling. It's all amazing.\n\nThe game also fares pretty well, if a little slow and methodical. This is the part that may make or break the game for a lot of people, for sure. Red moves VERY slow, it's done on purpose though, as areas in general are subdivided via "zones" and they aren't very large in scale either. The game's Battle Structuring is simple, but feels a tad linear in execution (atleast at the start) where enemies ambush you in certain parts of a Zone but won't respawn after a battle ends and you walk back into the area.\n\nCombat is where the gameplay really shines. The battles play out sort of like Crisis Core, once you enter combat mode, you're trapped inside the zone until enemies are defeated. Enemies will be mercilessly going after you, and you have just the one Health Bar to tide you over the entire battle, if your health bar depletes, you will lose a "Function" instead of dying.\nDuring combat, your attacks depend solely on the Functions you have picked out and set up. Each function, obtained either through finding people that died or leveling has multiple functions. This gives the game a LOT of depth as far as building your character goes. You have 4 main slots to assign a Function too, and those slots have 2 extra slots that you can assign more functions to to power up that function - * * * example: You can have a function that shoots out grenade like particles in an area, you have another function that, by itself, creates a bomb in place that needs to be self detonated, however, you can add that function to the previously mentioned function to add, let's say explosive attributes which come via the way of damage buffs, range buffs, etc * * * You can continously build more and more powerful functions to use to kill your foes, move faster, avoid attacks while dealing damage, etc, there's I believe, TONS of ways to build the character you want and fight the way you want.\nWhen fighting, the Combat Areas have little grey squares, these serve as your main method of avoiding attacks. You can destroy these squares yourself or the enemy can. During Major Boss battles, this is very important to keep track of, as bosses can deal a TON of damage and are very patternized. You also have the "Turn" Command, which freezes the entire battle field and let's you plan out attacks ahead of time, this can also be used to avoid attacks. The Turn command works via a queing system - Imagine you have a time slider and you're editing it with the stuff you want Red to do, wether it is move away or closer to an enemy, use specific Functions to continously attack an enemy, avoid an enemy, or both. It is, however, not 100% accurate, as while you're in turn mode you continously set Red to Attack the enemy in a specific area, but the enemy CAN still move when combat resumes and avoid your attacks, thus giving the combat a ton of strategic aspects to it. Turn mode is balanced due to the way you're forced to wait until the turn slider returns to normal, when you deplete the Turn Bar, you CANNOT attack or use any function, so keep that in mind always, and don't use Turn Mode haphazardly as it can leave you VERY vulnerable after usage.\n\nPros:\n+Amazing Soundtrack\n+Amazing Hand Painted/Digital looking world\n+Amazing looking Particle effects to compliment the already awesome looking world\n+Expansive and Deep "Functions" System\n+Amazing Voice Work and Sound Effects.\n+Surprisingly deep combat with a large strategic element to it.\n+Communicates it's Atmosphere amazingly.\n+Great enemy designs help the atmosphere even further.\n+Surprisingly well designed and written Main Character.\n\nCons\n-Minor Scaling issues with Buildings and structures\n-Red moves a little methodical and slow\n-Combat Structure feels a little linear (At time of Writing)","May 23, 2014","true","0.9"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","21","34","0","5"

The oversaturated, colorful art style combined with the ethereal soundtrack provide an incredible feel for the game.\n\nThe art is incredibly colorful, ranging from extremely warm to extremely cool, and it's all hand-painted. The "cutscenes" (if you can refer to them as that) are incredibly beautiful, and prompted me to take several screenshots in order to preserve them. Red's character design is excellent, and the enemy models and city are both really creative and interesting. A lot of cyberpunk art is cool, hard, metallic; you don't see that here. There's a lot of blur, a lot of soft edges, a ton of bloom. It's a game bursting with color.\n\nIf you've read any of my other reviews, you already know that music and sound design play a big part in shaping the experience for me. This game has both in spades. The excellent soundtrack ranges from jazzy and uptempo, to soft and bluesy, to straight downtempo ambient. The sound design is utterly phenomenal. When paused, the game continues playing the background music, but at a slower tempo, and muffled, as if  it were being played inside a car next to you with all of the windows and doors sealed tightly. Click out of the game's window, and you get a very quiet, bassy hum in the background. I've got the game paused in another window as I type this review, and I feel the quiet bass rattling on and off in the cans even now. It's a really phenomenal effect. Whoever worked sound on this title definitely earned their wages.\n\nThere's also an extremely simple, yet very likeable feature that causes Red to hum along to the background music merely by holding down a button. This is just as simple as it sounds, yet I found myself sitting for minutes on end with the left bumper on my controller compressed; mesmerized and staring into my screen as my focus slowly deteriorated.\n\nI feel like I'm floating in a hot tub while on drugs when I play Transistor. It's that kind of game.\n\nAs someone with an overclocked 1440p display the lone criticism I have with the game is the lack of 1440p support, but this qualm is rendered moot by the fact that these are hand-painted designs. It's difficult to justify creating these designs with a 1440p resolution in mind considering how small of a userbase it is, so I can forgive Supergiant for locking the display at 1080p. That's what the art looks best at, and I experienced the game at this resolution in windowed mode.\n\nIt has a voice acting schtick similar to the narrator in Bastion, though in Transistor it takes the form of a speaking sword rather than a narrator. So if you liked that kind of thing in Bastion, you'll like it here. The voice acting is very well-done, but it rubs me a bit wrongly; about half of the lines feel like they're jammed into the game in a very hamfisted manner. I seem to be the only one who felt that way about Bastion, though, so take this criticism of Transistor for what it's worth.\n\nThe core gameplay is your basic isometric action RPG stuff with a couple of neat concepts thrown in. The ability to pause the game and plot out your next actions -- which happen extremely quickly and automatically once you unpause -- is a key aspect in what keeps the combat from becoming a bit stale. There were plenty of times when I felt I didn't have enough control over where my attacks were headed. Certain "functions", as the game calls your attacking skills, felt like they were a bit too hard to properly line up, and as a result I frequently missed some enemies I should have been hitting. But the nifty pausing function takes care of most of it, and it looks really cool. It makes you feel like the badass that Red is supposed to be.\n\nThe other thing I really liked, and the thing that kept me playing most, was the ability to junction functions into each other in order to modify their actions. You have a set amount of function attack and actions and only four slots in which to place them. Each function has an active ability that becomes usable when placed, but they also have a specific modifying ability when junctioned into another active function. This all seems complicated when I write it out, but it's really fairly easy to understand in the game; no tutorial is really necessary after a few minutes of tinkering with it. The combinations are almost literally endless, and I found myself constantly resetting them in order to try new ones. It really adds some meat and some depth to a game that I felt would have easily succeeded on its artistic merits without these systems.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say this game is worth a few hours of play simply for the art style and the soundtrack. But the neat combat and function features here will keep you coming back for far longer than that. This is a very worthwhile experience and Supergiant Games continues to offer some really unique, polished, artistic gaming experiences.","June 29, 2014","true","11.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Very nicely done.\nNever played the previous game "Bastion", but after playing this I may have to pick it up, too.\n\nWell in this game you are controlling Red. Explore the cloudbank and fight against evil process using functions. You can and have to combine your various functions to get the best from your character.\n\nStory is not too hard, the first level are challenging, because you don't have many functions. You can even start a NG+ to start over with more functions.\nDuring your visit, you can do some "tests". Basicly they are challenges to teach you a better way to use your abilities. They are easy, except the performance tests.

Maybe I shouldn't even compare Bastion and Transistor because Supergiant Games might wanted do something different... Anyways.\n\nYou start right away in middle of the game and the story. The setting is a Sci-Fi world, more precisely I guess it's something like an online world.\nIn Transistor you experience the story chronologically. In the beginning there are some minor gaps, which get filled soon. The story catches you and you want to know what happens next. Nevertheless, to be honest I have to say that I liked the story of Bastion better but the story of this game is not bad at all!\n\nThe gameplay is quite cool. Transistor's gameplay contain some nice features that underline the story and the atmosphere. That includes electing something on a terminal or some breaks for the protagonist. These breaks are implemented as beautiful pictures.\n\nWhat I liked the most is the combat system.\nTime to time you get more attacks and can combine these like you want. This mixing provides a great variety to fighting in Transistor. Also, there is a "plan mode" in which you can plan moves and then perform then fast. That looks very cool and is fun too.\nLastly, you can, as well as in Bastion, increase the difficulty on your own.\n\nSupergiant Games games always catch you with their atmosphere so I didn't write anything about the atmosphere here.\n\nOkay, I can not write this review without mentioning Darren Korb and his great job on composing marvellous songs for this game. The music matches perfectly to the game and is an essential part of it, just like in Bastion.\n\nI come to the conclusion that Transistor is another awesome game by Supergiant Games. It's a perfect game that doesn't need improvements at all! If you liked Bastion or you want to play something different but brilliant buy Transistor now!","November 24, 2014","true","13.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

[deaf]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NG-Allison/","276 products in account","Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing\nFor Deaf/hoh gamers, I rate this game a 10/10!\n\nOverall GameSupergiant knocked it out of the park again.  In Transistor, you play as Red, a lady whose voice was stolen by a group who intended to kill her.  Obviously that's a bit odd, but the game takes place inside of a computer-ish environment.  Telling more would be giving things away for those who, for some reason, have yet to play it.\n\nSince this review is largely oriented toward acciessibility for deaf/hoh gamers, I will stop there and just say that it is a great game with a great story that has significant replay value both in terms of further understanding the story and additional challenges, as the game gets harder on additional playthroughs.\n\nMy overall rating for gameplay experience is 10/10. :D\n\nGeneral AccessibilityThis game has been called semi-isometric.  Basically, you control Red in an angled-down view using WASD, Q for a 'flourish,' and the number keys 1-4.  In place of WASD, you can left click to have Red go somewhere.\n\nFor mobility-related issues, you have the option of keyboard/mouse OR a controller, and the game can realistically be played using real-time combat and the Turn() function or just through Turn(), though it is slightly harder, since the enemies will still attack outside of your Turn() actions.  Further, all keys can be rebound.\n\nTurn() basically pauses combat so that you can plan and execute an attack using 'movement points.'\n\nFor overall accessibility, I give Transistor a 10/10.\n\nSubtitles & CaptionsTransistor starts with subtitles turned off, so make sure you enable them before playing.  As the game has no opening cinematics prior to the start menu, you will not miss any of the story.\n\nSubtitles appear at the top of the screen in very large, clear, outlined text.  No concerns with white-on-white or otherwise unreadable subtitles.  Further, subs are colored according to who is talking and images accompany the voices to indicate the speaker.  In scenes with multiple speakers, nobody is shown actually talking on screen, so there are no concerns with differentiating on-screen vs off-screen subtitles.\n\nAlthough I was confused when I first started playing, when you see off-white captions with no indication of the speaker, pay attention to the sword glowing.  Since Red has no voice, the sword is the speaker, and it acts as a narrator-in-being in the game, pushing the story along by talking to Red.\n\nRed actually uses the OVC terminals to talk back to the sword via typing, so you can consider that a shoutout to TTYs or using text/notepad on a smartphone to communicate.\n\nFor its effective use of subtitles that leaves no confusion about the speaker or the story, I rate this category a 10/10.\n\nChatting/CommunicatingTransistor is a single-player game.  No chatting or voice comms exist.\n\nNo rating!","December 19, 2014","true","47.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I see that most reviewers mention that and that the story is cool, but not so many people emphasize this enough:\n\nThis is one of the best combat systems you'll find around\n\nDuring combat you use your skills (therein called "functions"), run around and etc... but you also have a "turn bar" that when fills up, allows you to "pause" the fight; it sort of allows you to "script" what you're going to do next. You have a certain number of "turn points" to spend on using skills and moving around. Once you're done, you "unpause" and your character will "run the script".\n\n\nThat idea in itself is worth the game, really. But there is more.\n\nThe skills are AWESOME. There are 16 "only", but they are VERY DIFFERENT. "Bounce" hits the target and ricochets around; "Breach" has a long range and pierces the target and walls. "Crash" causes little damage, but stuns the target, which increases the next damage; "Void" does not cause any damage, but increase the damage for the next few seconds. Now, these are their Active function; skills can be used in Passive mode as well - which give you some bonus or protection - or be Combined (in the game its called "upgrade") e.g. Breach + (Bounce + Crash) will pierce through targets in a straight line, but also ricochet and stun. Mind you, Bounce + (Breach + Crash) is not the same thing, nor is Crash + (Breach +  Bounce).\n\nThe combinations and possibilities for combos are so overhelming that I've finished the game twice and never settled down for one single combo line, always changing. The combat system is just plain amazing.\n\nFinally, another reason to buy this game: it is a Supergiant Game. These guys are one of the best small studio I've seen around, professional products released in mature state, also customer support was great when I needed. Back these guys as much as you can, they deserve it.","January 29, 2015","true","21.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The oversaturated, colorful art style combined with the ethereal soundtrack provide an incredible feel for the game.\n\nThe art is incredibly colorful, ranging from extremely warm to extremely cool, and it's all hand-painted. The "cutscenes" (if you can refer to them as that) are incredibly beautiful, and prompted me to take several screenshots in order to preserve them. Red's character design is excellent, and the enemy models and city are both really creative and interesting. A lot of cyberpunk art is cool, hard, metallic; you don't see that here. There's a lot of blur, a lot of soft edges, a ton of bloom. It's a game bursting with color.\n\nIf you've read any of my other reviews, you already know that music and sound design play a big part in shaping the experience for me. This game has both in spades. The excellent soundtrack ranges from jazzy and uptempo, to soft and bluesy, to straight downtempo ambient. The sound design is utterly phenomenal. When paused, the game continues playing the background music, but at a slower tempo, and muffled, as if  it were being played inside a car next to you with all of the windows and doors sealed tightly. Click out of the game's window, and you get a very quiet, bassy hum in the background. I've got the game paused in another window as I type this review, and I feel the quiet bass rattling on and off in the cans even now. It's a really phenomenal effect. Whoever worked sound on this title definitely earned their wages.\n\nThere's also an extremely simple, yet very likeable feature that causes Red to hum along to the background music merely by holding down a button.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Em_TC/recommended/237930/","Em_TC","Em","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Em_TC/","135 products in account","Oh, Transistor.\n\nI went into this game assuming it was, like so many have said, a mere 6 hour jaunt. The impression often given is that that's all there is to Transistor; sure, it's visually and musically stunning, and its narrative is engaging, but ultimately many will say that 6 hours (give or take an hour) is all there is to it. I disagree, and not just because subjective, arbitrarily determined gameplay durations are generally a poor gauge of quality game content in the first place.\n\nMy first playthrough took me about 11 hours, 12 if you count my various AFK'ing and tabbing out pauses. However, I didn't just play through the story from start to finish. I completed the extra challenge "tests" that introduced me to abilities I may not have realized were useful otherwise; I explored every area, read news terminals, and unlocked some of the additional "function" (ability) file details. All of these served to greatly expand my understanding of the game's setting and characters. It is this that gets me to the point of my review. There is more to Transistor than just the story that's on the surface. Just getting to the "end" of the game will not give you an explicit understanding of its story.\n\nMeticulously placed throughout the beautiful environments, the well-voiced dialogue, the amazing music -- even some of the function names -- are subtle hints, easter eggs, and pointers to details about the game's setting, story and characters that are often not addressed directly anywhere else. This game is very much about (subtly) showing you, NOT outright telling you. Days after I had first beaten the game, I was still going through my screenshots, still pondering the meaning behind some of the music's lyrics, and still reading others' interpretations. This was all in an attempt to absorb more of what the game has to offer, to gain even more insight into perhaps the best, most enjoyable and satisfying aspect of the game for me -- what was NOT said, what was NOT blatantly pointed out, and was instead left there for me to find on my own or to speculate about later. And my second playthrough... well. I don't think I've ever jumped right back into a game for a new playthrough so soon after finishing it. And then even the fact that the game's "new game+" option was instead referred to as a "recursion" turned out to have some significance.\n\nSo yes, the game's art style is gorgeous. Its soundtrack is one of the best game soundtracks I've ever listened to. Its combat system is intricate and greatly rewards planning ahead and experimenting. It is all of these things, and you can go through a straight start-to-finish playthrough and enjoy every bit of that. But if you're the type of player who likes to ask a lot of questions about the specifics of a game's plot or characters, who isn't always merely satisfied with the obvious, and who appreciates a game that lets you connect some of the dots on your own, you'll very likely get even more out of Transistor than you thought you would.\n\nP.S.: Yes, the soundtrack is absolutely worth purchasing.

The last few years I have only got this feeling from two games, the first one was The Banner Saga, and now Transistor. This is a game that when I sit down playing it I don't wanna stop, but I dont really want to continue either, because i'm thinking: The game is probably quite short.\n\nHowever, for this story the amount of time was perfect, not to short and definitely not to long.\nThis is a very interesting RPG-game with a deep love story, in a city where very weird things are going on.\nI must say that at first I was very confused, but the longer I played it the longer I was drawn into the story and into the world of Transistor.\n\nTogether with the exellent art-style and magnificent soundtrack this game made made me more immersed than what I usually get in games, atleast since I got older. I remember that I as a kid more often got this feeling, the feeling I got from Banner saga and now Transistor. I guess that is because I get used to it, to the way games play and the way a gaming story most often adapts.\n\nRomance or more rather love is a huge part of the story, or it basically is and I don't feel many games use that as their spine. More games should, since it's a powerful tool to usurp our feelings. I want my feelings to get usurped by games, I really do.\n\nThis game has two main characters, one is Red, a strong female character who are fighting to get back her voice, which was stolen from her by Camerata, which is a group you don't know much about, but their intentions were at first good, but power might have corrupted them. The other protagonist is "the" Transistor, the weapon Red uses. who throughout the game is trying to help you as much as possible.\n\nThe fighting is very interesting, as you play you will find more and more moves, or attacks that you can use during these fights. You can fight as time goes, or you can enter this... "V.A.T.S" system (If you know Fallout 3 & NV) where you get to plan your moves ahead of you and then fire them all at once without the enemy having the time to respond. However that leads to a cooldown so you can't attack for a few seconds after. I found this system very usable at times, but mostly I tend to... forget it? Or maybe I just don't appriciate it enough. It has helped me sure, but I want to kill the enemy "myself" If that makes sence.\n\nWhenever you get beaten enough you'll lose some attacks, which will return later on when another cooldown has counted down to zero. The most interesting part with the attacks are that you can put them together, you can strenghen one by adding the others, that however cost a few points so at the same time you have to look at a bar that show you how much points you've spend on this. While leveling up you can choose to increase that bar, or add another support slot for your weapon, etc.\n\nI would dearly recommend this game to anyone who would like to try something different, but still very beautiful and worthwhile.","January 4, 2015","true","5.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

When I heard SuperGiantGames was making another Bastion-esque game, I was not very happy, to be honest. I saw the trailers, and thought it looked too similar to Bastion, and assumed they were putting their entire budget into marketing. Gladly, I was very wrong. Transistor is only similar to Bastion in its base style (top down, hand drawn). The gameplay has been improved, the art style is completely different, and the music is just as good as it was in Bastion. Now, I'm sure I will still like Bastion better, simply because I played it first and am therefore somewhat bias, but if you remove any comparison from your mind, you are left with a unique, enjoyable, and artistic game with a fantastic story.\n\nAlso, I am very impressed that there are no bugs or glitches, as I am playing on day one. That's not to say you might not have problems, but it seems that with my somewhat abnormal setup, I tend to take the brunt of those sorts of things.\n\nThis game and its soundtrack are completely worth the money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/recommended/237930/","Auburok","Auburok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/","581 products in account","I was looking forward to this game for a long time, and have a lot to say about it, but I'll do a super TL;DR list precursor.\n\nPROS:\n+Amazing artwork\n+Particular songs of the soundtrack\n+Interesting upgrade system\n\nCONS:\n-Plothole laden story\n-Combat\n-Short\n-Repetitive\n-Crashes\n-Bugs\n\nFrom this point on, spoilers will be present.\n\nTransistor is something of a tactical RPG by Supergiant Games. The player is thrust into a vague situation as the famous singer Red, whom has had her voice "stolen" from her, as she removes a sword-like object from a corpse. It's insinuated that you knew this person, Mr. Nobody, and they protected you. The sword acts as the narrator of the story and as the majority of the player's insight into the world.\n\nRed uses the sword, the titular "Transistor", to fight off mysterious white invaders known as "The Process". The sword begins with a few attacks and has the ability to stop time (called "turn) to plan attacks, and then execute the qued attacks. This can only be done once every few seconds, depending on how many actions were lined up, and this is the main method of playing. The player can attack outside of combat when they aren't regenerating their "turn" ability or when an ability is upgraded with a specific augment, but it's very slow and inaccurate. There's a multitude of skills (called "functions"- 18 in total) which can also be used to augment other skills or Red herself. Functions are multi-purpose: not only do they act as Red's skills system, but they also unlock fragments of backstory for the game while using them in one of the three different capacities (ability, ability upgrade, personal upgrade), but the backstories are focused on the person related to the ability.\n\nThe skill system is very interesting and can lead to some creative builds, but ultimately the goal is still to do gross amounts of damage, and there's only a handful of skills that will help you reach those levels. While many of these functions have interesting properties and uses, Transistor's combat doesn't really lend to using some of them more than once to unlock background story. An example of this is the function "Get", which pulls an enemy toward you. Due to the nature of combat, Get often is redundant or, at worst, a detriment. When executing a turn, time isn't stopped anymore- it's slowed. Faster creatures will begin to move away from your planned abilities and Get can sometimes miss or pull the wrong one. This doesn't require faster enemies to mess up, either, as the game's readout of potential damage often is misleading. When stacking attacks, the game will caculate how much damage will occur to enemies. Often it'll drop out enemies if there's too much information on the screen, but it also poorly handles damage over time and momentum knocking enemies out of range. Some monsters, like Jerk 3.0's, are able to rotate so quickly that by the time you're done buffing and debuffing, they have rotated and you can no longer backstab. This is frustrating considering that the two most simple solutions are: A, stop time entirely for the turn function, or B, remove the damage readout.\n\nDespite being flawed on many fronts on its own, the mediocre combat isn't the only thing to blame. Enemies in Transistor focus on ten different enemies. These enemies start out basic, and get "upgrades" as the player continues through the story. These upgrades are denoted by a 2.0 or higher designation beside the name. Despite the intent that the player needs to deal with these enemies in different ways, none of these enemies force the player to think differently. The answer is always the same: use a turn and do as much damage as possible in one go, preferably by way of AoE damage. This is absolutely true for every enemy, from hulking Jerks to artillery Cluckers. There are some attempts to break this up, such as the Snapshot's obscuring effect, but many of the abilities in the game already force the player into melee combat, so they are often inconsequential. In the later stages of the game, the player merely need to wait until an enemy is no longer stealthed to unleash flurry of void debuffs and a final cull swing.\n\nThe game is rather short, and it takes somewhere in between two to six hours for a playthrough, depending on if the player does everything (interacting with spots and terminals, doing challenges, etc) or not. The player is thrust into the story as soon as they start the game for the first time, and it really never becomes much clearer. Transistor takes something of a "Dark Souls" approach to telling a story by having it dispersed through strings of text on functions and difficulty increasing "limiters". The Transistor, whom is inhabited by someone Red knows that remains nameless, is the main source of off-hand information during the game, usually to excess. The problem with this story is that nothing is ever divulged, nothing is ever expanded upon, and most information presented through functions are about people that either aren't important to the story or provide nothing concurrent that puts things into context. The game is absolutely full of plot holes to an incredible degree and it's presented in a way that would be lost on a lot of people, as it expects the player to use all abilities in all capacities and sift through the text. It's terrible storytelling, which is a shame. The story is interesting, but inaccessible unless subtitles (for Sybil, Royce and Mr. Nobody) and with some extra reading and conjecture. Conjecture is not a basis for storytelling, though; you're just witnessing an event without any context. It's like if you've witnessed a UFO beaming up some farm animals in the distance. Without the rest of the story, the game focuses on Red and Mr. Nobody's extremely obvious relationship as lovers, and Mr. Nobody talks at great length in regards to this when he's not busy filling your ears full of nonsense otherwise. "Sea Monster's the only real choice here," indeed. The relationship stands somewhere around "puppy love" on the devotion spectrum until the end of the game, but there's really no development at all. There's no back story, outside of a few obscure references and some images during the credits.\n\nThe majority of the game is spent trying to get to the Camerata in their tower, and then backtracking through some of the early areas to an M.C. Escher area (which contrasts to the Gustav Klimt inspired "golds and shapes" artwork through the rest of the game). The areas, while beautiful, are exceptionally similar and the game's areas bleed into each other. While there's plenty of polish, there's plenty of little things I wouldn't expect at this level of polish, like how OVC terminals are pretty much just inverted when facing the other way, including the giant "OVC" markings. These things become very apparent when the environments aren't differentiated, and when you're doing the same things over and over.\n\nSupergiant Games had a lot to live up to for their second game, and I can't really hold them to those expectations; they were just astronomical considering Bastion was their first fare, which was both refreshing, innovative, and honed in just about every category. Something about Transistor feels rushed, or hollow. It's hard not to compare Transistor to Bastion with all the similarities and outright references to it; a silent protagonist with a narrator voiced by Logan Cunningham battles to save what's left of their city using a deus ex machina device, all whilst encountering a few survivors and an eventual "betrayal" that leads the character to seek greener pastures. The only differences here are story elements, which are even more vague in this offering, and the well meaning but ultimately poor combat. I'm pressed to say that this game would be amazing for a first entry as a studio, but, it's not.\n\nTransistor is an okay game plagued with self-plagiarizing of old concepts and poor execution of new ones.","May 25, 2014","true","10.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The whole atmosphere constructed by the art and soundtrack is very immersive. The whole story came together beautifully.\n\nGameplay:\n\nIt's an interesting take on giving players a choice between etiher real-time womanliness combat (which I'm not woman enough to do) or "halting time" so you can plan out a series of executions (use a skill, move, use a skill, use a skill, move, etc.), and even a mix of both.\n\nHave to admit though, the controls on the keyboard aren't too great, and while it isn't a huge issue, I am more inclinded to use the plan-it-out option in fights just to make sure I hit the right things.\n\nArt:\n\nWhat can I say? It's beautiful. It's breathtaking. It looks like it was a hell-of-lot of work to do, so kudos to the art team. It's really amazing.\n\nSoundtrack:\n\nFor me, the fantastic song "We All Become" featured in the reveal trailer stands out the most. Yet, it and every soundtrack/song mixed into the Transistor experience are all really, really well done.\n\nStoryline/Immersion:\n\nI have yet to complete the storyline, but the whole game comes together well. The world is given life and the characters given silent voices. While the story isn't told in a straightforward manner, having the player piece it together on her/his own is a nice variation.\n\nTransistor is a phenomal work of art that everyone should experience. 10/10.","November 2, 2014","true","7.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It doesn't (and couldn't) have the "amazing thing out of nowhere" quality of Bastion. But the art direction, narration, and setting of Transistor are more to my taste.\n\nThe story has a cryptic in medias res presentation and requires a lot of digging to uncover and properly arrange what is actually going on, but that was OK with me.\n\nI also was happy trying out tons of different loadouts and combinations of the combat powers -- the motivation of unlocking story/background bits, and tackling the different challenge rooms, was enough to push me into that experimental approach. And I think that made for a more enjoyable playthrough. Transistor strikes me as being a little analogous to Bioshock in that way; it's tempting to just wrench and electrobolt your way through Bioshock, and you couldn't really be blamed for doing that, but you might have had more fun intentionally trying other weapons/plasmids.\n\nTransistor definitely is flawed as a combat-heavy game with nuanced but poorly tutorialized mechanics that are also hard to visually "read", so I imagine many people will bounce off of it. For various reasons I stuck with it though and ended up having a very good time. I even fired up NG+ immediately and played about halfway through it again. It's a beautiful game that attempts some interesting things, and I'm glad I played it.","January 19, 2015","true","10.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
