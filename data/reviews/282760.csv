Each piece of music is full of originality and abundance of tone color, with pleasant atmosphere and diversity of music type. While a good memory is required, pitch recognition, sense of rhythm and timbre recognition ability are also important to this game. It would be a good chance for those who want to improve their musicality to develop and enhance their understanding of music.\n\nI just want to say, I really, really enjoy the whole game and actually listen to every single note and fragment. Thank to the developer who created this wonderful piece of work, and I would love to see more innovative elements being added into it.\n\nCircuits\n[9/10]\n\n[Chinese Version]\n身為一個學習音樂多年的音樂人和音樂愛好者，這款真可完全說是"我的遊戲"啊XD\n拜過去多年的音樂培育環境所賜，我擁有平時沒甚麼用處的絕對音感和良好的節奏感，但玩這款遊戲時就完全變成了一種享受；因為房間裡就擺著一台電子鋼琴在我電腦邊，所以甚至會邊聽邊把旋律複製下來，不少片段都富有原創性和啟發性，讓我自己本身拿手的現代音樂風格又多了一些靈感，是款極富趣味、氣氛輕鬆以及充滿創造力的作品。\n\n這款遊戲的目的在於把聽過的旋律用各種元素重組，以完整重現音樂的片段。基本有弦樂、Bass、打擊樂、鋼琴和人歌聲等，後面的關卡會添加更多元素，例如重複次數和迴圈設定的加入，讓遊戲更有了耐玩度。各關卡音樂本身可以分層聽，把不同的樂器分開對聽覺不那麼敏銳的人會是比較容易的開始，不過我個人還是喜歡不分層聽，感覺比較有挑戰性XD\n\n不只要求記憶性，良好的音高音感、節奏感、音色辨識能力都是能夠在這款音樂遊戲中學習培養到的。就算對音樂沒太多概念也能單純享受好音樂，強烈推薦給也喜歡音樂的朋友，這款前所未見的音樂藝術品絕對能讓你獲益良多。\n\n順帶一提，我玩到目前的關卡幾乎都是不拆解聽一遍就能全部放對，成就感破表，總感覺有點作弊啊XD\n\nCircuits\n[9/10]","June 15, 2014","true","5.7"," 87 of 100 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","87","100","3","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/282760/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Playing Circuits is like trying to transcribe a song someone else wrote, while having an overly vague and harsh on looker constantly jump in to tell you you're doing something wrong. It's a dull lesson in tedious frustration, constantly imposing illogical and repetitive mechanics on the player while providing no incentive or reward for figuring them out. The ideas behind Circuits sound intriguing on paper, but the foundation developer Digital Tentacle has laid them out is simply not there.\n\nCircuits is a game about building music, or that's what it's supposed to be. In reality it's the act of memorizing a sequence of sounds, and then placing audio samples in the correct order until you've recreated the track exactly. This is expanded upon by new mechanics such as repeating samples and loops, but they are never used in a way that actually expands the gameplay into something more compelling, instead only making tracks more confusing and difficult to put together.\n\nThis is the fault of both the opaque design at the core of Circuits, and the fact that the tracks you are creating are often made up of far more sounds and layers than you actually place on your board. This makes deciphering what sample is meant to go where incredibly challenging in a way that feels poorly thought out and rarely allows you to readily hear the mistakes you make, as everything is buried under so many other sounds to begin with. It also flies in the face of the very premise of the game that you are building these tracks yourself, as so much of them are completely separate from the gameplay and simply added onto the samples you placed. Finally the soundtrack is enormously disappointing for a game based around music, consisting of twenty-five nearly identical tracks, none of which are the least bit memorable and made having to listen to them dozens of times per level immensely irritating.\n\nThough it blends two of my favorite genres (music and puzzle games), Circuits manages nothing but to be exceedingly unenjoyable in nearly every aspect of its designing, failing to even deliver upon its original goals as it meanders about with uneasy steps in its mess of dismal design choices. I'm not sure why I bothered to push through to the end, as having done so I can see I was having very much the same experience then as right at the start of the game, which is to say a dreadful time that I couldn't recommend to others.","August 10, 2014","false","3.9"," 73 of 97 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","73","97","3","5"

You can separate the soundtrack into individual layers, which makes it easy to listen and compare the music pieces and find the right place for each one... but that's not even a challenge, and I think there is no point in playing the game like this.\n\nBut if you have a good musical ear (and headphones), you can choose not to use layers (there is an achievement for that), so you can only listen to the complete unmodified track, with up to 3 "instruments" playing at the same time. And that makes things interesting, in some cases nearly impossible. But that's when hints come into play! You just need to get things mostly right and then you may use hints to logically deduce the rest, which is also quite fun.\nOh, and if you want more, then you can play with layers but without hints (which is another achievement), so there's some replayability.\n\nIn conclusion, Circuits is an interesting game, but I wouldn't recommend it to most people.\n\n★★★★★★☆☆☆☆","June 23, 2014","true","6.1"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","2"

But be prepared for some pretty difficult puzzles!\n\nHowever, for those with a history of extensive musical training, don't expect to use much thought process. I myself am a music composition major in university, and have been playing music since the age of 2. Needless to say, I was able to complete all the puzzles with total ease, without using any hints or switching to individual instrument layers. If you think you would be in a similar position as me, either wait until more difficult puzzles are introduced into the game (the devs are considering adding some more challenging levels), or simply get the game now, and use it as a method to relax.\nOn a side note, I hear there is a new extention or software coming soon called Circuits Composer, which means that the community might be able to provide us with some truly challenging puzzles, possibly even for music graduates.\n\nMy final word is that I fully recommend this game to people who don't have impossibly sharp ears, as you'll be developing your hearing abilities through levels that you may find yourself stuck on for hours.

However, the objective is wrong. Instead of listening to music so that we can copy it as well as possible, we should be rearranging these buttons in such a way that the music makes intuitive sense without the help of any guide at all. This way, we only hear the (by the way, fantastic) original score once we solve the puzzle. If you do this, you can begin the music with all buttons in place - just some of them are wrong. Then instead of listening like a parrot, we listen like a musician and learn to pick out things that don't belong on our own.","June 5, 2014","false","2.3"," 54 of 81 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","54","81","0","0"

And that's basically what circuits is all about--chaining musical samples together to reproduce the default piece of each level. While the music samples are pretty good, as a game where the player simply tries to reproduce what he hears, I didn't find it all that fun or engaging.\n\nAs I played the game, I was thinking that the user should be able to make his own musical scores based on the samples provided. And apparently there is a Circuits Composer feature coming soon which I think will make this game a fun little music generator. So I give it a thumbs up for a future unreleased feature. The base game isn't all that impressive, but it's hard not to recommend it given the sale price.","October 30, 2014","true","7.0"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

Slowly got a bit more interesting, then they introduced the loops portion of the gameplay and that's where the game completely broke down from a musical puzzle to a frustrating chore.\n\nFor a musician, this game provides no real challenge or gameplay. Simply listen to each sample and figure out where it needs to go, then when you think you've solved it, just hit play and fast-forward through. There's no incentive to actually listen to the entire piece or all samples together. It's much easier and faster to figure out each "layer" (as they call it) and put in the proper samples.\n\nYou may notice that I haven't even spent a full hour on the game but that's because I finished around half the levels and then the "loop" mechanic got SO tedious that I just had to stop. It wasn't an engaging or challenging mechanic. It was just endless tedium. And the number of loops that you need to figure out has no meaning musically as there are no measures or BPM or anything. So it's a matter of figuring out how many times each sample loops audibly. And when you've heard these repeating samples over and over again, watching paint dry sounds like a much better afternoon!\n\nSo get it if it's on sale and get it if you're not a musician.","November 9, 2015","false","0.5"," 45 of 66 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","45","66","4","6"

The game mechanic is based on you listening to certain melodies and then identiying the proper sounds and putting them in the right order. Note that you will probably have to listen to some parts repeatedly to get them right, since it is something not everyone has the patience for.\n\nThe difficulty is generally not high, except towards the end (levels 24-25). You can, however, choose to *not* break up the music into layers in the previous levels, so it will be harder for you to distinguish the different sounds playing at the same time. The game is a tad short, I finished it in roughly 4 hours, but that can vary depending on the person. However, the developers have promised more levels in the near future, so this might change.\n\nOverall, I would say that circuits is worth your time.  It is simple, yet elegant and relaxing if you are generally musically inclined. It is hard to comment beyond personal preferences for this type of game, since I feel it is mostly a matter of taste, so if you think what I have mentioned so far is something you will like, you will probably enjoy this game as I have.","July 6, 2014","true","4.1"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

It is highly original, and I have never seen another game like it! While it's mechanics are deceitfully simple, you will come to find Circuits both stimulating and satisfying. The objective is to string together various segments of a song in the correct order... Easy, right? =)\n\nStory: If you only play games with a primary focus on storytelling, Circuits might not be the game for you. If you can, however, enjoy a game without a tale to tell, I really implore you to try this game.\n\nGameplay: If you are a music lover, this game might suit you. The gameplay revolves around the music, and I assure you that the soundtrack is superb, and with good reason. Basically, all you have to do is listen to the song and figure out how to recreate it on an empty template. You can listen to the song in layers, or as a whole, depending on how well you can pick apart sound. The game doesn't take long to beat, and my only complaint is the difficulty. It starts off extremely easy, and at some point takes a leap into higher difficulties. Overall, this game is extremely enjoyable, especially if you're just looking for something relaxing to do.\n\nControls: This game offers an untraditional approach to gaming. While the controls are simple enough, and playable simply with a mouse, it is best played with a set of headphones. This helps the player to become immersed in the sounds, which in turn will aid them on their quest to put the sounds in the correct sequence.\n\nGraphics: Sleek, simple, and to the point: Circuit's interface is highly appealing, and not overly cluttered. The music will be threaded together on a maze of lines, taking the form of colourful circles, which will light up as they are played. The background is subtle, and overall, I feel that the graphics are reasonable.\n\nSound: The audio is possibly Circuit's best selling feature, in my opinion. While some sounds are not entirely appealing, most are incredibly easy to listen to. It is easy on the ears, and progresses in difficulty throughout the players gaming experience. There isn't a lot left to critique.\n\nReplay Value: I'd be willing to play Circuits again, I'm kind of a sucker for puzzle games, so I tend to play a puzzle per week, or so.","October 18, 2014","true","5.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

The "circuits" are just the visual manifestation of how the music plays out-- pay no heed-- it will make sense once you try the game.\n\nBasically, you listen to some synth music, and with your ear (assisted by optional in-game hints), figure out which chords go where in the progression; which sections are looped (and how much), what the beat patterns are (and how they are repeated).  I don't consider myself a huge fan of techno/synth/trance (some of it I like), but I found all of the music pleasant to listen to.\n\nThere are 25 levels-- whether it's a long game or a short game is completely based on how you are able to figure out the levels.

Which to me leads to the only real downside of the game.  If it had a sandbox mode, an editor, or the ability to incorporate your own music into the game, it would be perfect.  As it stands, it's still a solid music puzzle game, but it's dependent on whether you enjoy the music already presented in the game.","April 25, 2014","true","5.6"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","1"

You also have to handle is the elements loop, and very often some elements are drowned out by others even though they still add to the song as a whole. Headphones are very recommended for this. There are 25 levels of increasing difficulty, so plenty to do, along with a separate "composer" application.\n\nThe game uses a very simple drag and drop interface. I unfortunately can't say for sure if it works with a touch screen, but from what I can say I suspect it will. The music elements and the song in each level are all of a high quality, so it does afeel as if you are interacting with music and not just some pizzle pieces.\n\nGood game for those with a musical ear, or just those who want to improve their own.","December 23, 2015","true","4.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Ultimately, the game is a test is your aural detection and mimicry, and not much else.\n\nWhile the game is titled Circuits, the gameplay relates to circuitry in only a superficial (using the symbol for ground, etc) manner - there is no actual relation to circuit design (ANDing or ORing the audio signals, for example) in order to create the music, which is somewhat disappointing. In each level, you are given a series of tiles each of which contain a single musical track. Along the progress bar of the "circuit", there are locations where you drop those tiles in order to match them to the given audio track. Sometimes you'll have to loop individual tracks or groups of tracks, and there are "switch"es where you choose one track over another, but in truth they only serve to make the levels easier, as the tiles are in fixed locations on them, which limits the areas those tiles can be used.\n\nUltimately, this is a game of mimicry/memory. The last couple levels provide some degree of challenge within that constraint, but for the most part I didn't find the game particularly challenging/fun. The music itself was generally pleasant, and if there was something more to the game than "match what you hear" I would probably switch this to a recommend. But as is, I don't think most people would overly enjoy the game - if a game of matching audio tracks to one another sounds like fun, then by all means.\n\nI'd recommend not splitting the layers in order to provide a higher level of difficulty - you'll probably get more out of it.","July 26, 2014","false","3.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It starts off fairly simple, and slowly increases in difficulty. They introduce new concepts to the puzzles very well, giving you time to adjust. My favorite part is the musical portion, it's unique (at least to me) in a puzzle game to have it all reliant on sound. Nothing is more satisfying than correctly matching up the sound bits to the song, piece by piece, and playing it as a whole and hearing it match solidly to the original. The composer is fun, even with next to no knowledge on how to make music you can throw in a few random things on the track list and it'll probably sound close to decent, I haven't experimented with it too much but I look forward to it. The game itself is fairly priced, if you enjoy music based games or puzzle games, you'll feel it was well worth it, if not for the game itself but just to mess around in the composer (especially if you caught it on a sale, like I did.)","November 14, 2015","true","5.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, what it does differently is every piece of the puzzle is a short piece of music, which you need to put into the correct position to recreate the whole score for the level. You might think this is quite simplistic, but if you are not a very musically driven person like me, it may be somewhat difficult to differ which piece goes where, due to some of them sounding very similar. The game slowly introduces different mechanics like layers, looping and switches, which increases the difficulty if you don't listen carefully.\nAll in all this simplistic game is a very cheap gem on the steam store that forces you to listen to be able to solve the puzzle instead of staring and observing like many other games but can still be quite challenging and time consuming, although time is not wasted when you finally get to hear the masterpiece you put together.","October 15, 2014","true","2.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So, I checked my library and found some games I never played before (those are gifts, actually).\nAnd then, I downloaded one of those. The name is Circuits. The size is quite small so it didn't need much download time to complete it. I played this game and... hell, this game is awesome.\nThe game itself is about music puzzle divided to levels. So, the gameplay is simple. First, you listen to the sample music. Then, you'll be served some puzzle with some notes missing. You have to fill the missing note with the tone available. Rearrange it well, and you'll pass!\nThe graphic is quietly simple, but it bring the game so relaxing to play and give you more concentration at the music.\nThe gameplay seems too simple, but trust me, this game is not getting you bored. Beware that you have to use earphone and have good sense of listening. I have played it for a while and I get stuck on level 4! (well, that was my level when this review is written, maybe now I am going at igher level)\nI really recommend this game for you. If you are looking for game that is relaxing and challenging at the same time, good art, and much of music on it, then this game is for you!\n\nPS. Sorry for some grammar errors.

I played Circuits a level or two at a time, just before I went to sleep and really enjoyed the experience. 8/10\n\nPros:\n+ A refreshingly different experience from blowing stuff up or hack n slash. Also surprisingly relaxing.\n+ Designed for headphones, great quality audio with depth and width. Some of the tunes are quite beautiful.\n+ Game mechanics gradually introduced, never overwhelming.\n+ Small indie devs working on a free music composer as an addition to this game. I suspect some people might have even more fun with the composer than the actual game itself. It has huge potential.\n\nCons:\n- Gets a bit repetitive if played in long sessions.\n- Ending is just a one page thank-you note. No victory tune or credit roll or anything.\n- Game difficulty depends on how good your ears are, there are no difficulty settings. I found the first 23 levels very straightforward because each tune can be split into different tracks to isolate individual sounds. The last 2 levels remove this feature to increase the difficulty. Now I like a good challenge and have a decent pair of ears but I found it impossible to pick out some sounds because they were completely masked by other, much louder sounds. I resorted to guessing and using the hint system.\n:(","June 12, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

After playing a good amount of Sequence, this was a perfect follow-up game. This is a FANTASTIC game to play if you want to train/hone your ears for tone/pitch identification, or even just improve your music listening skills.\n\nIf you like circuit-based puzzles, music arrangement (in particular, EDM-style), and reconstructing song beats, you will really love this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are simple, but good - the theme seems to revolve around cell reproduction (as seen in the level titles and accompanying symbols/pictures). The music and sounds - which are central to the gameplay - are very, very good, and recreating a beat is extremely fun to listen to.\n\nThe controls are simple - everything is done with your mouse. The tutorials are very quick and helpful, and new ones are given whenever a new mechanic is introduced. The learning curve ranges from minimal to moderate, primarily depending on your knowledge in musical theory, or at least identifying different notes/chords/pitches. If you play an instrument or dabble in sound/music creation, you should have an easier time with this game. Even for people not well-versed in music, however, there is a layer system that allows you to isolate similar sounds and listen to them separately from the rest of the track - making completion of the levels a lot easier.\n\nFor the achievement junkies, the achievements in Circuits are not too difficult to complete (without walkthroughs), however, the most challenging one is easily the "do not switch layers for any of the levels (except level 3, where it is mandatory)" goal - this requires you to actually LISTEN to each note being played. I spent upwards of fifteen minutes on a level just to get a correct solution. There are not too many levels, however, the game remains reasonably long (except if you are a musical virtuoso).\n\nThe gameplay is really fun and gets progressively more and more challenging. To begin, you are given a circuit track and a bunch of sound nodes. You can play the entire track sample that you need to replicate as many times as you like, and can also jump to any part of the sample (it will show you where in the circuit the track currently is at all times). Next, you must take the nodes you are given and arrange them on the circuit to replicate the sample track. The slots for the nodes are already provided for you, however, you must distinguish which node correctly goes into which slot. Nodes have different colors and initially arranged based on type.\n\nYou can click on each node to play its sound, and you can place them into the background in order to arrange them based on tone/pitch (this is highly recommended).\n\nLater, you will have to do more advanced things like loop different nodes for x times (1-8). Further through the game, you will even have to loop entire sets of nodes. One tricky mechanic you will encounter later is path switching, where different pathways of the circuit are available, however, only specific pathways are correct. Furthermore, when you listen to the sample track, the visual aid of where the circuit is going will NOT tell you which pathway is correct. Overall, the difficulty progression is very well-done, and the game always remains fairly challenging.\n\nWonderful game for people into music, especially if you enjoy mixing/creating arrangements. Definitely check it out if this type of gameplay interests you.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","August 28, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bubs14/recommended/282760/","bubs14","[GWJ!] Bubs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bubs14/","183 products in account","A unique puzzle game, almost like an audible jigsaw puzzle.  You have various snippets of musical elements, and your task is to reconstruct the full track by inserting the elements in the correct order (and later on, establishing if they loop and how many times they loop, or picking the right subtle variation of a particular element out of maybe four or five options).\n\nIt's incredibly challenging, because I don't think I've ever played a game like this.  You REALLY have to listen closely in places, and the final two levels are brutal because you lose your ability to strip out the individual "tracks" of the puzzle.  But it's a fun experience, there's a great feeling when you play your finished solution and you just know from hearing it that you nailed it.\n\nIf I had to complain, it's a tad short (3.1 hours to complete it, not going back for 100% achievements) and there's not good feedback when your solution is incorrect: you listen to it all the way through, it gives the same ending sound and animation whether you got it right or not, and only when the little dialog pops up does it say "you screwed up".  Both are forgivable seeing as it's an indie game with a low price point; not saying this to be derogatory, I think it's a fantastic game regardless.\n\nPlus, you get the soundtrack for free with the game, it helps that the puzzle songs have decent variety and are very earwormy (I would love to hear extended versions of the last song and the song that actually has lyrics in it, I forget the title/track number of the second song).  And with Steam Workshop features coming, I think it will be pretty cool to see what kinds of new puzzles the community comes up with.\n\nIn closing (i.e. - TL;DR), if you like unique, challenging puzzle games and/or have a soft spot for music, get this game.  I dare say you won't be disappointed.  I would love to see a sequel or some additional puzzles available as *gulp* DLC.","October 13, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Circuits is a very challenging game(or at least I thought so) It's fun and it looks nice. There are some things though that I think the game needs to be even better. I like how the difficulty goes up the longer the clip. so instead of having just 25 levels I think it needs a  bit more try aiming for 40 try to go for the ending levels being entire songs. I was a tad dissappointed when I found the OST and they were the clips from the game, in game I thought the devs took a clip from a song and had us recreate it. I understand that maybe thoses were finished songs, but to me they just didn't sound finished or they sounded like they started halfway into a song. I read some other reviews and one caught my eye, a sandbox mode would be reallly great, just use the sounds you have in game and  have the community make some levels and put them in workshop for download. It would add to the game, and would create more replayablility. Also it would be really cool if the devs added a more diverse set of music, all the music sounded the same except for a few songs. I understand that making a game is difficult, and this game is really really cool. I just wish there was more to it. I still reccommend it, I had fun with it and it really challenged me.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good enough to justify the rest of the game.\n\nIf the puzzles had been more varied, it might have been worth it. There are a couple of different gameplay elements, but they don't provide any real variety.\n\nIf the puzzles had been more difficult and complex, it might have been worth it. As it was, they felt less like a challenge and more like an exercise in tedium. Instead of getting difficult, they just got longer.\n\nThe last two puzzles were the most interesting, since the game forces you to figure things out by listening to all of the song layers at once. You have to listen very closely to pick out the parts of the song that are relevant to the pieces you're trying to place. Unfortunately, even here, it became frustrating, simply because some of the sounds were so completely masked by the other sounds that it felt like I had no choice but to guess.\n\nThe idea is very clever! I like the concept of using sound this way. It's just the execution that felt unsatisfying. More meta-modifiers like the loops and repetitions and better use of the control switches so they required more thought about the overall structure of the song rather than just the next sound clip would have helped immensely.","June 30, 2014","false","2.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

If you want it for the music then yea ok this might work for you, but if you are thinking of buying this because it's a "challenging puzzle game" don't waste your money.\nLet me start by saying that the only thing about it that is to do with circuits is the earth symbol at the end of the line. Poor choice of title really, should of gone with something a bit more music orientated. But a poor choice of title is not worth giving a bad review, no.\nThe fact that it boasts "challenging puzzle" makes me laugh. The first 23 levels I completed in the time played were simplistic and easy. You listen to a music strand and match it with the one that sounds the same, thats all it is. Count the repeats and set it to that many... not very puzzling (puzzled = "unable to understand"). The only challenge was trying to decipher the 1 decibel (it's an exaggeration before you start screaming at me) between the multiple choice music strands, which I will admit was challenging but again easy to get around.\nNow the music was ok, the mojority of it i liked however there were bits were I felt like my ears were bleeding and the vocals were crap. I really don't think there should of been any vocals at all.\nThe last 2 levels I didn't complete because their idea of making something more of a challenge or harder is to take out the main game mechanic. Let me explain, in game you have a sytem to choose which type of strand to listen to so you don't get then all mixed together when trying to decipher which one goes where. This gets taken out the game on the last 2 levels so you have to listen to the 3 different types of strands plus the background music and try and make out which one of all these 20 different music strands that sound very similar is the right one to go in that slot. It's a terrible shortcut to making the game harder without much effort.\nAll in all I really don't think anyone should buy this game, short, easy and borring it's not much fun. Luckily I only paid 69p for it and I don't think it was worth that.

I don't claim to do so with any expertise; but there are minor revelations, and then I marvel at the composer's expertise and imagination at  constructing the end result.\n\nCircuits is a puzzle game that peels the curtain back a bit further.  The concept is simple: you are given auditory snippets which you must arrange in the correct manner in order to reproduce a song.  There are up to three layers in a song, and (prior to the last two levels) the game allows you to listen to each layer individually - a fascinating insight into the mind of a composer.\n\nThere are additional puzzle elements - switches, loops, extraneous sound bites - but Circuits introduces each complication gently, and removes them before they overstay their welcome.  This restraint in puzzle design helps ensure that the experience never grows stale.\n\n---- Pbbt ----\n\nOnce upon a time there was a boy who could only make one sound.  No matter what he did - how he shaped his lips or moved his tongue or pressed air through his teeth - that single sound was the only one that would ever emerge.  Which sound was this?  Stick your tongue between your lips, press down, and blow.  Yep, that's the one.\n\nStill, this was not the worst affliction in the world, or so the boy's parents told themselves.  They enrolled the boy in a school for the deaf, where he learned to use his hands to sign his thoughts to others.  It was a hardship of course, but one that the human race at large understood and even sympathized with.  And so the boy grew up into a man who did not dread the greater world.  Instead he faced it with a straight back, a strong heart, and a grin on his face.\n\nUntil the fateful day when he heard the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony (link).  In his mind the voices wove a glittering fabric, rising and falling strands of color and exaltation that created a single Ode to Joy.  The man listened to Beethoven's masterpiece again, and then again, and then again and again, and there was a moment when he realized that he was both lost and in love, and perhaps the two were not so different?  Yes: the man was both lost and in love, and not knowing where he was, there was nowhere else he would rather be.\n\nThat day a path was created for the man, clear and straight and true.  He would become a singer.  Not a great one, of course - the man was not delusional - but perhaps if he studied and trained enough, he would be rewarded with a small place in a great choir.  And then one day his voice would be added to the song he adored.\n\nIt was not to be.\n\nI will spare you the details of the man's tragedy, give you but a clouded view of the moment when the man realized that his body had betrayed him from birth, that his hopes were cobwebs and his dreams but mud.  On that day the man sat alone on a park bench and cried.  He did his best not to, knowing that in doing so he would only bleat out his cursed sound over and over and over again.  But his sorrow was too great; it pounded against the dam of his soul and would not be denied.\n\nThere was laughter.\n\nWho would be so thoughtless?  Who could be so cruel?  The man peeked out from between his fingers with red-rimmed eyes, only to discover a face that was thoughtless, but not cruel.\n\n"Mister," the little girl said, still laughing.  "That's really funny.  Can you do that again?"\n\nThat day the man discovered a new path for himself, a future that would be filled with joyful children.  And, he reflected, was that not an even greater blessing than the one he had originally desired for himself?\n----------------------------\n\nOn a personal note, the music in Circuits - synthesized voices and electronica - does not hold the greatest appeal for me.  What would I prefer?  Something like Mozart's deathbed scene from 'Amadeus' (link) (forward to 2:00 to see his music start coming together); oh, that would be glorious!  And yet the fact that I enjoyed Circuits so much speaks well of its merits as a game.\n\n---- Pbbt (Epilogue) ------\n\nOf course it was not a greater blessing.  The man remained lost and in love.\n\nYet the laughter of children did make him happy, and if it was not the greatest happiness he could imagine - well, those who fly too close to the sun often plummet to their death.\n\nStill, for the rest of the life, the man woke from dreams where he sang to rapturous applause - "O Freunde, nicht diese Töne!  Sondern lasst uns angenehmere anstimmen, und freudenvollere."  When his eyes blinked open, sometimes he would lie silent.  Sometimes he would wipe tears from his eyes.  And sometimes he would smile and grasp the fleeting substance of his dream, using what was left behind to light the shadowed places of his soul.\n----------------------------","April 20, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The goal is to arrange all of the different loops of piano, bass, vocals, strings, beats, etc to match the intended track. As it focuses around the soundtrack, this game boasts an amazing array of songs, all written to be torn apart and mashed together in any number of ways, each one somehow sounding amazing. The design is simple and intuitive, leaving nothing wanting but giving you everything you need. Overall, I definitely recommend this game, but only if you are interested in music or interesting puzzles.

It's a really nice concept for a game and so far I have enjoyed it. Although there are many pros about this game, I have to be fair and talk about the cons. The major downside to this game is that it is far too simple. Yes, the music is lovely and the concept is great, but I just wish there was more of a challenge throughout the game. I flew through the first 20 levels like it was nothing. I give it a strong 8.75/10.

This is for the developers, my english is bad too, excuse that ;)\nWell, you made a great Game, but i recommend to make more levels. Like the First 25 are Stage on and the second stage will have 25 songs again, abit longer than the ones of the first stage.\nAnd in the Third Stage maybe full sounds.\nThe last and Fourth Stage could  be random generated Songs, or like you can do in Audiosurf, search your directorys to find your own songs and then you can play them.\nFurthermore it would be nice, if you could implement some capture device, so you can capture the finished songs, but that´s just the nonplusultra, not necessary XD.\n\nReally good is the idea of diffrent colors, but maybe a new color brings more light into the themes :D.\n\nThe Hints could be made better, mbe adding difficulties, the easier the more help you get.\nAnd at some Songs (i stuck a long time at song 24 and 25 XD) you could implement a "time Bonus", if it takes too long, the player get´s new hints.\n\nA new Tool: not only sort the tones/themes in a song by color, but sort by tone high. I for myself have no problem to listen out what high/deep a tone/theme exactly has, but many of my friends failed due they play not any instruments _:)-.\n\nThe last Thing i have to say:\n\nThis Idea is GREAT.

It was a STEAL. I would have payed double full price for it if that's what it cost. This game is AMAZING. Just a note, while it works best with headphones, speaker also work if you need to use them. The way you play, is you listen to a base track (that you can play back as many times as you want) and then you peice together the song with a bare minimum of it playing underneath. You can choose to listen to only parts of the song at a time (i.e, cutting out all other instruments), but this is the easy way out. If you choose to only listen to the base song, then reconstruct it, it will be very difficult. This is much more easy to play if you have a good musical ear, and is a good way to train your musical ear. It is also super crazy fun. 100000000000000000000/10. Buy. It. Right.

The puzzles are simply amazing, if just a tad difficult. The minimalistic design is pretty well done, fitting the tone of game. The music is amazing, and pretty catchy, though it can get annoying at times due to having to relisten to it over and over in order to solve a puzzle. This happens very few times however. I guess the biggest complaint one can have is the length of only 25 levels, but for $3, it is well worth the price. However, since the main concept it do put pieces of music together, a musically challeneged person might not find enjoyment in this.

It's true, music games hold a special place in my head, in between the headphones which this game even recommends that you use.  Some use music in novel ways that go with the beat and flow.  This one goes in a unique way as well by allowing you to effectively build up music by relying on your own ability not to follow a tempo so much as to hear the notes, keys, etc. and decide where they go.  And you can efficitely create your own piece (there are 25 levels) but to progress you must match up the "correct" circuit layout.  It's extremely organic and very user based as you can turn on and off the different layers of sounds in each level to deal with one set at a time.  If you like music you really should get this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/282760/","dons20","TRU±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","IntroductionCircuits is beautiful game with great asthetics but falls short in terms of actual gameplay. It has a beautiful art style and great sounding music, but unfortunately the finished product is nothing short of underwhelming.\n\nGameplayCircuits appears to be another unique puzzle game. You have to put the right pieces onto the music track in order for it to play correctly. The only guidance you have is a "Play mode" that plays the song in the correct order and you have to listen to it to get it right. I say this with a bit of hesitation because although that's what the developers may have intended, the game is just too slow-paced in order to really utilize it. It really gets boring to have to listen to a track over and over to see what area you might have gotten wrong. Most of the time, the player will find themselves randomly placing tracks, fast-forwarding to see if they got it right and then doing that over and over until they find success. This is the reason I can't recommend this game. It expects you to be super-patient as well as having an ear for music, otherwise you have to just randomly try stuff until they work.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, this type of game does appeal to some people, I understand. However I've seen similar games with better implementations in various categories. Some may have very upbeat music with very distinct sections so that the player can actively listen out for them. Some may have different looking icons for each section. Some may have unique ways of directing the flow of music and so on. This one however, has a fixed track, fixed icons and very little track variations. For the average user I cannot recommend this game for the gameplay.\n\nGraphicsOne thing I absolutely love about the game is the unique visual style. It was bright, smooth and attractive and really gave me a calming feeling whilst playing.\n\nAudioThe sounds were pretty good, however the frustrating style of gameplay meant that I had to fast-forward which also meant that I couldn't hear the music during that.\n\nSummaryThis is not a game for everyone. It will appeal to some, but for others like me who has played games such as Auditorium and a ton of other musically inclined games, this is a weak attempt at entering that market. Pick it up on sale if this appeals to you.\n\n6/10 - Not for the impatient\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The replayability lies mostly in wanting to hear the short songs again but the game is still fun and rewarding.

It took me about 4 hours to get through all 25 puzzles (and I hear talk of DLC or updates on the way, including a song by the person who did super hexagon's soundtrack), plus another hour to get all of the remaining achievements, so compared to a $6 movie for 3 hours of entertainment, or a $60 game for 40-50 hours of play, $3 for 5 hours is a good deal.\n\nCircuits is a musical puzzler game where you have to arrange blocks of music together to match the desired music. It has a very intuitive layout and the mechanics are all very easy to understand, with each new feature being introduced individually so you aren't overwhelmed with everything immediately.\n\nIt is a bit short, but with the achievements (especially golden ear) there's enough incentive to replay the levels, and like I said above, there's supposed to be some new levels and music coming soon.\n\nOverall, this is a neat little game with an interesting concept that I would recommend you pick up if you've got some time to kill and don't mind breaking your bank; I know not everyone can afford not to have their morning cup of coffee.","June 2, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

It's essentially a very simple music sequencer, 25 short pieces of music (chillstep, ambient) with a "stem" that acts as a timeline. You're given a handful of nodes, each containing short musical phrases or snippets of percussion, and you have to put them on the correct placeholders along the stem. You can play the entire piece of music and drag the timeline slider to any point, so it's pretty easy at first to build the song. Later levels get a bit more difficult, with subtle chord differences or slight variations in note timing, and nodes or sequences of nodes that must be allocated a certain amount of repeats, but unless you're tone deaf it's not too difficult. It's a neat concept, the music is worth a listen (the OST is included), and it's probably a fun way of learning the very basics of song composition. The developer has promised some harder levels in the future, as the basic game will take you about 2-3 hours to finish.","April 21, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I enjoy the idea of arranging pieces to form a musical piece i can listen to but i feel like a number of the tones are a bit too harsh on the ears (especially when you consider the game is supposed to be played with headphones). Also, at the beginning, it seemed like you were intending to color code the different pieces of the music, with red as lead and piano, yellow as techno or background and purple as the percussion and rythym. However, this concept isnt held through. The transition between levels is excrutiatingly painful on the eyes, going from a bright white/gray immediately to black, lasting just long enough for your eyes to adjust and then back to bright murdered my eyeholes. If you listen, you can hear breaths being taken at the beginning or end of some non lyrical tracks, which is a little unsettling. Other than that i enjoy the music (just soft enough that the harshness of some tones doesnt scar my hearing) and the puzzles. 6/10","July 10, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's basically a more involved version of Simon, but it works really well, and was surprisingly challenging, especially in the later levels. There are multiple tracks, and some pieces repeat (or some piece groups repeat), and sometimes you have to choose which of multiple tracks is the right one. There are only 25 levels, and a few too many of the early ones are tutorial-focused, so it only took me a little over 2 hours to play through it, but I enjoyed all of it.

It's basically a more involved version of Simon, but it works really well, and was surprisingly challenging, especially in the later levels. There are multiple tracks, and some pieces repeat (or some piece groups repeat), and sometimes you have to choose which of multiple tracks is the right one. There are only 25 levels, and a few too many of the early ones are tutorial-focused, so it only took me a little over 2 hours to play through it, but I enjoyed all of it. If you like light electronica, or symphonic (and a couple that sounded a bit like Tron Legacy's Soundtrack), the music will work for you too. I love most every music-based game I play, and this is a very different and unique one. I only wish there were more levels, or an editor where you could chain loops up and build your own songs.","May 26, 2014","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a nice experience, although short and not too challenging gameplay wise, it's a relaxed casual music game with great music that's enjoyable to listen to.\n\nSadly, it gets boring to listen to the same song over and over while trying to find out what node you were wrong with, and when you finally get it right, you'll just skip the song because you've heard it so many time until that moment of actual victory.\nI think it would've been better if the song were to remain 'bland' (only the nodes you put in, no extra music), and when you actually try to play it (to check if you were correct) it adds all the other layers, to feel some measure of success and progression.\n\nApart from that, having actual parts of music development that don't occur from the nodes you've placed is rather confusing at points and there should at least be a way to disable that while testing out your song (apart from switching between layers).\nAt times it was hard to figure out which node was playing what type of music, and some nodes were mostly too quiet to hear and comprehend which required me to guess and check with the hint tool if I was correct or not.\n\nThe game doesn't really have any replayability, because once you've finished all 25 levels (I think I finished them in about an hour or two), you've heard all the songs and you wouldn't really go back to play those songs again.\nThere should be some sort of difficulty level per song (maybe something like 'easy' 'medium' 'hard') which include more/less nodes according to the difficulty, and more song complexity accordingly. Some sort of rating (according to time or some other measurement of performance) may improve replayability.\n\nLastly, a 'free-creation' mode would've been great, using all the nodes in the game to create your own levels or songs to share, or just to enjoy on your own. That would've changed the game immensly, making it a whole new experience.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty nice game, lacks in a lot of respects, but for $3 it's pretty worth it just to give it a try, and hope the developers will make a 2nd version with some gameplay improvements :P","April 19, 2014","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The user is presented with a circuit diagram and a number of different audio samples which must be placed in the correct spots along with the use of a few different mechanics (repeat, loops, switches) in order to reproduce a 15 to 30 second song. There are 25 levels in total which I was able to finish in about 4 hours.\n\nThe aesthetic of the user interface is spartan which I personally liked. I had mixed feelings about the music. I liked certain parts of each song, but I can only say that I actually liked about 5 out of the 25 songs in their entirety. A lot of the songs make liberal use of the vocoder, which is something that I absolutely detest in any music.

This game offers a new perspective for assembling music, and I think it will help me in this way.\n\nKeep working on it, lads.

This game is a nice simple puzzler that takes some patience but it entirely worth the result.\n\nThe game is about finding the correct piece to fit the music.  You listen to the track and find which sounds fits where.  It does get a bit confusing but not so much that you would rage.  The soundtrack is nice and not overwhelming.  It is a calm game that I would reccomend playing in some spare time if you don't have much.  This game isn't that long so don't expect hundreds of levels, but the 25 levels it does have make it worth the $2.99.  I got this during a Steam Weekend Sale for only $0.74 but I would have spent the full price if I knew what this was.\n\n7/10 - But I'm no professional, just a casual gamer who likes to play.

Noob (Nightmare Lyra)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmarelyre/","406 products in account","As a music producer in training I got interested in trying this game from it's description, however while it's claiming to be a puzzle game about music production Circuits is more like a version of Simon Says where Simon is a robot that mimicks samples of bad EDM songs.\n\nThe game is basically a rather small collection of 25 levels where a timeline is set up, and you have to put in audio samples given to you in the correct spots. Not in a studio-like enviorment as the screenshots make it look like, that is for the song editor where you can make your own premade sample beats if you want, but in a clunky branching line with pre-destined spots where you are allowed to put things.\n\nYou then have to preview the song and figure out which bits fit where in the song, and maybe it's just because I have practice in the actual thing this is based on, but it seems like there is no real challenge or thought to this? All you basically do is painstakingly listen over the song in a unintuitive interface and then drag and drop the right sound clips to win. Not so much a puzzle as much as just making sure to pay attention.\n\nThis might have been able to work somewhat better if it felt rewarding to finish these songs, but honestly I really couldn't stand the songs in this game. Music taste is of course 100% subjecive so take this with a grain of salt, but all the songs I heard before I gave up out of boredom sounded like free pre-made snippets of beats, and it almost seems like the game itself doesn't like it's own soundtrack as it's perfectly fine with letting you skip the song you just constructed to get to the next level, so it makes the tedious effort to make these beats feel like a complete waste of time.\n\nThere is also something to be said about this game about audio production having somewhat bad audio mixing to it. There is no options for changing the volume in game, and the default volume of the game is sometimes so loud the music starts clipping (sounding unintentionally distorted and broken) which makes it rather unpleasant to listen to sometimes.\n\nIf you have a interest in audio production and you have never ever used production or mixing software in your life then sure, this might be an okay way to get into some of the basics of it, especially since it comes bundled with a primitive production software to make beats in as well as the game itself. However I can't recommend this to anybody who have ever interacted with the real deal, this is less the Guitar Hero equivelant of audio production and more like the Power Gig version of it.","January 24","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

The idea of a version of The Talos Principle or Portal geared towards the musically keen was almost too good to be true.\n\nHowever, this game is much less about music; it plays like a "find the 10 differences" puzzle.\n\nWhen you get into the game, you have two basic tools to solve the puzzle. You have the main circuit with blank sockets, upon which you try to "assemble" the piece of music. You also have the master track at the bottom of your screen, upon which the music sockets rest. You can also kind of organize the pieces around the circuit if you would like to group them up before putting them into the puzzle (and you can't even use the entire screen for it).\n\nIdeally, you listen to the master track. You then click on a piece and know where it should go on the board. Once you have all of the pieces, you listen back to compare and then you know if there is any error or not.\n\nWhat actually happens is that the segments of the songs are either a few notes that barely differ or just some strange arbitrary noises. This means that you cannot really analyze it from a musical standpoint and get away with it. Since the differences between the false sockets and the real sockets are so minute, you find yourself trying to jump to the master track and listening to that portion and then directly comparing it while it's still in your ear.\n\nSpeaking of which, navigating the master track is awful. You can kind of correspond with it on a the circuit, but you can't bookmark it and you can't isolate a certain section to concentrate on it.\n\nWhen you go to check the puzzle, you can play it or you can hold the mouse button to "accelerate". This becomes really tedious when you're trying to check for a single error, because you are wasting 15-20 seconds for no reason. There is nothing wrong with a "check song" button.\n\nThe music in the game is really bad. It sounds like a lumped mix of ideas that have almost no order and maybe 2 seconds of thought to them. It's like the Zedd/Skrillex notepad of random ideas that they came up with during lunch and then never thought about again.\n\nThere is also a very minute mechanic of "repeating" a piece, which is quite illogical. In music, phrases/ideas can consist of 4 notes, 2 measures, 4 measures, 8 measures, etc. Sometimes, the same idea is 4x2 measures (4 repeats of the same 2 measures). Early in the game, sometimes that idea is isolated in one segment, and the others might express it as 4 (that you have to repeat twice) or as 2 (which you have to repeat four times). This is not skillful; it is tedious.\n\nAlso, by the time I've finished "writing" the song, I'm sick of hearing it and don't even remember what the entire thing was supposed to sound like. In fact, it's possible to beat the game without listening to a single one of the songs in its entirety.\n\nThe idea is good, but this game is simply not there yet.","April 13, 2015","false","3.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

The game has nothing in relation to Circuits of the electronic variety in any way. There are 25 songs that you spend a great deal of time trying to replicate for the very short length of music. In 3 hours, I'd completed the game. Fortunately not very expensive. In most songs you're allowed to switch 'layers' so you're only hearing for example the melodies or the bass, so you can limit what you're hearing and make it easier to replicate. But the last two songs are the most complex pieces of music in the game, and don't allow you to limit the layers like you've been taught the rest of the game. There are parts in both of the last two levels that are so complex with so many instruments at varying loudness that it is impossible to make out the instruments you're actually trying to replicate. I had no choice but to resort to the 'hint' button for them.","October 19, 2014","false","3.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","2"

While most music games are based primarily around rhythmic timing, Circuits is more based on pitch and tone recognition. This makes for a pretty unique experience. Given that it's a music-based game, having a solid soundtrack is important - thankfully, Circuits delivers on that front with a well-made relaxing atmospheric soundtrack. My biggest critique is the relatively short length.\n\nIf you consider yourself completely tone-deaf, I'd have a hard time recommending this. But if you're looking for a relaxing, musical way to pass by a couple hours, then it's hard to come up with a better recommendation than Circuits.","March 10, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not very long; I beat the whole game in around 3 hours (as you can see). For the most part, it's not that hard, either, unless you're trying to get the "Golden Ear" achievement (which requires you to complete every level without separating the song into individual layers). Speaking of achievements, I managed to get all but three in my first playthrough - and one of those three was an achievement for skipping 5 levels...\n\nThat said, though this game might be short, it is surprisingly challenging in the final few levels; you can't separate the last two levels into layers, so it's all up to your ability to listen carefully and pick out the different layers yourself. Music lovers in particular will almost certainly enjoy this game. (...Though I was not a fan of some of the electronic/dubstep songs.)\n\nIf it's on sale, I'd recommend checking it out. I just wish there were community-made levels or something so I could get more replay value out of it.\n\nEDIT: ...And now, 3 hours later, I've beaten the game again (...well, the first 23 out of 25 levels, at least) and gotten the "Golden Ear" achievement (the other two took about a minute or less each).

Not good, not great, just ok. Being a musician with a good ear it can get tedious fast, the equivalent of fitting different shapes into shaped holes. Still the game has its merits and it works fine.\n\nOther than that, the game is a bit short, but I've read they're working on that with a composer that theorically should expand the game through workshop or some sort.\n\nIf you're a musician you might find this a bit dull, still you might want this in your collection.","December 19, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are tasked with putting together the provided music samples in the correct order to duplicate the target sequence. Some samples may repeat. Some sequences of samples may repeat. You must listen well in order to dicern the difference between some samples. To ease you into the more complicated sequences, you can isolate "layers" which correspond to a voice or instrument. Be the end, you must rely on your ears and wits alone.\n\nThis game is not about contructing popular or recognizable music. It is, however, a thematic study of an original piece. If you do not have much patience or well-tuned ears, you may find this game frustrating. However, if you enjoy music and want to improve your listening skills, I believe you will enjoy this game.","December 22, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music I'd say is ambient/chill electronica and is well composed.  There are a few tricks like loops where you set the number of repeats, and switches that select between similar (but slightly different) sounds, but for the most part it's pretty straightforward.  It does get much harder in the last two puzzles, where you're denied the ability to split the melodies.  The only other game I've played like it is Auditorium, which is more free-form.  Not much replay value, but for $3 it's still well worth the time you'll get out of it.","July 23, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels start off simply with only a few samples per piece but they quicly escalate requiring close attention to sample looping, chord progression and rhythmic subtleties.\nThe game's soundtrack and visual style are both relaxing and exhillarating while offering a task that is simple to learn but takes significant musical understanding to master.\nDefinitely give this game a shot.","July 7, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought I would check it out for a few minutes after adding it to my library today, but instead ended up spending the entire evening playing through it.  Needless to say, my expectations were exceeded on all accounts.\n\nCircuits is an audio puzzle game.  Perhaps not the first in this genre but certainly the best I have ever experienced.  The art design is elegantly simple and the music is amazing.  Good headphones are definitely a plus as the sound is absolutely central to the experience.\n\nThere are currently only 25 levels to the game, and even playing without using any hints or layers options, it still took me a few good hours to get through them all.  The game is as challenging as you’d like it to be.  Even if you are not musically inclined, I would still urge you to give this game a try.  The gameplay is simple, and the optional hints and layers make it accessible for everyone.  The music alone is easily worth the price.\n\nDigital Tentacle is the small indie company that created Circuits.  Not only did they produce a beautifully fun and awesome game, but they are very active on the forums and care a great deal about their product and their fans.  They’ve even added the full soundtrack to the game file for everyone to enjoy, completely free of charge.  I know this has nothing to do with the game (which is already awesome in its own right) but I am very impressed by their commitment and humbleness.\n\nCircuits is ear training at its best.  Even at the full price, the game is a steal.  Go ahead and pick it up today.  I’m certain you will not regret it.","July 9, 2014","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It's not very long; I beat the whole game in around 3 hours (as you can see). For the most part, it's not that hard, either, unless you're trying to get the "Golden Ear" achievement (which requires you to complete every level without separating the song into individual layers). Speaking of achievements, I managed to get all but three in my first playthrough - and one of those three was an achievement for skipping 5 levels...\n\nThat said, though this game might be short, it is surprisingly challenging in the final few levels; you can't separate the last two levels into layers, so it's all up to your ability to listen carefully and pick out the different layers yourself. Music lovers in particular will almost certainly enjoy this game. (...Though I was not a fan of some of the electronic/dubstep songs.)\n\nIf it's on sale, I'd recommend checking it out. I just wish there were community-made levels or something so I could get more replay value out of it.\n\nEDIT: ...And now, 3 hours later, I've beaten the game again (...well, the first 23 out of 25 levels, at least) and gotten the "Golden Ear" achievement (the other two took about a minute or less each).

I enjoyed the music and concept of the game.\n\nNow to list the problem me and a friend had.  It was the randoming of the node placements.  You see, every time you replay a level, the audio nodes at the bottom are randomly shuffled.  Because of this, you cannot make an actual solution guide to the game.  You have to basically listen to everything and begin a trial and error method of solving.  While this seems okay for the first few levels, in later levels, you deal with as many as 16+ nodes, and hearing the same 2-3 seconds gets grating.\n\nI spent nearly an hour trying to solve level 24 because too many of the audio nodes sound too much the same.  I eventually took my headphones off as I just couldn't stand it much more.  I feel that the game should automatically give you hints on what pieces are wrong and/or why its incorrect after you play back a song, as the limited hintings some of the levels give just don't help that greatly.\n\nMy original rating of this game was 90% but I have to drop it down to 60% because I expected the game to be more relaxing, and not hair-pulling frustation.  While you do get the OST with the game, it is kinda difficult to fully recommend the game.  However, the price is pretty good.

So without no further excuses, let's go.!\n\nGAME: In circuits you have to rebuilt a song, the way to do that, is to listen very carefully to the song a couple of times and then listen the parts, that process may be a little hard at the middle to the end of the game cause, you keep receiving more variants of the song, not just more parts to deal with but a hole new noise and stuff you need to re-construct the song.\ntip. don't go trying every piece in every space, you are not going to go anywhere like that, because it gets tough, real challenging, thought out the hole gameand you know experience the game, fell the song, and mostly don't give up.\n\nYOU WILL GET THERE.\n\nTHANKS...","June 16, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Similar to LYNE, Splice, SpaceChem, KAMI, or Perfection., Circuits is polished to perfection, very easy on the eyes, and EXTREMELY easy on the ears. Circuits has one of the best soundtracks of any puzzle game ever, and for good reason: the gameplay revolves around the music. The object of the game is to construct certain songs piece by piece, by listening to the full thing in sequence, and then doing your best to remember what it sounded like. It gets more and more complex as you go, as it has very nice progression. It stays entertaining as it introduces new methods of completing increasingly difficult and complex songs, such as looping certain clips. My only complaint is the difficulty and length: it starts way too easy for the first 10 levels, and then hops up the difficulty quite a bit. But after that it has beautiful progression. It also only took me 85 minutes to complete, but since it's so enjoyable to listen to the music and such a pristine and refreshing experience, the shortness doesn't matter that much; I played through it one and a half more times before I got bored. Also since it only costs $4.99, it's a great deal even for an hour-and-a-half-long game! (especially if you get it on sale) Circuits is a little gem that went unnoticed by most. If you like sleekly designed and simplistic puzzle games and love good, crisp music, then don't hesitate any longer: get Circuits!\n\n8.0/10","June 29, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Low stress, since you can re-listen and re-try the puzzle as many times as needed, but progressively more challenging to get it right the first time.\n\nBut the thing that puts it over the top for awesome is the composer mode.

It's not that it's a bad game, not at all. The videos, images and reviews here, though, make it seem like a title with similar logic with Guitar Hero or Amplitude. It's a "music game" after all, how different can it be? A lot!\n\nThe subtle but huge difference is that in all those titles you take on the role of the "creator" or, at least, "fixer of broken" music: the music doesn't exist until you do your stuff and, hey presto, there it appears - and you feel like the best DJ in the world. Or guitarist. Or something.\n\nCircuits is the polar oposite: they are "action" games, this is a puzzle game. Thus, the player is passive, and you don't "create music": you listen to a pre-existing song, again and again, and try to RE-create it by moving bits of it here and there.\n\nAs I've already written, that doesn't mean that it's a bad game - it's actually a great one. Just keep in mind that difference if you came here searching for your next Rez.","July 18, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The music I'd say is ambient/chill electronica and is well composed.  There are a few tricks like loops where you set the number of repeats, and switches that select between similar (but slightly different) sounds, but for the most part it's pretty straightforward.  It does get much harder in the last two puzzles, where you're denied the ability to split the melodies.  The only other game I've played like it is Auditorium, which is more free-form.

Hopefully this will add more depth to the game, though I am still hoping for something more like rated community levels.

It's quite simple early on but the game throws some nice twists at you to keep you on your toes. The later levels are quite a nice increase in difficulty and will test your abilities to differentiate the notes.

The game is a puzzle game where the player has to be able to listen to parts of a song and be able to distinguish the different parts of the song so that you can build the song.  Now that may not sound so hard, but later on you start getting parts that may have the slightest difference and there may be 4 or 5 of those.  This can get real tricky when you have to listen to the same five parts over and over just to figure out which one is right.  The player is given a row of circles, each circle plays a different track of the song and you have to build the song with the tracks you are given.  If you misplace a track,  when you go to play the song through, it will bring up a message at the end of the song saying wrong and it will have you try again.  There are 25 levels and each have a great song to go along with them.  If you have a keen eye for making music, you can try their very simple Circuits composer which allows you to take all the parts of the songs of the real game and make your own songs out of them.  Overall I really like the songs that you build in the game, most of them are techno and dubstep songs and there are a few piano and and modern orchestral style songs.  I really have no dislikes other than i think they should add more levels and make it so you can post and play your own creations.  I think this game is worth it to try, it is a different type of puzzle game instead of your typical matching, card, crossword, etc. style games.","June 3, 2015","true","76.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After a while i'tll come naturally but thats when it gets tough. The player is tasked with conecting certain points which act as sounds in the beat you have to memorize.

While most music games are based primarily around rhythmic timing, Circuits is more based on pitch and tone recognition. This makes for a pretty unique experience. Given that it's a music-based game, having a solid soundtrack is important - thankfully, Circuits delivers on that front with a well-made relaxing atmospheric soundtrack. My biggest critique is the relatively short length.\n\nIf you consider yourself completely tone-deaf, I'd have a hard time recommending this.

You'd think the point of a game like this would be to split each song up into tracks so that you can reconstruct it on a track-by-track basis. But each "song" is just a succession of disconnected noises, so all you're doing is playing Simon Says: you listen to a sound, and then you find the same sound in your inventory and put it in the slot. Even when you have to "loop" sounds, they're still separated from everything else (and the songs have no rhythm), so this is just a matter of counting how many times the sound repeats and then punching in that number. Furthermore, because the music is all droning electronica, trying to tell the difference between some of the sounds is extremely annoying. And if you're having trouble, the only tool at your disposal is a hint button that tells you which parts you have wrong, rather than something like a mixing board that would actually help you identify the sounds, which is what the game is pretending to be about.

I first saw Circuits on steam greenlight, and thought that the concept would be very enjoyable. The creator went above and beyond my expectations, and the full game is one of my favorites in my lirbrary so far! The music in the game is amazing, the controls are easy to use and enjoyable, the graphics are simple, but they are also beautiful at the same time!\n\nCircuits is played by first listening a song or part of a song, then filling in parts with the short clips that are provided to you. You will fill in parts for beats, bass, piano, synths, and even some vocals parts. If you get stuck on a certain part, you can listen to individual layers (such as one layer for bass, one for synths, and one for vocals) so that you can hear each part in more detail. If you're still stuck, you can also use the hints to show what is wrong, or place one sphere in the correct spot. Once all parts are placed, you can play the song to listen to how your work has turned out!\n\nI would suggest buying this for anyone who is interested in listening to, teaching, or creating music. I enjoy learning and teaching vocal music, and have developed a good ear for hearing and learning parts from it. When I saw this game, I though that this game was perfect for me, because I already could pick out parts easily without switching layers, and continue to play to train my ear even just a bit more! I would highly recommend this game!","February 8","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Initially I didn't think this game would have any real replay value until I saw the Circuits Composer (which I have yet to try).  This game is well worth it's price, even its full price!\n\nUPDATE: I just tried the Circuits Composer, and I was mildly disappointed, as I can't create new levels/circuits — only songs.  Oh well....\n\nTwo of my favorite things combine into one game: music and puzzle games.  Moreover, the devs have done it in such a special way that makes the music a serious part of the learning process.  This game, true to its word, gives valuable insight to the layering process that goes on in musical composition (and even some live performances), and quite frankly, has made me a little less shy about composing my own stuff.  It was perhaps a bit easier for me than most to solve the 25 puzzles in the game since I have a good sense of rhythm, count, and perfect pitch (try me!).  That said, while I recommend this game for anyone, I highly recommend it for anyone interested in or good at music.\n\nMy main complaint with the game though is that at times it is a bit too simplistic.  When I think of "circuits" I think of lots of complex loops and switches.  In this game there are more nodes and dead ends than loops and switches.  But don't let that discourage you from enjoying and assembling the music.\n\nAlso, if you have the game and haven't yet played through it, I challenge you to get the "Golden Ear" achievement on your first playthrough.

Similar to LYNE, Splice, SpaceChem, KAMI, or Perfection., Circuits is polished to perfection, very easy on the eyes, and EXTREMELY easy on the ears. Circuits has one of the best soundtracks of any puzzle game ever, and for good reason: the gameplay revolves around the music. The object of the game is to construct certain songs piece by piece, by listening to the full thing in sequence, and then doing your best to remember what it sounded like. It gets more and more complex as you go, as it has very nice progression. It stays entertaining as it introduces new methods of completing increasingly difficult and complex songs, such as looping certain clips. My only complaint is the difficulty and length: it starts way too easy for the first 10 levels, and then hops up the difficulty quite a bit. But after that it has beautiful progression. It also only took me 85 minutes to complete, but since it's so enjoyable to listen to the music and such a pristine and refreshing experience, the shortness doesn't matter that much; I played through it one and a half more times before I got bored. Also since it only costs $4.99, it's a great deal even for an hour-and-a-half-long game! (especially if you get it on sale) Circuits is a little gem that went unnoticed by most. If you like sleekly designed and simplistic puzzle games and love good, crisp music, then don't hesitate any longer: get Circuits!\n\n8.0/10","June 29, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed the music and concept of the game.\n\nNow to list the problem me and a friend had.  It was the randoming of the node placements.  You see, every time you replay a level, the audio nodes at the bottom are randomly shuffled.  Because of this, you cannot make an actual solution guide to the game.  You have to basically listen to everything and begin a trial and error method of solving.  While this seems okay for the first few levels, in later levels, you deal with as many as 16+ nodes, and hearing the same 2-3 seconds gets grating.\n\nI spent nearly an hour trying to solve level 24 because too many of the audio nodes sound too much the same.  I eventually took my headphones off as I just couldn't stand it much more.  I feel that the game should automatically give you hints on what pieces are wrong and/or why its incorrect after you play back a song, as the limited hintings some of the levels give just don't help that greatly.\n\nMy original rating of this game was 90% but I have to drop it down to 60% because I expected the game to be more relaxing, and not hair-pulling frustation.  While you do get the OST with the game, it is kinda difficult to fully recommend the game.  However, the price is pretty good.

You must compare audio clips to a final version of a song, and sometimes the clips are a 8 seconds long, and the difference between clips doesn't make itself apparent until after halfway into the clip. What should be a fun little puzzle experience becomes time consuming by the nature of audio and having to sit and listen and compare. It is less about challenge and more about patience and investment, and it feels far from rewarding.\n\nIt has a nice visual presentation, but it does little to change the slow, monotonous nature of the puzzles. It would be like having a visual puzzle piece fading in or drawing pixel by pixel then disappearing when you were no longer looking at it, requiring you to simply remember what it looked like. Perhaps there isn't a better way to do it with an audio based puzzle game, but hopefully that shares a bit of info for people looking for information on the game.","August 12, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sounds easy, but it isn't because many pieces are very similar to each other and you need to listen to the various instrumental tracks simultaneously. Thankfully, you can use some hints, like the game indicating where to put a piece or which pieces are wrong. You can also listen to the separate layers, but that prevents you from getting an achievement, and it's disabled in the last levels. But for me the most annoying was to know what pieces you must loop. This isn't a game for everyone, but if you think you'll enjoy a game that tests your hearing capabilities, you probably will. There's also a neat composer integrated with the Steam Workshop. If you wanna try it, on sale is a good deal.","January 31","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Initially I didn't think this game would have any real replay value until I saw the Circuits Composer (which I have yet to try).  This game is well worth it's price, even its full price!\n\nUPDATE: I just tried the Circuits Composer, and I was mildly disappointed, as I can't create new levels/circuits — only songs.  Oh well....\n\nTwo of my favorite things combine into one game: music and puzzle games.  Moreover, the devs have done it in such a special way that makes the music a serious part of the learning process.  This game, true to its word, gives valuable insight to the layering process that goes on in musical composition (and even some live performances), and quite frankly, has made me a little less shy about composing my own stuff.  It was perhaps a bit easier for me than most to solve the 25 puzzles in the game since I have a good sense of rhythm, count, and perfect pitch (try me!).  That said, while I recommend this game for anyone, I highly recommend it for anyone interested in or good at music.\n\nMy main complaint with the game though is that at times it is a bit too simplistic.  When I think of "circuits" I think of lots of complex loops and switches.  In this game there are more nodes and dead ends than loops and switches.  But don't let that discourage you from enjoying and assembling the music.\n\nAlso, if you have the game and haven't yet played through it, I challenge you to get the "Golden Ear" achievement on your first playthrough.

The game is a puzzle game where the player has to be able to listen to parts of a song and be able to distinguish the different parts of the song so that you can build the song.  Now that may not sound so hard, but later on you start getting parts that may have the slightest difference and there may be 4 or 5 of those.  This can get real tricky when you have to listen to the same five parts over and over just to figure out which one is right.  The player is given a row of circles, each circle plays a different track of the song and you have to build the song with the tracks you are given.  If you misplace a track,  when you go to play the song through, it will bring up a message at the end of the song saying wrong and it will have you try again.  There are 25 levels and each have a great song to go along with them.  If you have a keen eye for making music, you can try their very simple Circuits composer which allows you to take all the parts of the songs of the real game and make your own songs out of them.  Overall I really like the songs that you build in the game, most of them are techno and dubstep songs and there are a few piano and and modern orchestral style songs.  I really have no dislikes other than i think they should add more levels and make it so you can post and play your own creations.  I think this game is worth it to try, it is a different type of puzzle game instead of your typical matching, card, crossword, etc. style games.","June 3, 2015","true","76.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But still a pretty interesting game and it's cheap.","July 11, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had been looking for some kind of music game and this one is great. Definitely a good listening exercise! it has really great, simple music, too. Very fun to listen to, and listen to all the different ways it can be... written I guess. I love that they added a composer too. It's so fun to play with. It's like back in the day when I played with garage band. Except the composer isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's super fun. I would have paid like ten bucks for this game! Definitely worth the great price.","July 26, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a game about taking pods of sound and placing them in the appropriate place. Sounds simple, right? Well, then they added repeats and group repeats, adding that little bit of extra challenge to spice things up. Levels 24 and 25 are something, let me tell you that. The music used sounds pretty good (especially 24 and 25) and is something that most people shouldn't have a problem with. The game looks short with only 25 levels, but I did get a good few hours in, and I'm sure people could get more if they don't have as good of ears as I do. All in all, it's a fun little game with a fun concept and a great soundtrack. Definitely would recommend!","April 8","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleshbox/recommended/282760/","fleshbox","FlesHBoX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleshbox/","809 products in account","This is a great little music puzzler!  At first I thought it was way too simple and easy, but things quickly got more complex, and I found myself with my eyes closed, hands cupped around my headphones, concentrating on each little sound I could make out, because I wanted to get things right without using layers or hints.\n\nDefinitely pay attention when it says "Headphones recommended".  I thought that since I had real studio monitors, that I could get by without putting on my cans, but it really helps having everything else shut out.\n\nA warning.  Levels 24 and 25 are seriously difficult, as you have no option to separate layers, and some of the parts are basically inaudible, so you have to pay attention to the harmonics caused by those sounds, or use hints.  I finally gave in on 25 and used a hint, and it revealed that I had a part basically backwards, lol.\n\nThis little gem is definitely worth the price of admission.  I plan on resetting and going back through to work on the last achievement that I am missing... to complete every level without using layers!  Wish me luck!\n\n\nOne last note, you probably want to like music if you want to play this game.","April 9","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
