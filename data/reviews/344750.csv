I'm a sucker for roguelikes (look at my library!) and action-RPGs, and while there were tons of negative reviews, I thought it could still be a gem for me.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe core principle is really, really awesome- you're a mage (at least, you're casting spells at stuff) digging into dungeons and looting them, while killing all sorts of stuff. The loot hunt and action (along with the challenge of permadeath) is what keeps me playing roguelikes, roguelites, etc. I was hoping for a game with all the ridiculous roguelike fun of, say, netHack or ADOM or Crawl or all the other games I used to love- but injected with the adrenaline you get from games like Doom or Call of Duty or even a tough battle in Skyrim. I know it was greedy of me but I wanted my damn cake and I wanted to eat it too.\n\nThe problem is, in just the short amount of time I've played it, this is bar-none the shallowest roguelike I have ever played, and I have played a lot (and to be "shallow" is perhaps the most damning verdict for a roguelike!). While I'm a big fan of accessible games and being able to delve through a dungeon in twenty minutes without six hours of tutorials, there's just no depth here.\n\nTo start, the game just throws you into things with a VERY minimalist "tutorial", which is quite literally just the keymapping. You can do campaign dungeons or random dungeons, as well as access your stash and check out the shopkeeper. These options seem really cool, I like the idea of "fixed" dungeons alongside more random ones for a bigger challenge. The stash seems to be a way to organize the loot you acquire in each dungeon run, which pretty much consists of "crafting reagent A" and "crafting reagent B" in a million combinations to make different items. Crafting is cool. I like making my own items. Moving from the stash to the shopkeeper, we see he sells a bunch of items that come "pre-made" (as opposed to you having to craft them) that you can purchase for gold instead of crafting them. There are various tiers you can purchase, ranging from cheap (250 gold, I amassed slightly more than that in a single level) to expensive (3000 gold). I like this because sometimes RNGesus just doesn't love you and your crafting materials will be just right as to make it so you simply can't make any gear for yourself. The cheap gear gives you paltry 10-ish stat boosts to a few stats (which at level one is still a lot), while the 3000 gold gear will boost all 5 stats by a pretty hefty (30-ish) amount.\n\nThe problem is that all the game stats are meaningless- except Intelligence, I know that Intelligence increases spell damage (after figuring out how to even check out your spells, that took me about fifteen minutes of gameplay). I can assume some stats, but it's really anyone's guess as to what they ACTUALLY do. And every item seems to be basically the same- some numbers go up but things still die in one hit, and you still die in five hits or so from "vanilla" enemies (note: I never actually died, I just got hit a few times so I'm kind of extrapolating that). Because nothing is really explained and the game is so absurdly shallow, there's no joy in making your character better. Your character levels as you kill enemies, but I have no idea what it does in terms of actually increasing your survivability or damage output or anything. Your spells level as you kill enemies with them, but I didn't know what THAT did either until I stumbled upon the page that shows you your spell damage (protip: spells increase in damage by 0.01% per level). There seems to be a healthy number of spells, so maybe they get interesting, but your starting spells are "red", "blue", and "web-ball-thing that stops an enemy's animation for a second". You also have your portal home you can use at any time which is handy in case you think you're going to die (but that will never happen so don't worry). I used the web once. I used the blue a few times. I used the red mostly because I like red more than blue. So that was how I chose how to develop my character.\n\nLuckily it doesn't seem to matter, as enemy AI is so abominable that they might as well be toddlers with blindfolds on. Enemies can stare you right in the face but not move towards you until you "trigger" their AI, which seems to consist of "RUN AT THAT GUY AND HIT HIM". Many enemies I've killed before even triggering this basic AI pattern; some simple patrol AI would really help alleviate this, but enemies just seem to stand there until it's patently obvious you're trying to kill them. I haven't experienced the weird pathing glitches others have had, but I'm not terribly surprised- it seems like they just want to beeline it to you to kill you (or maybe every monster is simply suicidal? That might actually make more sense). The other issue with enemies is that they all seem to be exactly the same with different names- goblins, giant beetles, wolf-things, some other things I can't spell, cave trolls, whatever- they all just die.\n\nAnother big, glaring problem is the interface. For one, there have been multiple times where text has gone off-screen (into oblivion, rendering whatever it was totally unreadable- very apparent in the shop right from the start), or has been chopped off by some other UI element (like the keymaps at the start screen overlapping my character stat page, making a chunk of that completely unreadable, also obvious from the get-go). Things like this are pretty shameful to me as they're so immediately apparent, and they are a HUGE turn-off to a gamer. More UI problems: no stat descriptions, as I detailed before. I have no clue what anything does or means, or how I should gear my character besides "more is better". I have no idea how to customize my character's spells, despite knowing there are multiple and even knowing where they are (I'd imagine this is more than many other players, to be honest, given the clunkiness of the UI). I don't know what leveling up does. I don't know how to actually select my campaign dungeon (it appears to automatically select it for me and I seem unable to re-do the Level 1 campaign dungeon). There's no loot all button, there's no stacking items (since everything is made from some different combination of however-many crafting reagents, you're going to see a lot of duplicate materials). The game does not pause when entering the menu. There is an annoying lag when opening your menu. There is no indicator of what you can and can not interact with or loot (I eventually figured out that enemies that "glowed" gold had loot you could take). It appears no environmental objects can be looted (that is, I haven't found any chests or barrels or other lootable/destructible objects). The biggest complaint, though, is just that NOTHING HAS A DESCRIPTION. Stats have no description. Spells have no description (having "An apprentice level spell" is not a ♥♥♥♥ing description, come on). Enemies have no description\n\nLike many other players, I really wanted to like this. I was hoping for a game that would be a challenge, that would help bring FPS elements into roguelikes, or even just be a more traditional roguelike with a more "action"-y feel (as compared to, say, Legend of Grimrock's weird turn-slash-time-based combat). I wanted to be able to utilize three dimensions to more tactically engage foes. I wanted a stealth system, or at least enemy detection cones/radii. I wanted environment manipulation, traps, interesting skills, difficult enemies, strategic combat, interesting loot, meaningful game systems.\n\nI spent more time on this review than I did playing. Why? I wanted a game and I didn't get one. Even for a dollar, just skip it. Developers shouldn't be allowed to release stuff like this.","May 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 396 of 411 people (96%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","96","396","411","17","1"

You could only 'play' this game for 40 hours if you left it idle in the background to log those hours for a 'review'.  People can hide under the guise of 'Early Access', but there just isn't a core system or mechanics to build off of here.\n\nThen outside of the game lacking any general direction, there is just too much baggage attached to the developer.  I had no clue all of this was going to go down when I stupidly bought this game and made my first review.  It would take a heck of a lot of work for them to dig themselves out of this persona they built for themselves, but who wants to stick around for it when there is so much else going on in the gaming world.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***I'll update my review after some basic patches are deployed.  I don't have time to moderate a review everytime someone posts a link to your past, and I can't update my review if you lock it due to links.  Just take a deep breath and work on your game.***\n\n\nInitial Review:\nI went in blind, and came out a sucker.  I'm all about a jenky indie game that could use some help, but this is one isn't even ready for an early access release.  Overpriced is an understatement.\n\nMy first 5 minutes of game play:\nThe dragon on the opening screen is facing away from you and his wings clip through the title... amazing.\nThe UI is ready to melt your eyeballs.  They picked all the wrong colors and crammed text into all of the wrong places.\nLoads of loot to open but absolutely no indication of why I would care to do it.\nLots of static models are floating and not touching the floor.\nEnemies can just walk through walls, stairs and doors.  I had them clip into the stairs and kill me, couldn't fire back.  This isn't like a one-off thing either, this happens all the time.\nThe UI strikes again.  Clicking on anything in the UI will cause you to fire.\nAbsolutely 0 introduction to the mechanics or idea of the game.  Where is my mana and how do I replenish it?  Why do I want gold? Why are there a billion things to loot and what do they do?\nI leveled a skill up!  What do I need to do about that and where?\nSo basically there is just a lot of confusion and zero excitement.  I can play through a buggy game, but there is just this general lack of vision and core gameplay at the moment.  I wasn't hip to the developer’s history before I jumped in, so I guess I was asking for it.  I might load it up again if the UI gets any sort of love, enemies don't walk through walls and some basic gameplay tool tips are added.\n\n\n0/10 - Feels like an unfinished cash grab.","February 26, 2015","false","0.7"," 513 of 556 people (92%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","92","513","556","22","59"

They came close to making a half decent game and in y opinion this is probably the best game digital homicide has made. Don't get me wrong though it's still a bad game.\n\nLike their other games, they've used unity assets for example here's the rat: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3641\nHere's the trader: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/7934\nand here's the centaur: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/20481\nand here's the bat: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/18044\nBut currently I don't think the dungeon is on the asset store so I'm going to assume that digital homicide actually made the dungeon.\n\nDeadly profits is a first person dungeon crawler game. your goal is to survive ech dungeon which will take maybe 10 mins each and level up your character back at the base. There are a total of 15 dungeons but all of them seem the same except from it hving different turns which is something both the slaughtering grounds and temper tantrum suffered from. When I mentioned the 15 dungeons I was talking about the 15 campaign dungeons. But the thing is the campaign and random dungeon generator both seem to be the same thing. The campaign dosn't have any story except get to the end of the dungeon and fight an incredibly easy boss. rinse and repeat for 15 OTHER DUNGEONS. I think you can see where I'm going with my first complint. The game suffers from something Forsaken Uprising suffered frm it's boring. The attacks that u have have no variation except from a different appearance when you fire them.\n\nThe menus are confusing to go through. One menu goes ontop of the other so u have no idead what half of this stuff says as it's being covered by another menu.\n\nIn my opinion the game starts off way too easy. all creatures start off by being killed with one hit even the big centaur later in the level.\n\nI'm going to give digital homicide a bit of slack with this one as this is currently in my opinion the best game they've made out of the 7.

There is no menu (that i can find) in game to remap controls, no tutorial, no explaination of keys. This is a seriously lackluster way to bring fans into the game, especially something as unforgiving as a rogue-like. If you want to know what to do, you need to go through the control mapping part of the settings window that comes up at launch of the game.\nNot a game-killing issue, there is a lot of promise, but then comes the uglyness of the actual gameplay.\n\nVery little information about what is lootable and what isn't. No explaination of how crafting is done, or where to get crafting items. Some large groups of enemies spawn on Level 1 and make it almost impossible to kill them, without being absolutely wrecked the second you start to shoot at them. On top of  this, enemies are not at all staggared towards the player in the beginning. Storyline or Random Dungeon, both will spawn large amounts of stuff at you and prevent you from getting very far until you put a lot of practice into the level. This is definitely a game that needs some improvement and so far, i'm hoping that the developers will work hard enough to bring us to that point!\n\nThere is a lot of possibilities for this game, especially if players work together with the devs in getting content towards patches and stuff :)\nUntil then though, there is a lot of work needed to make this game better, and hopefully it will come soon.

Props to the guys/gals who made them (I forget the name, but something with P on the Unity Asset Store). And it's kinda nice to see a First-Person-Mage game again. But that's all for the good side of this game.\n\nHonestly, every other part is lacking much or plain bad.\n\nThe dungeon layouts are boring and repeat themselves, you always know where and how many monsters will appear. And it's just on one level, no going up or down. Always the same looking hallways with the same boring rooms with some set number of monsters. That's not good level design. No incentive to explore, well, no possibility to explore anything.\n\nThere is also no challenge whatsoever. Just equip the most recent offense spell and spam it till all the baddies are dead. (Nice animations though, props to the guys/gals, you know...) Most enemies just take one hit and you can fire your spells as soon as the last projectile hit. In the boss fights you can stun the bigger ones and spam your spells - easy win.\n\nCrafting is there, but I honestly don't know if it does anything. Yea, some random number go up and it has probably some influence on how you perform but I couldnt care less. Items are boring and standard and there is not much variety at all, just +22 here or +24 there. No unique stuff, no nothing. Same for the offensive spells, which are just different colored rockets. Hell, you could even swap out the spells for candies and it wouldn't matter one bit.\n\nDefense spells are a little more varied but then there are traps, stuns and summons. Summoned creatures wont have any intelligence and tend to get stuck in walls. But then that fits with the monster AI which is pretty much non-existent. No need for tactics, they'll run into their doom nontheless.\n\nAnd that's it. That's  the game. Gameplay won't change past the first level, monster assets seem to swap bexond level 5 but then it doesnt really matter. Environments stay the same. Menus look cheap, too.\n\nBugs: Yea, there are some of them. You can lose your ability to cast spells which renders you dead. Items randomly disappear and reappear and you cant do anything about it. I didnt run into any crashes so thats good.\n\nThe GUI has some kind of odd behaviour and tends to open to many windows at once which you have to close one after another. You also can't loot all the stuff in a dead body at once so there's unnecessary clicking. Spells have weird descriptions and say something about ingredients which don't exist at all. So, are the descriptions just copied from somewhere else? I don't know and I don't care.\n\nI bought this game for 1 buck and I can't recommend it even for that price. It's just bad. There are lots of games which work waaaaaay better than Deadly Profits and which don't rely on bought Unity assets. (To be clear: This isn't the issue here, it could have been a good game with bought assets, but it isn't.) If you're looking for a first-person dungeon crawler shooter hybrid, stick to Ziggurat or if you don't mind the setting try games like Fancy Skulls, Tower of Guns or even Paranautical Activity. Or play Legend of Grimrock. Yea, you should probably play that.","June 5, 2015","false","1.2"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","35","37","0","0"

On the upside, the developer is still active and trying to improve the game.\n\nOriginal Review Follows:\n\nI know it's early access, and there are some glitches as would be expected BUT it just doesn't play well. Really though, the "deaths" are the most disappointing thing. The game suddenly comes to an abrupt end with a still shot of the logo and some text that informs you that you are dead. Nothing on the screen tells you that you are getting hit, until you look down and see the thin red bar going down. I had an enemy attacking me from behind until the last second I turned around.\nThe game need some hit feedback, or a semi-transparant screen flash, or something you let you know what is happening...and as a bonus, where it's coming from.\n\nAlso the hit markers for enemies attacking you are either off of there is a lag in damage calculation. I was getting hit by a monster (a rat - so no distance attacks here), and then ran and turned around to fire off a spell, and then suddenly the abrupt death screen appeared when the rat was far away.\nThat abrupt death screen and silence is just a mood killer.\n\nI'll try it again in a couple of months...but right now, it's not worth it.","April 29, 2015","false","2.7"," 60 of 79 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","60","79","4","3"

I purchased it  for $5 and would say it's definitely not worth that unless some serious work goes into the game - and honestly I'm not sure that's enough.\n\nQuick rundown:\n\n+ interesting concept, unique gameplay (I don't know any other fps style rogue-like dungeon crawlers)\n+ graphics are acceptable but not amazing\n+ character progression and spells are OK, a little limited but passable especially for early access\n+ crafting is pretty good, easy to use and quite a few craftable items\n\n- very slow loading (at least for me - running a GeForce mobile card with 1 Gb vram though, and started playing on minimal settings to reduce load time...ugh)\n- pretty repetetive and limited gameplay and especially level design\n- mob pathing issues\n- serious gameplay glitches, booted out of dungeons, items missing...have been able to play multiple full dungeons however so...hopefully will be patched relatively soon on that one.\n- **No "loot all" option; be prepared to click A LOT, also inventory/storage management is super clunky and time consuming\n- item drops are quite random; I got enough crafting mats in 1 dungeon for 2 items, then 1 more item in the next, then none (potentially because some items did not remain in inventory after finishing dungeon for some reason)\n\n\n\nThe gameplay is OK, but super repetetive and not at all challenging for a rogue-like.  I've not died once, it's basically shoot, shoot, web, while running backwards.  The only trouble is if you don't get that you must EVERY time you enter a dungeon change your spell from "portal home" (WTF!? that's the default for right mouse?) to the web spell you start with, or if you run into rooms and get mobbed.\n\nOn that note, I've gotten hit multiple times as a door opens before I can even see a mob, not the best design - and there are virtually ALWAYS mobs to the right and left of the door so if you don't go slowly you'll have trouble.   But again, super predictable.  The bosses seem to have serious pathing issues as well; so far I've stood in the entrance room and been apparently unhittable, and then stood on the opposite side of the exit portal, on which the boss got stuck and could no longer move towards me.\n\nAnd this is the real reason for  the (reluctant) thumbs-down.  The load times are quite frankly atrocious, the mobs often "slide" towards me before the running animation starts, and aforementioned pathing issues for bosses just scream poor design, something that is not easy to fix (i.e. will not likely be fixed ever imo).  I hope I'm wrong and if things change I would really love to give this a thumbs up.\n\nAdd to this the fact that, despite not having died (as far as I know - explanation follows) I have twice been booted back to the main screen randomly in a dungeon, with an empty inventory and equipment screen.  Did I die?  I didn't get hit but in both instances it appeared as if I was going to be hit shortly.  My health was over half however, and it was a level 1 dungeon with a level 2 character (and 2 pieces of armor equipped) so should I really be getting 2-shot anyway?  Restarting the game "fixed" the issue and my gear and inventory appeared once again, but a pretty serious bug it seems, even for early access - no?\n\nThe item drop system is also a little frustrating - drops are few and far between and I've picked up things that later did not appear in my inventory.  Also, I can't figure out how long drops are supposed to stay on the ground but I've missed out on at least a few within less than 2 minutes (less than 1 minute in at least one instance) from the mob disappearing, and it's definitely not easy to figure out when or why this happens.  Let's just say try to pick things up like seriously ASAP, unless you'll die trying to do so.   Currently I have multiples of 6 or 7 items and cannot craft anything...definitely suboptimal, but these are the things I can easily overlook in an early access title.  OH - but seriously, no "loot all" button?  This is not a title worthy of developing carpal tunnel from, so I probably won't be playing much until and unless that option is available...\n\nTL:DR buy this game if you really love the concept and you see it on sale.  But beware it is in the early stages, and without some very serious reworking will just not be an enjoyable experience.  I really hope it gets the TLC that the concept deserves, as it could be a lot of fun but frankly it just seems like a fledgling title from an inexperienced developer, and the coding feels really sloppy.  So here's hoping, but I'm not holding my breath either.","May 7, 2015","false","1.4"," 41 of 50 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","41","50","0","1"

I had it on my wish list from a while ago, and saw it on sale for a dollar, so figured I'd give it a buy.  Guess I should have double checked it, despite being on my wish list.  Least I only lost a dollar.\n\nThe game has an interesting concept, an FPS in the style of Doom, but with Roguelike elements.  It fails on delivery though.  Enemies are all basically the same, they just look different.  Perhaps later on they manifest some different traits, but right now they just rush you and die instantly.  The interface is kind of clunky, particularly looting monsters.  Game doesn't pause while you loot, and there is no loot all button, and if you should close the loot without grabbing something, it's gone.  This gives it a very alpha/beta feel.  I know it is just recently out of that stage, but it seems like they did it prematurely.\n\nStats don't seem to do anything, or at least nothing about them is mentioned, other than int increasing your damage.\n\nThe graphics aren't great, but I wasn't expecting that, and they aren't terrible either.  The problem is the sound.  Seems like everything in the dungeon makes noise no matter how close you are.  It's a bit creepy at first to hear all kinds of chittering bugs and such, but eventually it just grows annoying as you can't even remotely rely on sound to locate enemies or warn of them sneaking up on you.  This once again gives it a very unpolished feel.\n\nCan't be too mad about the deficencies for a dollar, but all in all I suggest giving the game a pass unless/until the game gets a few more major overhalls.","May 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","27","30","2","0"

I would even played in it a bit longer... on the touchpad, with total absence of other games on it. It almost as good to be acceptable... probably. But we're talking about PC platform there, and on PC, with all tons of freeware stuff of better quality, and zillion of good games still awaiting when I'll get to them... No, I would not play in Deadly Profits again, and I suggest you to look the other way as well.\n\nBeing as buggy and mindless as all other games from that developer, Deadly Profits at least, provides some tolerable gameplay, a shooting dungeon crawler. I actually liked the feature with guided projectiles: you fire by left click and before releasing the button you control your fireball on its way. Nice thing, really.\n\nSadly, that's about all of good words. Options you see on the title screen are only allowing you to turn off the sounds. That means no controls remapping, no mouse scroll tuning... again (like in the all other projects of that dev team). And if you turned music off from the main screen, you can't turn it back on from the dungeon, until you return from it.\nThe freezes occurs regulary, and they can be quite prolonged - without any chances to fix that. I'm sure it will be freezing even on "IBM Sequoia" or "Cray Titan".\n\nAgain, no intro, not a slightest idea why you should fry all those monsters and crawl all those dungeons, except of grinding... like we have not enough grinding already!\n\nOkay, I summarize: that one game should have stayed on the touchpads to be marked at least as mediocre one. But taking a step on the PC platform... should be punished!\n\n4,65/10 mark: it can be played for an hour or two, if you're stuck in the desert with only that game in the pocket. But I suggest sleep as better option.","September 8, 2015","false","5.2"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","31","37","2","2"

Now think of the worst one of those. This is even worse then that. I saw the game and instantly thought this is going to be bad. It was on sale for a dollar, so I bought it and was right. Terrible animations, terrible sound effects and horrible music. No story line, no real goals and repetitive to an extreme. The enemies are the same, just different magic restitances, which has near no effect on the game. They look a little different, but have the same speed, same hitboxes (I think) and the same attack. The game appears to lack any form of ranged enemies, giving you a huge advantage, being a mage. You contantly run backwards and you cannot be hit. Enemies also have terrible AI. Summoned minions will walk into walls to try and reach targets, and enemies will get stuck on basic walls. The bosses are pathetically easy, assuming your backwards, turning when needed, whilst shooting at them. They won't even hit you once.  Also the 'randomly' generated dungeons are not very good. They randomly genrate the same pattern of: Room, one enterance, one exit, three branches off exit path, with one to the left, one to the right and one straight ahead. The left and right are full of enemies, and is also always a dead end. Also most dead enemies leave a large amount of health on the ground when they die. This will heal any damage you took getting stuck against the initial wall at spawn. The only good thing it has is a few nice textures and the fun of laughing at it. Overall the game feels like a highschool student who knew how to use ms paint but had no idea what they were doing otherwise. Also I'm not sure how this is any positive reviews for this. Especially ones with over two hours of game play... Oh and if you check the developer, he has four games. Two with 75% negative reviews, this with rough 45% negative reviews and another with 55% negative reviews.

What can I say. I am glad I paid 1 Euro for this game.\nA game with some nice features, reminds me of walking around dungeon keeper 2 with the first person spell a little. I would normally not write a review when I had played something for so short a time but with this I want too and I am finding it hard. I want to like this game. It is basically a 3D rouge game. But at least with Rogue you knew why you were there and short of taking the title of the game literal, Deadly profits is a bit... Lacking.\nIt's unpolished and really should not be out of beta. For what the game is and the objective the graphics are ok and the game itself has a nice idea for people who like to grind. Where this game falls flat on its face so hard it rolls over until its standing again only to then fall backwards onto its ♥♥♥ is the execution. It's unoptimised and unfinished with AI that went to the Alien Swarm school of tactics in that charging the player that has been happily one click killing these guys for the better part of half an hour is obviously the best idea.\nBut even that I can for give as swarming may in the end once you get to later levels prove effective.\nSo why can't I approve of this game. Its the optimization that kills it for me. At one point I brought up the steam in game menu and when I closed it again the top and bottom of the menu remained and I was left playing the game through a letterbox frame of the Steam browser. Again it fails on looting, there are little clusters of hearts floating over the dead enemies some times. I assume these heal the player but due to the face I have never once been touched by a monster this is only a guess.\nThere is a box in the middle of the starting screen that gives you a brief outline of the control scheme with most people don't like as it is a cheap and quick way of not having to program a second menu in the options screen, I don't mind too much even if I agree with this assessment, the starting screen where you pick your dungeons is only visited on an odd occasion between battles any way. The problem here is for example "F = loot monster." Fairly straightforward I think you will agree. Get into the game kill everything in sight and turn around to loot.... Spend a few minutes pressing F over every corpse until they start disappearing with no result. Move to next area and repeat. Finally I looted something. While looking at an Orc corpse, I looted a chest....\nThe game immersion is a bust too and that's what really finally kills it for me. It sounds as if the monsters are right next to you even when you and see them skulking a long way off, out of range of even your spells. Now there is no map that I have seen or found so far so what I am hearing could in fact be on the other side of the walls I am standing next to for all I know. But if that's the case then... Yeah I can't even think of a sarcastic comment to compare that one too.\n\nThe list goes on with a thousand tiny and medium level problems with this game. While there are no truly major issues that make the game unplayable, there is just no challenge to it on the whole and nothing you have to think about beyond draw a few enemies, run down a long hallway so they line up one behind the other and then spam fire spell until they go away and finally see if its possible to loot them (Or a chest that for all intensive purposes could be on the other side of the wall for all I know."\nStill if you like one click kills then the first level is for you!\n\nOnce (If) the patches start rolling out I will edit this accordingly. I hope they do because this game has potential and could, if worked on, do what Lichdom failed to do and be an entertaining game.\n","May 30, 2015","false","0.5"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

The atmosphere seems dull, dominated primarily by the constant grunting of a mismatched assortment of ghouls and ghosts. The spells, while upgradeable, appear but clones of one another (minus the abilities), followed by underwhelming visual and sound effects. To top the experience off, the loading times prove abnormally long for such a small game.

A game should have the very obvious bugs worked out before early access, yes? The menus are unusable in game, due to multiple pop-ups during looting. Levelling up is confusing, as it seems to do... nothing? You can view stats but not add to them? I beat the first level, the game ported me into a boss room, I killed the boss and got stuck there. Used my portal skill to get out, but lost my crafting materials I had found.\n\nIn short, this wasn't worth the $5 I spent on sale, definitely not worth $28 right now. I have no idea the direction this game is trying to go, but stick with another $30 buy for the money.\n\nUpdate May 30/2015: Game has been patched, and many of the technical issues I was having were resolved.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, probably not worth $10 right now, but if the developers keep updates coming in, it very well could be. Monster AI is currently the weakest component in the game, but crafting has been made clearer and more functional.

They don't use 3D positioning or if they do it  pretty much spans the whole dungeon. The sounds themselves are nice and a bit scary even, but they are implemented very poorly.\n\nThe monsters themselves have very high quality models, I can tell that the developer bought all of the PROFACTOR models from the Unity Asset Store. That's not a bad thing, those models are good high quality. Again, it's a problem with implementation. The biggest issue is that the monsters that you find in the dungeon are completely random. They all have the same level, it seems that as long as you are their level or higher you one shot everything. I honestly don't even know what happens when you get hit, because it's so easy. But it's sooooo annoying that a Giant Beetle, a Harpy, a Goblin, and a Beholder all attack you (i.e. run towards you) at once. What are they even doing hanging out together in this dungeon. There's just nothing interesting at all about it, no game design, just a bunch of random crap for you to look at.\n\nIn as much as I played there seems to be only one set of dungeon tiles. The maps aren't really very interesting. There's tons of barrels and dungeon trash, but it's all just decoration, can't do anything with it.\n\nThe UI is pretty clunky, I don't even know why there is crafting in this game, and well, I guess to sum it up, this game seems like a kid just learning to program threw this together, not a professional product.\n\nWho knows, maybe it'll keep getting updates.","June 6, 2015","false","0.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

For those who have played or seen The Magic Circle, the "portals" are noticeable copies, if not direct rips, of the life essence pools found in that game in a few locations (the pool sizes and shapes change, though this in particular can be seen from the first or second life essence pool provided to the player in that game)\n\nThere is no combat mechanics outside of "click and hope you don't die" - attempts to skillfully use spells often causes more problems than simply spamming the "spells." The crouching/jumping animations seem to be simply camera movement, and often unnecessary actions.\n\nThe UI is horrendous, under developed, and simply looks rushed to be put together. There is no visual indication of what you've clicked on, or about to click on, the color scheme looks to be that of a 1990s website designed by a then 12-year old who favorites dark colors and certain neon ones and believes them to be good for general user reading. There is no ability to see what items you're picking up, outside of icon, from a looted body and zero way to know what the controls are in-game outside of a minimal UI tutorial or having read the controls before the game has launched.

I wouldn't reccomend getting it if you have to pay much more than that.  Second, I notice a lot of people saying that the game doesn't work.  Although I haven't played it much, I can say that I have not experienced any problems like that.  In terms of content though, there really isn't much there.  It's a very easy game and although there are many different kinds of enemies they are all pretty much the same.  They all use melee and are pretty easy to kill while just backing away from them.  My main problem with this game, however, is that it's just freaking creepy as hell.  The art style in the game and the sounds just make it one of the most horrifying things I've ever played.  To make matters worse the sound is messed up so if you are wearing a headset it always sounds like the monsters are right behind you.  AND even after you kill the monsters they make creepy moaning sounds.  The game itself is horrifying tbh.  And like I said, there really isn't much play time there.  However, if you like rogue likes and you can get it for very cheap it might be worth getting.","June 4, 2015","false","0.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Enemy names don't need to be listed, as everything is just named "Giant [what does it look like]". Enemies should take more than one hit to kill. Hitting F to loot should also get you out of the loot menu when hit again.\n\nOn the other hand, it was 21 cents and I totally got 21 cents worth of fun figuring out its systems.

The sounds are ok but the monster sound effects seem to not vary with distance at all so it always sounds as though they are right on top of you.\n\nThe game fairly often freezes up for seconds at a time; other times you find yourself moving slowly across the floor as if you are stuck on something, although you aren't, and walking down the same corridor again will not be the same.\n\nThe game seems to have quite a large variety of monsters but it throws too many different models at you too fast: they could have introduced them more gradually. Mind you, all the monsters feel the same so it doesn't really matter.\n\nThere's crafting, a shop and an inventory but they made picking stuff up annoying, like you have to go to the green glow on the floor, press a key, then you have to  click each item you want to take and click another button to "loot all godl". Back in the menu screen, putting items into your stash has to be done by clicking an empty stash space and then the item in your inventory once for every single item.\n\nWhen I got bored and exited the game it froze up for a while and then crashed with a stack error. In general I think the programmers' attitude towards memory management is probably similar to the fact that monster corpses never disappear, which can't be good for performance.\n\nAt 90% off the game is worth it, but you could be playing something more fun instead, so why bother?","June 3, 2015","false","0.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Equip is done by right click. Comparison of equipped and new item is missing. Drag and drop would be welcomed.

Simply put, it's either too hard to keep it running correctly, or too hard to lose/die.\n\nFirst of all, about half of the time that I kill a boss, no portal appears, so I have to exit the game, or use the portal spell and lose all my acquired items. Speaking of items, I can't get my tier-3 items to stop duplicating themselves. I don't want 15 pairs of pants. I also keep randomly getting stuck on... nothing, literally. I'll be in the middle of an open space, and suddenly be unable to move. And jumping does not do anything, ever.\n\nAnother, even bigger problem for me, and the main reason that I would not recommend this game, is that magic is too overpowered. Apparently they used to have some form of a mana (item?) system (which it still says the spells cost), but it was removed. Now you can set ten thousand traps, as well as use spells that kill enemies in 1-2 hits. (I entered a 'hard' level, and killed the main boss in 2 quick hits, which might be why the portal often doesn't appear). Also, I am able to stand in the middle of a group of monsters (or by the main boss) for minutes, letting them whail on me, before killing them and drinking the health potions to fully recover.

The trailer makes it seem like it will be a Dungeon Crawl reminiscent of Legends of Grimrock but with the movement ability of an FPS so the jarring one-step-stop that causes me to feel motion sick when playing Grimrock wouldn’t be a problem. I’ve noticed the game doesn’t have the best reviews but for $.94 how bad could it be?\nTLDR Answer: BAD, even for 94 cents.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when I started the game up was the lack of sound on the loading screen, no music, no sounds. Just some crappy drawing with the name of that game. Okay, not a problem, it an indie developer, maybe music while loading isn’t the first thing on your mind. But then after about 3 minutes into the loading screen it starts grunt and groaning, monsters start roaring.\nI’ve now been loading for 3 minutes and 30 seconds mind you, which is weird because my PC can hand Fallout 4 no problem and no other review mentioned super long loading screens. Anyways; 3:30 into loading and the monster noises stop, music starts, and I’m now a dull home screen that gives you options like “Play game” “Delete character” and one other option which I didn’t read but it might as well have said, “A Sweet Merciful Exit”.\nSo I jump into “Play game” and I’m dropped unceremoniously into a HUB with instructions littering the bottom the screen. The whole thing looks hastily done and the layout of everything is odd. But whatever, let’s start the campaign shall we?\nOH GOD THE LOADING SCREEN AGAIN.\nI’m nearly in tears as the loading screen comes up again and monster moans start spewing from my headset. Thankfully this time it stops after only 30 seconds and I’m in a small room littered with boxes as decoration around the walls. It’s dark with very few torches lighting up the area giving you the feeling of a great dungeon crawl. One thing I have noticed is that the monster sounds are still going so I know there has to be some creatures around somewhere.\nSure enough you turn the corner and there are three beasts waiting for you. This game really hasn’t given me a difficulty curve to expect so, crap. Three creatures? And I don’t know what spells I have or if I have to start with a sword, do I have to let them get close to hit them?\nNope. You get Magic Mouse Cursor, er, Magic Arrow. Anyway you point the arrow moves, leaving behind and impressive trail of sparkling flames. So I shoot and it insta-kills the first guy. Okay? Shoot again, insta-kill. Once more, all guys are dead. That was boring.\nNow to spare you a room by room synopsis, I beat the first level in probably 5 minutes. Slaying a ferocious amount of enemy, that all die in 1 hit, and looting from their cold dead corpses in the most awkward placement for loot ever. But I’ll get to the looting in a minute.  How you beat the level is you find a crack in the FAR wall of what is basically a long corridor with off shooting rooms. Once you step through the crack, after yet another loading screen, you’re transported into small room with no explanation what so ever. I thought maybe the second level started and the only way to go back to the HUB was in between games.\nAfter moving forward, you come a LARGE EMPTY room with a portal on the far side. Oh, maybe it’s a boss battle, he’ll spawn in the second I move forward. Yep, just as you step into the room, a large creature just pops into the world. Well okay then, lets shot it until it dies. I feel I should mention that I have not used any spell other than Magic Arrow since I’ve entered the game. So I just click away on mouse one before the monster has any time to move forward and kill it in 5 hits. Well, at least it wasn’t 1.\nNow’s when I notice the odd placement of the loot. When the Ogre falls I notice that for some reason his crotch is glowing. Have all the enemy’s I’ve looted had glowing crotches? Yes, yes they have. So after a childish amount of laughter I loot the corpse and move through the portal. Back in the Hub. Well, maybe that level was like the tutorial level, the second one can be that bad can it? Yes. And so is the third. You are literally play the same thing on loop with the ability to insta-kill EVERYTHING.\n\nIt’s funny that Steam basis it’s rating system off of Recommend or Don’t Recommend because the truth is, yes I do recommend this game; To anyone making games and looking for an example of what NOT to do. Buyer beware, this game is more boring that a Sunday car-ride with Gramma giving you a sermon on your way to church. You’re just going to repeat everything over and over again.\n","January 16","false","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(like it is already)\n\nYou have some abilities, but it's not changing alot, everytime you kill an enemy with that ability, it grants some experience and eventually it will level up and become stronger.\n\nYou can't destroy or interact with objects..

Digital Homicide almost managed to develop an actual game. They failed and one might even ad: Of course they did. But that would be pretty mean.\nBut it is, again, a bunch of assets thrown together without apparently any sense. The gameplay could be decent, if it wasn’t a) repetitive and b) just boring easy. In combination, I can’t stand more than 20 minutes of playing this game before falling asleep. It offers nothing of relevance, which is a pity, because the game could offer some interesting roleplaying and crafting aspects if the presentation wouldn’t be that hideous and that unpractical. Hell, they didn’t even manage to program the options menu right so that the game goes on after you clicked esc and while you try to turn the god-awful sound of this game.\nI tried the game and unlike with the complete catastrophe that the pile of ♥♥♥♥ “Temper Tantrum” was, I was convinced that this could be something. And it is something, it is a true step forward and IF there weren’t that much issues, it could be some good game. Unfortunately, it is just bad gameplay, boring, uninspired and uncreative and overall a huge waste of money and time for both, the developer and the unlucky souls who try this out.\n\nBut then again: We are talking about forum censoring amateurs who consider themselves developers by creating playable asset showcases and putting them on steam.

The opening screen is a CG dragon moving around in an automated pattern behind poorly rendered fire particle effects. To the right were buttons (Start Game, Delete Character, Quit Game), that had no feedback when pressed. Pressing Start Game merely took me to the next screen without any indicated that I had pressed it. The same happened in the next screen. There were several things to press, but all of them just brought up a menu and paused all of the moving animations in the background.\n\nWhen actually playing the game for the first time, I was looking around and getting used to the controls, and I got killed by a monster without even knowing. I was immediately booted out of the dungeon and placed back in the main menu. I tried again and kept my eye out for monsters. I used my mouse button to shoot monsters and killed them all with one attack. All of the monsters take only one attack to die except for the Ogres that take several. The amount of attacks it takes to kill the Ogre is egregious compared to how few it takes to kill the rest. After enemies die, their bodies stay in the dungeon and the player can walk through them. The controls section says that I should be able to loot the monsters using the ‘F’ key, but I could not at all.\n\nAfter fighting some monsters, you level up and get a new spell. However, you can only have access to getting this spell in the main menu. It was very hard to find, but if you click on the wizard to the right, a window pops up with a tab where the player can change their spells. Even though the player does not really need to switch spells because they will all kill the monsters in one hit.\n\nWhen leveling up the player, there are no stat increases. There is just text that pops up on the screen. The player receives a new spell, and at certain levels players can go to different dungeons, but that is it.\n","December 19, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Listed below are some of my observations and what was wrong with the game...\n\n-	The spell menu lists reagents required for their use but it was never implemented so you can use any of the magic as many times as you wish.\n-	The golem you can summon usually ends up continuously running into a wall, getting himself stuck.\n-	When the imp summon attacks an enemy, it keeps attacking over and over again in one spot and won’t move from then on.\n-	The games unstable and crashed a few times.\n-	There was no point in buying equipment from the wizard in your safe haven as the item vanished as soon as I entered a dungeon.\n-	Sometimes the health potions dropped by monsters worked, and sometimes not.\n-	There is no real variety in the dungeons. Furthermore, you never need to search them in any real capacity, as only monsters ever drop loot.\n-	Controls were poor. I sometimes got snagged on nothing and couldn’t move and jumping does nothing…not that there’s any reason to jump.\n-	There are 15 dungeons in the campaign. Nothing happens in beating the last one. You just end up back in the safe haven.\n-	There is no difference in the 15 or so offensive spells that I could see.\n-	Besides intelligence, I don’t know if the other attributes really do anything.\n-	The monsters just run at you and besides certain ones that take a few extra shots, they are all pretty much the same. No monster had a range attack.\n-	Various item glitches like crafting items sometimes disappearing, crafting one item but getting another, item duplication, crafting an item but not getting anything, etc.\n\nThere’s no doubt more that I can’t think of but you get the idea. I think I got this for around .50 to a dollar and it still wasn’t worth it.\n","December 22, 2015","false","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No effort, except to steal certain work from other developers.  Every single card sold nets them at least a penny.  Keep that in mind when buying games on the cheap.

No really. It's so easy that you can beat dungeons that are above your level witout taking a single hit.\n*You one shot all enemies once you've a decent spell levelled. Find your favourite spells and never switch again.\n*The boss aren't a challenge as tehy are dumb as rocks.

Everything reflects light like oil have been poured on it.\n* The animations and interface are not paced with the game's logic. Example: the interface will take up to two seconds to update after you took a hit or something\n* It takes more time to drop the Steam Trading cards than it takes to be tired of the game\n* Some spells look like they were made in ten minutes with basic Unity Engine functions (ex: a sphere that travels forward following the cursor, and stops upon hitting an enemy, freezing the enemy's animation and movement)\n* Spells you cast FOLLOW your CURSOR. Means that if you throw a spell at some enemy and target another enemy, the spell will follow and hit the second enemy, not the first one.\n\nThere are some positive sides however:\n* Made profit selling the trading cards\n* It can be played if you're extremely bored and desesperate\n* ♥♥♥♥ it was only $0.19\n* Sold the cards for $0.24\n* Makes a good horror story to tell at night around a campfire with fellow gamers\n\n20/100\n","October 18, 2015","false","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I wouldn't recommend it, though I don't think it's as bad as many reviews say it is.\n\nThe idea behind it is really neat, but the interface is pretty awful. It doesn't remember the invert mouse setting, so you have to change it every time. The music/sound is basically some delayed thudding of the fireball, plus a bunch of screaming that will make people in your house wonder WTF is going on.\n\nI played some random missions before working out that there was a campaign. I (barely) won my first random mission and then couldn't figure out how to get back, so I quit. Luckily my progress was saved. Second random mission was easier, as I worked out how to use the crafting system. Pretty cool, and it's fairly obvious once you stare at it enough. Click an option, check the bottom and see if you have all the components. That mission ended as soon as I killed the boss. Hmm. Third mission, which was actually my first campaign mission, I realised that a portal appears once you kill the boss and you just walk through it. Aha.\n\nAfter finishing the first mission of the campaign, I went back to the campaign, and the first mission was the only one that was available. Huh.\n\nOh yes, jump is bugged. Most of the time, the screen just kinda stutters. It even did that when I was in the large boss room. It did work once though. Weird bug.\n\nTL;DR: While not terrible, I wouldn't recommend the game too much. It's nice that it's cheap, but it's likely to frustrate people more than entertain them. I think the devs could spend a few hours tidying it up and it would be a MUCH better game.","May 1","false","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is a story mode of sorts yet there is not a single line of story text in this entire game from what I have played. A SINGLE story line text would actually make this game better.\n\nEnemies just run at you around corners blindly. The dev just does not have the experince to make these games good and puts out way too many games.

Boy, was I bored that day. http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/119275-deadly-profits/faqs/72596\n\nIn Deadly Profits you are an unnamed wizard that goes into dungeons for....profit?\n\nYou start the game at an inn, where you can buy, sell, craft, and store equipment. Already we get a bug: Equipping items in this screen will not allow them to be used in dungeons.\n\nYou can venture into the dungeon via two methods: Campaign or Random Dungeon. With Random Dungeon, you can choose a dungeon with monsters harder or easier for your character level. Campaign gives you a "campaign" of dungeons. It's a waste of time to do the campaign, since the levels there are not based on your level, meaning you could go through a campaign level and fight really weak monsters and get useless items. You get nothing for completing the campaign.\n\nThe dungeons are created with preset designs, which are basically three types of rooms: large square rooms, corners, and intersections which have long halls on the sides. The dungeons are packed with random enemies, and random is definitely the word. They were simply taken from a bunch of Unity assets and thrown in.\n\nSometimes your equipment will randomly disappear while in the dungeon, which may cripple you. You gain levels by defeating monsters, and sometimes their bodies will linger so that you can pick up items. At certain levels you will gain spells, which can be placed in four spell slots. Many of these spells, such as traps, as completely worthless. They take way too long to set up, and you could have already defeated the monsters long before the trap is set up.\n\nThe dungeon is overpacked with monsters; long hallways will have so many monsters that when you activate them, you hear a loud screech from all their battle cries at once. At the end of the dungeon, you will fight a boss, which is always a pushover. Sometimes the boss will drop the equipment that randomly disappeared from your inventory, which is nice to get back. After the dungeon, it's back to the inn for you. When you get back to the inn, you may notice some of your items will randomly disappear. Thanks, Deadly Profits!\n\nNow you get to repeat this again, or what you will probably do is exit the game.","March 22","false","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

There's not a story here: you teleport into the dungeon, you kill everything that moves, you teleport back to the shop.\nThe looting can be a problem: often you need to move around a dead body until you get the right angle and when you close the looting window the cursor will sometimes be stuck, and since the cursor is the only way to rotate your character and to aim that means you need to reopen the inventory and close until it fixes.\nAlso in 2 out of 4 dungeons I went into, when I got out my inventory was nearly empty, and I had just picked quite a few items.\nOther inventory bugs seem to be comon: my character is wearing a pair of gloves on the helmet slot for a while now...the gloves just decided to stay there instead of the hands and a couple of times when I oppened my inventory, my character was totally naked and it should have like 4 or 5 items on.\nAlso you pick up gold on the dungeons that you can use to buy equipment but there is no way to know how much gold you've got. You can try to buy an item and if you got enough gold you will get it or if you don't it will just say you haven't got enough money.\nAlso there are two modes: Random dungeons where you choose to get an easy (1 lvl below your charater), normal (same lvl as the character) or hard (1 lvl above) dungeon, and that kinda works (even if the dungeons look all the same with the same enemies just slightly weaker); and the campaign mode where you should folow an order of dungeons with increasing lvl, which I managed to finish the first dungeon twice and can't get to any other, it just says I need to do the first one and won't let me go to the second.\nThe game says you should head back to town if your health is low but even when I tried my health never went bellow half the total.\nAlso the dungeons are a low graphic stone textured series of corridors in brown with golden details while most of the enemies are brown with gold and black details. As I said they all look the same, all just like this.\n\nSo this is an extra easy, ugly, boring and glitchy game.\n\nEdit: and even if the esc menu has the option to turn off the music, it stays on unless you turn of the sound. The sounds should help you know where the enemies are but since you keep on hearing spiders and other monsters from way too far, there's not really much point. You still have no idea how far they are.","May 2","false","2.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadstanley/recommended/344750/","deadstanley","DeadStanley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadstanley/","142 products in account","I bought this title out of morbid curiosity. Having seen it for sale at 50 cents, and with all the negative reviews, I decided to go ahead and give it a shot with zero expectations at any positive experience. Conceptually, I like what the game tries to do though it does fall short in many ways. Overall I think it was a positive experience and would recommend it, but not at full price.\n\nThere is no story provided. You don't know why you're there or what it is you're trying to accomplish. While there is a Campaign Mode, it doesn't do anything to resolve the lack of information. What you quickly discover is that you are to enter a multitude of dungeons, kill anything that moves, collect random loot drops, and proceed to a boss encounter. Afterwards you are brought back to "town" where you can interact with a merchant before disembarking once more.\n\nEach dungeon is essentially a randomly generated "maze", though upon playing would be hard pressed to believe it. You literally can not get lost in these dungeons as any path that strays will come to an immediate dead end. Since the layout of the dungeons is so linear, you'll find that the length of each dungeon is short. You should be able to get through one within 5 minutes (sooner if you choose not to defeat all of the enemies). The campaign has only 15 dungeons. You can replay them or go into random mode, but if you do the math, you'll find the game will be finished rather quickly.\n\nThe enemies you encounter all employ melee attacks, and all of your own attacks are ranged, so there's little room for strategy and you'll find that you can just spam your offensive spells while walking backward to succeed. As you gain experience levels you will unlock more spells, which come as either offensive or defensive. In theory this offers a nice variety as you progress, though in reality all offensive spells behave the same way in that they are single projectiles. The defensive spells offer a bit more variety in that you can choose from stuns, shields, or minions to use.\n\nAny loot you acquire during your dungeon run is strictly a reagent that is used in crafting or as a means of sale for gold. The crafting feature is nice, and each type of gear you can craft comes in two varieties which you can choose between with small favors given to one stat over another. There are three tiers of gear that you craft, where each successive tier provides a major upgrade to your stats from the previous tier. This is a good motivating factor to press on with the game as better reagents become available and you progress, offering you a change to craft better equipment. If crafting isn't your thing you can sell the reagents for gold and purchase gear from the merchant instead.\n\nThere's no denying that "Deadly Profits" suffers from plenty of technical issues and bugs. The game feels very incomplete in that the game mechanics you are introduced to are very shallow. If you can keep an open mind and look past these issues you may find that it is somewhat enjoyable for the price paid, though that price should be in a magnitude of cents, not dollars.","January 18","true","4.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

And I have always given up during the first few dungeon sections. I thought it was nothing more than a boring dungeon crawler and I just couldn't keep myself interested at all. But now, almost 11 minutes after its initial release, I suddenly decided that it's the right time to give it another chance.\n\nAnd after finishing it I don't regret a single minute.\n\nIt's true, let's face it. The game only truly starts after you get away from that mage shop, and then... Pure awesomeness commences. It's so fantastically designed that the magic fights never feel boring, there's one action after another, every single location is filled with its own unique atmosphere and while the story isn't the most creative or breathtaking one, the game more than makes up for it with everything else. It feels so great to play, and you've gotta play it yourself to really understand.\n\nApplause to Digital Homicide and a slap in my face for not playing this masterpiece earlier.

Pick up the loot and sell them to a vendor named Archimedes to obtain an armory of mythical proportions.

Where to begin...\n\nThe UI. It really needs a major overhual. It's really hard to find information when you're looking in the shop, crafting, and stash. I still have not been able to figure out how to move items to the Stash.\n\nGraphics, are fairly good, if a bit repetitive. Which can lead to confusion and getting lost fairly easily.\n\nDungeons are indeed random, Well as random as can be. Mostly tunnels with little varity to the level in terms of decoration uniqueness. Even "Dungeons Steam Edition" Had alot more decorations to play with.\n\nCould be better balanced in terms of loot drops, and gold drops, this way you're not having to continuely sell off crafting matierals, to buy items, or repeatedly play the same dungeon level over to keep getting more materials.\n\nRPG aspect could be better. Such as being able to use stat points to enhance your characters attributes. Get rid of spell components. They are unless to have if you're also using Mana to cast said spells.\n\nDungeon level progression. The higher and more difficult the level the more gold drops, and the more rare the loot is. Bosses should drop quite a bit of common items, and at least one rare tiem, as well as 100+ gold starting, and increase per level. Not kill a boss, and Hey only get 10 gold. -.- Even in DnD, My players got decent rewards.\n\nOverall it's a Okay game, and I'm glad to see that the developer has not stopped updating it.

If you're bored and just want something easy and mindless, and if the game is on sale for like 19 cents, I say go for it.","August 26, 2015","true","7.7"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","11","1","9","2","0"

You can say it adds to the ambiance because you always think there is a monster nearby.\n\nTo avoid any problem with the AI rushing you in straight line, the monsters can go through most objects except walls it seems.\n\nCollisions are kinda strange too, when there is a dead monster on the ground, you can go through it, but you're slowed down sometimes, and sometimes not. And sometimes you're slowed down even when there is no corpse, like, you're stuck in the collision of the object against the wall 1m from you or something.\n\nCrafting is simple, just select a Tier, a piece of equipment, and the game tells you if you have the 4 components required or not.\n\nTook me a while to understand how to koot : you can only loot mobs with a yellow glowing orb.

I've been playing it almost daily, just because it's a very nice, casual game that I can play with for a few minutes, without having to take notes or remember what I was doing in order to pick it up later. I played the original Rogue, back in the day, and this is probably the closest thing I've ever seen to an actual "Rogue-like" game. Even as an early access title, it's fun and addictive, if somewhat mindless at this stage. The controls can be remapped on the pre-title screen (that is, the box that pops up before the title screen) and after I switched the "use" (originally the "F" key) to my middle mouse button, it's all good. I look forward to whatever the developer decides to do in the future.\n\nPS To those complaining about getting mobbed and dying all the time, keep Energy Web bound to your right mouse button, and spam the spell as soon as you get close enough to open a door. Back up while firing your offensive spell, and occasionally hit the baddies with Web again every so often. I've gotten through huge mobs without dying using this method. Also, MAKE SURE you clear the room before turning to loot anything - keep your back to the wall otherwise, just like you'd do in any other game when you're trying to be sneaky.","May 9, 2015","true","17.5"," 8 of 45 people (18%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","18","8","45","2","0"

It's a little dungeon scrawler and that's it!\n\nPro:\n- On my little test it doesn't crash anytime\n- Generated dungeons\n- Dungeon scroller basics\n- Simple Controlls (Ingame)\n- The dev is active working (patchs and so on)\n\nCon:\n- Different enemys with only different hp (I didn't see any range enemys or enemy casts)\n- The difficulty is absolutly low, it feels much to easy (and I played on "hard" random dungeons)\n\n- It doesn't feel finished, I missed so many features like a "Loot-All" Button and noticed things like:\n-> The first (and maybe all) of your abillity cooldowns are fixed on there lifetime. This means: if you hit a target instant, you will have no cd on your abillity and if you missed your target you will wait a few seconds. Why no fixed cd?\n-> The abillity sounds are just audio samples, which will get finished, when the audio loop is finished, not when it hit the target (only some hours scripting would fix it).\n-> It has a very quick playstyle, but you still need to stop every time to loot the monsters, which counteract the quick playstyle (unfortunately).\n-> Boss enemys haven't a fixed bossloot (XP isn't enough reward for a player...)\n\n\nPro/Con:\n- The menu is fiddly oldschool, someone will like it, some other will hate it\n- The first abillitys wasn't spectacular, but there are a lot more and I don't know how this would be.\n- The abillitys follows your screen center like a controllable rocket in some shooter, it feels unfinished (sometimes it seems, that some abillitys were flying back, which feels illogical) but a nice idea!\n\nConclusion:\nIn sale for 1-5€ absolutly ok, but for whole 10€ it needs more then generated dungeons and some dungeon scrawler basics. There are so many awesome indie games out there for 10€ or less, which has more potential and content as this game in current state. I don't know why it isn't anymore in early access. It still needs time and work.

Simplistic, but fun. there are a few things that need working on.\n\n1. The controls need some work. I find myself being able to walk fine one minute then it's like I'm walking through glue for no reason. The mouse is way too sensitive even though I have it turned almost all the way down and my mouse's settings seem to have no effect, either.\n\n2. The game should have environmental loot and the ability to break vases(with a possibility of loot in them). There's so much laying around in the dungeons, but why? You can't collect any of it. That's part of the fun of dungeon delving is looting the dungeons and the beasties.\n\n3. Possibilty of being able to use the weapons you actually craft. I understand this seems to be a spell casting, dungeon delving game, but you're crafting weapons but not really using them. Maybe instead of weapons, you craft books or relics to carry along with you.\n\nOver all, I find this a fun game. The graphics are great, over all the game play is fun and I can see myself playing this for some time to come. Short dungeons help make it not something I feel like I have to stick with for a while if I only have 15 or 20 minutes to play, but the campaign helps you feel it's a long lasting game.","May 30, 2015","true","1.2"," 2 of 31 people (6%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","6","2","31","2","0"

Not a finished product yet, but it's fun. It feels like a modern day rogue, meaning I don't expect to live for very long and very pleased when I do. Then I get grumpy because I die at a higher level and I have to start all over again. But that's rogue. Recommended for gamers who don't mind a difficult challenge.","May 9, 2015","true","2.7"," 7 of 44 people (16%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","16","7","44","0","0"

They need more Randomization of dungeons.\n\nThe windows in the UI are buggy, cant move them , and they interfere with each other sometimes.\n\nThe campaign wont allow me to do anything but the level 1 dungeon for some reason I cant click and change to the higher level ones.\n\nThe looting is kinda buggy , many containers that are meant to be looted barrels mainly either dont glow or you cant loot them and they do glow.\n\nPros:\n\nThe game is great at this stage, if they keep listneing to the community and deal Dungeon Crawler veterans they will have one hell of a winner here.\n\nGreat Combat if you understand Dungeon Crawlers.\n\nReally good leveling system.\n\nGold is hard to get which is good, but on the bad side of this there is nothing good to buy in the shop so gold is kinda usless right now.","April 30, 2015","true","4.0"," 20 of 77 people (26%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","26","20","77","4","0"
