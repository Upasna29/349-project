Just don't even bother. Simple as that. Here is why...\nIt is broken. The mouse controls are just down right broken. I could only continue playing this because I have an xbox controller to plug in. Even then this game is barely playable. The physics...who programed these physics, they make no sense. Was no effort put into making this? When you roll down a hill, hit another hill GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY, you somehow gain speed and keep going up. This can be level breaking in some levels in which you have to stop or you will fall off.\nThe first chapter has 30 levels and the second chapter has 9. Did they forget how to count? Why the sudden change? I am still trying to finish the game 100% and so I do not know how many levels are in the final third "Event" but at this rate it should be around 3. It seems that as the game development progressed the just completely gave up. Speaking of giving up on design, there are a few levels that made me laugh. Some are so badly designed... but 2-8 comes to mind. Which is it devs: slow down the hill OR avoid bolders. You can barely do both. Not to mention that gem at the start of the track makes me laugh. Really a gem under the track? Was there a misclick when level editing? If you slow down to get it (it just randomly gets absorbed up the drivers ♥♥♥ if you are slow enough) or flip over to get it, with your clipping head, you will not make it down the first hill. Which is the first obstacle of the level. Why not shift over that track under the first hill a bit to the right? You can barely land on it. If you slow down to do that you will get hit by the boulders, which are btw REALLY closed together in drop time. Ugh. *Facepalms*\nThe ♥♥♥♥ing gems. Half my playtime is me idling as I rub my temples and breathe in and out slowly, and me redoing levels because the hitbox radius on the vehicle is ♥♥♥♥ing broken.  I have literally passed over collectable gems, they have entered my pixelated body, and then they have quickly shot out of my ♥♥♥ for no apparent reason. This can cause you to redo levels just because a gem decided that this day wasn't its day to be collected.\nThe art. Is it art? I am getting a bit sick of pixelated games on steam. Some are really well done and beautifuly made. Most aren't. And it is starting to get to me. This is 2014 there is no need to pixelate your game to make it seem retro. Specially if you are awful at pixel art. This game looks like mario had too much to drink and then vomited. The devs then took his pixelated puke and used that as art. The colors and contrast are bad. there is no sense of a color palette. Every pixel just blends in together and it is very hard to focus on things. There is no form of siloutte on the player, course, and the background. It looks like a free flash game on Newgrounds that gets maximum 2/5 stars. The UI is pretty funny. When I tell you that a word is greyed out, you would think that means locked or unclickable right? Nope grey words are the main thigns you click on. White words are...I am not even sure. Just info and random words on the side. It took me a while to know what was going on with the UI because there is so much going on in the background that all the pixels just kind of blend together. The MAIN menu is simple but everythign beyond that is laughably bad.\nSpeaking of the main menu, just sit there and watch. The main menu tells you how bad this game is. Watch the drivers. 9/10 don't make it over the fist gap. When they don't even put effort into a simple track in the main menu, you should get an idea of what is to come in the actual levels.\nAnyway I could honestly go on and on about how awful this game is. And in case you are wondering I am only finishing it and playing it because I enjoy finishing bad games and the achievements are fairly easy. I will say that the amount of customization on the driver IS nice but the pixel art, once again, is so god awful that there is no sense of visual satisfaction when you change your driver and cart gear.\nThe amount of customization and the gem bank mechanic where collectables turn into usable money is pretty good. But everything else sucks. Therefore my final thoughts are: This game is broken, ugly, and not fun. Don't bother.\n2/10","December 25, 2014","false","17.7"," 53 of 64 people (83%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","83","53","64","11","3"

A games quality shouldn't be a factor on whether it should be available on a store or not. Ignoring that BS... here's the truth;\n\nThe game itself doesn't really have enough depth or skill factor for me to really enjoy it. I can deal with the shoddy graphics, and horrid pixelisation, but the gameplay just isn't there for me. You basically roll a cart down a hill, and apply the brakes when needed. Not very complex, but not very fun either. Sure, the later levels have an element of balancing, wheelies and maybe even a "be the right speed at the right time" element to it. But still... nothing really grabbed me and made me enjoy it. I think its main flaw, is that I was half expecting the camera to zoom out and see the whole track so I can plan a bit more - you're given a preview - but being able to see more than a few meters in front of you would be a much better option.  Basically there are games like LineRider that are similar and, at least to me, are a lot more fun.\n\nBut a gigantic flaw the game has, is it being unoptimised as hell. Yes, this seems to be a mobile game made for PC (which I have no problem what-so-ever with normally). Kudos for attempting to add controller support, but it's all over the place - menu's are confusing, and don't seem to improve on either mouse/keyboard or joypad. Perhaps customisable option in game would soften the blow a little, but half the time its hard to see what you're supposed to be clicking on, and the other half its awkward "swipe" controls. Fullscreen mode seems to match the height of your screen instead of the width, meaning it cuts off the left and right of the screen if you're not on a decent widescreen ratio (Sure, playing in a window prevents some of this, but I prefer fullscreen with black borders if necessary).\n\nAll in all, its one of the few games where it's been really easy to say that I wouldn't recommend it. Unless the game is given a big overhall via updates, then I think my opinion will stay that way. I wish the devs the best of luck, none the less.","May 10, 2014","false","2.0"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","33","46","2","3"

Not diseased in a metaphorical way but diseased as in, this game actually went and swum into an underwater druggie hangout and took one of the needles and injected it into himself, giving him hepatitus C (or hepatitus Sea for that matter).

It's a simplistic, both in controls, graphics, and physics, racing game which will likely frustrate you early on either getting stuck on the scenery or racing to your doom off the track.  While some would say this "challenges" the player, more often than not it actually just seems like misplacement of world objects -- resulting in a too close overhead that will immediately deaden forward momentum or an unavoidable seesaw that will lower to bar progress.  I'm sure that if playing this on a phone people would continue to play just to beat the frustrating levels once, but I can't see myself doing it on the PC.  It seems like it needs a fair bit more polish.\n\nAlthough the level editor seems clunky, perhaps user-devised levels once Steam Workshop is in place will elevate the game?","May 9, 2014","false","1.2"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vankier/recommended/295930/","Vankier","Vankier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vankier/","470 products in account","First of all, this game is a phone port, or something with a touch screen.\nIt's an indie game, don't expect an over the top product.\n\nAnyway, there's quite a few pros and cons with this game, and I actually found it to be a fun little time waster. It isn't a game I would buy at full price, but if you can get it with a discount it's worth the money\n\nIn total, I'd give about a 6/10 as far as indie games go.\n\nPros:\nSteam cards (If you grab it in a sale, you make money, everyone loves money)\n\nThe cards are worth more than I expected\n\nLeaderboard, to try to beat the scores of other players\n\nA level creator, which I always find to be a neat feature\n\nThe physics actually work, I've seen those go straight to hell in other games\n\nThe game is actually enjoyable, if you've got a taste for these type of things\n\nIt's actually NOT a horrible port, the controls work once you understand them, and if you don't want to use your mouse?\n\nBAM we have full controller support, which does complement the game much better than the mouse. (Except the\ncontrols went a little haywire but I'll get to that in a moment.)\n\nThe game increases in difficulty really quickly, this can be a pro or a con depending on what you like in a game, if you're seeking a nice, relaxing physics racer where you don't have to think much, this isn't for you.\n\n\nCons:\n\nThe mouse can stop working entirely in the menu, and there's nothing you can do but spam click and hope it works.\n\nThe game can be a little confusing at times, but that comes with the territory.\n\n(This is nitpicking and didn't lose any points in my book) But at times it'll tell you to tap the screen, instead of use the mouse, which I'm sure is left over from the mobile version.\n\nEnglish is the only supported language, which makes it difficult for players who speak other languages. (But a lot of games are like that, so again I'm nitpicking)\n\n\nAll in all, the pros outweigh the cons in my eyes, making this game not nearly as horrible as people say. If you're up for a physics racer with a high difficulty, this is the game for you.","January 19, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's essentially a 2D physics game that gives you one opportunity to accelerate, after which you can only break. Using these options you must navigate some rather bizarre track situations while stopping at the end without falling off the track at any point.\n\nThe only problem with it is that it suffers from the fact that it's obviously a "port" (or perhaps just build) of a game designed for mobile touch screen platforms. I feel like it could really use some sort of adaptation for playing it with the mouse (or other non-touchscreen controls).\n\nNote: I got this in a game bundle. I'm not sure I'd pay more than $1 for it, even though I'd say it's pretty good for what it is.","July 16, 2014","true","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I played it on XBox pc gamepad cause keyboard/mouse is unplayable. Bad physics, horrible control system, bad navigation in menus, pixels that hurt, twitchy rails and lousy concept. So you accelerate for a small portion of a track and then spend the rest of time braking, doing wheelies and using other boosts - but you either need to try to get the gold medal (speed) or gem (for collecting all the gems). And all of that just to buy/get vanity stuff - helms, carts and wheels.

I almost got to the end of this game until I got to the levels that were in hell, and it's a good location for them because they are hell to play. This has easily been the most frustrating game I have ever played. The controls are awful. It's called swipecart, everything requires you to swipe. Thats great for a touchscreen but not a mouse, especially when two abilities use pretty much the same swipe direction. There's also no need for skill in this game. You pretty much swipe at the beginning of the level and then pray that you're gonna end up in the right place. 2/10 - one of the worst games I have played.","April 26","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
