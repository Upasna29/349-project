I thought this game could not get any better then it showed me its seamless matchmaking system to get into a competative game. It would be great with freinds but I lost all my freinds in the time I was playing this game.

Trust me, that actually was part of our basic training, they are just too pro for me.\n\nAlthough it is offered at steam our Scientist team lead by very talented Doges (it is hard to find good quality Fox personal nowadays) has found out that you can actually get the 1.8 release of  Gumboy at CNET download legaly FOR FREE.\n(source: Gumboytournament.com)\n\nIt is said that their Headquarter is in the Szech Republic and that their only connection to the glorious Fox connection (and no, we do not own Fox TV) does not work for anybody and that the named server probably is almost down.\nBut thanks for everything there is a Campset orderable for free to set up your own Military Base (server).\n\nThe commentator of the Game is none other than the famous superstar Squeeky Mc Squeek, also known for one of the voice actors from the Chipmunks Series and many many other quality internet videos.\nRumours say, that you can gather the all mighty power of his voice by inhaling Helium. And no: That is not how we Foxes sound.\n\nOne of our researchers has also made a small visit to the culture of the Gumboys\nIt appears that they like to race against each other who gets the fasted amount of Diamonds and can sell those for 50,100 and 200 Fox$ers to our intergalactic Organisation.\nWhen they  shall not do so, they try to steal the Flagg of their other Nation and bring it to their own Flag.\nApparently they do not like each other and have always to show which is the best Nation.\n\nThe Gumboys got named one of the most fabulous Creatures 2006 by the russian dancing men organisation "Gametunnel".\nWe blame the capitalist pig!","August 25, 2014","true","1.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

You're a gumboy, which is basically a ball that can stick to surfaces, also the gumboy is able to jump.\n\nYour goal in the game is to collect more diamonds than your opponent does. You can play vs bots, local vs a friend or online. Mind you though, there probably won't be any player online to play.\n\nGumboy Tournament is a neat party game, especially for kids but you probably get bored with it pretty quickly. The game is cheap (normal price: 2 bucks, in a steam deal it could be 0,30 cents) which is the right price for the game but in my opinion it's not enough to recommend this game.\n\n","January 5, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Developers apparently didn't bother testing on anything but a junky old 1080p monitor.\n\nArtwork style in the game rating out of 10: MSPaint.   Seriously, the graphics are that bad.\n\nGameplay:  Well it's like Wizball (kind of - instead of bouncing, you're sticky and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•) from the 1980s but competitive and not particularly fun or interesting.  There's no real story mode, you just go through levels competing against other players or the AI.  You roll around the walls of the map and collect diamonds to get more points than the other guy.   In the era of Grand Theft Auto 5, Ark, The Witcher 3, Skyrim, Star Citizen, and so many other incredible games, they give us MSPaint with sticky balls.  Correction, they ask for us to pay them for sticky balls, it's not even free.  Even if it was free, you wouldn't want it.\n\nTechnical stuff: Absolutely atrocious - doesn't work on modern systems.   Video options are limited to turning off the background and running the game in full screen.    Bonus:  If you run windowed, and switch out, the game locks up and stays stuck in foreground.   Alt+F4 is your friend, thankfully.  Kudos to the developers for allowing us to exit the game.\n\nDon't buy this.  Play one of the F2P games from the Steam store instead.","March 22","false","0.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"

In this game, you are a racing gumball(I know, right?) and you go through many levels and different kinds of races(which are basically just the same 9-10 levels repeated over and over again, slowly becoming more challenging) to earn trophies. Basically, you use your mouse to move and fire your gumball in different directions. The AI is pathetic, so most all of the races are easy, and you'll beat each in roughly 1-3, depending on how far you are. The graphics are livable, but they're not that great and make the game look flat. The game does have multiplayer, although I have not personally tried it out since no one has made a server in a good few years, but I imagine that it would have the same gameplay as the singleplayer.\n\n\n\nIn short, this is a relatively fun, casual game to spend your free time on when you've only got a minute or so and you've run out of dragons to kill. The multiplayer however has been dead for several years now though, so only play for singleplayer or with friends. $3 is too expensive for this game, seeing as of how you can easily buy this game on sale for $.29.\n\n\nRating: 6/10: the game is fun for the price I paid, but is mostly uninspired.","May 27","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
