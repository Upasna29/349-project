Someone found a workaround for the missing executable by trying to download the demo and the game will update and works! Yay!\n\nBut I can already tell you what it's in Mystery PI - The Vegas Heist... I played a retail version years ago :).\n\nYour role is to find the loot from an heist and who did it. Yeah, the plot isn't revelant here.\n\nMystery PI: The Vegas Heist is in reality a fine example of pure Hidden Objects game: list of items to find in a scene with many of them, a puzzle, a list of items, etc... In other words, you don't have the adventure side included.\n\nIf you find special objects, you'll unlock the mode Unlimited Seek and Find - clean the scene!\n\nThe score determine your rank. How is it possible? Each object found is worth of 5000 points. If you're being fast to find them in row, you have a bonus. Special objects (fingerprints, keys, poker chips) are also adding a high bonus to your score. And if you're clearing the level of all objects (instead of choosing to solve the puzzle when you have between two and four items still in the scenes), you can score a 25 000 bonus points for a perfect investigation.\n\nAnyway, the scenes are correct, I love the music there and it's a nice improvement from the Lottery Ticket. Yet, if you're used to HO games like Artifex Mundi's, you'll be disappointed in that plain game. You're always seeing the same scenes, the same puzzles, well, you're going to be bored if you need action.\n\nBut given the fact that I've appreciated this game a long time ago, I would say: buy this classic, not a full price though. And don't forget the workaround!","November 8, 2015","true","3.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

There are cool mini-games, and additional challenges.  The hint system is fair.  It's worth playing over, also.  If you love this as much as I do, check out The Lottery TIcket, also.","February 24, 2015","true","6.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Finally, the fourth of the Mystery P.I. Games I got in the Popcap bundle is played through completely.\n\nTo summarize: we have the same game mechanics (search for hidden objects as the main part of the level, then solve a puzzle or search for words at the end of each level). We have the same flavor of story (private investigator, money at stake, limited time - though this can be eliminated with the relaxed mode, which I did, since I don't like being rushed). We have the same objects for the most part.\n\nSix hours of gaming time logged on this game were the game running on idle in the background. Other than that, I took it pretty slow and relaxed for my standards.\n\nLike the other Mystery P.I. games, and the hidden object game Escape Rosecliff Island, I do not recommend this game unless you really really like this type of game, or you can get it cheaper in a bundle or with one of Steam's offers.\n\nAlso, I think I might just have lost my sane mind by playing all five hidden object games in less than one month. I must have. I'm seeing hidden objects in real life already. Time to put it to an end and focus on other enjoyable games. FINALLY.","January 26, 2015","false","18.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Little to no story to link it all together.  Reused environments, make it all a little boring after a while.  I would have enjoyed it at half the length and a bit more sleuthing.","December 3, 2014","false","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A standard hidden object game with excellent images and art to make seeking a challenge. The "between seeks" puzzles are very straightforward and simple. However, the game suffers from drawn-out repetitive over-use of the same locations. In my opinion, the final conclusion to the game should occur after 20 rounds of seeking, not 25.","April 16, 2014","true","10.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

They are faithful to HOG fans, the artwork is wonderful, and the game is very engaging. I enjoyed the puzzles.  This is very well done.   I wish they offered more in this series.  I would snap up all of them.","May 29, 2015","true","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
