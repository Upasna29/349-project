I personally would have purchased this game had I not reviewed it because I enjoy buying as many sandbox\crafting\survival games as possible to support Developers in this genre and as new updates roll out I switch between games. If you're curious about what this game has to offer then read the Steam Store marketing literature, which is almost up to date (minus the bulletpoint about "Signing In" which is now handled via Steam Login and Singleplayer Mode that's now available as well).\n\nMain Menu\nWhen the game loads there are 3 options:\n\nSingle Player - Self Explanatory\nMultiplayer - Self Explanatory\nOptions - Options is lacking rebindable keys, additional resolutions (4:3 especially), and better graphic settings to adjust the quality (I want more FPS).\n\nOptions Screenshot: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/494645911099743875/515B2BAA10E8A14E2CCC7364055301698B995F08/\n\nSingle Player\nI've only briefly played Single Player, but it's the same as Multiplayer only players cannot connect to your world. One cool thing is if you ever change your mind you can launch Multiplayer and play in your world with other people.\n\nMultiplayer\nCreating\Joining a Game\n\nIn Multiplayer mode players can effortlessly create a randomly generated world for others to join on Tethys Interactive's servers (up to 10 players can join). The game can be password protected, but seems to lack administrator commands. Most sandbox\crafting\survival games either have a Public Server for everyone to join and\or provide players the option of hosting their own dedicated server. A Public Server usually leads to griefing and destruction of your hard work and dedicated servers require opening ports and additional hardware so its hard not to love this feature. The only thing that worries me about the current arrangement is (1) the world generation + load time is slow and (2) if your friend who created the world is offline you can't connect to the world and continue building (3) since players can't host dedicated servers they might experience high ping if Tethys Interactive has limited server locations.\n\nServer Creation: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/494645911099937956/9F83A11A8898B57B73617121F2D226537B0A20F2/\n\nServer List:\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/494645911099744651/BD029692CD8714A8ED6DD5BFEADDC3D3C9B1A3D9/\n\nSelecting\Creating a Character\n\nWhen you start a new Multiplayer game you can pick your character (Male or Female) from 3 different races: The Fae, Dark Elf, or Dwarf. I honestly cannot stand how the Fey looks (Male or Female). Something about it doesn't look on par with the rest. As of right now the difference between races is the starting spells. I'm hoping things such as run speeds, harvest rates, etc. will be different eventually.\n\nCharacter Creation - Male Characters: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/494645911099744252/8E9D6691FE5DDC6F840761077CCCDCBD2B2E801D/\n\nCharacter Creation - Female Characters: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/494645911099744359/550F069AB966FDDDC1CFFFF3F673E4F24C7063E8/\n\nCharacter Selection:\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/494645911099744556/BC58D719ECC9FF2F95E3A162D8022982B6EB4C45/\n\nCore Features\nUnfortunately due to character limitations I can't elaborate as intended on each of the games core features, but this Youtube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEtVrgY-Cdo and http://astralterra.com/ (See: Core Game Features) accurately depict the games 6 core features which are:\n\nDYNAMICALLY GENERATED INFINITE WORLDS\nBUILDING AND SCULPTING - Highly scalable. Designing intricate structures is cake. My one complaint is the larger the structure the slower my game becomes.\nMINING AND CRAFTING - The crafting system is functional, stress free, and easy to learn.\nSURVIVAL - There needs to be more threats than just chickens.\nDISCOVERY & ADVENTURE - The world is huge. To keep me interested quests need to be added. Right now there's  just too much walking around for no reason.\nSKILLS & XP - XP is gained through combat, exploration, and harvesting. A list of skills or a skill tree would be nice.\n\nPrice\nI understand the exhausting work that goes into developing games in this genre, but many other Early Access titles have fallen: Beasts of Prey, The Stomping Land, The Dead Linger, etc. With that said I would feel comfortable spending $9.99 USD because this game has a lot to offer and I wouldn't lose any sleep over that amount. If the game is bug free\feature complete then I would pay $14.99 USD (Single Copy) \ $44.99 USD (4-Pack if Steam Permits them again).\n\nRating:\n7/10 - Based on the positive direction the game is headed. I didn't penalize the Rating due to the countless bugs because the game is being marketed as an Alpha.\n\nPros:\nNot just another sandbox\crafting\survival game. Terraforming is the coolest thing ever. Unforunately there's no coordinates to easily find another player so I didn't dare try testing PVP to see how Terraforming might be used in a battle.\nGorgeous art style. I love how they created player models for multiple races and both genders.\nIf you post an idea the Project Manager is always interested in what you have to say and takes it into consideration.\nNo Steam trading cards, badges, emoticons, and wallpapers. A lot of Developers with Early Access games make the fatal mistake of incorporating these at the beginning. I don't know if this was intentional, but it works in their favor. When Astral Terra leaves Early Access I hope they roll them out to get the attention of existing owners to start playing the game again and for potential customers to discover the game in its complete state by means of badge crafting and wallpaper or emoticon collecting.\nCons: The hardware requirements are too substantial and the game should support DirectX 10 GPU's. I understand only 14.47% of the Steam Community has a DirectX 10 GPU (Steam Hardware & Software Survey: April 2016\n: http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/?sort=chg), but the Steam Store is flooded with sandbox\crafting\survival games and right out of the gate you're losing a fair percentage of potential buyers to your competition. A great example of a competitor on Steam suffering from this same problem is TUG: http://steamcommunity.com/app/277930/discussions/search/?q=directx&gidforum=558751812959815359&include_deleted=1\nThe Development roadmap hasn't been updated: http://steamcommunity.com/app/266190/discussions/1/490125103643422639/ which makes many Early Access potential buyers (especially for an Alpha game) feel concerned. If you're not completely sure of where the game is headed one thing you can do to ease potential buyers minds is open up your to do list similar to CREA (this is a competitior on Steam): https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/510733 so people can see things are being worked on in between updates.\nNo Linux\SteamOS or Mac Support.\nThe game has a lot of bugs. Some might consider it to be a Pre-Alpha. If you don't have patience then this game isn't for you.\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC","May 12","true","16.4"," 52 of 61 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","52","61","2","3"

You will find everything that you would expect from a sandbox game: crafting, building, gathering resources. RPG part offers character progression: you will earn XP, level up, learn new spells, etc. The main distinctive feature of Astral Terra is “terraforming”. You can change the shape and textures of the environment or build anything from giant cave systems or floating islands.\n\nPros:\nNice graphics and visual effects (a step away from blocky Minecraft clones).\nBeautiful unique environments (from snowy mountains to tropical islands).\nTerraforming (change the shape and look of the environment to your liking).\nClassic RPG elements: different races, character progression, leveling system.\nFarming (you gather seeds, plant them and eventually harvest crops).\nActive developer. Regular updates.\nIt ran perfectly fine on my pc (80-90 FPS on average on ultra).\n\nCons:   Lack of tutorial. It may take a while to figure things out on your own. Thankfully you can find some helpful YouTube videos.\nSince it’s an alpha build, early access game: not a lot of content and some bugs are to be expected.\nRather annoying music and lack of sound effects.\nAfter playing Astral Terra for about 10 hours, I can recommend it based on the current state of development, amount of content and promises of what is yet to come. Just keep in mind that as of right now the game is far away from being completed.\n\nPC Specs\nHardware Type   CPU Intel Core i7 5820K 3.30GHz   GPU Nvidia GTX 970   RAM 16GB DDR3   OS Windows 10 PRO\nDisclaimer:\nA copy of the game was provided for reviewing purposes.

Granted, it's an alpha right now, so there's going to be some things about the game that needs to change.\n\nMy suggestions would be... Fullscreen Windowed option. Most games have it, and it'd be an utter shame if this game didn't. Trust me, your players will love you for the option! (It's always the first thing I look for to make sure it's on.)\nCancel button on Settings Configuration, just in case we screwed something up and don't want to face the ultimatum of "Quit Game" or "Apply".\nCamera speed option, and perhaps an option to keep it regulated so that it doesn't start off as a slow crawl to a sudden lurching, motion-sickness inducing whizzing across the screen, haha.\nHotkey reconfiguration. This is important in that it allows for players to fall into hotkeys and habits they're familiar and comfortable with. Most importantly, it allows for players who are brand new to the game to peruse the hotkeys and see what the default hotkeys are in game. (For example, I never would have guessed that Q, normally a Strafe Left movement button would be the Descend function.)\nAllow for players to zoom out of first person if they so wish in Build Mode. Being forced to first person is very disorienting and doesn't allow for the player to gage scaling.\nAllow players to adjust volume of various things, not just master volume. I must shamefully admit I'm not a fan of the music, but I'd still want to hear the environmental sounds; there's no option for this, however. It's all or nothing right now. Similarly, breaking down the settings to multiple categories would be advised for organizational purposes.\nSpeed up the scrolling speed of Build Mode's texture selection. I'm not sure if the developers have tested this particular function, but it's ridiculously slow, borderline frustrating.\nHave the movement keys (WASD) move the camera as well. Having to hold down the right mouse button to figure out we're unintentionally running our character's off a cliff isn't a good thing!\nCharacter customization! Is there any at the character creation screen? I'm not too certain, but I believe not. It's a little disheartening, but I assume this will become a later feature. If there is indeed character customization in this build, it's very well hidden.\nHave Stamina be a bit more reasonable. Within four minutes of standing around figuring out controls and settings, my Stamina was entirely depleted. Seems rather silly having it go away so soon, perhaps extend it to over the course of an hour? I'm not certain what purpose it holds, but if its anything important, this game would be unplayable.\nWarning before deleting/throwing away objects by dragging off the window. Hooo boy.\nThat's all I can think of off the top of my head. Looking back on it, wow I piled 'em up. Keep up the fantastic work. I might update this later with more suggestions, but these are the most prominent that surface to mind.","November 11, 2015","true","0.8"," 53 of 80 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","53","80","2","0"

This great feature allows you to alter procedurally generated environments on a macro scale, allowing the generation of truly epic creations. Due to the game's current alpha state, I can only recommend this game (at this point in time) to fans of the crafting genre, especially those that want to take part in the developing process with continued feedback. For everyone else, I'd advise following this game until it reaches a point in development that you are comfortable with a purchase. In the following review, I will only be commenting on its first impressions and the current state of the game.\n\n==== First Impressions ====----05/12/2016----\nWhen you first make a character (choose your race), you will then create a new world for you to explore. With a few varied and expansive environments around you, Terraforming and building is immediately available. The initial start is rather slow due to an absence of any tutorial or questline, but once you learn the controls and the desire to Terraform mountains materializes, the game becomes rather fun. On a more critical note, the quality of the textures and optimization leaves a bit of desire for improvement. There are lots of pop-in textures and animals, and running around/building is not as fluid as I hoped it would be. Bugs are pretty abundant in the current release state, but I only found a couple that warranted a game restart (permanantly locked cursor while Terraforming & infinite harvest animation from fast-clicking).\n\n==== Current State of the Game ====As of this review, the developers have fixed multitudes of minor bugs and a few major bugs reported by users through Steam reviews and from their website/forums. A large patch was just released last week, and since then, another minor patch was also implemented. The developers have not only shown continued interest in improving this game and utilizing community feedback, they have also been transparent with their future plans and current content. The biggest takeaway points are listed below:\n\nPros:Terraforming\nDiverse environments\nRPG elements\nActive developer team\nCons:Alpha state\nDirectx 11 GPU requirement\nNo progressive content atm\n==== Early Access ====For those that are not aware of the Early Access concept, it is perfectly acceptable for bugs to be present and game mechanics to be missing (especially at the alpha stage of development). With that in mind, I can at least say that I have enjoyed what I've played so far, and hope to see more people get a jump on Astral Terra.\n\n==== Hardware Information ====HardwareTypeMonitor720p 32 LED TVControllerDS3 (M&K used for this review)MotherboardASRock Z97M AnniversaryCPUi5-4590GPURadeon R9 290XRAM8 GBOSWindows 7\n==== Disclaimer ====A copy of this game was provided by the developer: Tethys Interactive LLC; however, this did not bias my review in any form.","May 12","true","0.7"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

The developers are very active and always listening and pushing small updates with fixes and improvements. I think another 6 months would be a huge difference.\n\nAt first...When I first saw this game, it reminded me very much of Landmark and when I created my first character and saw the Drow, I immediately went back to memories of EverQuest. After selecting my race I was sad there was not any other options, but I read that character customization is planned.\n\nCreating worldsNext was creating a world name and seed. No idea what to put in Seed but couldn't leave it blank. So went to the Steam Discussion and searched for 'seed' and used one of the suggestions. I wish there was some kind of info to tell you what you could use as a seed or maybe suggest seeds with biome descriptions like the thread had. But you can apparently enter any random number or words to generate a world. I created 3 with a random word, and 2 with a random 3 digit number, and then 1 with a ? and all worked except the last. That one got stuck at 90% and after 10 minutes I exited. Tried entering it and it did the same thing.\n\nExperiencesIn two of the worlds I ran in one direction until my Hunger bar was empty and health drained causing  my death. In both of them I saw only 2 biomes; Desert to Jungle in one and Snow to Jungle in the other. In both cases eventually ran into such a high mountain that I got tired of trying to jump up the slope since there would be a delay while stuck in a crouching position sometimes.\n\nI built a few bridges to span over large canyons. I did not have the patience to get the controls right and allow spanning a single row of blocks that expended across multiple columns. Basically couldn't build one layer of blocks from one side to the other. Instead I was building entire cubes that filled the whole gap from the top where I was, to the bottom of the canyon.\n\nI also spent some time digging up a plant only to realize I dug myself into a hole when I shifted the camera angle cause I couldn't move.\n\nAnd then spent much time playing with the terraforming feature. I absolutely love the idea that I can quickly flatten space before building, as in other building games I have spent hours to do this one block at a time. I only wish it could be controlled smoother to create flat ground. I did also try to fall out the bottom of the world, but I can tell you there is a bedrock layer to prevent that. :rose:\n\nPositives for me:  Active developers who want to hear your input and seem to always be working behind the scene pushing many small updates from your feedback in a very quick fashion.\n\nGorgeous world & many building blocks right at the start pleases me. Honestly I get bored of looking at endless bland trees seen in other survival games and trying to make something appealing. Not in Astral Terra! The landscape has a vibrant colorful feel with absolutely wonderful textures. And right at the start you have access to at least 38 different block textures with 13 shapes to choose from. Stone walls, textured glass, woods, metals, cement maybe with shiny metal like details. I can't wait to see how this improves by full release!\n\nTerraforming is awesome! I know I basically mentioned it earlier in my experience, but I really can't stress the happiness in having an option to flatten an area to build on so quickly.\n\nAbilities in a survival game, WHAT! You can heal yourself! So even when hungry as your health ticks you can heal until you find/make food. Also to me its pretty fantastic you can summon a crafting station wherever you are.\n\nMouseover tool tips show resources in the distance and scale in size to reflect how far away they are.\n\n+1 for no fall damage!\nSeems reasonable that will probably get changed later though.\nThings I wasn’t fond of:Also for the developers to consider since they do use player input and improve features.\n\nCurrently no way to hide the UI for screenshots and that makes me sad.\n\nLoot system really pained me. I am not a fan of spending time to chop down a tree or demolish a rock only to have to manually pick up each of the bits that came from it. I also found my expectation was that if I clicked a log or piece of rock I wanted to automatically walk towards and loot it. Versus standing there being told its out of range.\n\nESC key isn't utilized. I suppose it is more expectation from other games. When I press ESC I think its going to exit whatever current window I am in, and if none are open I expect the main menu that will take me back to a character or world select screen. None of those things happen right now. You have to click the Gear icon in the bottom right toolbar.\n\nControls are frustrating to me when exploring.\n\nThe A and D keys which I tap to move left/right instead cause me to turn and spin in a circle which is frustrating. But on the flip side,when terraforming being able to rotate to the left/right and keep the ground i was removing sort of straight/flat was helpful. Using mouse I can't get that kind of stability. Maybe an option to have the controls act different depending if in standard / Terraform / Build mode would help?\n\nAlso the delay when I jump up a slope and sort of get stuck in a crouching position seemed to cause my patience to shoot out of the roof. I actually found I was yelling at my screen a couple times between looping in circles instead of running forward and getting stuck in a sloped mountain or while trying to terraform a path through a mountain.\n\nMini-map is currently black space (as is the Map) but I suspect its just a placeholder that will be fixed at a later stage of alpha or beta. On a side note, if its not been suggested i would love the option to re-size and even move the mini-map. Big fan of having control over my UI elements to move as I need.\n\nOption slider for sound effect would be fantastic. There is one for Music versus Main volume so I suspect that will also get added later. When I first encountered water I thought I broke my eardrums. I moved the main slider to half way and then couldn't hear anything so I moved it back a fourth of the way or so to compromise for over all sound vs effects. Think the main volume might need some tweaking cause of this.\n\nMany have expressed high system requirements being needed and having to play the game on its lowest settings, not being able to play, or not being able to load the game at all. It was smooth for me on Ultra with a 66-90 FPS on average. A few times I noticed it was even at 100. I will include my hardware to help others compare and decide. Just FYI even in Medium (the lowest setting) the world still looks wonderful.\n\nDate: May 22, 2016\nRating: 8/10 at this stage of early access.\nI can see the promise and personally love the fantasy idea.\n\nHardwareIncluded as others said they couldn't play or load the game.\n\nMobo: Asus x99 Deluxe w/ usb 3.1\nCPU: i7 5820K\nGPU: duel GTX 970 EVGA Superclocked\nRAM: 16x Corsair Vengeance LPX\nHDD: 4TB WD Black + 1TB WD Black\nMonitors: one 27", two 23" LED, 2ms\nKeyboard: G910 Orion Spark\nMouse: Trackball (Kensington Orbit)\n\nDisclaimer: Key provided by TethysInteractiveLLC but does not influence my review.","May 22","true","6.8"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","2"

Early Access games are an interesting way to explore new sandbox games as developers continue to find new and exciting ways to take the tedium out of sandboxes.  This review is by no means an absolute true review, when people review games they give both positive and negative view points on games.

In this case multiple character classes, an extremely intriguing terraforming which I believe its a huge defining piece of the game as it feels unlike any other.\n\nAs with any game on the marketplace, deep understanding of the games mechanics as well as developers reactions to issues should always be taken into consideration.

I have taken this fact into account in my review.\n\nIn its current state, Astral Terra is an exercise in frustration. First of all, the design choices for the game controls are very hard to get used to. Character movement have been relegated entirely to the keyboard while the mouse cursor is free floating at all time. You can however look around by pressing the right mouse button. The gathering of resources is tedious as it requires you to place the mouse cursor in the right spot (often needing you to move around) on the resource you're trying to gather, then picking up the elements you've extracted from the ground, also requiring awkward mouse cursor placements. The game is still in alpha stage so its expected to have loads of bugs, however when you can't even walk for a couple of minutes without falling through the ground and into oblivion, it's really difficult to get anything else done. I feel that, minimally, this should have been addressed before allowing the public to access the game.\n\nEven in its current buggy state, the game shows tons of potential. The graphics are gorgeous and the world is entirely editable with the terraforming / terrain editing tools. Building anything is awkward at the moment as placement of building blocks in the 3D wold is a bit sketchy, but one thing I really liked is the ability to do it in free mode, not requiring your character to climb and access the places where you want to build. The crafting system is simple enough and already has a good number of items. There's also all of the RPG elements which add an extra layer to the game, although I haven't been able to experience much in that area yet.\n\nIn it's current state, I can only recommend purchasing this game if you want to help the developer out and are interested in being a part of hunting down bugs and shaping the game as it progresses. The developer is involved with the community so I'm confident that people who like those kind of sandbox/survival games will find an enjoyable product when it is closer to release.

The bad news is that there are bugs waiting around many a corner in its current state. The good news is that there is the foundation of an enjoyable game here. Things will only get better as the game is updated, but it is only fair to consider this when deciding whether to jump into the game today, as opposed to waiting for a few more updates.\n\nTo start with, the worlds look very nice. when you begin a game, you choose a 'seed' by entering a number. each number will take you to a different world. They have everything covered from desert to snowy mountains. I haven't felt the need to adventure too far in an individual world, but they feel large in scale.\n\nMy favorite part from this game is the terraforming. I can build myself woodland beach right in the middle of the snowy mountains if I want to do so(and I do). The ability to shape the world around you is limited only by your imagination. Do you want to be a moleman and live underground? Here is your chance! I feel like a superhero running around reshaping the environment to my liking. This is a new experience for me in a game, and I look forward to the opportunity to reshape a world on an epic scale. Sometimes I even have a hard time concentrating on other tasks, since I have so much fun with terraforming that I can't resist the urge to use it.\n\nRegarding the current state of the game:\n\nThe crafting system is easy to learn and functional right now. Crafting is never my favorite thing to do in a game, but this time around is it a painless experience. I managed to get through the process of making myself a small farm without getting frustrated while hunting for items, which is a refreshing change from some other games I have played. The devs have done a good job here.\n\nI didn't have many issues in the way of building. I am not one to go and build myself some kind of beautiful dwelling that will impress everyone who sees it. I prefer to just build up some oddities and laugh at them. This building system works very well for me. It allows me to build on a large scale with ease. With just a few clicks, I can put together a structure that is large enough to dominate the landscape. I can't speak for how well it works with more intricate buildings, but I am pleased with the system.\n\nI had no luck at all with multiplayer working, so I can't recommend this game at the moment if that is what you are looking for. I wish that it was easier to get going on multiplayer, because I suspect it would be good fun. It does give me something to look forward to in the future, once it gets all sorted out. In the meantime, feel free to try to join WOODLAND"S HAPPYTIME PARTYZONE at seed 420, and lets see if we can get it working and have some good times.\n\nOverall, I feel like the good outweighs the bad at the moment, and it is only going to get better from here. It is still in a state where it is simply a sandbox, but it is an entertaing one. There should be plenty more to be added, so keep in mind that the potential is here for them to turn this into quite an epic game. I am certainly looking forward to it.\n\n\nRating:\n6.5/10\n\nPros:\nactive dev team\nnice enviroments\nterraforming\nCons:  still early in development\nbugs ahoy\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC","May 10","true","9.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

For those who like building & crafting this game is a must. You can literally build anything you want. There's already so many things to choose from when building & crafting. At the moment the game is still in Alpha build so there are some bugs, but I still manage to build some pretty amazing things. What is also great about this game is the RPG elements. You choose your character at the start, he then evolve all through the game. I can't wait to see more quest. To me that alone will adds so much gameplay and make it a game I keep coming back too.\n\nOn the down side, the game is mostly played using the keyboard. I would've like to have the option to use keyboard and mouse or even better a controller. Also there's no different ennemies, for a survival game, at the moment there's not much to survive too. Finally the sound effects are really lacking, it makes the experience less intense. Of course being an Alpha you can expect to come across several bugs, but the devs are pretty involved in fixing them, so I have high hope that it will play much smoother in the near future.\n\nIn conclusion, I really think that this game has the potential to become a great game once the bugs are fix. The devs are really active which always bode well for the future of the game. They are actively working at fixing the bugs and improving on the existing features. I really like the concept already and I cant wait to see it develop further. I really think that there's a great future for this game.\n\nRating:\n6.5/10\n\nPros:\nThe in-depth terraforming mode lets you have a unique experience every time you create a new world.\nThe RPG element, quest adds to the gameplay.\nGreat graphics and beautiful big world to play in.\nWith the terraforming and the characters ability to evolve, each playthrough is truly unique.\nEven though theres no tutorial per se, theres a help feature which lets you know which key do what.\nCons:  The music is rather bland and it lack some sound effect.\nThe keyboard control makes it rather hard to play, would've like to be able to use the mouse to move.\nSeveral bugs and issues to be fix.\nTheres no tutorial, so you feel kind of lost at the start.\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor Asus laptop 17 inch 1600 by 900   Headphones Headphones   Keyboard Asus ROG laptop   Controller XBOX 360   Mouse Microsoft mobile mouse 3500   Microphone Microphone   Motherboard ASUS ROG laptop   CPU Intel Core i7 6700HQ 260 GHz   GPU gtx 960m 2b   RAM 16 gb   OS windows 8   HDD 1 tb\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Tethys Interactive","May 19","true","2.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

My review, however, is not affected by this action and will rate this game accordingly.\nREVIEW\nThere are tons of survival games out there, and most of them offer the same content over and over again without any new features or changes at all. And given that statement, I believe Astral Terra has what it takes to stand out than the rest. Even though the game has been on development for quite some time, it still needs more polishing and probably more content.\n\nI could only suggest this game to those who are willing to help out the developers on finishing this one. They could really use some help from the community feedbacks. So if you’re not that type of person, I do suggest that you wishlist this game and maybe check it out again in a couple of months.\n\nPROS\nTerraforming – I think this is the selling point of this game, and one of the most unique\nfeatures compared to the other survival games.\nDedicated developers – I’ve checked the developer’s website and found out that this game was on Kickstarter and Steam Greenlight on 2013. And up until now, they try to update the game as constantly as possible. Not everyone has the patience to develop games that long.\nGorgeous Graphics – With more than a decent rig and the highest quality settings possible, this game simply stands out than most of the survival games out there.\nRPG Elements – You can choose your race and your gender upon character creation\nand it all comes with different character spells and a levelling system.CONS\nNot User-Friendly – I had a hard time starting off to be honest, took me quite some time before I understand the mechanics of the game. I suggest you read some guides in-game or find a wiki on the internet.\nLacks Customization – I’m aware that the gameplay does not revolve around the character customization. But the only options you get when creating a character is choosing a race and its gender.\nLow-end Rigs – If you can’t run this game and have a stable fps, I highly suggest that you look for different game instead. You’ll just be annoyed with the graphics and constant stutters. Not only that, but it also requires a DX 11 to run the game.","May 19","true","1.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

The good news is that if you are the sort of person that likes to make suggestions and see them implemented then this is a good game to choose. The developer is very approachable and adds regular updates of users suggestions to the game on a weekly basis. I wont lie to you. There are a lot of bugs and at the moment and there is not much to do apart from building objects, Terraforming and exploring the infinite world.\n\nThe terraforming element to the game is interesting and has promise but I believe it is not yet stable in its current state and you will often find yourself stuck underground. The terraforming tool is a big colourful cube which appears in front of you and can be moved upwards and downwards and closer or farther away. It digs into the ground and you can form tunnels which go downwards as far as you like. When the tool is perfected I can see this being a great way of building tunnels and passageways underground. Currently I found the tool difficult to use accurately and that is something the devs will need to improve on to really make this game stand out. The building elements to the game are quite good as they stand and you can easily build structures to your heart's content. The game does include combat and magical spell elements but these are in early development and at the moment any creatures you encounter are easy targets. You can create your own worlds and name them and create passwords for your friends to join. I can see this game being a really good game in the future, it just depends whether you want to jump on board and ride the journey with them. Be warned that in this state you will be joining the fun right at the start and I imagine there's a long way to go so don't expect a finished game yet.\n\nIn conclusion, I cant really recommend the game in its current form but it is in an ALPHA state so that is to be expected. Can I see promise in the game? Yes I can, and therefore I would recommend it to anyone who likes to get involved and make suggestions that if worthy will be implemented quickly. I guess this is why Steam releases games in ALPHA states so that users can mould the game and help develop it. I have seen first hand that my suggestions and my friends ideas were included in updates within the week so if this excites you then I would say go for it!\n\nRating:\n6.5/10\n\nPros:\nDevs listen to your ideas and implement them quickly\nAn infinite world for you to play around in and the terraforming tool could be very promising\nMultiplayer and single player modes included and you can create your own worlds which are password protected.\nCons:  Lots and Lots of Bugs\nNot much to do at the moment\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor LG IPS LED FLATRON IPS234   Headphones Turtle Beach Earforce X12   Keyboard Corsair Raptor K40   Controller Microsoft Xbox 360   Mouse Trust GXT 25   Microphone Turtle Beach Earforce X12   Motherboard ASRock Z97 Extreme 6   CPU QuadCore Intel Core i7-4790K 4400 MHz 44 x 100   GPU Gigabyte GeForce GTX 760   RAM 16MB   OS Windows 81   HDD Crucial M550 512GB SSD\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC","May 15","true","5.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","4"

The review describes my expression of the game and nothing more than that. This  particularly review holds more formal nature and form.\n\nMay 20th, year 2016. The copy was obtained from Tethys Interactive LLC.\n\nTo be honest, this is one of the most ambivalent reviews I am writing so far even though there aren't so many in general. If I were to describe the game in a catch-phrase it would probably sound like "An all-round cake with superious taste ... which is yet to be cooked". And that may somehow convey the first expression after you decide to give Astral Terra a try.\n\nFurther saying, there are many things to be changed and some to be completely redone even before developers could move this project to "road to release". If you want to support AT and give it your own thoughts after playing, think twice. It is indeed mentioned that the game is currently being in Alpha (which I still can't really justify for an Early Access title as there should be some limit of "done'ess" to consider title be worthy of opening it to mass public). In my opinion, the present build would be much more welcomed as a closed Pre Alpha testing to a limited pool of enthusiasts.\n\nBut enough with negatory grunt for now. As it was said earlier, Astral Terra has an immense potentional and headway (the main reason I decided to give it a thumbs up) and despite being quite a mess it slowly buy steadily progresses towards that kind of sandbox "toy" you wouldn't feel tedious to play with. There is already diverse arsenal of possibilities to try: for instance, you are able to terraform natural surroundings and create completely different biomes within others  (lets say a lovely oasis garden lying midst rough wilderness), give a try to building mass constructions of various form, nature or caliber in general. Also, you could rather devote yourself to grinding and combining elements to then act as blacksmith, carpenter or "The Creator" of some sort. There are three races in-game but naturally it doesn't matter which one you decide to choose as the changes in gameplay are non significant at all less said bring any influence.\n\nTechically, as you may have guessed yourself this title is far from anything certain. I first started playing Astral Terra when the team came up with a "huge, epic update" so I am hardly to imagine how it looked like before but even then I had to face several unpleasant issues distorting game experience quite significantly. Thus, I needed to relaunch it a few of times being unable to load the world/hero, I got stucked in the textures twice having to do the same RE thing. The most annoying thing though was constantly dissapearing cursor which was absolutely necessary to be on-screen for a building mode. Another point is a control scheme or just the character/interface controls in general: you can use the common A/D to turn the hero while Q/E only let you run obliquely in zig zags; meanwhile, right mouse button should be trapped to use as a regular camera view while just mouse is purposed for navigating through menus and building. This wholeness is rather peculiar in my opinion and could be replaced with easier and more user-friendly concept later. Not sure if it's worth of mentioning, but there is also an already dead multiplayer in the game too (couldn't load other player's online world, so can't speculate on that).\n\n\nWhat was enjoyable:   - Huge opportunities ... >\nAbility to terraform earth and add a plentiful amount of different elements (including water)\nMany materials and forms to create buildings with (still, they will likely have simplified form due to overall small scale and lack of complex structure)\nPresence of surprisingly advanced crafting system (weapons, misc and so on)\nOnline mode (even so it's not working properly for me at least)\nA visible progress towards improving, seemingly active and mindful developers\nWhat proves lacking:   - > ... Within far crippling boundaries\nCountless small bugs in all aspects of the game to polish, overall feeling of colossal incompletess even for an "Alpha" version of the game\nHunger system which proves absolutely out of the place at such early stage of development and seems hasslesome for players\nThe patient RPG system is more likely dead than alive\nPoor animations while the surrondings seem static\nHighly resourceful and "system crushing" in the current state, especially on GPU (for the sake of your mediocre PC's wellbeing, don't try to set everything on max and then create water)\nCropped and lacking sounds effects_____________________________________________\n\n4 "Oh stop rolling from me damn logs!" out of 10 (which is still a positive mark, yes). Far from being far of finishing, fairly bum and incomplete in many ways sandbox voxel creation with a small hint of becoming worthy title to enjoy in the nearest future; 'le gachis de idees' if one can say.","May 19","true","2.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

You start off by creating your character, in which you can choose between three races and whether it be a male or female and of course a name. After this you create your first world, and of course decide to enter it. You are spawned in a big, beautiful world in which you are free to gather materials, craft foundations and terraform the environment. You also have magical spells to your abilities, including a self-heal. The most fun I had was with its terraforming, adding or removing things to and from the environment. If you have always wanted an unlimited supply of gold, this game's definitely for you. Try not to drown yourself in your newly created pool of water though (wish someone had told me beforehand).\n\nThe game is in its alpha state, and you can definitely tell this by the amount of bugs. I also hope the developer will work on the user interaction portion of the game. Dear dev, the a and d keys are a lot more suited to be used as strafing keys - NOT as turning the camera around. Also I couldn't find an easy way to exit to the main menu, besides exiting the entire game. I also didn't see any cancel buttons within some of the menus, having to click on the appropriate menu button to close it again. The character and abilities screen have it, so why cant settings have one for example? The game definitely has potential, but it still needs - a lot - of tweaking. In its current state, I would rather call it pre-alpha.\n\nAs you can see I gave this game a (barely) positive score, but please bear in mind that this is me taking its alpha state into heavy consideration. I even feel that calling it alpha is stretching it. I would only recommend a purchase if you are starving for a new sandbox game, or if you like to support the developer. The developer is involved within the community, something I applaud them for. This leads me to believe that they will do their best to improve the game to the players liking.\n\nRating:\n5.5/10\n\nPros:\nDeveloper seems dedicated, I have high hopes this will not become another EA abandoned project.\nThe environment of the game looks great.\nOffers both single-player and multiplayer, can carry your worlds over.\nTerraforming is awesome!\nAbilities hotbar.\nCons:  Lacking a tutorial, making it a lot more difficult for newcomers to understand and simply a strain.\nAudio (or lack thereof).

It takes a few moments to get used to the camera in the game, but once the player has a handle on it allows for easy access to all sides and angles of any construction, no matter the size.\n\nOne of my favourite mechanics in the game, and possibly the one mechanic that allows it to stand out from most other survival/sandbox games is the terra forming mechanic. Terra forming allows the players to manipulate the environment around them to a degree most other games in this genre do not allow. They can create caves, lakes, beaches any geographic object they want, so the game in not limited to creating man-made structures.\n\nThe combat that I've seen in the game so far has been responsive, but somewhat wonky. In fact some interactions in general are a little frustrating because hit boxes seem to not be exactly where we see them in the game. So very often I'd be trying to pick an item up, and I think I'm pointing at it, but the game does not recognize that I am. So it takes a couple of tries to find where I need to click; and while I'm on that subject, the player needs to be close enough to the item to pick up or the game will say "Not close enough" - forgive me for being simple, but why not just walk to an item I've clicked on if my character isn't close enough?\n\nThe spacial rendering of the environment and the constructions in the game is really good as I've mentioned, so exploring mines and structures is rather enjoyable, and the details are quite nice. But it comes at a price; the game requires a G-card that can support DirectX 11 as a minimum requirement. Although the game will run on DirectX 9 it won't be running very smoothly and will need better hardware to show it's real potential. That limits the number of people who can run the game.\n\nPros:Rich and beautiful environment\nTerra Forming is a uniquely powerful mechanic\nFlexible camera and point of view\nLarge choice of materials available for creativity Cons:Wonky combat, odd hitboxes\nAbove average hardware requirements\nUgly characters and limited sound track that clash with the beautiful environment\nThe game is incomplete and has a number of small bugs and glitches and missing content (the usual things that come with an alpha or a beta game)\nUtimately I think this game has a lot of potential, and I really hope it achieves it. At this point the game is incomplete and I cannot really recommend it. I am looking forward to where the developers will take it in the future. But for now my score for the game is 6/10 - incomplete\nSource of consideration: Tethys Interactive","June 2","true","1.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You can also use Terraforming to chape the world with your own hands, so, go build that underground city you always dreamed of.\n\nYes, Early Access means some bugs, but every game has at least one, even the finished ones, so expect some on this one. But the Devs are pretty active, and many of the reported bugs are fixed in the following patch, so, the more feedback you give, better the game will turn out to be.\n\nP.S.: I have around more 15 hours of offline gameplay, mostly on singleplayer mode though.\n\nRating:\n7.2/10\n\nPros:\nVery active Devs, who listen for ideas/sugestions/bug reports, and more, and patch them, or implement them, as soon as possible.\nTerraforming, in other words, the ability to change the world around you, its a powerful tool at your disposal\nThe Map Seed, which means, each map has its own number, its Seed, and if you found a amazing world you can send the number to a friend for him to play in the same one (without your modifications to the same).\nSeveral classes to choose from, each one with his own backstory and lore.\nThe art is amazing for a Early Access game, we can see that they gave much time in that area.\nCons:The Tutorial. Or better yet, the lack of it, it may be a sandbox game, but we still need to learn how to play it.\nThe controls either for construction and for movement, after a while you get a hang of them, but still hard to use them.\nThis game requires a High-Spec computer, which means, a lot of people wont be able to enjoy it with maximum fps.\nIts a Alpha(Early Access) game, but in my opinion, its still on a pre-alpha level, but with the help and feedback from the community, soon enough will be a Alpha level game.\nIn my opinion, the game is a bit overpriced, i see this as a 10/15 game max, so the 20+- pricetag i think its a big push.\nHardware Information\nHardwareTypeMonitor1366x768HeadphonesOzone Rage STKeyboard- LaptopController-MouseE-Blue AurozaMicrophoneOzone Rage ST MicrophoneMotherboardMotherboardCPUIntel Core i5-3210M 250GHzGPUNVIDIA GeForce GT 620MRAM6GbOSWindows 7HDD750Gb\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC","May 17","true","0.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The game allows terraform which I think is cool at first, but this game feels kinda like a pre-alpha. The crafting system is cool and kinda feels like the game Grav with the farming for materials aspect.\n\nThe graphics look decent considering that this game is an alpha. The artwork and animation look decent enough as well. Hopefully the finished product will produce more detail in the characters and background.\n\nThe multiplayer didnt work for me. I guess its still being finalized for the complete version. There are several bugs that did require me to restart my game a few times. My controls got stuck and I was stuck in a ditch i dug on my own lol. Being that this is a sandbox game I hope the final product finishes the bugs along with the multiplayer to see how well this game runs with multiple people in one server. The possibilities can be endless. So only time will tell. The price range is a bit high in these early stages, but I do hope that the finish product does make it worth while.\n\nRating:\n6.0/10\n\nPros:\nDecent graphics makes it easy on the eyes\nCrafting and farming for materials\nAdded RPG elements to make it lasting\nMore unique take on the minecraft aspect\nPlease fill out all 5 pros.\nCons:  Clunky Controls made me restart the game\nRepetitive music makes me go crazy add some more lol\nMultiplayer doesnt work for now...\nBuggy game with hopefully patches to follow\nPlease fill out all 5 cons.\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor Samsung Series 9 S27B970D Display Port 2560x1440   Headphones Astro A40 Headset   Keyboard CMStorm KB   Controller Xbox 360 Wired Controller   Mouse CMStorm Mouse   Microphone Astro A40 Mic   Motherboard ASRock X79 Professional   CPU Intel i7-4930K 340GHz   GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 760 X 2   RAM 16 GB Ram   OS Windows 7 Pro   HDD WD 2TB Hdd\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC","May 17","true","0.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I know this game is at the alpha stage but there has to be some objective or quest to keep me entertained or even wanting to keep playing as wandering around terraforming can only keep me going so long.\n\nThe game has single player and multiplayer of which you can use your own created world for mulitplayer which is a great idea if you want to show friends something you have done in your own world and vice a versa. The game has a minimap which is awesome but not one thing was shown on it apart from direction.\n\nThe game has a fully configured steam controller which made the game alot easier with the steam track pad. I have seen on some other reviews that you need a monster pc to run this but i disagree with that, my pc is or wasa  budget pc, paid about 550 GBP and i can run this on ultra and with no issues\n\nOverall i feel this game has huge potential and i am honestly wishing the dev the best with it as it seems like he really cares about this game. It looks good and the the idea and concept of it all are great, but for me i need something to do more than just run around\nRating:\n5/10\n\nPros:\nGraphics are really good.\nTerraforming works really well.\nSteam controller works flawlessly, trackpad made it easier than using a keyboard and mouse\nEasy to move where you want, so if you need to get really high up, you can move yourself and no need to spend hours building or terraforming platforms.\nActive dev, has been 3 updates recently and they are very open to feedback and constructive criticism.\nCons:  No objective or quests\nNo tutorial for the alsolute newbie on the game mechanics.\nThere are still many bugs but the dev is sorting them out.\nThe music in my own opinion started to get on my nerves abit, This should be varied with some other music.\nThe game should not be early access just yet as i feel there is still a way to go before it should be sold as early access\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor 32 TV   Headphones turtle beach px3   Keyboard logitech g15   Controller xbox wireless   Mouse logitech mx518   Microphone turtle beach px3   Motherboard gigabyte   CPU hex core 3.4 ghz   GPU radeon 7750 OC   RAM 16 gb   OS windows 10   HDD 1tb sata\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Tethys Interactive LLC","May 19","true","1.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You are now able to hot swap equipment on your quickbar, allowing you to mine, dig, and chop trees without keeping your inventory open. Getting attacked? Use your spells and sword without having to dig through your backpack wasting crucial moments, then go back to looting that shattered rock full of Chromium.\n\nWhile this game is still in Early Access, the changes I've seen and the work put in by the devs is promising.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazeeColin/recommended/266190/","CrazeeColin","C.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazeeColin/","2292 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nThis review was written based off gameplay in patch 0.4.2\n\nAstral Terra is a game that is very much in its infancy. It's probably too early for it to be sold to the public at the minute. I understand that Early Access is for games that are still developing, but I don't feel that this game is ready to demand a price tag at the moment. There's potential here, but a lot of optimisation and work needs to be done.\n\nThere's a complete lack of tutorial. The game throws you in and expects you to know what you're doing. There is no way to change the key bindings at the moment. Once you have figured things out, everything in the game is a little awkward and clunky. The cursor needs to be placed exactly where the game wants it to be for something to work. This is especially frustrating when it comes to gathering materials and trying to pick them up. Everything must be clicked on individually, and sometimes you need to click outside of the texture of an item to pick it up. It leads to a lot of frustration and makes everything feel very slow and laboured. Even when terraforming, it can be difficult to get the game to do what you want it to do.\n\nThe world looks really good for a game in this genre. The environment is vibrant and huge. However, the character models are of considerably lower quality than the rest of the game, they don't fit in. Movement also looks a little unnatural.\n\nRight now the game is essentially a creative environment and nothing more. There's no challenging enemies, just an empty world to explore. It would be acceptable for this to be a creative game if it wasn't so frustrating to play. When it feels like you're fighting the game just to be able to play it, it gets exhausting quickly.\n\nAstral Terra is not a bad game, it's just a frustrating experience right now. As the game evolves and is updated, hopefully it will become more intuitive to play and create a better experience for the user. I'll re-visit the game across it's life, and hopefully the potential will be achieved and I can change this review and recommend it. Right now, I can't justify telling anyone they should spend their money on it though.","May 17","false","6.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Over the past few years I have watched Tethys Interactive and Astral Terra progress from nothing to a now greenlit and relatively smooth Early Access title. I am thrilled to finally participate in the alpha stages of the game and do my part to weed out bugs and give constructive criticism, and I can confidently say I expect tons of updates in the near future, they have come this far and are determined to make a quality game.\n\nMy personal favorite thing about this title so far is the "terraform" terrain editor; the controls can be slightly confusing at first, but with a few minutes of practice it is easy to get down. Terrain editing is fairly unique in Astral Terra, seeing as you can edit the world with your character in third person or if you choose, you can go free cam an float around to edit the terrain. This mechanic makes building and terrain editing quick and rewarding, in the first 30 minutes of gameplay I was able to dig myself a cave, add multiple rooms and changed the wall pattern, making a nice little shelter to call home.  Astral terra has come a long way since I first heard of its development, and I am looking forward to playing this title with friends, survivng the night and building towns, just like the old minecraft days.\n\nAs with any Eearly Access title, Astral Terra does have a fair ammount of bugs to be worked out (it is in Alpha, after all... cut them some slack) but do not let this detour you from getting a copy, Tethys is hard at work fixing bugs and patching errors that players are quickly discovering. For anyone who thinks they would enjoy this type of game, who understands the pros and cons of purchasing an early access title and wish to further help Tethys with their development of Astral Terra, I DEFFINITELY reccomend picking up a copy when possible.","November 15, 2015","true","1.1"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","15","30","0","0"

Due to the game being in early access at the time of this review, the content available is minimal and only stands as a representative sample of the final product. Before talking about the game, I would like to say that the developers have managed to patch all bugs that I have encountered before writing this review and that the Early Access tag does not imply that the game is broken, but rather underdeveloped in content.\n\nThe current version of the game (0.4.2) offers the player a building/terraforming tool, an inventory, a crafting system, map, and class-specific character skills. I found the building tool to be overwhelming, and as a result I never used it aside from testing the feature and getting frustrated with its highly sensitive reading of the mouse. Maybe if the game had a tutorial or allowed the player to gain for building structures I would have found myself more inclined to use it, instead I just found myself thinking of Minecraft or even Fortress craft which feels much easier to use. The RPG elements of the game such as skills and combat are the defining features of this game among the other sandbox games offered on steam, but unfortunately these elements are absolutely useless in single player. Maybe PVP or aggressive mobs such as bosses will be available in future patches, but if so, your better off playing an MMO where you can take advantage of these elements in their proper environment. I should also mention that the game looks fantastic and it might be the strongest factor that this game has over its competitors. Unfortunately, better graphics results in a smaller amount of people able to play the game, and due to the game crashing after my graphics card updated, I dont see Astral Terra becoming nearly as populated as other sandbox games in the future.\n\nOverall, I think that Astral Terra is going through an identity crisis. While I acknowledge that the game is in early access and is not a finished product, I fail to see the target audience for this type of game. Those who want to build will simply go to games that provide established building mechanics, while fans of the combat and RPG elements will be better off playing MMOs where raids are plentiful, and classes + skills are more elaborated. For those who might fall into the middle of these two worlds, then maybe Astral Terra will be for you, but only if the other sandbox games such as RUST, DayZ, and H1N1 fail you entertain you.\n\nRating:\n5.8/10\n\nPros:\nHas enhanced graphics when compared to other sandbox games, looking very nice.\nHas crafting, building, and unique character classes and skills.\nCons:  Higher required specs which limits the amount of people that can run this game compared to other sandbox games.\nCurrently in Early Access, meaning that content is limited\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor PhilipsTrueColor3000TV   Headphones GradoSi80   Keyboard MicrosoftBasicKeyboard10A   Controller SteamController   Mouse RazerNaga2014   Microphone cheapbrandNA   Motherboard Motherboard   CPU AMDFX4170Quad-CoreProcessor420GHz   GPU GeForceGTX560SE   RAM 4GBx2CorsairVengence   OS Windows7SP1   HDD SeagateBarracudaST1000DM0031TB7200RPM","May 15","false","1.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I'm all for indie developers putting their stuff out into the world, but you guys may have bitten off a bit more than you can chew.\n\nThe controls are just... bad. Slow, confusing, and poorly designed - they need optimization, as does the rest of the game. I mean, you have to go back into your inventory to reassign a tool to a hotkey after you use it? Are you... are you serious with that?\n\nThe visuals are early 2000s, which is fine, you know, whatever... Minecraft and Shovel Knight have primitive looking visuals, and are both fun and charming. This is... neither. The cahracters look straight out of Asheron's Call, and that's not a compliment. Visual design needs either a proper cohesive theme, or it needs a complete redesign - either way, I'm on board.\n\nThat's the thing with Astral Terra - I can see what the devs are shooting for, and the view is pretty neat... but there's just not enough here yet.\n\nAnd, yeah - I know I only have a few minutes in game. It doesn't take very long to get turned off by poorly done controls and stale visuals. I'm still reccomending this one, though, because I think it might be really neat... someday.

The game feels very rough and unpolished. As of right now, I couldnt find much to do.

Im afraid I cant recommend this game as of May 2016.\n\nIt is true, however, that there are some positive and promising things about the game, like being able to select different characters, playing online, the music (or song, because everytime I started playing I could only hear the same one) and specially the way the devs are updating their game regularly, being true to their supporters. Because of this attitude, I will make sure to come back and check the game regularly, hopefully changing my recommendation to positive in the near future.\n\nRating:\n3.0/10\n\nPros:  Interesting concept\nDevs update the game regularly\nBeing able to choose between different characters\nCons:  Very early state and already on steam for 20€*\nNot really much to do as of right now\nThe UI is hard to use\nFeels more like a level editor than a game\nI also included "Having to sign up for a new account using our email address" as a negative aspect, but it was changed recently in the last update.

They might actually like it and decide to invest in this project of a game, but I would be lying if I said I could recommend it to anyone as of right now.\n\n*Early Access is fine as long as the game is somewhat fun.

Dont fall for it. This games development has been at a crawl for a really long time (way longer than its been on steam), and the "game" itself is little more than proof of concept or a tech demo. Considering that the game is never going to get done is it REALLY worth more than 2-3$? NO (look at my library.. i know more than a thing or two about early access). As for the experience itself, expect 2 min. of confusion followed by about 5 min. of exploration and then the rest of your life to be bored.\n\nAlso the devs are censorship gung-ho, which is always fun to deal with.. and they send emails like this to you:\n\n"Greetings Founders!
