Don't buy if you liked old FM.\n\nPros- The wanzers for all they're worth are really nicely rendered.\n\nConsBugs\n- Crashes, a lot. It's 2015 (at the time of the review) the game was created in 2010 and it still crashes because they didn't bother to fix its bugs forcing you to replay missions especially on foot sections.\n\nStory\n- The story is bottom barrel garbage. It's like an extremely incoherent version of the worst Gundam story mixed with a poor interpretation of Front Mission: Gunhazard's story mixed with a heavily Americanised story akin to modern FPS at the time. Instead of crafting a compelling side story in the universe of Front Mission we've come to know, we get the "it's a reboot" trope with everything starting in New York like in the movies, I'll let that sink in. It has no saving grace.\n\nSound and Audio\n- The sound and audio are mediocre at best nothing stands out. The game's score has that Hollywood feel which you'll recognise from the start screen and is extremely generic and lacklustre. It doesn't have the inventive score capacity displayed in the prior entries.\n\nWeapons\n- Wanzer weapons feel so underpowered, either that or the enemies are enormous bullet sponges.\n\nCustomisation\n- Customisation is garbage whether you're an old Front Mission fan or a newcomer. You earn money in levels to buy parts to customise your wanzer so it should be great and a saving grace right, wrong. Before buying parts you'd normally select the parts, see how it looks on your wanzer then look at its stats against what's currently equipped. Well you can see the stats but you don't get a preview of the part, all you get is a picture with poor resolution under the stats. So if you want to view it on you wanzer you'll have to waste money purchasing it and once you buy it there's no way to re-equip your previously equipped part unless you repurchase it...I'll let that sink in as well.\n- You can now paint each part(limb) separately, it sounds nice until you realise how much of a hassle it is. Each part can be coloured differently via a colour picker however it's rather fiddly and doesn't remember colours when you want to recolour  other parts so if you want to use the same shade of a colour throughout your wanzer good luck remembering and finding the colour.\n\nAI\n- Why do you even have companion AI partners if they're going to be utterly useless? Your partners basically do nothing throughout the game. Sure they can shoot the enemies but what's the point if they do no damage and I mean no damage at all. Here's an example, missiles do a decent amount of damage, 4 missiles can reduce basic enemy health by a 1/4 however when one of your partner fire their missiles full barrage of 4 the enemies take no damage...I kid you not. I stood behind a building (so that the enemy wouldn't agro on me) in amazement as my partner fired barrage after barrage and watched its health and it stayed at full health regardless.\n- Enemy AI is even worse than your partner's and I'm not taking in a dumb kind of way, I mean in an unfair kind of way. If there's a fire fight between your partners and enemies, the enemy AI's aim is potato but once you get into the picture their aim goes to pin-point laser assisted. Also they become affixed on you no matter what, disregarding your partners altogether.\n\nOn Foot Sections\n- The on foot sections are so generic, under developed and buggy I wonder as to why they were even included. When you dismount you're equipped with an assault rifle and a rocket launcher which can take down enemy wanzer with 4 shots Now you might be saying "4 shots that seems overpowered" and it is considering it takes 16 missiles while in wanzer to destroy basic enemy wanzer. Before anyone says "But, you could've dismount in FM3 and Gun Hazard" while true once you'd dismount you either had to run for your life or find an unpiloted wanzer as you're squishy and only eqipped with a pistol which did 1 point of damage. If it takes 4 rockets to take down a wanzer what's the point of being in wanzers to begin with.\n\nOut of place Wanzer Designs\n- The wanzers designed specifically for this game do not match the current long standing design the series has or is known for and come off as being out of place when compared. What you get is some more akin to concept sketch or anime with unnecessary sharp edges, curves and skulls as opposed to the rectanglular or circular constructs.\n\nVerdictYou know you're in for a rough ride from the beginning cutscene where they pronounce wanzer as wanzer instead of vanzer. I tried to like it but it's a terrible game with or without the FM series applied biases. It brings nothing new to the table while poorly accomplishing everything which existed prior. Everything about this game is a let down, from the incoherent story, poor customisation, forced game sections, on foot sections, generic audio offerings and unlikeable characters. Square-Enix should've had more confidence in itself and released a turn-based tactics game with the improvements which FM5 made as that was the most perfect version to date.\nCan I recommend this game to long-time FM fans who may think "that it's not that bad, right?", no. Can I recommend this game to mech fans  hoping for a new game to play, no. This game has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. If you're looking for a FM game to play do yourself a favour and play FM:Gun Harzard, FM3, FM4 or FM5 instead.","August 27, 2015","false","5.4"," 90 of 113 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","90","113","3","7"

NOTE: I never played a front mission game before, I know its more of a strategy game but I am basing it off what I was presented with ingame.\n\nGameplay: The combat in my opinion is VERY satisfying, explosions are loud, your enemys explode violently and their husks ragdoll to the ground. You can dismember enemies to weaken them or just shoot the center mass to kill them outright. I am pretty sure when you dismember them you weaken their overall armor but I only noticed this with the boss fights. Combat is pretty tough, I died 22 times throughout the campaign on normal You can also skate around like every japanese mech game ever which is basically when you slide around using jets and somehow not scraping up your mech's feet. Combat is somewhat on the faster pace with the skating with you and enemies and the general low health of both parties. Also the game does a good job making it feel like you are controlling a mech, with your mech stomping around when you are not skating and the screen shaking (not the bad shaking where aim is crap, the good shaking where your crosshair does not move) Most of the guns feel powerful aswell. Customization is fun and not that restrictive. You make a 'Wanzer' (from the German word "wanderpanzer"; wander for "walking, and panzer for "armor") using differant arms, legs, torsos, weapons and backpacks. I must admit I am disappointed at the lack of digitigrade legs and tank treads, but their is plenty of parts to choose from.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are nice, characters look like humans and the mechs look like mechs. Cities are detailed and blah blah its a game from the modern age all games look amazing nowadays. Enemies can lose limbs (well you blow off the armor to reveal the inner workings, which looks cool as hell)\n\nSound: The sound is good, the guns sound cool and explosions are loud. The voice acting sounds a bit weird at some points of the game, but its not that bad.\n\nStory: Alright time for the story, you play as Dylan Ramsey as an engineer working to make wanzer prototypes and while going on a test run, some  major sh!t goes down in New York. Time to head into battle with little thought! You mainly are looking for your father but its kinda dangerous because enemy wanzers, troops and tanks want you very dead. That's about as far as I will go with story because I don't wanna ruin it. The story was not the best in my opion but it kept me intrested all the way through, course it has everything from violance to romance (lots of ♥♥♥♥ blocking, may I add. (why is that word blocked? What if I use it in a non vulgar way such as setting up a gun for firing?)) I also will add that the bosses are puss!es and run away alot, BUT when you do kill them its sastifying.\n\nConclusion: I went in with low expectations, but I was pleased. The game is fun and I played all the way through in one go. The game is 6 (My profile says 5.9 so I am rounding) hours long, this includes retries from death. I do have a complaint for the story, difficulty spikes and some cliche crap here and there, but I had fun, that's all that matters, right? I never played Front Mission before and I know this game is very differant from all the others as the others are turn based strategy and this is a thirst person shooter. I can see how fans of the series can be disappointed but I say, atleast give this game a chance. I give it an 8/10.","January 1, 2014","true","9.8"," 57 of 76 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","57","76","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apap/recommended/43000/","apap","Apap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apap/","76 products in account","Well, this game turned out to be a disappointment.\n\nI bought it remembering the amazing experience I had with Front Mission III on the original PlayStation. Sadly, this can hardly be compared, let alone even be called a FM game. While FM III was a turn strategy RPG, FM Evolved is a third-person shooter - a rather huge step away from the franchhise's original concept. However, this alone would not bother me that much, provided that the game was enjoyable. Sadly, this was not the case. Here's a list of 10 things that in my opinion make this game a failure:\n\n1. Generic plot - insert "save the world" template here and supplement it with a handful of overused cliches.\n2. Boring characters - a yet another bunch of two-dimensional cliches you couldn't care less about.\n3. Unconvincing voice acting - there is more emotion in the sound of a flushing toilet than in the voices you hear in this game.\n4. Failed customization - even though there is a variety of wanzer models and parts to choose from, the default model is so OP in comparison that you will always go for it.\n5. Annoying enemy AI - this game should be called "Dylan must die" because every single enemy is hellbound on targeting you. It doesn't matter how many allies you have in the mission or how much closer they are to the enemy than you - every single hostile unit will aim and shoot at you regardless of the distance or circumstances.\n6. Failed role system - because of the enemy AI, you basically cannot play as anything other than mid-to-short range brawler. Wanted to play as a sniper? Forget it - the enemy will never leave you alone, regardless of the difficulty level.\n7. Annoying bosses - fighting bosses is almost entirely luck-dependent as most of them have one or two ridiculous attacks that you can either hardly avoid and/or survive.\n8. Failed ally AI - your allies are useless. Completely and always.\n9. Human mode glitches - when running around as a human, prepare for some uncooperative controls and random kicks to Windows.\n10. Lack of a save option - the biggest failure this game has to offer. You simply cannot save by yourself and are subject to the mercy of the autosave and elusive check points. You will have to replay a lot when the game kicks you out to Win, and trust you me that it freakin' will.\n\nNot worth your time.","February 21, 2015","false","10.3"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","39","48","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/43000/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Summary:Front Mission Evolved is a third-person mech action game published by Square Enix. Overall it's something I'd expect from perfectly average game. Graphics and sounds are ok, whole action part is just about shooting and punching tanks and big mechs while controlling a big mech (except the on-foot parts). It's not a bad game but it doesn't deserve a recommendation at all as there are so many better games in TPS action genre.\n\nPros:- Average gameplay. Don't expect something to get really excited at, just shoot or punch everything and try to enjoy it as much as you can.\n- Modify your mech. More assault rifles, more rocket launchers,... or just a better design, spray mechs like your cars in Need for Speed style! Or if you just don't want to customize your mech, you can select a premade one.\n- Steam achievements.\n\nCons:- Partners' AI. Don't expect much help from them, enemies will even focus on you anytime. They don't die, they don't help. They want to watch and make you feel like you are not alone.\n- Story. Just expect cringeworthy and really uninteresting story, this game is based on action.\n- Dead multiplayer.\n- Linear campaign progress. That wouldn't be bad if it wasn't so obvious. You just see that's always "beat those enemies to move to another sector".\n- Average gameplay. You can spend your money better, buy this only if you are really bored and there's nothing better on sale.","January 2","false","1.9"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","32","42","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedudered/recommended/43000/","thedudered","RED Floyd /(Weber)\","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedudered/","414 products in account","This game is abyssmal. The only reason why I finished was because I put money in it and I didn't want it to be wasted. With that said let's get to the trial. Where to begin; it's boring, I just wanted to quit halfway through the game, but you know, money spent, and with that said lets get down to the boring aspects. My biggest gripe is the weapon system, a single gun alone is underpowered, I went into battle weilding two, in addition Front Mission Evolved puts an emphasis on shooting body parts, such destroyed body parts leave the enemy at a disadvantage, which really doesn't matter because you blow them apart seconds later for the effect to be relevant.\n\nThe gameplay is very linear, the game won't let you play certain missions unless you have a sniper rifle, kind of legs or something or other. The controls are also pretty clunky, mouse movement is fine but the controls on your keyboard are a different story.\n\nSpeaking of which, you get a relatively small variety of weapons, rifles, SMG's, swords, sniper rifles, shotguns, and shields (why the ♥♥♥♥ are these here?), but you also get should mounted weaponry, which are pretty nice, mainly missile launchers, rockets, miniguns. These help out a lot, because as I cannot stress enough, your guns are pretty weak. Not to mention the sniper rifle is useless in boss fights and around the end of the game. The guns also have an overheat system, as do the shoulder weaponry, pretty annoying, like the SKATE's recharge. However you can also utilize just a sword and shield if you want a swordsman style gameplay but I'll touch upon that later.\n\nThen comes along the movement system, walking is mind numbingly slow, as such the only way to get around is to use the SKATE System, and the disadvantages mean life or death in some cases, burning out the entire charge for SKATE forces you wait 8 seconds for a recharge (or less depending on customization), a lot of stuff can go down in the time, especially near the end of the game, and that's time nobody has either! You also get the EDGE system, time slows down, you become invulnerable and deal out godly amounts of damage, the EDGE system is recharged through fighting.\n\nThe enemies are all cookie cutter-type enemies, they pose no challenge, little threat, their just...there pretty much, yet they remain durable enough for me to need two guns, at times a new type will be introduced but really it's just the same thing with a different gun or body type. This all makes the combat and gameplay repetitive, as the only things getting changed up don't make an impact, and there are no enemies that try something dramatic or pull a twist., it's 5 types, they're all fodder. There's also bosses, and around the end you fight 4 you met earlier and you fight them alone, pretty darn difficult, only interesting moment really.\n\nThe story, CLICHES GALORE and it's dull and typical like a lot of things Hollywood pumps out. Unknown bad guy decides to be a terrorist and destroys space elevators to make a statement about the world, and the young perky engineer guy (protagonist) must rise and stop him. No plot twists, it's just...bland. Which brings me to the characters! Oh boy are you in for a treat! One dimensional! The characters don't change, they don't adopt new viewpoints, get different outlooks on life, you know the symptoms, voice acting is fine, but the catchphrases are a pain. Hope you like cutscenes, you'll get endless amounts to progress the story.\n\nWith that said lets get down to the maps, LINEAR ON-RAILS SHOOTER HO! Summarized it, you're forced down a path with the same enemies (stated earlier) all to get to something. With occassional breaks into large areas to move around and fight enemies, bosses, only to be shoved down the same forward path again. But it's got collectables laden along the way, a ♥♥♥♥ton, have fun finding 20 sensor nodes in nooks, crannies, you name it. However there are three emblems per level, these unlock decals and emblems for your mech, basically the only collectables that matter.\n\nNow from time to time, you won't be fighting in a mech you'll sometimes be on foot in third person, and the weapons selection is small, rifle, rocket launcher, shotgun, grenades, and the enemies this time around are just as cookie cutter! The on-foot segments are a change of pace, but they don't break the monotony, as it all delves back into the same formula as when driving a mech. Same goes for gunship landing segments, however, I did find those a bit fun, mainly because I got guns that were actually powerful, but it all boils down to 'circle area, and land.'\n\nAre we done? Nope! Remember when I mentioned that bit about swordsman style, well were getting into customization! Now to the games credit, customization is pretty nice (of course, they posted it all over the videos and pics). You get to compare weapons, body types (this is the armor), backpacks, legs and arms, and really you can customize to some pretty big lengths. There are three types of legs, bi-pedal, multi-leg, and hover, their all just about the same though as what really matters is the skate system, but multi-leg does let you carry more heavier weaponry while hover gives you more manuvering. You can change up your weapons to become like, a dual sword weilding person, a heavy sniper, or just do what I did and fit as much OP stuff on as possible.\n\nBackpacks give you all kinds of benefits, more energy for SKATE, anti-missile systems, more power for carrying heavier weaponry, faster recharge, movement and such, and the game won't force you to use a certain kind of backpack for missions. And while were on customization, you can choose decals, colors, you know the jist.\n\nBut the biggest incriminating factor about this game is the fact it has multiplayer, BUT NO ONE PLAYS IT, it's dead. makes the DLC pretty useless, along with the customization and decals mentioned earlier. Also to addon is that the end of the game, the final part, is very unforgiving.\nAll this combines to make little to no-replayability.\nThe designs and looks of the mechs are pretty nice though, that's the only redeeming factor.\n\nTL;DR: Front Mission Evolved is boring, linear, on-rails, and it's a massive time sink for such boredom, multiplayer is non-existant, the story is dry and flat, and it's all stuffed behind pretty graphics. Don't buy it. It's not worth anything.","December 10, 2013","false","8.1"," 63 of 96 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","63","96","0","7"

Each of those weapons and parts can equipped with skills cards (of some sort) to enhance your arsenal's ability like explosive ammunition and so on (though they are pretty limited. The E.D.G.E system is basically the Devil Trigger so okay.\nThe third person part is pretty simple; you got your rifle, shotgun, rocket launcher and grenade at your disposal but no personal collection of your own weapons so no customization here.\n\nGameplay 6/10:  Most of the time you'll be killing wanzers or blow stuff up either as a wanzer yourself or occasionally, a turret section from a carrier. The boss battles aren't as varied as most of them just behave like any other wanzer, just more aggressive and equipped with better weapons.

There are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of collectables, which is how you both gain new skills (hint: these are very handy) and cash (which is also handy, even though the cash system in this game is kind of a trainwreck?).\n\nDo you want to track down, and this is not a joke, an average of 23+ items PER LEVEL?

Not the best title I've seen in most mech shooters but I will tell you this before I start dropping bombs of disappointment; for a long time I watched a lot of Gundam and I technically count as still a fan. I will however admit the characters in that show were so lifeless, or just uncreative, no offense to any fans of the franchise but let's be honest. Romance in an all out mech war? I'm not a big anime fan, but come on let's get some armor crunching and guns blazing going on here!\n\nNow before I go on a rant off this topic let's get down to the story, you're probably thinking "Wow! this game has giant mechs tearing into each other and blowing ♥♥♥♥ up like crazy! EPIC!!!" well unfortunately no.\n\nLike in Gundam the characters are either hot headed dumb asses that rush into battle without any plan as to what in the hell they're doing. Or they're negative, boring, cold, and just unreconizable. I hate it when characters are just badly scripted or written out to be this "mysterious badass" it's not like I don't like those characters it just depends on how well you can write a good character to be that way.\n\nThe plot: not much to it really, in fact none of it is really that important or interesting in the least. But for players who don't want it spoiled: basically what happens is humanity builds continent sized space stations that have the occasional boarder lands battle or two, nothing too serious just humans being humans. So they replaced the military with giant mechs named "wanzers" yeah I know it's a stupid name to call a mech if anything it sounds like a lot like Robin  "jee wowzers Batman!"\n\nHowever a random terrorist group attacks New York and later completely destroys it. You then play as some stupid kid that constantly rushes into fights without a second thought named Dylan.\n\nSo Dylan later finds out his father has been assumed killed in the assault on New York he then vows he will strike a blow for vengeance on the terrorists that murdered his father. And what better way is there to claim revenge? he of course joins up with the army! actually they walked up to him and just said "hey kid, wanna join the military?"  because that's how recruitment works... he then blows everyone in his path to kingdom come!\n\nYou will later fight different mentally disabled bosses along the way and eventually when progressing in the game Dylan will get involved in the most awkward randomist romance I've ever seen in a game. Yeah I don't know who was writing this thing but obviously he/she did not watch Gundam wing or Gundam X.\n\nSeriously! a cookie cutter romance in a 3rd person mech shooter? if it was a 3rd person mech shooting RPG then I might give it a pass. But shooters and romance don't normally mix very well together, like Halo 4 for example, however that had more "awwww" moments like Mass Effect but also had "why the hell is this in my first person shooter Halo game?!" moments.\n\nIn the end Dylan just randomly decides his Pheromones were stronger than his logic and hooks up with that ♥♥♥♥♥ that constantly yells at you to do stuff in the start of the game, whether you like her or not, you're stuck with her! and to those who have played Mass Effect imagine it like Miranda was the ONLY romance option in the entire game....Yeah, no thanks...\n\nMultiplayer: it's not "perfect" but it's a hell of a lot of fun to play,  when you get decent gear and weapons of course  it's more fun than the crappy campaign they gave us I'll tell you that much. However due to the lack of people playing the game finding a match is like digging in your back yard for hours looking for dinosaur bones  and no, you are not in China so your chances of finding at least a Tooth is slim to damn nill.\n\nBut if you can convince your friends or your girl friend to play this game you won't regret blowing off some steam in a giant mech twice the size of my Kia.\n\nNow for character customization. Yes there are tons of parts to use but they can only be unlocked through multiplayer or story mode. And since barely anyone has a match up you will not be getting the parts you want unless you open up a group on steam or you get people you know to play it. Either one is challenging so pick your poison. Also one of the problems with gear in this game is; you can't cross campaign mode character progress such as armor and weapons to multiplayer. This of course results in newer players being nothing more but cannon fodder until you farm for better parts within ranked multiplayer matches.\n\nFinal verdict: this game get's a solid 6/10, it could have been a 7 or 8 if the story was at least half decent but that's my opinion on the game. Now does it belong in your library? that's your choice to decide. But I suggest getting this game while on sale before thinking too heavily on it.\n\nI however only suggest it to any loyal mech fans like me but only as a last ditch choice if you don't like Hawken or any other Mech shooter out there. Because trust me, this game is not a "MUST HAVE!" it's a cheap game you can look at if you are completely out of games to play or a game you might seriously consider getting. but it is not an epic mech shooter like a Gundam game would be like so don't expect some awesome showdown like Gundam had becuase most of the time the bosses are a pain in the ♥♥♥ and feel like a chore fighting.\n\nSo until a decent Gundam related mech shooter is released or better yet a Gundam game entirely I suggest this game to mech fans out there, but again only as a last resort!","June 20, 2014","true","29.7"," 35 of 52 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","35","52","0","2"

Also, if you are on the fence about this game then you are probably better off not buying it.\n\nTo be blunt, this game is not remarkable, but it does provide a taste of 3rd-person wanzer piloting that I've often dreamed of.\n\nCustomization\nWanzer customization has always been central to Front Mission games and fortunately this one doesn't fail to deliver.  You have a reasonable selection from which to customize your wanzer parts, weapons, abilities, etc.  You can set yourself up to be a slow tank, a thin-skinned but swift machine or anything in between.  Then you can choose between a variety of weapons including assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, grenade launchers, missile launchers and more.  There are also backpacks that add certain perks.\n\nThe color scheme editor allows a great level of customization as well.\n\nCampaign\nThe story isn't amazing but it gets the job done.  You'll work your way through the missions, experiencing a variety of challenges as you go.  Certain missions demand specific loadouts and there is no single loadout that works under ALL circumstances.\n\nAlthough there are some challenging moments the game is relatively easily, except when it comes to some boss fights in which the bosses can seem massively overpowered.  At this point you'll probably need to read a guide to learn what the best loadout is and what tactics to use for the battle.\n\nThere are segments occasionally in which you are in your wanzer while loaded into the drop-heli with dual chainguns and missiles that you get to use to unleash hellfire on enemies.  That's always fun.\n\nCombat\nThe combat is entertaining.  Skating around enemies while blasting them with a variety of weapons and locking on with your homing missiles while using your own jetpack to dodge enemy fire can be rather fun.  However, the controls will take a little time to master before you can get to this point.\n\nEnvironment\nThe environments leave a little to be desired.  They kind of remind me of Armored Core levels on Playstation 2 which always felt somewhat empty and lifeless.  At the same time, they aren't entirely uninspired.\n\nMultiplayer\nMultiplayer is dead, sadly.  I bought the Last Stand DLC because I love that type of game mode, but unfortunately I've never been able to play it with another player.  You can play it alone, but you get no XP for upgrades and it is rather monotonous making it completely pointless.","September 19, 2015","true","13.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

The story is the most cliche'd nonsense conceived.  Things happen, no real believable development and it sounds like an 80s cartoon with so much focus on the gameplay gimmick, all wrapped up in your standard pretentious references.  The acting is bad, but ....given what's there.. can't be expected to be better.\n\n2.  Given it's essentially Armored Core lite, you would think they would stick with the gameplay in the former series, but nope.. not a chance.  The part selection is rather shallow, the AI is somehow dumber than in the former series, your partners aren't good for anything and the most serious fault is the on foot sections.  Why include the onfoot sections?  They are an interesting idea, but the execution is like an afterthought.  The control/feel for the on foot section is really bad.  You could call the overall mech game weak, but the onfoot sections are terrible.  At least the aiming in the mech sections is forgiveable.\n\n3.  The sound effects in this game is straight out of Transformers the movie.  It is terrible, nonsensicle and has such a presence that I was annoyed from start to finish.  The music is generic "epic" and forgettable.\n\n4.  I played through the campaign and resolved to uninstall it right away, so I have not tried the multiplayer.  The mech sections were not that compelling, so I don't think whatever community happens to be there would be worth my time.","December 13, 2015","false","8.5"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","21","33","0","0"

After playing the first two levels you will have seen all of what the game has to offer. It only gets worse from there though with a poor attempt at "variety". Turret sections and then still worse is on foot sections that feel like what i'd expect out of a mobile game from 5 years ago.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=637472065\n\nIf you stick with it what you're in for is a cliched story, poor music, graphics, voice acting and absolute crap level design.\n\nOnly square enix could think it would be a good idea to put all its marbles on expanding the franchise by turning the series known for its turn based strategy elements/depth into a shallow outsourced one off failure of a action game that desperately tries to appeal to a western audience.\n\nThis is one of the worst handled franchises by square enix, even though most of the games never came to the west they ended up being fan translated. FM: Gun Hazard (snes) spinoff from 20 years ago offers far more compelling story/gameplay/mech building then this game does.\n\nOnly reason i even powered through this is because i had a morbid curiosity of seeing how bad this abomination was and what killed off front mission for good.

The torso, each respective arms, and the legs. While the torso represents the main health, each other part will contribute to your Combat Abilities. You break them, your ability to fight will become that much more crippled.\nNow this will mean you need to play smart. Seriously smart.  I won't joke around when I say   Mobility   is  a  Key   factor in this game.\n\nYour Wanzer's ability to  Skate  around is your most powerful tool the Controller can utilise.\nThat being said, if your Legs (aka, your Skating Mobility) gets destroyed, you'll be crippled like a horse missing a leg.   You're gonna have a bad time.  So better get looking for a health pack!\nThe main reason why I emphasize the importance of Mobility is because you can  Quite Literally,  dodge  Everything.\n'Oh, are those a trail of Machine Gun Bullets aimed at me? Let me keep dashing to the side!'\n'Huh, is there a shower of Mortal coming down from the sky? Better Skate out of the way!'\n'Grrr, is that a suicide brawler after my ♥♥♥? Better Kite backwards while shooting!'\n'Ah, is that a series of Homing Missiles Locked onto me? I think I should Stutter-Step left and right!'\n\nOn top of that, anytime during the game, when you realize that a certain Arsenal of Weapon Choice isn't working out and frustrating you,  You Can Change It Midgame.\nYes, I said that right; you can ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ change your Loadout during the middle of the mission without restarting it.\nAs a gamer that enjoys trying each type of weapon available, I can't emphasize how grateful this  Privilege	 the developers have implemented into the game. It shows a great understanding for perspective on our behalf.\nGone are the days where you need to restart the game to change your playstyle!  … Oops, I forgot that Triple A Developers now Suck Again Q.Q\n\n☆ ★ ☆ ★ ☆\nBut there are some few problems…\nGeneric Characters. Linear Story. Cut Paste Voice Acting. Companion Battle Ai Non-existent. Lack of NG+.\nBosses can get sometimes infuriating at some OP things (but the game does its part in stepping stones to teach you how to overcome it.)\nThe Core Item Drops of Energy refills are missing for 95% of the game. I believe the flexibility of the Game could’ve improved so much more if that was available.\nMultiplayer is dead. Q.Q I want my achievements pl0x!!! No other Single Player Options besides the Campaign too (least give me Survival Mode or something).\n☆ ★ ☆ ★ ☆\nNow back to the good points!\nDid I mention you can Customize the look of your Wanzer?! :D  Not by a lot doh..  A nice touch if I do say so myself.\nDid I mention that you feel like you’re in an actually 60-Feet Suit of Metal and Armor? You can actively Crush things beneath your feet! (Sure there’s isn’t much to even step on…) But still! The fact that you have  only a few  destructible debris is so trilling!  (Although I’m srlly peeved at how I’m able to Crush Cars when I walk over them but my 16”Caliber Guns can’t leave a dent… oh well #2010problems)\nThe Intro and Final Cutscenes were just really Cool in the perspective of a Mecha Anime Watcher. The Orbital Tower Defense Laser was really awesome to watch. The Big weapon that took it down was also really cool to see (despite we never being able to see it again later). While the ending thing really reminded me of the one scene from Gundam Seed (Destiny?). Quite Touching, really. Cue  Kimi Wa Boku Ni Niteiru. [ https]\nSo although you don’t quite feel like Jesus Yamato from the Gundam Seed Series.\nI did quite feel like Suzaku Kururugi from Code Geass (Season One) with the excellent Mobility of the Knightmare Frames.\n☆ ★ ☆ ★ ☆\nConclusion:\nMecha Fans will really like this. But to fully understand the Gameplay, you need to play Smart and keep your Cool.\n“Know thy self, know thy enemy.

But that is not the main reason why this Front Mission is mediocre.\n\nThe gameplay is easy to catch-up and to play, I really enjoyed how the game played; nothing wrong here.\n\nThe wanzers we see are all from the series (except one or two), so you can somehow relate that you are playing a Front Mission game, even though their designs are ugly (I speak of the Grille Sechs for example).\n\nThe story could be good if it was longer and with well written dialogue. Character progression is weak and seems a lot happens of the screen. One second you meet Adela and she hates you, then on the next mission she is jealous of Dylan’s old friend and apparently now loves Dylan? Also Dylan gets involved into the UCS military no questions asked I mean … it makes no damn sense. Characters die for no reason, are enemies in one mission and on the next are you best friends …. In the end, the story is really bad written, full of clichés, and does not make up to the series.\n\nAlso the characters have no personality that makes us love them or hate them. They look like random guys with names and no propose.\n\nAlso since the multiplayer is down, there is nothing to do after you complete the short and bad single player story.\n\nIn the end, Front Mission Online is a better Front Mission 3rd person shooter than Front Mission Evolved.

Obvious genre bender might seem as a surprise, but it's not the first time the franchise had a spin-off title, it's the fact that the execution of TPS gameplay seems clunky is what really brings the game down from a mechanical standpoint. Especially the completely tacked on infantry levels which were obviously an afterthought and come close second to the annoyance that are rocket-sponge bosses who will test your patience towards the end. Overall pacing of the game is also very lacking and at times it seems as if there are entire chapters missing which would've facilitated smoother flow instead of the current rushed narrative.\n\nSpeaking of which, the story is probably the greatest offender in the entire game and takes a very liberal, but ultimately misunderstood take on the existing setting. No tropes or cliches are left unchecked as the story forgoes franchise's signature politics-heavy approach in favor of merely dropping acronyms whenever it can and expecting you to give a damn as you follow a very bland main character doing his revenge thing which never evolves into anything beyond that very simple concept. Characters at large aren't treated any better and just fill the utterly predictable archetype role, especially the villains who are so by-the-numbers I first thought it was perhaps some kind of irony at work. You will forget what you went through the moment you finish the game and be glad you'll never again have to deal with all the manufactured EDGE drama.","December 1, 2013","false","9.1"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

You really had to work for your victories and fine-tuning your pilot's skills meshed well with the mix-and-match style of Wanzer design.  I always looked forward to playing Front Mission games, even picking up the original "remix" version for the Nintendo DS.\n\nHaving said this, I must testify that Front Mission Evolved betrays the classic formula that made the original Front Mission games so great.  Instead of giving us Front Mission 4, which looked absolutely fantastic, they gave us this ridiculously lame version of From Software's Armored Core.  None of the DLC makes a damned bit of difference, the controls are just terrible, the action is awkward, making you find little things around the map in order to get bonus achievements is idiotic and not fun, and the interface is a complete mess and very awkward.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoL0sS/recommended/43000/","CoL0sS","Baby Spice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoL0sS/","460 products in account","Front Mission: Evolved rides on a coattails of a beloved franchise which sold pretty well in Japan and had a decent following in the West; but where previous titles were tactical RPG's this one has been hit with a "borad appeal" mallet and is now a third-person shooter.\n\nPutting you into a cockpit of a bipedal mech toting machine guns and shoulder-mounted rocket launchers sounds amazing and has a great cathartic potential, but some annoying bugs and strange design decisions make this whole experience a chore. First of all, I have a problem with the amining-recticule. Now that may seem like a strange nitpick, but aiming recticule is surrounded by an unecessary transparent rectangle taking about 10% of the screen which\ngets in the way of you shooting things and spotting various collectibles (all of which do nothing except provide you with a small monetary bonus after you collect a set number of them). While on the subject of "getting in the way of fun" - AI partners. For most of the missions game partners you with a AI controlled Wanzer (basically another name for a mech) which I think were supposed to help you in larger battles by drawing aggro and damaging opponents, but they actually end up blocking your movement and line or sight while contributing nothing except stating the obvious (Yes, I realize my armor is low because my Wanzer is on fire thank you very much).\n\n\nCombat is mediocre at best, lacking any depth and ticking off every third-person shooter trope in the book. Your objective in every mission is to shoot stuff until it explodes or stops shooting back, which is unfortunate because with a bit of tweaking it could've been really interesting. You see, consecutive shots in your arms and especially legs can easily cripple you; and in the case of legs, severely hamper your mobility. This will cause you to move at a snails pace until your next health pickup esentially making you a sitting duck for all enemies in the area. While really frustrating it wouldn't be a problem if you could do that same thing to your enemies, but (and it could just be due to the higher difficulty level), I've never managed to do that making that whole mechanic feel kinda cheap. It also serves to highlight how much\nlimiting "skating"; a fast sliding maneuvre, can really interrupt the flow of combat by making you wait for a couple of seconds in cover while the appropriate meter or even your armor recharges. You can argue that this forces you to take a more tactical approach by using it sparingly; only to dash from cover to cover, but I'd argue that if you're gonna base all your missions on blowing stuff up, you might as well make the player feel like a complete badass by allowing him to blaze through it at high speed. Besides, by using slide, you're always sacrificing accuracy for higher mobility and compensating for that requires a certain dose of skill.\n\nTo devs credit, they tried mixing things up by throwing different kinds of enemies at you along with the occasional turret section, and, god help them, on-foot segment. These only serve to highlight the rest of the game because nothing makes you lament for that mediocre mech combat like playing utterly awful third-person shooter for a few minutes. Boss fights are dull, unimaginative and sometimes downright frustrating with bullet-spongey bosses making the whole affair an endurance run, as you circle strafe around them holding every shoot button available and offering prayers to any god that'll hear you that they go down before you do. Oh, and if you thought that facing a single bullet-spongey boss was an exercise in attrition, good luck facing four of them which game will generously throw at you at one point.\n\n\nAbility to customize your Wanzer to your linking is the only decent part of the experience and even that is offset by game forcing you to use specific parts for some missions, and the aforementioned on-foot sections.

No, obviously. Though Front Mission has roots in Turn-Based Strategy, Evolved is an Action game, more akin to Armored Core or Mech Assault.\n\nIs this an objectively BAD game? No. At the VERY worst, it's average. At best, it's pretty good.

Mech section, turret section, and on foot section.\n\nTurret section is like evrey turret section since the ps1/N64 era.\n\nOn foot section is also severly lacking in a good design and feel. It plays a lot like Mass Effect 1 with worse graphics and no special abilities.\n\nThe mech section is the main section and it plays basically like an armored core game. Just with a miniscule of the customization options.\n\nHowever the deathknell for this game is that the turret and on foot sections aren't included in the gameplay loop. You can't customize anything about these parts and so they are basically seperate games within your game.\n\nThe story does not convey the complexity of this world's cosmology. Instead it focuses on a very typical power-fantasy narrative. Very little is done in service of the game's extremely rich and detailed setting.\n\nAlso, the voice acting is among the worst I've ever heard in the xbox360/ps3 era. The main character literally uses a stereotypical homosexual accent when picking up powerups while on foot. (what's up with that ??). And one of the "old man" characters sounds like he is a 22 year old putting on an old man voice.\n\nAnd the boss fights are extremely tedious. They just last too long. and They feel like they are made for a particular loadout in mind (To an extreme degree).\n\nThere is a high liklihood of dissapointment if you come to this game with any expectations.","January 31","false","6.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoGalaxy/recommended/43000/","NeoGalaxy","[EDF] Shadow Dragon™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoGalaxy/","444 products in account","I was curious about this game since it was with mechs, and there are quite fewer of these games these days. But after playing for like 10 hours, the dissapointment got the best of me. Let me explain:\n\n- the graphics... wow this game sucks. The mech models... use the trash bin please. The heroes... almost all scare me, with their uglyness. The world around me, sad and with no life at all, also very very lame designed.\n- the mechs are decent in design, very bad thou model design thou, but hell the customization is quite nice since you can play either melee, ranged or both, as you see fit. The weapon design is nice, every weapon works like it should and the missiles are awesome well implemented but the customization menul is let's say spartan and very strict.\n- the boss fights are boring, sadly one after each other... they get from bad to worse, because each boss has 5-10 times more armour (thus life) than you, while having different skills you will never have in-game. At some point, the bosses you're going to fight will have way better weapons than you and 10-20 times more armour than you, which will make the fights less about skill and more about random hits and random luck. I almost gave up when I hard to fight against 2 very very powerfull lady bosses, with impressive mechs, and I can't lie... but I lost almost 12 fights... while trying differet setups.\n\nIn regard with the graphics, let's be blund, it sucks. There are no details that are really interesting to watch, the whole surroundings is pretty much barren, with very bad details, even so the video power drain is quite big for a game that offers little in return.\n\nThe weapons are nice, some are really good, but the boss fights make everything less than interesting. Maybe a better balance of these bosses will make the fights more interesting. The weapon and mech customization is good, you can choose a lot but the menu in itself is badly designed and implemented in the game. For each mission you can also use a standard mech design and customizations, but in some missions are you forced to use a specific part or mech.\n\nThere's some items you can find in every map, but I am sorry to say it's not really worth it. Also it's very very hard to see those items. The sensors or the emblems do not appear on the radar, but some are easy to find while others... well let's say hard to find. Also if you don't have the right mech or the right backpack, you might not be able to reach a sensor or an emblem.\n\nTo be honest the story is lame, the graphics a nightmare but playing with a customized mech is quite nice, if you ignore everything else.\n\nSadly the score is 4/10, but I will do my best to finish it. I haven't tried the MP, I don't think anyone is even playing in MP, these days.","November 26, 2015","false","17.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Poor voice acting deadens what little emotional impact is written into the well animated cutscenes. There was so much potential here, and the port itself runs quite well.\n\nThis doesn't 'feel' like a Front Mission game. Is it the UI? the mechs? customization? story? Probably all of the above. Yes the wanzers you know from games past are lovingly modeled from other games in the franchise, and interesting mechanics like dashing are integrated well into real time dynamic first person combat.\n\nIt's just so ... dull, and that's not enough to warrant a sale when there are so many surperior titles available. A shameful, boring PC port that does not lend any credence to the franchise.

If it had been done well, I would have been all for it. Unfortunately, the transition has been anything but smooth: the game tries to implement TPS gameplay with features carried over from the strategy days, such as weapon classifications and the maths system. The result is an unnecessarily clunky mess that attempts to appeal to both the veterans of Front Mission as well as new gamers, and succeeding at neither.\n\nCombine the waywards mechanics with uninspiring and repetitive gameplay, writing straight out of the worst of animes, terrible voice acting, outdated graphics even for the time, and even spunkgargleweewee elements (the game begins with New York being under attack, no kidding), and you've got yourself a boring shambles that cannot be recommended to Front Mission fans, action gamers, shooter fans, mech fans or anyone else imaginable.

Very. Japanese.\n\nIt's bad enough it's a game about giant mechs (not that I have anything against games with giant mechs) but Front Mission Evolved seems to be making a point to hit every single anime cliche that it can. Young man inexplicably talented at war suddenly drafted into the front lines of the conflict. Revenge for the death of a family member. The brunette love interest and the geeky girl with glasses. "Meaningful" sacrifices of a friend and unexpected reversals of fortune. Giant bosses unsurprisingly hampered by giant orange weak-points. It's unsophisticated, sophomoric pabulum that makes the Modern Warfare franchise look deep in comparison. Aging graphics, uninspired sound design and dull level design don't help. The combat is colorful but the levels are too constricted and linear. The third-person camera too often wedges into a corner leaving me with a useless view of my mech's (sorry, my /wanzer/'s) back. And the boss fights go on forever.\n\nFME's only saving grace is that, ultimately, it does involve giant robots, and it's hard to hate any games involving 100-ton walking death machines. But that's barely enough to keep one playing; it certainly doesn't warrant a recommendation. It's trite, unimaginative and poorly designed. But, sadly, that seems par for the course for Japanese video games.","November 25, 2013","false","4.8"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

The mechs are cool enough, and the basic combat works nicely, but the whole thing comes off as just a little too linear and a little too scripted.\n\nIn a certain sense, I think the title suffers because it can manage to evoke shades of the "Armored Core" series. In doing so, it whets your appetite for things that just aren't going to be delivered. "Armored Core" had extensive customization, lots of opportunities for free-form movement in the environments, and pretty deep combat. "Front Mission Evolved," on the other hand, has much more limited customization, environments that are often rather constrained, and relatively simplistic battle.\n\nThis game works well enough as a "my first Armored Core" sort of experience, but it could have been more than it is.","January 29, 2015","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is nothing like that, it's a third person shooter all the way, but as long as you realize that going in then there is really nothing to complain about.\n\nAs a shooter it's your standard fare.  Nothing special, nothing terrible.  As a FM game it has all the wanzers and customization you are used to (Grapple, Whisk, Husky, all the chassis make an appearance) with full ability to change colour, matte, decals, weapons, backpacks, battle skills etc.\n\nThe story is what you would expect from a FM game, a political intrigue about war, double crosses,  red herrings and military fiascos all with a plot about a young man trying to avenge the death of his father.  Is his father really dead, did the OCU and Da Han Zhong really start the war?  What is going on?  It's all your classic FM storyline which is paired with some well done cut scenes.\n\nIf you loved the previous FM games, and I'm sure many of you are fanatics about FM 3 and FM 4, and you don't mind taking direct control of the wanzer instead of having the strategy element, then you won't be let down.  If not, then fire up FM 3 and have Kazuki take on Lukav one more time, or guide Darril and Renges through South America and lead a revolution in FM 4.\n\nAll in all, for a FM fan, it's well worth the $10 as long as you know what you are getting going in.","January 10, 2015","true","28.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the modern graphical options are on display and the game supports Steam Overlay.  With multiplayer and controller support included, as well as fully customizable mechs make this game money well spent.  If I had to criticize one aspect of the game it would be it's rather uninspired music soundtrack, and a sort of console polish that is shared by games like Prototype and Darksiders.  In other words, the game can feel quite linear and the cutscenes tend to be overly long for my tastes.

This isn't bad cause it helps bring new players in, the problem falls on they tried cramming in a 60+ hour series storyline into a measly 4-5 hour game. The overdramatic touches the nonsensical characters. It all felt very harsh when you're chopping it all together. In a bigger more flesh out game this might have been a ok storyline, here ur better off skipping the cs's.\n\nGameplay: As far as mech games go, this one tries to hard to be a cross between "Armored Core" and "Third person shooter". It's nice that they added in the look and customization of the previous FM games, but the gameplay has become a almost bland expierence. You enter a level, missle down a row of bad guys, and move on. There's hardly really any strategy or even need for most of the customization options added into the game. I was shocked when they switched to a out of mech stage and you play on foot. It tried to emulate other third person games like "Gears of War" or just any simply generic shooter. The game needed more balance and tuning on it's mech side without the need of these on foot segments.\n\nOverall: I really can't recommend this game, especially to any fan of the FM series. I'm really disappointed by this as could have been a great way to bring new players in. The FM series has tried alternative gameplay before and has come out pretty well, yet for the first time in this generation it might have been better off staying with its tride and true formula. Especially considering how few SRPG series there were. I say stay away or get it on the cheap, very cheap steam sale.","January 8, 2014","false","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sniper rifle was one of the least satisfying guns I've used in any game, and whenever I had to use it that mission just dragged on and on.  In general most of the weapons outside of melee weapons and shotguns leave a bit to be desired.  All of the others are just pretty dull feeling and boring to use.\n\nIn general most of the combat and gameplay is extremely repetitive. They also force you out of the mech from time to time to do a standard third person shooter segment, which is easily the worst part of the game to me.  All of those segments were a drag and completely uninspired.  It broke up the gameplay a bit, which in itself might have been nice, but the actual gameplay during that segment was extremely subpar.\n\nThe story, voice acting, and characters are all pretty bad.  The story is about as generic as you can get, and all of the characters feel like a walking cliche that had almost no time put into their voice acting or writing.  Some of the dialogue is just cringe inducing, this is especially true during the game's boss battles where the enemy will spout the same phrase over and over again throughout the fight.\n\nIf you're going to pick up the game, pick it up when it's on sale.  Otherwise just go find a copy of one of the Armored Core games.\n","July 10, 2014","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The games fairly short, but nothing shorter then what we have come to expect from "recent" games.\n\nThe Multiplayer. Playing vs other people is a blast.

That's why I'm going to go ahead and offer all the negatives up front so I can get to why I recommend this game inspite of them. The Wanzer (robot) portion the game is too fast paced to really demonstrate the special context in which each weapon type shines. If you wear two shotguns, they don't both deal damage if shot at the exact same time for some reason. The EDGE (rage) mode is overpowered and trivializes many enemies and bosses. The controls are tight, but give the player schizophrenic feedback as to what is happening; While hovering, the Wanzers move forward very slowly before dropping back down, implying that they're barely held up by their propulsion systems, but while skating they accelerate instantly and whip around immediately in any direction. This disconnect makes it hard to believe the physics in the game and does not portray the machine as being as heavy as it should be at all times. The game also tries to be too epic and cinematic. This means that too much of the story is told by cutscenes and hard-to-believe dialogue in scenarios that could have been much more hard boiled and believable like the Metal Gear games and the older Front Mission games. The footsoldier portion of the game, while fun, feels like padding and doesn't offer the depth or variety of enemies the Wanzer portion does. This is only a complaint because it carries on for a long time and asks you to take it seriously instead of treating it like a quick and dirty bonus stage, which it would be better suited to be.  Health regenerates on your Wanzer, which would be ok except the enemy Wanzers do not regenerate health. This would be easier to believe than FPS human regenerating health, except that in the footsoldier part of the game, if you pay close enough attention to what's going on you'll realize your health regenerates on it's own when you haven't taken damage in a long enough period of time. What's worse, to me, is that picking up boxes of armor and med kits restores your Wanzer and footsoldier health instantly also. This would not be a severe complaint except that where they are located and how often the game feels they are needed makes it painfully obvious you're playing a videogame, not allowing you to experience the fantasy without arcade-like health-ups and ammo boxes constantly reminding you that it isn't real. This combined with the cutscenes basically reduces the game to an episodic arcade robot game, rather than a strict hard boiled mechanical warfare experience like it could have been. It's trying too hard to be an anime like Gundam instead of a unique experience. Moreover, there are too many different things you're able to do that are exclusive and manual actions, which causes trying to focus on when it would be best to do each of them to make it impossible to do any of them well simultaneously. The controls need a lot of work, but the problems generally go away once you get past the learning curve. Additionally, the in-mission environments are too clean, lacking dirt, dust particles, or textures that would portray the grit of real life as the cutscenes do. Lasting damage effects on the surfaces of barriers are painfully absent. The inside of the cockpit is totally awesome but there's no option to switch to an interior view while playing missions. But probably the biggest gripe is that the future world setting is pretty important to how the story works, but we don't get a peaceful introduction to it, except in narration and a brief opening cutscene. I'm fine with the cutscene being short, but we need some way to spend time getting to know why the future is the way it is, as we do in older Front Mission titles where the first few missions are low stakes and teach us about the scenario we find ourselves in, rather than throwing us into the pursuits of the main story arc and conflict right away. Like the pervious titles, this future is extremely like the present, only with robots running around. This was a really good opportunity to reboot on that and highlight more of the differences, but instead we only get to see some of them in passing before we're distracted by the main events of the campaign. Another minor gripe is that this was a port from a PS3 build, and they didn't remember to place the keys on the controls tutorial. You can look them up, so it's no big deal, but it is a small oversight.\n\nHowever, I'm totally willing to forgive everything above for a few reasons. First, it feels *good* to shoot things in this game. You can adopt a few play styles despite the limitations after you get some cash and unlock some parts in Act 1, which allow you to take the fights a little more quickly or a little more slowly, and really enjoy unloading on the enemy in different ways. Second, melee attacks are actually useful. Sometimes they are so useful you regret it when you don't take a melee weapon, which is a great homage to the series. Third, the customization is great and gives you the Armored Core-like pleasure of min-maxing different things about your Wanzer. Fourth, jumping around and dashing feels nice, in the way Zone of the Enders did, and it really brings back fond memories of running and gunning through lots of PS2 era games that are near and dear to our hearts. Fifth, there is a lot of content here. The fun parts of the game are there, and there's plenty of play time to dig into.\n\nBut sixth and most importantly, this game was the first real-time action game Square Enix has produced that made an attempt at science fiction realism. Evidence the following facts: You don't necessarily have to take tons of damage if you play carefully, and you don't get tons of meaningless trades with the enemy before they suddenly fall down and die like in a hack and slash RPG. Enemies with broken components show damage and stop being as effective accordingly. You zoom in to aim at times to take advantage of this, and it actually helps. The robots look good, and the scenario holds together during the action sequences, minus the health-ups laying around all over the place. Even with the stupid regeneration, there are a lot of enemies that don't take it easy on you and that means you will end up dying a lot, even on normal difficulty. This was clearly a serious attempt by Square Enix to make a really good futuristic robot war game, and that *needs to be rewarded*. If they did this again in a year or two and turned it into a more hard boiled, less cinematic experience, it could be a great game rather than just a good game like this one is. And just think while you're playing this game: This was their *first crack* not just at doing this franchise differently, but doing this *kind of game*, with tight sophisticated aiming and movement controls that put the action in the foreground and the RPG elements in the background.\n\nThe price point for this title would be ideally around 20 dollars. I got my copy for 5 and I have to say I feel like I got my money's worth. That gets it a 7 or 8 out of 10. Even for just having multiplayer built in, this is going to be much more fun than I bargained for. Hopefully Front Mission isn't done and we'll see Square Enix take another more experienced crack at this genre, as well as showing us it's future world setting. I will grade the next title much more harshly, but I am going to stay optimistic until we see how (and if) it turns out.","February 6, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The mechs are cool enough, and the basic combat works nicely, but the whole thing comes off as just a little too linear and a little too scripted.\n\nIn a certain sense, I think the title suffers because it can manage to evoke shades of the "Armored Core" series. In doing so, it whets your appetite for things that just aren't going to be delivered. "Armored Core" had extensive customization, lots of opportunities for free-form movement in the environments, and pretty deep combat. "Front Mission Evolved," on the other hand, has much more limited customization, environments that are often rather constrained, and relatively simplistic battle.\n\nThis game works well enough as a "my first Armored Core" sort of experience, but it could have been more than it is.","January 29, 2015","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not something exceptional, but interesting and movie-style ones.\n+ Short title, if played on Easy difficulty. Will be like waching a space-mech movie a tenth of hours long, with lots of action scheans... For this game, the 'short' is a posetive thing.\n+ Nice sound of weapons and mech movement. Interesting feeling that you drive a 'big' robot wit 'deadly strong' weapons.\n\nBads:\n- Console port logic => Terrible HUD configuration (for my likes): No customization of HUD, huge visuals on it hiding the screen, enormouse crossair with a stupit usless big rentacle arround it, just to make me unable to focus on the environment graphics\n- Console port logic => Strange and 'sluggy' movement of mech and mouse and controls in general... No hope for accurasy with mouse (I never play FPS with gamepad)... Gamepad orientation is obvius for example from the fact that you are forced to use one kay-command that combines 'change weapon' command and 'interact with environment'.., I once managed to accidently shoot a rocket at the in-my-fase console I was trying to activate...\n- Heavy-loaded visuals during combat (for my taste),,, Many of the times, I could see nothing more than red explosion gasses and bright ganlights during combat. Instead of understanding if i was shooting at a tank or a wanzer (mech), I was just trying to zero close to the bright red rectangles of HUD aim-lock elements. Only when I focused on sniper weaponry and got used of the game, I started to enjoing the game graphics... I dont know why, but I felt like getting a kind of light headache while playing, mabie becouse of the sholder-camera mooving in-and-our of my mech in an unconfortable way.\n- Unfair boss fights if you are in a sniper-focush build... More details here could be a spoiler... :-)\n- The story is not any memorable masterpiece that would overcome the above handicaps of the game. Scenarion is interesting but not well-displayed in the dialoges and the cutsheens (for my liking at least). Some characters are included in a cutshene, but there is no good presentation of them, making me feel like parts of the game and plot before the particular encounter have been taken out of the final product  There is no humour on the dialogues and not any particular art-of-literature... There are many of better space-opera stories at other games, books or films... On the other hand, the cinematics graphics and aesthetics does indead create a good immersion of a future-mechanic-space world.\n- Will propably have to search for human players at forums if you intent to go on multiplayer games. Having the game 'searching for other players' at the multiplayer screen for two minutes, reaulted in no-one baing online...\n\nIn general, I dont feel robbed-out -of-my-money with Front Mission Evolved, since it costed me less than an evening movie ticket, and it offered me about 15 hours of a not-so-bad mechanised sience-fiction story (including combat gametime). But, I will not advertise or recommend the game to my friends, since there are many far-better FPS space-story games out there with controls-sensitivites appropriate for a decent mouse-and-keyboard PC bulletstorm... My personal estimation is that If you find the game on big sales and you like heavy-shooting mechs, you will have some entertainment by playing it. If not, waching only the cinematics if they are avaialabe at a webpage nowdays, will be more rewording.","March 22, 2015","false","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is nothing like that, it's a third person shooter all the way, but as long as you realize that going in then there is really nothing to complain about.\n\nAs a shooter it's your standard fare.  Nothing special, nothing terrible.  As a FM game it has all the wanzers and customization you are used to (Grapple, Whisk, Husky, all the chassis make an appearance) with full ability to change colour, matte, decals, weapons, backpacks, battle skills etc.\n\nThe story is what you would expect from a FM game, a political intrigue about war, double crosses,  red herrings and military fiascos all with a plot about a young man trying to avenge the death of his father.  Is his father really dead, did the OCU and Da Han Zhong really start the war?  What is going on?

The CTDs tend to occur specifically on Nvidia hardware\nTwo, if you rush through the level it is possible to complete it without experiencing any CTDs. I have run a speed run twice without once experiencing a CTD.\nI am changing my preference to reccomend after discovering the solutions.","May 3, 2015","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Harvey [1st MRB]","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968432471/","150 products in account","Recommended for mecha fans ONLY!\n\nIf you've played Armored Core, then you'll feel right at home playing Front Mission Evolved. This is a 3rd person game in which you pilot mechs called "Wanzers". Like Armored Core, you can upgrade your Wanzer with different chassis components and weapons. You unlock better upgrades as you progress. There's also a 3rd person shooter component of the game that has you run around on foot, using a very small selection of infantry firearms (shotgun, rifle, or rocket launcher). It's reminiscent of another, older Mech game, Shogo Mobile Armor.\n\nThe mech combat portion of the game is alright. It's fun to charge around, throwing ridiculous amounts of missiles and gunfire at the enemy Wanzers. The hit detection is usually pretty clean and the enemy AI can get smart, dodging long range fire and running away from melee attacks. It is annoying that none of the enemies ever run out of ammo and can dash/sprint indefinitely. I also didn't always enjoy having every boss be incredibly overpowered. But overall, they seem to have gotten it right.\n\nThe 3rd person infantry part of the game is awful however. The character movement is terribly clunky and clumsy, with very little precision. The vast majority of enemies in this mode will consist of 2 types; those with shotguns who run at you, and those with rifles who stay at a distance. Occasionally they'll throw in a "ballistic" soldier with a rocket launcher, or give you a helicopter or wanzer enemy to shoot 4 times with a rocket. I didn't enjoy it at any point, and it could have been done much better. You will be struggling through these portions to get to more Wanzer action.\n\nA problem with both combat modes is two-fold; poor friendly AI and enemy AI that focuses solely on you. Your allies are pretty useless and will very seldom kill an enemy (unless it's a cutscene of course). That, combined with the fact that the enemies usually prioritize YOUR destruction over anything else creates a less fun and more difficult environment to play in. There are also little in-game collectables, though they seem to have no purpose other than to be collected.\n\nGraphically, the game looks pretty good, though it might be a bit dated by now. There were a few voice sync problems with the cutscenes, but no other problems. The soundtrack is generic and forgettable. The voice acting is a bit cheesy but it's okay, although one character couldn't decide if he was British or Australian. Front Mission's story is a bit predictable and has few surprises. There are a couple unanswered questions, some things that don't make sense, and a romance subplot you'll see coming a mile away. But then this isn't really a plot-driven game anyway.\n\nPlay this game for the mecha combat. Everything else is either pretty forgettable or barely tolerable.","May 19, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd definitely wait for a sale or a bundle because it is by no means a good game, but it's fun.\n\nThe actual gameplay is pretty great honestly, the skating mechanic is really nice and fluid, the mechs feel like they have weight and power, there are *tons* of customization options, many weapons, movements types, whatever. It's great.\n\nHOWEVER, it's short, extremely short, and there are no extra challenges or side missions or anything like that, it's just the campaign and multiplayer, which I haven't tried, but based on reviews, it's probably dead.\n\nThe story sucks, very badly. It's really hard to follow, and doesn't make sense in alot of places (sorta spoilers I guess, but in one part you're asked to equip a type of legs for quick movement for a recon mission, but then something happens and you're forced to do another mission with the legs. Once that ends, the story just continues, no recon mission, no mention of it, you never need the legs again.)\n\nIt also suffers alot from the cheap plot device of enemies being completely destroyed but then suddenly in the cutscene they're totally fine and spotless and can run away without any chase. This is every. single. boss. Similarly, cutscenes equip your mech with different weapons whenever it's convienient to the plot. It's just bad overall.\n\nOverall, it's worth a look at, sorta.

That specific genre is rather thin, and despite this games flaws it's still a bit ahead of a lot of the current offerings.\n\nIf you love the older FM games, and like mech games, don't get this. For people who haven't played any of the TBS FM games, they won't know how much this game craps on them. If you're a member of this group, I'd really recommend you'd buy Project Nimbus instead. If you're intrested in the multiplayer, then I'd recommend you look into Heavy Gear Assault (Not on Steam) or Hawken.\n\nIf you never played, or don't like the older FM games, and are fine with single player, then you could give this game a try. As it is, it's a well-done SP mech game.\n\nAs for the crashing issues, I never did come across any of them though I'll admit this was on a much older computer that was closer in spec to the games requirements.

It should really be called "Front Mission Devolved".\n\nYoud think that they would put in some effort to justify switching Front Mission to a third person shooter, but it just feels like a cheaply made game.\n\nThe plot is laughable - the voice acting is very uneven (a lot of the characters are emotionless when they should show emotion, and ALL the emotional scenes fall completely flat) and it is just poorly written and generic. A major theme of the game is the incredible power of the "EDGE System" which supposedly makes you into a superhuman mech piloting machine, but gameplay wise EDGE is pretty terrible. It only slows down enemies slightly for a few seconds and I hardly used it at all. The one badass female character turns into an emotional wreck halfway through the game just from seeing someone who scares her. The main character is as boring as you can get, with no real motivation besides "revenge!" And the villains have massive plot armor, even after you fight them in a half hour boss battle their wanzers don't get a scratch.\n\nThe game's very hard to control with a controller so I would suggest using mouse and keyboard - ESPECIALLY in the (boring) on foot segments which will always crash if you use a controller. Even then however, the animations feel pretty stiff during combat. The on foot sections feel tacked on and even more like an attempt to make the game appeal to "westerners".\n\nThe graphics are also pretty poor. Even for the time they came out they were dated. The graphics look like a launch Xbox 360 game from 2006.\n\nThe music is of course generic without any of the incredible tracks such as the ones Yoko Shimomura made for the original Front Mission. While it's not horrible, it's also pretty forgettable.\n\nAll in all it would have been better if they just ported Front Mission 4 or 5 to Steam (and probably made more money too). The Front Mission series was merely the victim of executive meddling thinking a shooter would appeal more to Westerners. That may be the case but it certainly didn't result in a better game, even as far as third person shooters go.","March 2","false","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me sum it up, the second to last boss has an attack where he fires two missiles that will destroy most of your health. They can be shot down, but not dodged. I chose to use a high powered rifle with a slow fire rate during the game. This rifle was awful without 100% perfect quickscoping at taking out those missiles. If both hit, you die. He also can attack for around a third of your health in melee with a super fast charge that cannot be avoided.\n\nLevel design fails mostly in that it has a bad habbit of spawning the player RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BLOODY ENEMY and gives very little to no delay. The final boss actually gets a few free shots in its first form!

It wasn't great, it felt shoe horned in and severely lacking in polish, but ultimately it was over in a reasonable amount of time and never progessed in to outright frustration.\n\nThe customisation feels about right for this kind of game, nothing too in depth, nothing too shallow. I was very confused that I was given a hexadecimal value for my chosen colours but couldn't find anywhere to input them? I also wish the textures were a bit nicer but I mean, it's a game from 2010. If you didn't mind the visual quality of games on the Xbox 360, this won't be particularly offensive.\n\nI haven't seen much of the story but honestly playing a game in which you pilot a giant mech for the story is like going to a party to appreciate the carpet\n\nThis game is a hard "If you like these kinds of games you'll probably have an amount of fun with this" out of 10.","December 23, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yaayyyy, right?\n\nSo does this game totally suck? No, it's just meh. For starters, the graphics look like a PS2 launch title, and gameplay mechanics remind of something for the PSX in 1997. It reminds me of Robotech Battlecry, you get to play out your mech fantasy, but somehow the devs didn't really pull it off. Even if this game had been released back 2001, it still would have been a 6.5 out of 10.\n\nLike I said this game isn't total crap, but it isn't great either. I got this game on sale ($6.99 I think), so I don't feel ripped off. If the game is on sale again, and you're a fan of the series, pick it up. Otherwise pass. This series was a complete jem back in the day, and like most of Square Enix properties, it has gone to seed.

(Single player campaign mode) [2015-12-27]\n\nTL;DR:If you are a longtime fan of the game, well, let's just say your expectations will be too high it won't be met.\nBUT If you've never played a front mission game before, DON'T BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. With the requirement that you like the ff categories:\nMechs\nTPS\nAdventure\nSensible story (more on this later)\nRobot fights!!!!\nBlowing things up\nCaveat(s)** Don't read text behind spoiler alerts.\n\nPROSFun Gameplay.\nModest difficulty. Played only in 'Hard' difficulty which is the hardest difficulty in the game. It's not too easy, but it's not too frustrating at the same time. I liked the balance here. Only real hard time you'll get are from the bosses. As in, multiple bosses in one boss fight. Sh!t, that was hell.\nBG Sound is OKAY. It's not annoying, It's there all the time, but you don't really notice it even though it complements the whole atmosphere at the same time.\nDub: Voice Acting is OKAY. It's not overly superb, but it's not bad either. Average even for todays' standard. And this was released in 2010\nStory: Not bad. TBH, it's not overly superb. But it does the job. It's not cheesy, there aren't too many "ive'-seen-that-before" either. It's pretty decent. In fact, imma even say, it's a Good story compared to most games that come out nowadays. It even comes with a... plot twist! So yeah, most near-end plot points copulate well with the premise that's why it has a sensible story.\nControls: Actually really, really good. I don't get why other people say the controls are bad. I really really don't. It's not even 'not bad' or 'just okay'; It's not hard to remember, it's perfectly compatible, it doesn't feel stiff, it doesn't bother your gameplay, It's just plain perfect.\nCONSGame crashes. Game crashed on the first foot level (level name: War Hero). Really sucks. Game crash fixing didn't really help when i checked the interwebz. Fix found below\nThere is no OP mech setup. At least even just for the single player story mode. Nope. Not at all.\nDub-lipsync: It's bad at some parts.\nFacial expressions: Well, it's a 2010 release. Waddaya expect?\nMultiplayer is dead. Let me repeat that: "MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD" It's understandable considering its' age and an ocean of multiplayer only games available in the industry today. That's why this review is about single player campaign only in the first place. Maybe there are some hobbyist out there with a private server setup or something, but I'm not going through that extra mile effort to find it anymore. So for the official, un-modded game, it's long gone and six feet under.\nErr.. More emotions??? Story probably could have evoked more emotions out of the gamer playing the game. Square Enix is known for that. In this sense, it feels like a non-Square Enix game. But then it's front mission. Ah, well.\nCouple of story telling annoyances. If you aren't too critical of a person, you won't see it. But if you are, well, that is why you would say the story is just "Okay".\nGame crash fixGame crashed about thrice. On the same level of the same part of the level. Because i was going Rambo and trying to be Machete at the same time. Changed my settings twice then played with the same tactics only to experience the crash again. After that, i said, "Ah, f*** it." and changed the game back to my preferred settings then played in a more cautious manner. So i guess the core fix that needs to be done here is the players' mindset.\nThis is my setting for the game after a few restarts of the game (not the computer) that made my playthrough smooth and non-crashy. It might be different with yours, but try if you're going insane.\nI'll only include settings which are usually factors of a game crash.\nGame settings            Misc                Controller        Gamepad                Audio                Dolby Pro Logic II        On                Video                Resolution        1280x720 @ 60 Hz                Shader        High                Texture        High                Shadow        High                Vsync        On                Anisotropic filtering        x16\nEnvironment            OS        Windows 7 Ultimate, 64bit                CPU        i7 - Devils Canyon                RAM        8Gb                Videocard        Onboard, N/A                Gamepad        Razer sabertooth\n4/5 - Entertaining, was not too disappointed.","December 26, 2015","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That specific genre is rather thin, and despite this games flaws it's still a bit ahead of a lot of the current offerings.\n\nIf you love the older FM games, and like mech games, don't get this. For people who haven't played any of the TBS FM games, they won't know how much this game craps on them. If you're a member of this group, I'd really recommend you'd buy Project Nimbus instead. If you're intrested in the multiplayer, then I'd recommend you look into Heavy Gear Assault (Not on Steam) or Hawken.\n\nIf you never played, or don't like the older FM games, and are fine with single player, then you could give this game a try. As it is, it's a well-done SP mech game.\n\nAs for the crashing issues, I never did come across any of them though I'll admit this was on a much older computer that was closer in spec to the games requirements.
