Review writted for Early Access v0.5.1.I write this in english to reach more ppl, but that's not my main language, feel free to let me know if I do some errors.\nIf you are bored to read, go bottom I posted a little video.\n\nYou understand how to play in about 5 min:\nSelect a track on your hard drive (mp3, flac)\nDAT analyse your sound and create a track regarding the content\nIf nobody have already used this sound, you are the creator of this track\nIf the sound have already been used, you can select other best players as ghost (very cool to learn)\nThen the game start, all you have to do is keep sync with the sound by keeping inside bars\nIf you are sync, you get 4x score bonus, or less if you are to late\nYou can collect some bonus and use a boost, jump, flip to make points\nWhen you are in advance on the synch, you become super sync and get a 10x score bonus\nThis is not a race, all you have to do is the best score\nWhat is missing actually in this game, for me, and I hope dev will now transform they little nugget into an awesome music game:\nNot enough beats effects, would be cool when the background city have more visual effects, something to make the game a lot more immersive (fireworks, flash on beats).\nIt really miss a button to preview your sound. Must to have\nYou can unlock new cars but actually you don't know why\nYou cannot rebind keys, I think that will come in futur. Actually if you play with a pad you don't have to rebind there is only 1 button but maybe for keyboards users that can be usefull.\nTo finish, I like too this EA Game cause the devs are present and love they baby, wait and read the feedbacks. So that's a good, really good start for me ! 100% recommended if you like to follow growing games and be a part of it\n\nHere is a little video if you are boring to read text and just see what look the game in actual state.

To be honest, I did not expect it to be so good. This is one of those games that you put your music into and they generate a racing track, which fits the music. Even though it's in Early Access, it does its job better than other game of the same genre.\nBelow the final verdict is the complete list of music that I've played for this review.\n\nPros:    Terrific surroundings (skyscrapers, spotlights, etc.)\nIt does a really good job at converting the music into the track you are driving on. The drops are amazing, boost pickups are synchronised with the beats and even landings fit the music!\nEven though it's a racing game, I did not expect to see drifting in this game. It's awesome!\nThere are jumps, flips, pickups, boosts and other stuff.\nThere is a wide choice of vehicles that can be used in-game. Also, you can buy skins for them using "chips" you earn while playing.\nOne of the main benefits (in my opinion): the graphic details are astonishing even on older computers. The game uses a low amount of system resources.\nThere are no lags or disruptions in the music you're playing. Even if you crash, the music keeps going. This is not the case in Audiosurf, though.\nEven when you crash, use boost or in any way change your speed, the landscape is always synchronised with the current music. I don't know how they did it, but it's amazing.\nThere are achievements and leaderboards.\nCons:    There is no music that comes with the game itself. If you want to play, you need your own music library first. | This feature has been added.\nNo autoplay/playlist option. When you finish a song, you have to pick the next one by hand. | This feature has been added.\nAchievement Unstoppable is not working properly. The player is supposed to unlock it when he completes a level without hitting any barricades. However, it can also be unlocked by restarting the level as soon as music starts to play.\nNo advanced graphic options. I know I have mentioned in the upsides that you don't actually need to lower the quality as it runs just fine on most of the computers. It is still a good idea to include more options.\nSome barricades are extremely hard to see and therefore avoid, especially after jumps.\nIf the music file is more silent than usual, the game sounds might be louder than the music itself. I only had this problem with The Writer, but there should be some kind of a detection system that would lower the game sounds, if necessary.\nThe final verdict:There are quite a few downsides, but they don't really matter that much. I really enjoyed my time in this game so far as it is an awesome experience for both your ears and eyes. There is no quality loss when songs are played, there are leaderboards to make you compete against others and, above all, the game runs smoothly with low loading times. Buy this game. What's better than listening to your favourite music while playing a fun game?\n\nThe list of songs I played:    Shawn Wasabi - Marble Soda\nEXGF - We Are The Hearts\nAdiemus\nMax Min - Anonymous\nZHU - Faded (Steve James Remix)\nMaraaya - Lovin' Me\nMarc Reeden - Take Me Away\nFreestylers - Cracks ft. Belle Humble (Flux Pavilion Remix)\nClokx - Catch Your Fall\nFelix Jaehn - Ain't Nobody ft.

While it sits in the same genre as games like Audiosurf, adding the cars with amazing drift handling really allows DAT to hold it's own. Not just a decent music generated game but one of the better arcade racers I've played in some time. Highly addictive and upon first play I was mesmerized by my screen for hours. The King is dead, long live the King.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qbVac0yjtw\nGameplay is simple, select a song, choose your car and burn rubber. Tracks are all given a star rating which dictate their difficulty and harder levels generally contained more obstacles and tighter turns.  Provided the song includes an id3 tag your score also gets uploaded to both local and global leaderboards. Tried a wide range of genres from classical through to chiptune and overall music generation was not only quick but produced some wonderful results.  Faster music had more jumps and loops while slower music seemed much more drift based.\n\nWhile there is still plenty to add in future (real-time lighting, skyboxes etc), Graphically speaking it already looks quite tron-like and beautiful. Currently in-game options were slim to none but given the minimalistic nature of the game I would hazard a guess it should run very well on a wide range of systems. Didn't skip a beat scaling up to 4k+ on a single 970. Something that did seem to be missing was a bunch of default music tracks which was a little unfortunate as I'm sure it would help with the competitive side of the game.\n\nMost of the features I would like to see included in future are already planned. Such as further control of stunts, improved tracking of stats and additional game modes, cars and environments. With that said DAT contains 12 standard cars (+2 secret), decent selection of liveries and enough change of environment and colour schemes that it stays fresh. The games few downsides like sometimes being stuck on your roof following a dodgy jump, or hurtling round a corner into a badly placed wall are easily outweighed by all the upsides.\n\nOverall if you're a fan of music based games or arcade racers such as Ridge Racer, RUSH, Burnout, Daytona or Outrun. DAT is well worth your weekly allowance and has got my stamp of approval. Cheers folks, now back to racing. :]","May 24, 2015","true","13.1"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","29","36","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/351990/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","I was hesitating on this one since a lot of rhythm type games that generate tracks from user audio files feel kinda bland or else they have the problem of only being fun if you are using EDM tracks with heavy, distinctive beats. I was watching some trailers as well and was hesitating because I couldn't really discern what the game was doing with the tracks that would make them truly feel like you were playing the song.\n\nAfter spending just a short amount of time with it, it's winning me over very fast. It's called Riff Racer, which suggests guitar riffs, which suggests it should be fun with rock music, whereas a lot of music/rhythm games that procedurally generate tracks are not super good with rock tracks. I was super impressed to discover that playing rock tracks in this game feels very satisfying and the game can specifically detect if you are a playing a rock/metal track.\n\nAs I was playing these rock songs, which don't have the heavy, distinctive beats that EDM tracks have, I kinda started to warm up to the things the game was doing to make you feel like you were playing the song. It was less about individual beats and more about the energy of the song. Placing a speed boost right when the chorus takes off. Dropping a huge ramp right when the song tears into a guitar solo. Shifting the lighting and colors to fiery hot as the song picks up speed and volume.\n\nWhere Riff Racer lacks at emphasizing the individual beats of a song, it seems to excel at getting the visceral energy of a song just right. Of course I'd advise you to mostly pick out a songs that suit a game about hitting ramps in a fast car.\n\nThe game has great controller support and the controls are fantastic. The driving feels almost as good as games like Mario Kart or Sonic All-Star Racing Transformed. The drifting takes a bit of getting used to, but its starts to make more sense the more you practice it.\n\nIt's an arcade racer, so it's all about racking up points. Unlike other rhythm games, which focus on hitting the good objects and dodging the bad objects, Riff Racer does something slightly different. Hitting the good objects instead builds up a boost meter that you can use to trigger a manual boost (in addition to free boosts lying on the track). In order to get the most points, you need to go as fast as possible for as long as possible, hit collectibles, hit ramps (especially at an angle so that you can spiral jump for extra points), and execute long drifts around sharp corners. The faster and fancier you drive without falling off the track, flipping the car, or crashing into things, the more points you'll rack up. It's not just about hitting those beats (although it's that too); it's also about kicking butts.\n\nAnd of course there are global leaderboards, friend leaderboards, personal best, etc. The game comes with a bunch of songs bundled in, and you can use your own. You also gain points for racing tracks, and those points let you unlock new cars and paint jobs. The new cars and paint jobs are merely cosmetic, but it gives you something to work toward if you need that kind of motivation.\n\nThe only downside to the game is that once you put 4 or 5 hours into it, race all of your favorite rock tracks, then you've pretty much seen the whole tour. You can still go back and score attack, but you're basically racing time trial on tracks that---while very fun---are largely similar, so it starts to get a little samey after a while.\n\nRating the game on the scale below, I give it a hearty 6:\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.\n6) A good game that is worth the full price.\n5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.\n3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.\n2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.\n1) Avoid at all costs.","May 12","true","5.1"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","0"

DAT is based on the Audiosurf premise, except it's a real racing game.\nYou also become a celebrity for being the first to play a song. So that's cool and all.\n\nIt's also worth noting that it's practically impossible to play without a controller. I used an Xbox 360 Chrome Series controller, and it worked great. I would imagine that the game is much easier to play with an Xbox ONE controller, or maybe just a controller that *hasn't* had Diet Coke spilled all over it.\n\nBuy this game if you like music and racing games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/travizty/recommended/351990/","travizty","TraviztY ッ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/travizty/","726 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo far I'm pretty addicted to this game. My love for music might be an influence. Being able to race to the music on your own PC is really fun and games that do this always grab my attention. DAT is infact a great Early Access title and I've already begun racking up hours played. Even though its an EA title, it has plenty of content to enjoy right now. Unlock cars by leveling up or collecting tokens and buying them. You can also change the paint scheme on any of them with a few tokens as well. The gameplay's difficulty depends on the song you play. If you play something really slow and soft, you're gonna have an easy track but switch it over to something more upbeat and fast and you'll find a real challenge. On the track you'll find 2 types of pickups. The boxy one fills up your boost and the coin looking ones are for spending in the garage on cars and paintjobs. The purpose of the game is to stay up with the first line of synchonization. I believe there are 4 total and if you fall behind, you will be resynced. If you have friends that own the game you can race against their ghosts if you want and try to get better times on the songs they have played but I'm pretty sure you have to own the song yourself. The store lists the game with multiplayer as well. Unfortunately I have yet to get to try this since I'm playing before release, I will update this review with info on multiplayer once I get to try it.\nThere are also leaderboards but the song you play must have an ID3 tag on it if you wish for the game to keep your score and place it on the leaderboards. (An ID3 tag is a little scrap of data added to the beginning or end of the MP3 file which stores information about the audio recording including the title, artist, album, copyright date, and musical genre.) I'm assuming this is how they keep track of the leaderboard scores. If you have music without a tag you can always get something like MP3Info, a great utility that adds ID3 tags and customizing to files.\nAll in all I would say this game has great potential and recommend it to anyone who loves driving games and music.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baiSyBvd__w","May 21, 2015","true","6.8"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

It's rare to see a music game where you're quite literally competing against the music. This game's got a lot of potential, and I'm already enjoying it more than games like Audiosurf. However, since it's Early Access (and it's only been out for one day) it's pretty rough around the edges. Sometimes the game will generate a huge jump right before a sharp turn, or create a barrier around a corner that you could never hope to see in time. Things like these can ruin your score, and it's the game's fault rather than your lack of skill. I've also clipped straight through the track more than once, and sometimes when you come out of a drift your car has a tendency to overcorrect itself and careen into a wall (tough cookies if this happens right before an ill-timed jump). I know it's an early access game, and I know there's no such thing as a bug free game, but these problems are the things they really need to iron out first.\n\nWhen the game works, I can't stress how much fun it is. It's certainly in a playable state, and it can only get better from here. I say go ahead and pick it up now before the price increases over time as the game gets fleshed out.","May 21, 2015","true","34.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

There are currently 3 things I noticed you collect as you race, that is a 10 tokens (the currency), boxes that fill your boost and give you additional points to your total point score and a separate boosters icon that gives you a boost as soon as you touch it, keep in mind that this booster icon doesn't take away the progress of you filling your boost from you collecting the boxes, it is its own separate boost. This makes me think of the midnight club la's slipstreaming, you can build up the slipstreaming and use it, that way you don't use a nitrous bar, but you still get a boost.\n\n\nThe Performance Optimization  is solid, constant 60 fps through gameplay with i5 3570k and gtx 760, The Recommended Requirements are pretty low, and I am impressed by that. A Intel Core 2 Duo and a Geforce 8000 series are pretty old components to run a game like this. But this makes this game playable for more people, so that is a good thing.\n\n\nSong difficulty Rating System  needs some work I think, for example I played a song by the uk power metal/speed metal band "Dragonforce" and these guys make a bunch of songs with intense guitars solos, and their tempo of their songs are just fast and the game only rated this Dragonforce Song a 1 star out of 5 star and then I played the Nickelback song "When We Stand Together" and apparently that song is rated 5/5, so I don't know how it's rating system works, it must work in a way that I don't understand or it's just not very accurate in this Alpha build of DAT . There are other songs that I played that I felt didn't match what I would rate the song in difficulty based on the tempo of the song, etc. but as example of a song that I thought it did well in rating is "Beneath The Tides" by Ravenface, this song has a pretty fast tempo to it also, and the game rated it a 4/5 and I thought that was fitting and the Track Generation for this song was solid, lots of jumps, dips, and long corners to drift around (I got a 38 beat drift on the one part of the track and I freaked out haha) I found it a very fun song to race on, While on the Subject of Track Generation, let's talk about that next.\n\n\nTrack Generation  it's kind of decent for it being in alpha currently, it can do what I think is a good job generating to match a certain part of a song, but then in some songs, I will be questioning "why did you generate (this part) of the track?" but it is in alpha, so I am not expecting this to be perfect, but I feel it still does good for the most part, but might be because I just like hitting the jumps and drifting and the driving style of this game in general... Speaking of jumps and drifting and just the overall handling of the cars... let's talk about handling.\n\n\nHandling of Cars  The handling of the cars are excellent in my opinion, the drifting is nice and you can really control your drifting which I really like. The Inferno Car is currently my favorite Car.\n\n\nRanking System   there is a ranking system in this game, it's seems to be pretty basic from what I noticed so far, you just get points from doing songs, and thus your points add up to level you up , the current reward that I noticed so far is some of the tokens in the game to buy paint jobs for your cars, which there are 2 paint jobs for each of the 7 cars of 15 or so cars total that I have unlocked so far.\n\nTo Summarize\n\n+Fun\n+ Solid Gameplay\n=Decent Track Generation\n+Excellent FPS (solid 60 fps) / Low System Requirements\n- Song Difficulty Rating system needs a little work for some songs/genres\n+ Excellent Car Handling/Drifting\n= Ranking System is Basic, but Solid for this game\n\nOverall 8.5/10","July 9, 2015","true","17.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","5"

If you like music and you like gaming, buy this.\n\nHowever, I want to address some concerns that negative reviews bring up:\n\n1) To those who say the game is too easy, I must insist you post higher scores than me on the same songs. This is why a leaderboard system exists. I will happily send you an mp3 gift of any song of your choosing, and then we can decide together if the game is too easy for you.\n\n2) I disagree that the specific song doesn't affect the track or gameplay significantly. The music isn't merely "background." In my experience, a song's crescendos, breakdowns, drops, and even minor variations result in loops, jumps, curves, and other set pieces. I can't imagine how one could miss this connection, but everyone is entitled their experience. Maybe my music is just more fun to drive.\n\n3) It's true that there isn't a ton of "unlockable" content. How could there be? This game is limited only by your music library. Yes, you can unlock new cars that only differ in appearance, and that's all there is to it. Would you really want the devs to artificially limit the manuverability of your car at the outset just to give you a false sense of progression?\n\nOne of the most popular rhythm games of all time, Dance Dance Revolution, contained unlocks. What did they give you? New songs, new characters. This game gives you all of the songs in the world as tracks, but you can purchase a handful of cosmetic upgrades with the coins you collect from racing. It's not intended to be a deep experience nor should it be.\n\n4) If you don't have a gamepad, don't buy a racing game-- even on PC-- and expect keyboard buttons to have the same degree of control as an analog stick. That's the entire point of analog sticks.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what some people were expecting when they bought this. It's a racing game that builds racing tracks from your music. No, it's not <INSERT RHYTHM GAME HERE>. That's the point of being a new, different game.","May 24","true","8.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

Drive Any Track is definitely one of the best music generated games in my opinion.\n\nIf you played Audiosurf -- I'm guessing most people who look at this page have played that -- just imagine that but you control your vehicle like a car of a racing game (including drifting, jumping, stunting, crashing) and instead of collecting right colored blocks this is just about driving perfectly through the course. The faster you go, the more points you get.\n\nYou can play against the ghosts of other players, which is really good. And the overall gameplay makes for some really intense or relaxing gaming, dependent on what music you're in the mood for.\n\nThe song analyzing is very solid. Sure it's not perfect, but what games song analyzer is? But since DAT has more stuff and obstacles that match up to the music it feels more satisfying than Audiosurf ever did.\n\nAnd all of this is just the early access version. There is a lot to add or improve here but as it is it's already an extremely fun game. And the creators of the game seem very well organized and take this stuff serious, so I'm very confident they will pull through what they promise (which for example is live multiplayer until DATs full release sometime in october).\nI just hope more people will play this awesome game so I have more ghosts to race against and more highscores to beat!","May 23, 2015","true","67.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

That being said ...\n\nThis is a great game.  It's quite enjoyable to run the tracks trying to get a decent score while listening to music you enjoy.\n\nMost of my music is two stars, with a few three stars, and I've had a few pop up as four stars.  I've yet to see a five star song from my music ...  Maybe I should be careful what I ask for, as four star songs are pretty wild!\n\nThe way you get points is by doing stunts.  You keep ahead of the first bar for maximum points.  Just driving doesn't get you anything, although you can use periods where you need to just drive to collect coins (for buying different cars and skins) and boost pack thingies (that you can use to activate your own boost whenever you want ... provided you've collected enough of them).\n\nYou always take about the same amount of time to make it through the track, so to get points you do stunts.  You run over ramps, getting as much air time as possible.  To get more points, you hit the ramps so the car spins ... but this comes with a number of issues that really justifies the extra score.  For instance, if you hit the ramp wrong, it's possible to land on your roof, or be flung from the map altogether!  So be very very very careful jumping, especially if you plan on doing the high scoring spins!\n\nYou also get points by drifting.  I suppose this can be abused, but whenever I've used drifting unnecessarily, I've always bounced off the walls.  Great way to fall behind, thus losing points!\n\nWhen you use the boost, it helps you get caught up, or you can use it just before a series of jumps to get ahead of the bar, increasing your point yield.  I'm the sort who tries to get more bang for my buck, so I always try to optimize when I use it.  But I rarely play the same track twice in a row, so it's always something of a gamble for me.\n\nIf you play the same track over a few times to get the highest score you can, you won't have to wait for it to rebuild the track.  But if you go to another track, then come back to the first one, you'll have to wait for it to be rebuilt.  There's a "tip" that says that "you only have to wait the first time you play the track," but this is not entirely true.  It is only true if you play the track repeatedly, a few times in a row.\n\nAlso, there are barriers on the road.  If bouncing off the walls, landing upside down after a trick jump, or flying clean off the road, aren't enough reasons to set you back, they stuck barriers on the road that will slow you down quite a bit.  Since you need to keep ahead of the first line to optimize your scoring, this can be quite a problem!\n\nYou also lose points for every barrier you hit, so it's a good idea to avoid them for more than one reason.\n\nIt can play m4a files, but not aac files.  Not a terribly large issue, just something to be aware of.  I do not know what other files it can play, as my library seems to be a mix of m4a and aac files.\n\nOn difficulty:\n1 star - Very casual.  I think I've seen only one or two of these songs.  Maybe the Beehtoven one I played was one?  I don't recall.\n2 star - Casual.  This is where most of my music lands.  It actually has quite a diverse range of difficulty in this range.\n3 star - Normal.  You really have to start using all the tools it gives you to keep up here.  It can sometimes be pretty wild.\n4 star - Hard.  It's beginning to get wild here.  I've had about half a dozen of my tracks come up like this.  It leaves me crying with laughter at every surprise twist and turn it gives me, and it's hard to make normal jumps ... let alone the high point yield twisters, here!\n5 star - Insanity?  I've yet to see a song this hard, but I'm pretty sure most people would be falling off the track quite a bit here.  The maps may even be nearly unplayable!\n\nI generally listen to Indie music.  I look at the top tracks, and I don't see anything I actually have in my library on them, so I guess I can not race against the "most popular" track leaders.  In point of fact, it's pretty rare for me to play a track anyone else has played, so maybe I have it a bit easier than most people who play the game getting coins.","May 15","true","8.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

So if you have things that you got legally (your progress is not recognized if you have an illegal copy) then this game will be very fun. Although, there are 10ish pre-installed tracks.\n\nThe game finds the tempo of your music from an online service and creates a track with varying difficulty. Tempos from 100 bpm to 200 bpm are the standard. if its less than 100 then it would be counted as 0 being 100. So if you have  a song with a bpm of 50 then it'll be seen as 150 bpm. It is the same with 200+. If your music is 275 then it'll be seen as 175.\n\nEvery track has its own leaderboard you can use to compete with yourself or with other people who have the same copy of the song you have. If you select to compete with the person in the next slot, the global leader, or one of your friends then there would be a ghost you 'race' against.\n\nThe actual racing part of this game is weird. The goal is not to be at the finish first but to have the most points at the end. The best way to get points is race the apex, jump from the highest point you can, drift as much as possible, and stay in the 4x or the 10x point area.\n\nThere are multiple cars you can race with but they all have the same stats except for the hit boxes.","February 24","true","16.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","4"

Nonetheless I have mixed feelings about this pretty looking, arcade style music based driving game.\n\nFirst, what the game does well.\nI will say that the art style and visual aestetic is very pleasing to look at. The use of bright vivid colours against a dark road gives me flashbacks of similar tron-inspired games. The UI isn't so distracting that it ever affected my performance but an option to toggle them on or off would have been appreciated(So far the options only seem to allow for changes in resolution, volume and mapping keys)\nThe Musical Enviroment Gaming Algorithm( or MEGA) is perhaps the games main selling point here. The game allows you to race on tracks that are designed around music chosen. You can select either music from the game or from your own music files you may have on your computer. Whenever you choose a song, a track is genreated based on the high/low pitches in music, use of cymbals or high-hats or where the bass might drop. While the game is able to generate these levels fairly well, for the most part I would experince the loud cresendo of a song while racing down a mostly empty stretch of road before the next ramo would appear several beats too late. That being said, the satisfaction of landing a jump off a ramp in time with a song beat is something that just feels undenaibly good.\nWhat the Game doesn't do so well...\nRemember when I said I had little experince with driving games earlier, with that in mind I personally distaste how the cars handle. Bearing in mind I'm playing on keyboard and mouse, the cars always seem to turn either too much or to little. I might try to turn around a bend but try and avoid on oncoming  barrier only to overcorrect the turn and smash into the wall. And drifting...Maybe it's just because I can't drift for ♥♥♥♥ but any attempt made only ever seems to result in collision with a wall whether I inteded to or not.\nAlso, you know how peveryone who played Mario Kart pretty much hated playing Rainbow Road, well the same flaws can be seen here. At any given ramp, should it be approached at too steep an angle because you overcorrected, you will fall off the ramp entirely and slowly spawn back onto the track. While I wouldn't mind on any other racing game, the use of twisting roads and ramps meaning it occurs more often than I would like.\n\nWith all that being said, I would say that while this game is probably not for me, I do think this is worth the discounted £8.24 price I paid to race against any of my music(None of which the game needs to liecence). The use of MEGA is something I appreaciate but I wish it was used in a more traditional Rthymn game rather than a less predictable arcade style racing game.Hopefully I may findone in the future.The game is good on the eyes and ears but feels too off for me.  If you enjoy arcade style racing games, you'll probably like this more than I will. Hope you enjoy.","May 15","true","4.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Audiosurf and its sequel have been long-time favorites for me. However, there was always something missing. There isn't a large amount of control you can give as you glide across a track to your favorite music.\n\nThat's where Drive Any Track comes in. It improves upon that concept by giving you much more control over what you do on that track. You see that sharp turn over there? Yeeeeaaaaah... you can friggin' drift around that like a pro racer. What about that jump? Evil Knievel that as you sing along to the song. You have more control over how you literally drive the song.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is a mixture of avoiding obstacles, collecting boxes for points/boost, collecting tokens for in-game customization, jumping off ramps (and landing them) all while staying in sync with the song you are playing. If you hit a barricade? You're going to lose some speed and possibly lose sync. Fail a jump? You might as well restart if you want that 100% bonus.\n\nAs you finish songs to completion, you are given a place on the leaderboard for that song. If you were the first one to play that song, you are credited with being the track creator. Additionally, you are given XP for completing the song, which levels you up (which unlocks cars). The tokens you gathered throughout the songs can be used to buy paint-jobs for the cars you own.\n\nThe game is essentially simple, which is to be expected of Early Access. Hopefully the developer adds some more game modes and spices up track generation.\n\nGraphics/Sounds/Controls The game has simple graphics that allow the game to be played on a majority of low-end computers. The game is more focused on using simple, abstract and vibrant colors and lights to give the game more of an arcade-y feel that allows the game to portray different genres. I have not run into any performance issues as of yet.\n\nSounds are entirely based on the quality of the audio file you are using. I recommend using the highest quality file to ensure the best listening pleasure.\n\nI have not used anything other than a keyboard for this game, so my experience in controllers or gamepads is non-existent. I can say that the games controls are simple and easy to learn. Playing on the keyboard is very useable as well. No need for controllers.\n\nReplayability The game's replayability is entirely dependant on the size of your music library. However, there are some problems where some songs will be given the wrong difficulty. Also, while every song has a unique track, it may get monotonous. The lack of different modes leave things to be desired.\n\nOverall The game is really good, it has massive potential. We just need some more modes to spice things up and increase replayability.\n\n+Very Enjoyable\n+Replayability based on music library\n+Simple graphics that fit the game\n+Addicting\n+Has a lot of potential\n+Leaderboard\n+Levels/Progress is recorded\n+Not many glitches/bugs\n+Steam Cloud\n+Developer IS ALIVE!\n\n/ Not that much customization (may change)\n/ Level cap prevents progress past 20 (may change)\n/ Track algorithm sometimes label songs incorrectly and give incorrect difficulties\n\n-Lack of variety in obstacles and jumps\n-Graphic options consist of only changing resolution\n-I suck at making reviews","July 8, 2015","true","15.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

While audiosurf is pretty much always straight ahead on 3 lanes, this right here is an actual racing game.\nNow, steering-wise the game is as simple as it gets. Left and right steer, Brake and gas arent needed, that does the game for you, CTRL is a handbrake for drifting and Space activates a Boost. Thats it.\n\nYour goal is to run a racetrack made from one of your songs and rack up as high of a score as you can. To do that you have to "stay in Sync" as the game tells you.\nBefore you runs a visible line, thats where the track is right now on the race track. YOu can stay in a measure of 4 bars behind it to be in Synch and get the optimal amount of points for your tricks. if you fall more than 4 bars behind, you lose a multiplicator until you are at least 7 bars behind, where the game will set you back on track (with a respawn phase where you dont get any points. same for when you fly off the track)\nIf you manage to overtake the Synch line, you enter a Supersynched mode where you amass more points but your speed and boost is slightly dampened, so you cant stay up there forever.\n\nNow, to get said points you just have to drive (a few points each measure of 4 beats), Jump (either by ramps on the track or by gaps in the track itself) Roll (same as jump - slightly tilted ramps or after Corkscrew Boosts) and Drift (by Using CTRL). After finishing a track you get some Boni depending on how good your driving was.\n\nNow what do I think? As someone who is pretty much terrible at racing games, I must say it is fun, plays pretty simple and even on Songs rated 4 Stars (out of 5) I managed to stay "in Sync" 60% of the time. Control is responsive, riding your tracks and experiencing your music completely different (again) feels nice and the Ghosting Modes (Race the world leader, the best ranked friend or a recommended random driver for a track) are fun too.\nAlso, the mechanic of "discovering" tracks, by being the first player worldwide who has ever played that song gives the game a nice way of saying "Good job that you listen to different music!" However, Songs have to be IDE3 taggedto be accepted as discovered.\n\nAs much as I like the game, It does have some flaws - sometimes the levels are built pretty counterproductive - like you get a boost into a long jump onto a sharp turn or you corkscrew a good 20 meters left to the track, sometimes when you resync you getdropped into a hole or a wall and lose more time and progress and its not really appearent weather or not you are drifting or if a drift has ended or has been aborted somehow. But since this game is early Acces as of now, it has room upwards.\nNot that it isnt far up already\n\nIf you like racing games and you love music, this right here is a good buy.\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah - another little beef I have with this game - it does not save after a track, so when the game unexpectedly crashed I found myself short of the spoils of the previous 6 or 7 races.","August 20, 2015","true","4.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

It destroyed the audio quality of my existing FLAC or 320 kbps MP3 library when being played through the game somehow, I have an studio level sound-card for production (EDM Prod and Mastering/Sound enginering and Audio Technica M50s and I could tell right away that there was some major bit-crushing to my audio, deal breaker for me.\n\n2. While the tracks are generated based of you're music its hit or miss on how much the track actually reflects the elements of the song you choose, many times the track does not reflect the tempo, tried DNB, Dubstep, Rock, Rap, millage may vary throughout you're choices.\n\n3. Graphic options are very limited.\n\n4. Unlike Audio Surf 1 the tracks in this game have many sharp turns which sounds great except there are constantly roadblocks around corners that you have no way of knowing are there until you turn said sharp corner and it's too late thus interrupting flow and "sync" to the game, this is poor design imo.\n\nTL;DR Great idea, Poor implementation.","May 13","false","0.3"," 35 of 62 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","35","62","7","2"

Do you like rhythm games like Guitar Hero? Audiosurf?\n\nThen man you would love this game. Able to turn any song saved on your computer(sadly it can't pull from something like Youtube or Pandora or Last.fm or any internet radio, you must have the file) into a track that you can race, you can experience your music in a new way. Whereas Audiosurf limits you to three lanes that you have to shift between, this game allows you full of control of a car of your choosing, able to drift, jump, roll and drive loops.\n\nPROS:\n-Excellent functionality creating new tracks for songs.\n-Ability to 'tag' a song by being the first to upload it- your name is attached to the song as it's 'creator'.\n-Car designs are interesting and likely one for everyone\n-Active leaderboards(for popular/well known songs, anyway, though more users will bring more activity)\n-Easy to navigate menus\n-Pretty good visual design. Each main 'theme'(Rock, Dance, 'Urban', among others) is unique\n\nCONS:\n-Leaderboards are currently dominated by people who shove their nose in every possible corner and drift anything available. It needs a serious adjustment to the score system for attempting to take first place to be fun again.\n-Some songs(I've noticed it particularly badly with some Rock/Metal songs) end up being fairly boring. The algorithm doesn't seem able to read songs without much variance in intensity very well.\n\nOverall a very fun game, I picked it up on sale and for the 5$ I paid -extremely- worth it. I'm still playing it and likely will as long as I remember that I have it, it's a ton of fun to load up your favorite songs and drive the tracks that the game creates for you, and people will be attempting to one-up each other on the popular songs until the servers no longer exist, whenever that might be.\n\nDefinitely worth it if you love music and driving.","February 9","true","82.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I love the fact that a new track generates depending on the music that is played. The course faithfully keeps up with the rhythm, if you are quick enough.\n\nWhen you discover a track that has an artist name (there is something else, but I forgot), it will be AUTOMATICALLY uploaded. This is a problem, what if I don't want to upload? I ended up accidentally uploading a sound effect. I hope there will be an option to manually upload things in the future.\n\nThe courses themselves are actually not too shabby. I like how the courses arrange themselves, the developers programmed this in such a way where I want to keep coming back with frustrating dubstep sounds, just to see how hard it will be. Just TRY doing "My Hope Will Never Die", it will be a looooong time to master that course.\n\nThe controls aren't bad, either. I use a controller, and it works smoothly. There is automatic controls and manual controls, all they do is control whether YOU want to control acelleration, or if the game will automatically go full throttle for you.\n\nThere are other cars...I think you unlock them by playing specific genres of music, but I'm not too sure. And besides, they're just different cars. no enhancements, or anything.\n\nThere is a pause button...good.\n\nScore: 8/10 the game met every expectation from me, but it wasn't good enough for a perfect score.

I definitely recommend Riff Racer if you like to relax and have some fun while listening to your favorite music.\nWhat really appeals to me is that you can use music from your own library and it generates a different track for each song. As you progress, you can unlock several cars and paintjobs.  Leaderboards are created for each song once someone has used them for the first time, and even though you don't have live multiplayer, you can race against a ghost car of top scoring racers, or your own high score.\nOne thing I would like to see is more variety to the colors and effects of the tracks. It does change depending on the type of music you use, but there isn't much variety, and sometimes the blur when you boost can be hard on the eyes.\nAlso, while the tracks are generated based on the song used, it doesn't really feel like it for the most part. Occasionally, the track does seem to match the music quite well. But most of the time, at least with the music I have used, it just feels like you are racing with your song as background music.\nEven though I see some room for improvement, this game gets a big "thumbs up" from me, and I can see myself putting many hours into just relaxing and playing along to my favorite music.\n","June 1","true","65.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The drifting system is my favorite part.\n\nThere are a few things you might want to change though, it's very easy to keep generating "new songs" for 100 coins. A lot of people get all of their money related achievements this way. You can simply make an mp3 file, duplicate it 100 times, and change the name of every file. No, I didn't do this, but it would be very easy to.\n\nI also think the game is kind of confusing when it comes to choosing original songs. Whether or not most players are using pirated music, it would make a lot more sense to just go by the IDE song name and artist. I've raced top 40 songs straight downloaded from Itunes, and was supposedly the first person to race that certain song. I think this is why you see so much participation in the bundled music. Which isn't bad, but let's be honest...\n\nThere is a lot of great things to say about this game. I don't just use it for music, It's a good way to get through lectures as well. Which is a great way to learn, get points, and satisfy your ADHD. MM.\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Drifting system feels flowy and fun\n- First game in the genre that doesen't require tapping your foot or finger 200mph\n- Concept is killer.\n- The achivements were fun to get.\n- Paint jobs are decent.\n- Last.fm genre API works great.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Lack of upgrading in garage\n- Community and game feels thinned out from unecessary song recogniztion (imo)\n- Not possible to connect to Last.fm (I think?)\n- Game feels a little bit too easy.\n- "Destruction" achievement and the walls behind jumps dont add up.\n\n\nOverall Rating - 7.5/10 - I would recommend this game to anyone and enjoy it thoroughly, despite its flaws and "early access" feel.","February 14","true","29.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There are a few issues with the car having tiny white spots dance all over it when choosing your car, and that the bloom effect can sometimes hide barricades.\n\nGameplay is simple and fun. It doesn't take much to get used to the controls, though in my experience steering can become wonky when you have to abort a drift. A major issue, though, is that the track generator has a bad habit of placing barricades right at the start of the loops, and of placing box trails and boosters in front of other barricades. This created "Gotcha" traps that you almost can't avoid when racing a track for the first time. If you are going for a high score, then it does stand to reason that you just memorize the placement of things on the track. But I feel it is a bit unfair to hit a ramp, only to see all too late that there is a barricade right where I'm landing. Or to reach a loop and have about half a second to veer to the side to avoid a set of barricades. For scoring points, the game heavilly rewards drifting and staying in sync or super sync with the song. The jumps and boxes do add to the score, but most of the times I've beaten someone elses high score, it was because of me drifting more than they did. The physics work fine for the most part. I have been turned around after a roll jump a few times, but not often enough that it was irritating.\n\nFor the music, the tracks bundled with the game are okay. There is an issue there, though, if you shoot for achievements, as not all of the genres are covered by the bundled tracks. The game relies on Last.fm to determine tracks. But the detection isn't perfect, and for songs that aren't mainstream, like anything from OCRemix or the Newgrounds Audio Portal, the detection is useless. Songs from those sources are usually are mis-labled. In what way, I don't know, as the game doesn't tell you what genre the song falls under, and there are only three color schemes thus far: green for hip hop and funk, blue for dance and classical, and red for rock and metal.\n\nI do have a complaint about a couple of secrets in the game, in that there are zero in-game hints on how to unlock those secrets. Unless you spoil yourself buy looking on forums and discussions, you would have to be lucky to stumble across them.\n\nOne thing I would like to see is something to spend coins on after all vehicles and their paint jobs are bought. Because that all coins are used for.\n\nAll in all, for just being a bit of a bare bones early access game, I feel it is worth it to buy this game. Unless the devs try to fix things that aren't broken, it can only get even better from here.\n\n\n4/8/2016 EDIT: The white spots are gone as of the latest update.","February 24","true","26.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And while in Audiosurf I prefer pushing myself over the edge with concentration and reflexes (hello Ironmode Ninja Mono), with Riff Racer I can just not test my reflexes, but also really enjoy the ride. Weither it's technical death metal, synthwave or hardcore underground hip-hop - Riff Racer shines with all the music you can throw in it. It's just that sometimes difficulty and trickness of race tracks are unpredictable - you expect a real storm and only get a calm and boring track, but sometimes it goes vice versa. But it doesn't really matter, because racing in Riff Racer is really fun and you can enjoy your favourite music in a completely new way. The only addition I would really like to see is an implementation of some records system like Audiosurf has, where you can view the leaderboards, notofications when you've been dethroned, friends scores etc.","May 27","true","16.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

That`s not to say it wont set you a challenge though, because it will depending on the music you use.\n\nSomething that does get me a bit though is that it does not really seem in synch with your music, yes it does generate unique tracks, but there does not seem to be much to indicate the track your racing is like racing your music. For example, while you maybe in synch with the track marker, pickups that you collect don`t seem to have a rythmic pattern following the music your racing to, I really think this should be looked at and tweaked. They really should be more inline with the beat, or lead sound of the music, and maybe more of them.\n\nI do agree about some walls too, they can at times appear in obscure places, like right on a bend, or hill top so you don`t get chance to react, so again needs tweaking.\n\nI really do enjoy when it gets to the part of the track with loads of drifting, and in most cases it feels right, it feels that it belongs in that certain part of your music.\n\nOn a final niggle, sometimes track generation difficulty can be confusing, I have tried a drum n bass track and it was given an easy difficulty rating, and was really easy to drive, but then I tried a soft rock track and it cranked up to 4 star difficulty. Rather baffling.\n\nI do recommend this game though, I have lost hours on it, and will more as well, and I hope that over time the engine will be fine tuned to iron out some of these niggles, along with even more excitement and variety of scenes.","May 27, 2015","true","35.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So, on with the game.\n\nThe game is well designed, the visuals are interesting as well as flashy, without being overwelming. The driving in this game works well, but seems a tad uninteresting, due to it seeming a bit like audiosurf without it copying it. The cars you can choose are all varied and come with extra skins, so you can find something that suits you.\n\nMy only real gripes with the game are a lack of choosable difficulty levels, which is bad because sometimes due to choices in music, especially when the mixing of certin songs can be iffy at times. There are also times on the songs where you can't really dodge the walls coming your way, due to jumps that make you land on them, and due to the camera not letting you see downward a little more when jumping.\n\nIt's worth buying though, and I'm glad I grabbed it when i did.","February 10","true","10.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Sure, the beat tracks are nice, and it is a nice way to experience music, but I didn't get the feel of playing a game, but more like an interactive visualizer. Drive Any Track feels like a game built around music, rather than vice versa with Audiosurf\n\nAlthough it's only in Early Access, I would happily play this as a final game. It has fantastic track generation, song detection and smooth responsive gameplay. The handling of cars is different, but after a couple of songs, I easily got used to it.\n\nThere isn't much of a tutorial in the game, but basically, your goal is to stay "in sync" with the song. The game calculates where the beats are, and breaks it into 4 lines, each representing a beat. The first line is in sync with the song, and each line after it is one bar behind. To remain in sync, you want to be between the first and second beat lines. It sound confusing, but it is quite easy to get a grip of, and it works quite well. As opposed to Audiosurf, where there isn't really a desire to "100%" tracks, it actually feels achievable and fun in Drive Any Track.\n\nOverall, If you like Audiosurf and Racing Games, I can't recommend this enough. The track generation is great across a range of genres, the game is fun, and I can see myself spending hours in it.","June 9, 2015","true","8.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Just some things to point out. I think it would be great to actually have an option to choose what genre the song is. To tell the truth, in most cases the genre is just wrong. Most of my electronic stuff is classified as hip-hop and my jazz songs are for some reason pop songs. I know it doesnt affect the gameplay but also it would be great to choose what background do you want for each song. Also the track needs an improvement too. More particles that match the music would be great and more track diversity cuz after like 40 songs I started to feel the track is getting kinda repetitive in some moments.

It's not a bad game.\n\nDrive Any Track (The early version at the time of this review!) is a racing game that tries to sync the racing experience to your music library.  The song selection generates the track, and lets you play it!  This isn't without flaws, however.\n\nAs a racing game, it falls a bit short, seeming to require a joystick or racing wheel of some kind to prevent oversteering and handles quite squirrely.  Other racing games allow PWM steering that makes keyboard play much more usable.  I don't actually have a joystick/wheel to play with, so I'm guessing.  However - saying it falls short might be a bit harsh since the games I'm comparing it to are much pricier as they have a larger development staff.\n\nAll the cars basically go the same speed, with minor variations.  This is by design, and it can't be any other way for this design of game.  If you go too fast or too slow, you get out of sync with the music and it would dull the racing experience of being with the music.   Instead, it opts for scoring points if you're a little bit ahead or behind the point of the music.\n\nThe "sync" with the soundtrack seems weak to me.  The song generates the track and layout and tries to sync with it, but when playing it doesn't "feel" like the music goes with it.   Changes can't be rapid to go along with the music strongly, as it would make the tracks too difficult to play.   In my opinion, some synchronized equalized effects in the background/sides of the race track would be a big help in that arena (Example: Distance).\n\n\nOverall, a fun game with interesting effects.  Hopefully it will get better and more fun!  It's like Audiosurf without the puzzle-element.","February 7","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's beautiful and the music isn't half bad, ha! Nah, but the game is amazing and really does look great. You get to add a music track from your own library and then the game makes a race track for it, and you need to keep in time whilst racing. I love that concept for a game. If you're the first person to race a track, you get marked as the creator of said track, and you get rewarded for it. I don't know about you, but that makes me wanna try different songs in my library to see if I'm the first one!\nThere isn't anything I would add or change about the game. I may suggest maybe car stats to make them different. You know like one is better at drifting, one is better at handling, each car has a different weight, light, medium and heavy, which affects how it flys in the air, you know? I would also like to see the price lowered from $15 to $9.99.

So I love games that let me get some use out of my MP3 collection. Although still in Early access at the time of this writing, Drive Any Track's core mechanics seem pretty well developed. My only complaint is that the visuals get kind of repetitive. While I love the neony Tron look, a  little more variety in backdrops, sky boxes, and track dressing would be nice. If they patched in some Wipeout-ish hovercars and maybe some different game modes, I wouldn't complain. Anyway, great game, for $15.

It was a frustrating start but after I practiced with the controls a bit, I do a bit better now. There are some great things and some not so great things so I will try to list them all.\n\nGreat things:\n-Plenty of cars and paints for the cars.\n-Visually stunning.\n-Simple yet challenging.\n-Track variation is pretty good, although I have found a few songs where most of the song is just drifting back and forth which is quite boring. For the most part though, the tracks are pretty good.\n-Shiny!\n\n\nNot so great things:\n-If you have a downloaded song through YouTube or some other source, there is no leader board for that song.\n-Sometimes downloaded songs will play as a different songs\n-Barricades are placed in bad spots from time to time. Sometimes they are impossible to avoid unless you have the track memorized.\n-Visuals can become distracting if your eyes are sensitive to bright colors, flashes, and other such effects.\n-Controls are wonky. They just do not feel consistent. Sometimes they respond slow. Sometimes they are too twitchy (Example: pulling out of a drift will slam you into a wall)\n-Crate and token hitboxes are not consistent either. Sometimes you can drive right next to them and pick them up, other times they won't get picked up.\n-Lack of control customization and not being able to use mouse/gamepad. You cannot change controls. The controls consist of <- -> [spacebar] and CTRL. There was little tutorial too. I was unsure that I could drift until about my 20th race and then i got a tip saying CTRL was to drift.\n\n\nOverall, considering this is Early access, It is in pretty good shape. There are a few minor things that need to be changed/tweaked/added. But overall, it was worth the money. I would suggest this game to any music lover.","May 23, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The genre categorizer is very good, although one dubstep song in particular[soundcloud.com] registered as a rock/metal song (probably cause all the bass) (I did like the special lighting for that song though). Drifting was a little hard to master at first, but it's very useful in some parts. The leaderboard/chart system isn't the most comprehensive in my opinion. I think the people who say this game is too easy missed the difficulty rating system. There are some tracks that you have to be next-level gamer demon to not destroy yourself in. On some tracks I've found there are very tight turns that can easily make or break a run, drifting or not. I noticed someone else said there's a 30 fps cap, but I've found this to be completely untrue (at least when you play on lowest resolution fullscreen).

Immediately the comparison is made to audiosurf, and I personally prefer this, as your ability to control the direction and speed of the vehicle as well as being able to be slowed down or drift creates a great feeling of weight and control, thus making it feel more immersive in comparison.\nDriving using your own music is something people have wanted in many driving and open world games, and this helps fit that desire. Most general music file formats seem to be supported, and the leaderboard support complete with ghosts to race against makes this game feel well thought out.\nThe only issue I can state at time of release is that when racing against ghosts, it's not always clear how they gain points, which can be irritating as improving your skills and tactics is difficult when you have no idea how you lost.\nOutside of that minor complaint, I can highly recommend this game.\nIt runs very well and looks great, but to note it is stylized and from an indie studio, I am more basing the intended graphics compared to what was seen, and there doesnt appear to be many errors or poor quality visuals.\nThis is a must buy if you are a fan of custom music based games.","May 13","true","4.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If you are the first to play your mp3 (note: you need to have id3 tags on your mp3s), the game will enshrine you as the creator of the track for all of eternity!  You can race by yourself, or race against a ghost of another player who has driven the same song.\n\nThe driving mechanics are just "ok" in my opinion, I've played much smoother racing games.  However, this game should not be confused with a technical racer, it is definitely more of an arcade racer with rhythm game features mixed in.  You can utilize a decent selection of cars, and unlock at least a couple of hidden cars as well.  They have added some more customization options since the Early Access phase, but it is still not quite as fleshed out as what you'd see in other racing games.\n\nThe rhythm aspects of the game are subtle but definitely there.  It's not quite as beat/rhythm focused as Audiosurf in terms of track pickups and obstacles, but the lights and colors of the track flash along with the beats and on certain drifts you can tap along with the beat to get the best result.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game an 8/10.  It really excels on what it sets out to accomplish as a game, despite seeming bare bones in certain aspects that you'd be used to seeing in another racing game.  The game is truly as deep as your mp3 collection, much like Audiosurf, but the racing is enjoyable enough and ghost racing against a friend gets really competitive and fun :)\n\nIf you'd like some gameplay footage, here's me racing against my good friend UncleDorky's ghost!","May 12","true","22.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The controls are very simple, basic driving movement keys [Though default bound to arrows and not wsad] with the drift function being controlled from spacebar (Saints Row 3 anyone?) and a boost button for when you fill your boost meter, which is cleverly displayed on the car and not a HUD.\n\nThe cars themselves are many once you can afford them [W/ In-game coins found within songs] and the designs are radical but remnescent, fitting into the game world perfectly while maintaining styles that many of us should be able to recognize features of.\n\nThe tracks [Road/Highway] are very colorful, as anyone here who has played audiosurf will easily relate to, fitting the music in a good way, with little dancing pixels colorized and moving to the beat of the music. There are stright-ways, loops, jumps, and drift streches, all of which are pretty fun to drive on, all except the drift areas containing barricades you want to advoid. My biggest issue was jumping off the side of the track and hitting barracades while going for coins, but it was all fun, the gameplay isn't overly challenging and the cars are manuverable in air, making mistakes like that semi recoverable. This is  -not- Dark Souls DJ'ing on wheels, this is a fun game ment for everyone.\n\nCoins end up being used for buying new cars and customization options for the cars you do own. You start off with one car that has one unlocked customization, a sporty design in a pretty blue. The songs seem to vary in coins amoung them, I had one song go as low as 90 coins and another up to 250. This does help keep the game a little more appealing since you end up setting goals for getting the cars and paints, though I am only left to wonder that if 250 coins per song is good, then cars and paints costing 20k+ would take quike awhile to get. You do level up as you gain experience points from each song and I can only assume higher levels gives higher coin multiplyers, but that is just my assumption and in no way should I ever be quoted on it.\n\nI don't have any gripes, as much as I tried to find one. While I was playing with the truck I did see my truck reflecting off the truck, which... makes no sence... and I once had a spotlight-beam cross the road for a second, but the map is littered with spotlights, as well as many other eye glittering detail. I have not been able to have this issue reoccure since, even on the same song it appeared on. The only thing that I would like to see is a super drift mode, or maybe a split game from this using the same physics, as the drift portions are very fun and arcade-like. I suppose one can compain about car customization being basic, but in this game there is so many colors and lights that you really only get to fully appreciate your car paint job when not driving.\n\nI'm a fan of arcade racing games and music games, audiosurf was the actual reason I made a steam account in the first place, and I now own sevral custom-music based games. With a game like this, I was only naturaly drawn to it once I saw it in the featured store page, and I haft to say, this game is worth it. Very worth it. It is fun, simple, and effective at staying just that. If you like music-based games, specialy ones that use your music, I would highly recommend this, even if you're not a driving-game fan. This game has its heart in the music, and that is something I can appreciate.","May 13","true","5.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Music has always been a strong passion of mine, I have always taken intrest in music games like Guitar Hero but once I found out about this game I was very excited and I bought it right away (I got it on sale for 6 bucks). I dont do too many reviews so my opinion shouldnt rock yours and influnce you to buy this game.\n\nPROS:\n-Track making system\n-Cool cyberpunk feel\n-Awesome looking cars\n-Very easy to pick up (as long as you have music)\n-Can make music without ID's into tracks (thats for all of you guys who download all your music off of youtube to mp3)\n-All genres make different tracks so its fun to expirment with that.\n-3 sexy easter egg cars that are awesome to try and unlock\n-Perfected and polished smooth leaderboard ghost racing system\n\nCONS:\n-Graphics are cartoony and all the friends I have suggested this awesome game to have been turned down by that\n-Its in early acess and therefore it still lacks a ton of content\n-Track making system, the reason I put this one in both pros and cons is because some things (like volume, drops, etc) can screw up the tracks because it cant tell the difference between 1 or 2 beats every now and then so your dubstep drop or rap outro might be a little iffy (ignore it the devs are doing an amazing job at attempting to fix it)\n-No updates for the past while (last one was August 11th, 2015) as im writing this\n\nMy verdict: 7/10\n\nThis game is awesome and you should totally pick it up when you get the chance as you will have a tremendous amount of fun playing this. It is currently 16.99 CAD (which is not worth the game) so wait till it goes on sale.\n\nI hope this review helped you and ill see you out there on the tracks.\n\nIf you want some gameplay here you go, I did this for a friend on my channel:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3MguSf2WCg\n(I take requests from time to time)","October 5, 2015","true","15.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Kinda sad that has to be a positive side of a game nowadays, huh? Anyways, the actual "racing" itself is done against the pace of the song by way of pace bars you need to try to keep up with to stay synced with the song; the drifting and speed of the game feel incredibly satisfying, with speed boosts placed at areas where the song picks up, or usually, when it goes into a chorus. Also there are spin jumps, which are pretty awesome...when you land them.\n\nNow for the negative sides, starting with what I last mentioned. Because the game has spin jumps, it has a sort of physics engine which the car operates on while midair, and while the game encourages you to do spin jumps to score more points, the car can very easily flip and leave you wiping out, resetting your position between the second and third bars. This could just be a case of "i'm bad at the game," but it's rather irritating to lose your 100% sync rate because of something you have little control over; following up on that note, the game has barriers on the track that slow your car, which nine times out of ten, are completely avoidable. But sometimes you get that one time of the ten, where you can't see the barrier coming up because the track is going through a loop, and the song is ridiculously fast, so you get little to no time to react and lose a ton of speed. Again, could just be me being bad, but also again, it's not satisfying to get jipped out of your score because of that; the big complaint i've seen the most, no WMA support. Kinda lame, but it doesn't bother me personally too much, as most of my library is in mp3 format anyways, but I imagine that's a very large glaring issue for many people. Also, channeling my inner TotalBiscuit, the graphics options menu is limited to resolution, and fullscreen on/off, so if you can't run the game as is, you're kind of SOL. Sorry, yo.\n\nOverall, i've enjoyed the time i've put into the game, and I would recommend it to people who are fans of games such as Audiosurf, and Ridge Racer.","May 12","true","18.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Pickups and elements on the track may be in sync with the music, but the actual control inputs required to drive the course aren't. Overall the driving seems too simplistic and there isn't enough to do in the game. Precision-timed and challenging inputs are staples of rythm games, but this has neither - it's more like a basic arcade driving game where the boost pickups happen to go to the beat of your music.","February 17","false","1.9"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","0"

For example, if you were to play a dubstep song (since they have a lot of bass) or perhaps a trap song, it will sound like a distorted mess. The game just can't handle any bass for some reason. A lot of the odd curves and twists will just send you into a wall or will end with a ramp without giving you enough reaction time ultimately leading to you flying off of the track and into the abyss. The vehicle customization is very frustrating. At first from the trailer, I thought you immediately started the game being able to using everything you want right off the bat. Nope. You have to buy all the cars AND each individual "paintjob" for it, since there is no real customization like I was expecting. Earning money is also annoying. Everytime you start a new song you haven't played before, it will award you with 100 credits(?). Typically you earn between 100-150 in one song. The problem is cars will cost somewhere between 1,000-10,000. The cars (at least in my opinion) don't have a very great default paintjob, so you will try to get another one. Instead of them being free, the paintjobs on the very starter car are between 1,000-7,500 (if my memory is correct). The biggest problem I have with this "buy to unlock" system is that it makes playing the game feel more like a greedy race where every time you miss money, you can't help but to think "♥♥♥♥!" while you slam into a wall 3 seconds later. Not to mention about half of the money pickups you get don't even register. It just feels like an eternity to finally get enough money to buy something. The whole "relax and play" concept is just out the window for this game, which was a thing that made games like Audiosurf fun and kept you playing and wanting to try different songs.\n\nI really want to like this game but there's just too many problems right now. I'm probably going to refund this game, but I won't mind buying this game again if these problems are fixed.","May 12","false","0.4"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","29","5","17","6","0"

They don't support WAV format yet, so that's likely my problem.  If you have the same one, either look into a file converter, or just wait for an update.  Otherwise, you'll just have to settle for whatever tracks you can manage to play.\n\nA very fun game, and I enjoy playing it a lot.  Games that use music as part of their mechanic interest me a lot.  However, a couple caveats.\n\n1. You'll want a controller for this game.  I had to play with the keyboard because mine didn't work, and I just can't get the precision I need with the steering.  Having a stick would give me a finer degree of control, instead of guessing how long to hold the arrow keys in a turn.  Drifting, at least, would be much easier!\n\n2. I can't speak for others, but I cannot, in fact, "Drive Any Track".  In fact, the majority of my music doesn't seem to be recognized by this game, despite no problems with either Audiosurf nor Beat Hazard, two other games with a similar mechanic.  This is a little frustrating as I find the only tracks I seem able to play are those I've picked up online somewhere, some possibly even pirated (I would really like to pick up the albums, but I'll keep my pirated tunes if it's the only way to play them).  I rather hope they fix this issue.  I have a lot of music I ripped from my CDs onto this computer.  I don't see why they're not available, yet random and silly songs I've collected from who-knows-where work just fine.  Unless my music is just too obscure to be supported, which shouldn't be a problem.  Not if the game wants to live up to its name.\n\nEven so, the game is still enjoyable, and perhaps some of my random tracks will inspire people to seek out more eclectic music they've yet to find.  Even stuff by some furry music artists.  I should still have plenty of songs to play.  I was just expecting to be able to play a lot more of it.","February 23","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Going through my  library of music on my hard drive to find the best driving song is a blast, and before you know it you sunk over an hour into it. That said, the algorithm in place to make tracks out of your music does have its issues. Sometimes on the harder difficulties, I find unavoidable barriers, jumps impossible to make without boost, and oddly placed boost pickups. Since this game is in Early Access, I know that these issues will probably get ironed out. That being said, The game has lots of different futuristic looking cars to drive with different visual liveries for each. The drift mechanic is fun and feels satisfying to get a big drift combo, but it would be nice to be able to chain your drift combo through turns without losing your streak.\n\nPros:\n- Lots of Cars\n- Endless amount of levels\n- Pick up and play\n- Addicting\n\nCons:\n- Algorithm needs tweaking\n- Addicting\n\nAll in all, this game is fun and I highly recommend it!","February 15","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
