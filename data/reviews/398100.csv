You can complete it in under 2 hours, and it doesnt have any variety.\nCompleting the game once to unlock the whole gallery is a bust as you dont get rewarded from playing it a second time, you only get new dialogue.\nChoices dont make much difference and there are very few endings, 3 to be exact, not even a hidden easter egg ending? Shame...\nAlso the pacing was a bit too Sanic. A lot of new things were just slapped on your face and it was\nreally hard to keep up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/messiahdmr/recommended/398100/","messiahdmr","Sapphic Princess","http://steamcommunity.com/id/messiahdmr/","1422 products in account","Originally written to investigate on potential yuri content, this review is written from a queer perspective, although I do not claim to speak for anyone in the community but myself, and any opinion expressed here only reflects my own personal experiences.\n\n- Characters -\n\nShoji:\n- Main Character, androgynous looking\n- Some shots show a definite feminine physique complete with a narrow waist and wide hips\n- Complimented on their feminine appearance, may even get upset when confronted to their lack\n- Initially identifies as male only, and still refers to themselves as male by the end\n- Grows up into their female persona, even enjoying it to some extent\n- Starts thinking in terms of what is appropriate for girls to do together during interactions\n- Is permanently afraid of people finding out about them being male, feels guilty about it, and becomes afraid of losing their friends if they were to find out about their situation\n\nLea/Ms. Rowen:\n- The Principal, potential romance\n- Seems overly enthused about the Shoji's feminine appearance\n- May buy you female clothing, and even enter your cabin when trying underwear\n- Definitely into forced feminization, from the way she treats Shoji\n- When Shoji points out they're starting to enjoy school even if they're not being themselves, she retorts that she doesn't think she would be any different as a person if she pretended to be male, and that interests and clothing should be enjoyed regardless of their stereotypical gender association.\n\nSelina:\n- The sportive girl, potential romance\n- Genuinely finds you attractive as female\n- Initially assumes Shoji to be transgender as their female identity appears genuine\n\nHoshi:\n- The nerdy girl, potential romance\n- Is confirmed to be uncertain about her sexuality\n\n- Story -\n\nI didn't expect a lot from the topic at hand, given the treatment it is usually given, but was actually surprised with a quite compelling story, with a protagonist that seems genuinely torn between their personal feelings and others' expectations of them, also experiencing what appears like some mild gender confusion along the way, for example, when asked if a lesbian, Shoji will initially answer no, but later feel confused and claim it to be both false and true. I know there are multiple endings and even if all the romance options knew about the protagonist's identity and only seem to really get involved together after Shoji openly reveals it to them, at which point they reveal themselves that they knew it all along and did not care, because they still are the same person that they have grown to like and/or love, I would say this game did tackle its subject matter rather competently for the most part, subverting the "anime cross-dressing" and "only boy in a girls school" clichés and, in my opinion, even scoring a few points on the LGBTQI side.\n\n- Major Spoilers -\n\nSelina:\n- Queer ending, where Shoji admits enjoying dressing up with her and reverting to a female role, albeit privately\nHoji:\n- Straight ending, where Shoji permanently assumes a male role\nLea:\n- Teacher's Pet ending, literally, she seems to get off on forced feminization a little too much and I found her slightly creepy\n\n- Final Verdict -\n\nI'll be honest, I was very curious but also expecting to tear this game a new one due to the tropes it's wearing on its sleeves, but I instead found myself quite pleasantly surprised, maybe I'm being biased because I found some parts relatable, sometimes in a reverse sort of way with the protagonist being male but having to pretend to be female because of the plot, lending to a sense of confusion and dysphoria and ending up like one of the most faithful depictions of gender issues I've seen in a video game, maybe I'm being generous on account of what these subgenres usually do, maybe because it's not so much about sex as interpersonal relationships, but I found Highschool Romance to be a cute and endearing visual novel, with some interesting views on gender roles and social expectations.\n\n\n\n- Addendum: Theory Corner -\n\nAs with the introductory disclaimer, this theory comes from personal experiences only, as the more I played and thought about it, the more this game seemed to have deeper layers.\n\nNow, this might seem crazy, and can be disproven by a few scenes in the game, but I thought some facts didn't line up, which brought me to an interesting, if flawed, theory:\n- What if Shoji actually was actually a transgender male student?\n\nLet's look at potential hints:\n- Their mother signed them up as female in a girls boarding school, which Shoji blames on inattention\n- Shoji's physique shows a distinctly female waistline and hip structure, dressed or not\n- They might be flat-chested, but they are also arguably the only character with a proportionate breast size in the game\n- They might make a point about shaving their legs being difficult, but not every woman does\n- When confronted about their feminine appearance, Shoji questions their actual masculinity\n- The principal could very well be forcing Shoji to conform to gender norms, which they can refuse\n- Shoji identifies as "a guy through and through", but reluctantly accepts to conform to said norms\n- Shoji is a male given name, yet nobody seems to pick up on this fact - at all\n- On the same note, they show attraction towards girls, but do not identify as a lesbian\n- Their clothing choice might be masculine, but it is repeatedly pointed out by other characters that they seem to be equally comfortable wearing female clothing, and wonder if the masculine look is more of a statement, the Principal also makes a point about it (read above)\n- The only person that is not convinced that Shoji can appear like any other female student is themselves\n- Shoji shows a lot of signs of gender confusion, feeling either complimented or insulted about their feminine appearance, and often getting caught in thinking from both male and female points of view\n\nSo yes, while this theory can easily be disproven by literally one scene, I thought it interesting to include as an after-thought that all along this game, Shoji could also appear to be someone who stongly identifies as male and feels trapped in a female body.\n\n…then again, I could just be reading too much into what is just a light-hearted, slice-of-life visual novel.","November 22, 2015","true","11.0"," 177 of 235 people (75%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","75","177","235","19","17"

The choices you make have clear impacts on your ending, and there is one route more difficult than the others THAT IS VERY MUCH WORTH IT.\n\nGet this game if the idea of virtual cross dressing appeals to you, and don't worry you can always say someone gifted it to you and you had to play it!

It's a cute game with stylish art, the characters look great. But it's pretty short. You can play through it in about one two-hour session, which isn't including the different endings of course.\n\nSomething else that bothered me were the static characters. There aren't a great many expressions for them, and this clashes with the dialogue and intended emotion of the scene more than once. There are visual novels out there that do this better, but it's never really jarring, just disappointing.\n\nAlso, I would have liked it better with adult content. Not sure if they left that out because of Steam or aesthetic decisions, but there is no 18+ version of the game.\n\nI'd recommend waiting for a sale, but if you have the money to blow I defs recommend it.

"Nudity" is a rather misleading tag because the closest you get is underwear and lingerie. This fact is better, though, as players can focus less on mindless sex appeal and perhaps enjoy the story a bit more. Is it worth $10? Probably not. Is it worth playing, however?

Someone hate it, someone love, but its part of our life and we cant ignore it.\nSo... Whats, if accident happens and your new school is girls-only?\nSome pervys can imagine it as harem, but this story isnt about it. Its about guy, who needs to crossdress into girl cuz of this situation. Sounds mad? Maybe, but if it wont scare you - just grab this. Or if you like 2D traps, like I d...nevermind :I\n\nSo, in short.\nPros:\n+ Few routes. Yep, its not katawa shoujo, but here are 3 full endings (full = not when you ends with your hands only). Also few choises - not as much as could be, but also not like in sakura series :/\n+ Pretty graphics. Rlly - not another copy-paste, where every character looks same as other one in different title\n+ Fanservice. I know, lewds, you are here for it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) There is, actually, no nudity, but, atlest, no pg13 erotic too, like in sakura series (Im used this again, cuz its very popular in steam)\n+ Cards. Cuz this game is a bit niche, they have a bit higher price than they could be. Thats cool if you dont wanna to craft badge. 3 of 5 drops in game.\n\nMehs:\n~ A bit short. Im not fast reader, cuz english isnt my native language, so - I did 100% (all routes, all choises, all stuff in gallery) in like 4.5 hours (and one more hour farmed cards). Its not worst result for vn, but not best too.\n~ Plot. Im not fan of slices, so - it wasnt my coup of tea. But, for someone else its may be in pros, so - placed it here\n\nCons:\n- Not much sprites. Rlly. Not all action scenes have custom backgrounds actually, like if its censored (but it isnt). For not free vn, its not best thing.\n\nOverall: its little, but fun (rlly fun - some scenes made me laugh) slice vn, a bit cliched, but it looks different anyways, cuz of situation.\nIn my opinion, its must have for every trap-lovers and recommended for fans of slices. Also, as I said, its may be awesome to gift it to your male friends with stereotypes :^)\n\nAnyways - Highschool Romance 2 announced and my body is ready :D\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nPS: Selina > Lea > Hoshi.

Screen transitions between scenes and days.  A distinctive text difference between your actual speech and your inner thoughts besides italics which you can barely distinguish.  Backgrounds that change based on time and location.  A pacing which lets you take your time and enjoy the experience before it's suddenly over.  A readable text background that doesn't make your eyes hurt after a few minutes (seriously, that bright red is enough to blind someone...)\n\nThis game lacks all of those things.  It's a breakneck adventure with sudden jolts between scenes that is difficult to keep up with at times.  Whenever I started to feel myself enjoying the experience, I was jolted into another scene and the immersion was broken again.\n\nAs a first attempt at a game like this, it's not terrible.  A $10 price point for this 2 hour romp through a fairly token story is a little steep.  You wouldn't regret paying a buck or two for it if you're tired of trips to feels town and just want a light-hearted romp with a few girls.\n\nI can't give a full recommendation in this state, but I'm still curious for the sequel.  If they smooth out some of the rough edges in the interface, learn about pacing, and make the game a little longer, Highschool Romance 2 could be a solid game.

Playing through a route may take you about an hour max, but if your like me and your a completionist, I can't really guess as to how long it might take to find all the scenes.\n\nIn the game you play as Shoji, a guy who enrolls in a private boarding school with no idea that its female only. During the ensuing chaos when you find out you get talked into pretending to be a girl so you can stay. As far as I know, there are two routes. Hoshi, and Selina.

His review was 10/10 IGN... Unfortunately, that was the best part about this game. I got HS Romance during a sale for 5 bucks - granted I played for almost 5 hours, I feel like I was slightly jipped. Why? Because the reviews made me think I was in for a crazy adventure that was just insane in every aspect. What I ended up getting was actually a relatively tame visual novel that told a relatively average quality story with little artwork and a short completion time. This makes it sound like I'm ragging on the game, but really, I think it was worth the $5 I payed for it. Just allow me to explain WHY this game was enjoyable - actually and truly.\n1.) The art that's there is really pretty and has a unique style. The girls are cute and the environments colorful (even if both are repetitive)\n2.) You actually do have some choices to make that effect the endgame. None of the choices are groundbreaking, but they DO make a difference\n3.)Because the content isn't as risqué as some reviews would have you believe, I played this for a stream with a couple of friends. We had plenty of laughs and were able to stay entertained for most of the title.\n\nTL;dr? It's pretty and has cute girls, but the nudity tag is a lie.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mrs_Sprinklebottom/recommended/398100/","Mrs_Sprinklebottom","♡.:Trixie:.♡","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mrs_Sprinklebottom/","83 products in account","This game would really only interest a real anime fan that enjoys finding more LGBT oriented stories and characters; not at all something to interest a casual anime "davvler" i guess would be a good word to use and someone not of the supportive LGBT variety. Its a visual novel about a androgynous boy that is mistakenly transferred to a once co-ed boarding school that is now an all girl school. So naturally the best course of action is to just go with and pretend to be a girl with the full consent and help of the principal. We've all been there once or twice right? By the way it is of course a visual novel, that means really its just a picture book that will have you spneding all your time reading and clicking your mouse just to turn the page. Ocassionaly you will have to choose what your character decides to do for what situation hes in, which is just to determine which girl you want to end up with\n\nThe 4 main characters--including you--are basically the common cliche, cookie cutter anime stereotypes found in alot of anime: Youre the androgynous "male" character that ALREADY looks like a female, yet somehow doesn't realize it and thinks he's a man's man, there's the softspoken shy over-academic glasses girl--with big boobs, the outspoken sporty competitive girl--with big boobs, and your hot-blooded principal/teacher that's actually SUPPOSED to be an older woman but looks and dresses like a teenager and has a thing for barely legal young men--of course with big boobs. But i still felt they were nicely designed characters.\n\nThe story as well is just as cliche but tells itself well enough, its a shame its not just a full flegded animation. You fall ontop of girls in awkward intimate ways, you spill things on their big boobs, youre forced to make decisions between them, etc. Your character, while supposed to be heterosexual and cisgendered, somewhat discovers he can "enjoy" transvestite activites at least during 2 of your interests' paths (alot of people dont know a transvestite actually has nothing to do with homosexuality or transexuality) but thats really all the "character" developement that happens. However i cant in good faith advocate this as a truly lesbian or transgender novel because its not supposed to be despite it giving that impression.\n\nPros:\n-It has a great bright vibrant artstyle that i absolutely love (perhaps even a bit too bright enough to hurt your eyes).\n-The girls have nice designs--especially Lea (omfg i want her clothes... ;_;)\n-Is a sweet romance anime novel\n-I personally rather enjoyed the girls personalities. Selina specifically i feel is the best and strongest character that probably makes the story as interesting as it can be, with Lea being the second.\n-If you look nicely drawn boobs, then the story has nicely drawn boobs on sexy ladies\n-Silly and humorous\n\n\nCons:\n-The whole grounds the story is based on is stupid i have to say. Thats not me necessarily saying its bad, but it is something that would ONLY happen in anime.\n-Notice how i kept saying the girls are nice characters with the exception of the character the story is taking perspective of right? Thats because the guy is not a great character at all that doesnt really have any terribly interesting qualities or talents that the other characters have to read about whether that was intentional or not. Not much is learned about him besides what you begin the game knowing about him in otherwords and thats how each story ends\n-The music while it is sweet and cute, is too few in variation and gets a little annoying after how long they go on and how often theyre used. It was especially annoying when youre reading something really intimate and mature happening between the main character and one of his interests and theres this really cheery upbeat tune playing to it that sounds like you should be reading about a little girl having a tea party.\n-No sex in case thats something you were expecting. It's strictly romance with some saucy moments, but nothing involving intercourse.\n-This visual novel was made to particularly interest anime enthusiasts that like romance, underlying LGBT stories and characters. If thpse things don't interest you this game novel most assuredly will not\n\nFinal verdict: 5.7/10. I genuinely did enjoy it for the story so i give it a thumbs up based on *my* interests. Lea and and Selina are great vibrant characters that are most of the interest to be found here while you are not in my opinion. There could have been more done with the story and the main character i feel. With that said i will certainly look forward to what the publisher is working on next.","February 22","true","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Reminds me hentai artist Doxy.\n\n\nCons:\n-Not enough background arts. It's quite annoying to the characters talking about being in a completely different place than what is shown in the background.\n-Not enough character portraits. In many cases the characters expression doesn't represent their emotion properly.\n-There is still a few of mistakes where some characters said something that's supposed to be said by other character. It doesnt really bother me but mistakes are still mistakes.\n-Uninteresting story. It's the same quality as some random hentai doujin.\n-Bad music looping. Sometimes the music fade out completely as if something is about to go down while in fact the music track is just ended.\n-The protagonist, Shoji is completely drawn like a girl. No crotch bulge, hips wider than his shoulder, curvy waist, etc. Which is a bit disappointing since any decent trap artist would have left some male qualities in a trap character. Although it's understandable since the dev is probably trying to attract more normie audience.\n-The profile backrounds you get from crafting badges is sooo badly edited. Which is even more of a disappointment since the artworks in the game is really good.\n\n\nRegardless, I still enjoy the game as it is: a visual novel game with trap protagonist. If you are a normie this game could be your gateway to trap hentai. If you are a person who already explore the deep world of hentai though, you are probably going to be disappointed.","March 6","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Seriously. You don't advertise "You're a boy crossdressing at a female school!!" and then do literally nothing with that. Your target audience isn't normals. It's weebs. You get three routes, two of which are nearly identical, railroaded, and filled with so many lame timeskips and things like the game telling you this character you've seen twice is suddenly your best friend. It even offers a Mass Effect-style ending decision node. Really?\n\nStory aside, this game has next to no art assets. There are 18 event CG in the entire game, and several of that number are literally the same scene, just with different underwear on. The main character is drawn as a girl and called a guy (No, seriously, he has childbearing hips and wears eyeliner in your first look at him). There are three characters that have sprites, three expressions for each, and three sets of clothes: School, Casual, and Underwear. Oh, I guess the Principle has a yukata too. The game frequently forgets that the characters actually have multiple expressions to choose from; past the halfway point no one will react to anything visually again.\n\nThe background CG is horribly limited too. For instance, in one scene everyone starts commenting how it's night time and the fireworks going off are beautiful. There's no firework CG, no firework effects, no firework sounds, and the background is still bright with a blue sky like it's 1 PM. In another scene, you're supposedly in the gym showers getting mud and sweat off of yourself....and the background shows you in the school's entrance, by the shoe lockers. What?\n\nArt isn't the only type of asset lacking in this game. There's no audio. The only sound you get is the repetitive soundtrack, which seems as limited as the Art in variety as well. Inappropriate music plays several times, setting a mood that doesn't reflect the text in the slightest.\n\nAnd then just like that, the game's over. After nothing happens for an hour, you suddenly choose one of the girls and, if you chose to hang out with them a lot, you end up marrying her. It's bad. It's literally "Which do I choose?" [Hoshi] [Selina]. Oh, and [Lea] is only an option if you answered the first decision in the game correctly. Yes, the best route (with most of the CG and noteworthy scenes) is completely locked out if you express dismay at the idea of crossdressing to stay in the school. If you go full weeaboo and express some interest in crossdressing, Lea hops all over you. her route is the only one that's got any entertainment value in it, and I only enjoyed it because I could skip all the scenes without her, as I'd already completed most of the game at that point.\n\nI unlocked all 18 event CG and had seen all scenes in this game, while streaming, in 2:41:00. This game is short, shallow, and unimaginative. It doesn't even play with its premise. By all means, send it as a gag gift to people. That's how I got it. But for your own sake, don't buy it and expect even a passable time. I'm surprised that the developers canceled their kickstarter to develop this privately; it really feels like they'd put something out just to say they did it. Even Katawa Shoujo is leaps and bounds ahead of this one.","December 29, 2015","false","2.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The story itself is fine as far as typical highschool dating game stories go, but it's not particularly long, and with the skip function you probably won't break 3 or 4 hours between the game's 3 routes. The art style is what will probably make or break it for you; I personally liked it, but I've also seen a lot of people who hate the style due to its more western appearance. Overall it's a decent game for fans of the trap genre, but I was kind of expecting more from it.","December 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

It's a visual novel which last for about 5 hours to play through. Even though it sounds like a short game it isn't, the game shoots at you so much in so little time it almost seems like the game lasts longer than it does. I have played many great dating simulators and visual novels and Highschool Romance is one of the best i have played. Highschool Romance is definitely on my top 3 best visual novels and dating simulators list. The story is amaizing and it dosen't get booring. The many decisions that you make through the game change the story a lot which is great. You can have three different endings in the game, which means you can play it again two times if you like (and maybe more times if you want the ending which you thought was the best again or if you just like the game). I highly recommend the game even at it's full price. I give the game 10/10. Ou and for the creators of the game Thank you  so much for this amaizing game! I really enjoyed it a lot!","February 21","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is typical to all VNs I have played though they were missing one of the more important features to a VN. I was unable to scroll up to view previous text, which is generally a hallmark of VNs.\n\nFor grabbing the game at around ~$6.75, I spent 6 hours 100%ing it. I found that a price of $5-7 range is the best for this game since it isn't particularly long and somewhat repetitive. There are about 4 background tracks tops and sometimes they do not fit the scene they play in which can convey the wrong kind of atmosphere to the reader imo. Another aspect that fit in the okay, not exceptional category is that I think there are... 6? background CGs tops. Not to mention that the character's writing  would have benefit way more from a longer game.\n\n\nBasically it boils down to:\n* Not many background CGs\n* 3-4 music tracks tops\n* Music did not fit some scenes\n* Characters were a little shallow, leading into\n* Game should have been longer for better character depth\n\n\nDespite the flaws, I did enjoy the art style and the story was certainly alright, though reactions to certain things were a bit disappointing. Get it if you are new to the visual novels genre and would like to give it a try for cheap\n\nRating would be about 3.5 out of 5\n\nlea best grill","February 21","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then I spent an hour getting the other endings, which are linear to each other, just with a different person and in some cases, a different posision at the same location except some of the Lea moments (Unless you send mixed answers to all of them, then it just ends prematurely and says that this school was just like the rest and he gets nobody). It's like a multitrack recording, the same song but there's anouther mic on a different instrument playing its melody to the same tune.  After that, it's like a book you've already read. The suspence is gone (well, it was really gone after the first time around, there was a hell of a lot less once the 2nd and 3rd were underway) and you end up just skipping through all the dialogue because you've been this way before, just click a different answer. The cost to entertainment ratio is horrible, but I will admit, those 1st 3 hours were great. It managed to play my strings like I were in a relationship, I even squealed at certain parts in joy! (Boy, does that make me feel like a girl...) If the sequel was released, I'd probably get it to see excactly how this could be followed up, and if the length issue were addressed. I really do like this game, it is a short but sweet wonder, It'd be a 5/5 if it had more length to it, but since it doesn't, 4/5 will do. I will end this stupidly long meandering ramble to nowhere now. Thanks for reading.","March 4","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Would really recommend it to those who like concise VN's with very few characters.\n\nI suppose there isn't a whole lot to say about this game, more-so considering i'm a 'noobie', but anyways!!\n\nThe art was cute, more or less "aesthetically pleasing" from MY point of view (although some might disagree), and the characters were fairly interesting with seemingly different backgrounds and personalities, albeit I suppose it would've been appreciated to branch a bit more on their characters-- It may've made them a bit more 3D in a way, but beggars can't be choosers.\n\nAside from all the interesting options, the semi good music (it wasn't bad but it wasn't overly good & the changes weren't all that in 'sync', if that makes sense, making it a bit off to listen to-- More or less, overly joyful music & suddenly a dreary tone slips in. Otherwise it was pretty good for the most part), and the pretty cute characters (ngl Shoji has wormed "her" way into my heart among the other characters), the gameplay itself was....lacking to say the least.\n\nAs many others have stated, the game was far too short and I honestly would've appreciated a lot more, maybe some other characters and various scenes which would've made it a bit more fun! (There were some scenes that were described but didn't have a picture which was a tad bit upsetting to say the least-- For further clarification, i'm not talking about the scenes that progressed soon after one of the CG's showed up or the small tidbits describing certain things progressing around the main character).\n\nThere were a few grammar mistakes & some of the CG's weren't necessarily linked up to what was being said, for example, Shoji would mention something about putting his shirt back on but in the CG he'd still be in a bra or whatever-- Just nitpicky things, nothing that detracts from the overall gameplay and nothing to really, you know, fuss about.\n\nAside from the cons to this game, i'd really only recommend this to people who're looking for short gameplay and very FEW characters (as well as choices). Can't really complain about the price as it wasn't OVERLY expensive but not TOO cheap to be considered a rip-off of it's worth.","December 19, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it needs a "skip read" function to get through the massive chunks of unchanging sory between choices on replay. I play a lot of visual novels and dating sims, so maybe I was expecting too much.

CHARMING YET SIMPLE STORY, BUSTY BABES, NO NUDITY, LITTLE TO NO REPLAY VALUE\n\nHighschool Romance is a VN...and from there I don't know what can stand out when you compare it to other VN's. The story unfolds, you watch, you get to do some decisions which won't impact the plot at all, just the ending, but then again, when the title says what's this about, this is what you get.\n\nWhile I find the main plot as something done a thousand times before, it manages to engage you with enough charm on it's simplicity and waifu material. Characters have some good traits to them, but, aside from one, I never felt that any of them were anything beyond stereotypes.\n\nMy only real problem with this game is that I find little to no replay value, I can only see a comitted completionist finishing this game with all endings, and after that, I don't see him picking it up again. A real shame because the visuals give the game a personality of its own.\n\nBUT my main complain is why didn't the devs make any freaky fakkin' nudity content/patch?! I know Steam would rather have me eviscerating one of this vixens before seeing their nipples but, come on Lord Gaben!! This is the kind of game that I play with the mouse in my left hand and a bottle of wax in the right one. With the crossdressing, the silly dialogue, the busty schoolgirls, the cliches I'm almost expecting a porn movie with Johny Sins as Shoji! Serioulsy, some H content would have boosted the replay value, and perhaps added some depth to the character's relationships (it's about love right?).\n\nYeah, yeah, there's a sequel with actual nudity but no, I don't like it's visuals.","April 24","false","9.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"

With that said, I have completed all three of the story arcs, both good and “bad” endings.\n\nIt's a nice little visual novel. However, it left me wanting several things, especially if you compare it to something like Katawa Shoujo. Overall I would rate it 6/10 but I would not recommend the game to a friend in the current state that it’s in.\n\nHowever, if it’s on sale then go ahead and get it.\n\n*Long Version*\n*Cons*\n-There are several lines of dialogue that could be used as choices. I don't know if it's just me, but I would prefer a choice of telling someone if I'm a lesbian instead of being able to choose tennis or running.\n-There is also a severe lack of endings. There's only three routes and five endings in the game. More characters would be nice or the addition of truly devastating bad endings instead of the neutral like "bad" endings. Also with the addition of more characters, it would allow other endings to close off easier and make the choices in game more meaningful.\n-More character flaws would be nice too. It seemed to me that everyone was a "Mary Sue" and gave me no real reason to become attached to a character. There's a lot of opportunities, however, in the plot that would allow for development of flaws, which brings me to my next point...\n-The plot seemed rushed. There are so many good events or problems that could have been expanded upon. I.e. when Hoshi is doing other people's homework, this subplot gets dropped within the same scene and never brought up again. There are countless more examples of this and makes a game that could be 4-6 hours long take only 2.\n-The art doesn't always match what's going on in the background. If dialogue says that it's dark then I don't want to see bright blue skies in the background. In addition, the only still pictures used are for either kisses or underwear scenes. It would be nice to actually see the board games that you're playing with Hoshi or the fireworks that are in the sky during the festival. In addition, there are a lot of character models with different expressions. It’s hard to take the scenes seriously when Selina or Hoshi is supposed to be mad but their faces are smiling.\n-The music is annoying after hearing it over and over again. It's too simple and short to hear constantly.\n-The transition of time is awful. Several times the game moved on to the next day. But because there are no visual cues or even change of lighting, it’s hard to follow when that happens. Just the screen fading to black for a second would be better than what is there.\n-An interface to recall previous dialogue. If you skip something you have to either revert to an old save or start over from the beginning.\n\n*Pros*\n-This game has a lot of potential. It has an interesting concept and a decent story. I really enjoyed Lea's path.\n-The art is actually really nice. I just wish I was able to see more of it. I really wanted to see Shoji and Hoshi sing karaoke.\n-It takes a delicate and controversial idea and doesn’t butcher it.\n\nOverall I would give it a 6/10 as of right now. What I would really like to see before the release of the sequel is a more fleshed out version of this. If that were to happen then this game would easily be 9/10.","February 17","false","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The UI seems spot on.  I start reading and I'm in the character's head, but then as soon as we get to the principal's office, I'm suddenly surprised at the Principal's response.  There was no indication of items being said vs being thought.  It was jarring to need to spend that extra moment to pay the closer attention to tell what can be taken intuitively by a little more setup or preparation.\nThe art was has a very unique style, and it has its own lull appeal to it, though at times it had me slightly repelled.  My preferences in what I'd want to see could be overlooked, because it's so different, but there became a few other issues with the art so far.  One is just how little the characters differ in form/posture.  Maybe I'm not far enough in yet, but as an example, the main character we're following says the principal says something 'so brightly' yet there's not a single change in the smile, eyes, or posture to indicate that it was remotely true.

The UI seems spot on.  I start reading and I'm in the character's head, but then as soon as we get to the principal's office, I'm suddenly surprised at the Principal's response.  There was no indication of items being said vs being thought.  It was jarring to need to spend that extra moment to pay the closer attention to tell what can be taken intuitively by a little more setup or preparation.\nThe art was has a very unique style, and it has its own lull appeal to it, though at times it had me slightly repelled.  My preferences in what I'd want to see could be overlooked, because it's so different, but there became a few other issues with the art so far.  One is just how little the characters differ in form/posture.  Maybe I'm not far enough in yet, but as an example, the main character we're following says the principal says something 'so brightly' yet there's not a single change in the smile, eyes, or posture to indicate that it was remotely true.

I bought it in spite of fact I rather dislike all these novel-story-games seen around lately. I love anime on TV, but this kind of thing doesn't please me in a game.\n\nWhy I bought it then? For one and only reason - because it reminded me of these funny sim-date flash games that were popular when I was in middle school (yeah, and games were mostly 18+ ;))\nI don't know why, but this specific game title has recalled me all that, and so, despite my worries, I finally purchased it.\n\nAt this moment I've played it 3 times, each for about 1,5 hour. Need to mention, in my first attempt, I have kinda lost... hard to say if I should call it like that, but yeah, I didn't get "the goal". So, take it into consideration while playing it - this possibility also exists.\n\nI must say, after playing it for longer while I've pretty got liked this game. I still need to try one more ending, and I want to check the importance of each decision for the final result.\nBut for it's price, the game had a potential to be "more", with even better dialogues, much more art with different poses of characters, and of course - enhanced variety of choices.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Quite entertaining story, good dialogues, lovely art... and pretty girls, obviously!\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Short game (with this, it could be much longer), small variability of choices, not enough art (more pictures! more different poses of characters!)\n\nWould I recommend buying it then?\nMaybe not for the standard price. If you are not really into this genre, then you'd rather think twice before purchasing. But if you enjoy such games - go ahead!

That I couldn't direct the game in the direction I *really* felt it was hinting at, yet never delivered on.\nIt kinda made me wonder, if the game wasn't ''fearing'' to delve deeper into the whole 'being dressed as a girl' thing, and intentionally blocking/not exploring moments where, clearly, it could definitely have.\n\nSo... Good game, but disappointed that it explored so little.","November 20, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It only got 4 characters, including our main guy. And the music is very boring...\nHowever! if you get past all that, and just read it for fun, it truely is. I really enjoyed the many dumb situations, and loved thinking of what I'd do myself in those situations. It is also one of the visual novels I've read that I actually felt good about the endings, and one of the few that have given me some great laughs.\nThis is not Katawa Shoujo levels of great, but it is worth a read if you got the money to spare, and ain't too narrow minded.

Luckily I think, otherwise it would have lost its charm with me.\n\n===\n\nI really like the artwork of this game, the characters all look amazing. Sometimes you get a little piece of extra artwork of a scene in the story.\nSadly, there were many times while reading the story I wanted to actually see that scene drawn on the screen rather than just the character sprite explaining it to me in just text. The backgrounds are all devoid of any life, maybe not to distract you from the main characters, but this school just looked empty to me.\n\nBasically make the choices toward the girl you like between Selina and Hoshi. With ms. Rowen you will have to be a bit more daunting. To make another playthrough easier, a handy skip button allows you to quickly pass all the text you already have read.\n\n===\n\nI liked this game for its art style and the stories intertwined well with eachother.

Yes it's about a guy going to all girl's High school and end up living his High school life as a cross dress. BUT I do like the drawing. Feels kind of unique in it's own way.\n\nI wish they put more girl's though. Since I believe this game has a short story, I do wish they put more girl's or characters for more options. I feel less likely to encounter any event flags if there's less character in a short story. Also, I do have hard times reading the text. The text color and the back around seems hard for me read. It might be better if they used black outline instead of white on the text. (This might be only me, but just saying.)\n\nOverall, I'll come back again to re-write the review after I finish it. I say It's a pretty decent game. I've seen people say it's ♥♥♥♥ game, but compare with other Kuso-ge I played that sells over 5000 yen (cough...Cough!

This game is barely worth full price, if that. But it is not bad.It's the definition of a quick and simple romantic VN. It's a textbook example of how to make a game using as few original assets as feasible while still looking wholly original. It's a game with exactly three routes, little to no deviation, and effectively nothing in between it's few and sometimes meaningless choices.\n\nAnd yet I still can't say skip it outright.\nThat's not praise for this game being above or beyond anything else good. I mean, It's not nearly as unoriginal or boring as some others. SAying KURAp like that about this game would be disrespectful. Cough cough. At least this game has something to it, but beyond that... If there was a median between recommend and not, I'd be pressing it. It's... passable. Fitting considering the protagonist but I digress.\n\nIt's certainly functional. I got exactly one spelling error, which is pretty good as far as VN track records. The music fits fine, and the characters all look colourful, distinct, and eye-catching... all four of them. My point is, it hits all the right notes for a good game, but never goes for that epic solo that could make it a great game. The story routes for all three girls mostly follow the same plot points, including assured events that occur even when you have zero interest in them on your, say, third run. Unless you go for the third and evidently "truest" route, they'll be rather quickly completed anyway. And as long as you don't make truly boneheaded choices or half-hearted decisions, you'll have everything done in no time. So... What else is there? Besides Lea, who alone made my final route run through this game as cute and appealing as I was hoping. Seriously, she's great. But she alone can't make the game great.\n\nNot much really. Get this game if you want to spend an hour decompressing with a cute but quiet story. Otherwise, let it be. I can't ask more of the game, since it isn't really lacking anything. But I can't fully feel satisfied either.","December 5, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have a lot to say, both in terms of the Pros and Cons, so I'll list them out for the sake of convenience.\n\nPros:\n*The artwork is very nice and detailed.\n\n*All the characters are somewhat likeable.\n\n*Offers dialogue options.\n\n*Girls are cute.\n\nCons:\n*Although the artwork is very well done, there is not enough of it. Most if it is just the same artwork with a clothing change, like a sports bra instead of a normal bra, and it's disappointing overall.\n\n*The dialogue is honestly awful. The way the plot progresses and is paced is poor, and there are many grammatical mistakes in the text that make some sentences hard to understand.\n\n*There are only 3 girls, and I found all of them boring and honestly too perfect to believe. It actually makes me harder to like characters if they have literally no flaws to them whatsoever.\n\n*The endings are disappointing/terrible based on which one you get. The amount of boring text I had to get through to reach the crappy end was definitely not worth it.\n\n*Even though there are dialogue choices, I've noticed most of them don't change the story much and are just there to make you THINK you are making an important decision.\n\n*Price is too high for the production value of the game.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall, this game has a lot more negatives than positives, and I feel that this game is not deserving of its price tag. Compared to Huniepop, which has voice acting, animations, engaging dialogue, more characters, and doubles as a super addicting puzzle game, this game definitely disappoints.\n\n5/10\nI do not recommend purchasing this for over 5 dollars.","February 20","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is short for the money, but as you'll see, it's worth it in the long run.\n\nNow the good. The storyline itself is formulaic, but the plot is AMAZING. I went in to this game optimistic that it wasn't going to be one of those sketchy harem games where the "boy" is just trying to get his wick dipped. The developers did not disappoint; the protag has definite dimension and… personality. I'm actually not sure if this was actually a surreptitious way to introduce a transgender protag or not; Shoji certainly seemed to take on the feminine role very quickly… and almost too well. I love that the developers actually reference this in one of the potential endings, though it isn't as strong as it could be (which is all I'm going to say, as I can't divulge any more without actually spoiling it).\n\nAll in all, I have to say that this was a pretty epic win. I have taken some chances on other otome games, and some have been good (such as Michaela Laws' Seduce Me), and others that weren't so great (and I'll not make mention of them here). I'm pleased to say that this one is in the former category. I find myself actually looking forward to the sequel. I spoke with the developers (who are very responsive in the forums), and I like some of the ideas they have for it. We need more trans characters placed in a good light, and I think they get that.\n\nFinal verdict: Is it worth your time? Hell yes. This is a great story that warms my heart. My profile background has recently changed to Hoshi, and my desktop background is Selina and Shoji in the park. That's how much I enjoyed it.","February 24","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is barely worth full price, if that. But it is not bad.It's the definition of a quick and simple romantic VN. It's a textbook example of how to make a game using as few original assets as feasible while still looking wholly original. It's a game with exactly three routes, little to no deviation, and effectively nothing in between it's few and sometimes meaningless choices.\n\nAnd yet I still can't say skip it outright.\nThat's not praise for this game being above or beyond anything else good. I mean, It's not nearly as unoriginal or boring as some others. SAying KURAp like that about this game would be disrespectful. Cough cough. At least this game has something to it, but beyond that... If there was a median between recommend and not, I'd be pressing it. It's... passable. Fitting considering the protagonist but I digress.\n\nIt's certainly functional. I got exactly one spelling error, which is pretty good as far as VN track records. The music fits fine, and the characters all look colourful, distinct, and eye-catching... all four of them. My point is, it hits all the right notes for a good game, but never goes for that epic solo that could make it a great game. The story routes for all three girls mostly follow the same plot points, including assured events that occur even when you have zero interest in them on your, say, third run. Unless you go for the third and evidently "truest" route, they'll be rather quickly completed anyway. And as long as you don't make truly boneheaded choices or half-hearted decisions, you'll have everything done in no time. So... What else is there? Besides Lea, who alone made my final route run through this game as cute and appealing as I was hoping. Seriously, she's great. But she alone can't make the game great.\n\nNot much really. Get this game if you want to spend an hour decompressing with a cute but quiet story. Otherwise, let it be. I can't ask more of the game, since it isn't really lacking anything. But I can't fully feel satisfied either.","December 5, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because of this the main character Shoji has to pretend to be a girl. Now, when I first heard about this game, I was excited to find a game with a crossdressing protagonist as it's so rarely handled nowadays. But I was also very worried since whenever it is handled... well it's not usually handled particularly well.\n\nHigh School Romance is actually very mature about the concept though and talks about it in a somewhat respectful manner. It presents you with a main character who, while obviously a touch hesitant about crossdressing at first, grows to accept it and learns something about himself. Occasionally it does delve into dressing up as a 'kink', but it treats it very equally, painting it not as humiliating but as 'sexy' on both sides.\n\nSpeaking of 'sexy', the artwork is lovely and the characters all look superb. This is a style I really love and the CGs are all really great. The presentation elsewhere however is lacking and feels a touch sloppy. There aren't enough expressions for each of the characters, there are typos, music doesn't always fit the scene and sometimes scene transitions are there, sometimes they aren't which can be a little jarring.\n\nIt's also exceptionally short, which makes the asking price somewhat hard to sell. It took me just less than 4 hours to fully complete it, which was in one sitting I might add. However, thanks to it's brevity and the sheer lightness of it's plot it's perfect for a quick fluffy time if you're ever feeling a little down.\n\nAnd that's what this mostly is, a fluffy cute Dating Sim with crossdressing in it. And while it's not as developed as other VNs it is at least entertaining for what it is.","January 4","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Highschool Romance, You play as a Dude called Shoji, who was accidentally Enrolled into a All girls collage for your final year of collage, due to an error on your forms saying you are female. but instead of leaving and ruining the year for entry exams the Principle, called Lea, has come up with the idea fo you to dress up as a girl so you can "blend in" and complete the final year. (the reason he changed collage is that him and his family travel alot)\n\nSo around the collage you meet 2 Girls who slowly become your friends, one is Hoshi, who is a quiet timid "book worm" who is the Class rep in you classroom, and then you meet Selina, who is a busty, bashful sporty type. things happen and you are caught up into a "love net" between the 2 girls.\n\ni wont spoil the ending but its really Heartwarming, and there is a third "woman" you can fall in love with.\n\nive had 0 hours when i wrote this but i watched about 3 playthroughs of this game and it took my heart....\n\nOk, that was creepy O-O''","December 24, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are three different girls you can end up with or you can end up alone. So to put it simply you have three good endings and one bad one. Depending on your chooses, will depend on what girl you get, But this game is rather simle and usually only has one or two options to pick from when making a decision. If you want a game that will challenge your relationship skills and romancing skills then this isnt the game for you. If you just want a quick romatic and cute love story about a cross dressing teen guy then, I say this might be the game for you :3  If you arn't tht serious about buying the game then I would highly suggest waiting for it to go on sale, but if the game really intrests you then go ahead and buy it. I personally would buy this game at most maybe 10$, anything more I think is too pricy for this game. It has a cute story that is mostly predicatable and to get through all the endings took me like max two hours. But over all I would define the game as a quick and cute romance story.","December 25, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After that, you may spend some time messing with the in-game choices in order to unlock all four achievements. For this particular purpose, there's a handy skip button that lets you speed past any dialouge you've already read. It actually stops at a point where you haven't read a particular dialouge, so that was helpful.\n\nSpeaking of choices (2-3 at a time), they're not anything that you'll have to think hard about. You can save and come back to them if you'd like but there's also the skip feature.\n\nThe background music is nothing amazing but also is not going to annoy you.\n\nStory: You are a boy who is accidentally enrolled into an all-girls school. You are in a situation where you don't have any better options so you pretend to be a girl. If you've watched an anime episode where this happens to the main character, you know what you're getting.\n\nIt's a fun novel but the only thing going against it is price. Is $10 worth ~1-2 hours of your time? If not, wait until it's on sale (I bought it during the Winter sale). Otherwise I recommend it.","February 3","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As I played and made choices I found myself part of the story and I became very interested in what the outcome would be.  Also, although I could never be Shoji, I could never pull off pretending to be a woman,  the various characters and romance pulled me into the story.  Of course when I made my choices dividing time between both girls I ended up with neither of them as in real life.\n\nSo I read the achievement guides and followed the Selina True Love scenario:  a Feminist choice: she spends her time teaching Shoji how to be her boyfriend.     Now he does not know if he wears dresses because she wants him to or because he likes it.  She wears the pants and he wears the dress.  She is the husband and he is the wife.  I would never have gotten this achievement if not for reading how to get it.  It just would not work for me.\n\nLea True Love:  the woman who is the principal and gym teacher: looks more like a model than a principal. Lea is an older woman who sneaks around flirting with Shoji trying on sexy bras and panties in front of him asking for his opion.  Then she kisses him.  In the end they get married and live happily ever after.  In both Selina and Lea True Love scenarios they both like to see Shoji in womans clothing and continue to dress Shoji up as a female.\n\nHoshi True Love:  Shoji does not have to wear the dress to entertain Hoshi and a happy ending.","April 13","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What also caught my attention was the cute art tyle.\n\nPros:\n+ Art style is pretty\n+ Gallery\n+ Total of 3 romance options\n+ Crossdressing, try it out bro\n\nCons:\n- Way to short for the price (There will be a sequel)\n- Uses mostly the same soundtrack\n- Writing seems rushed\n\nIn Conclusion My biggest problem is that the game is way too short. Best to get it if it's on sale or you have a coupon for it. Funny dialogue, but you can tell that they wanted to quickly finish the game. I finished the game in 2 hours, and maybe more.
