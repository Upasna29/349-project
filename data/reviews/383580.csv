"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SSSeal/recommended/383580/","SSSeal","Sin Seer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SSSeal/","144 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAre you:\nA fan of eating?\nA fan of flesh?\nA fan of flesh eating?\nIf you're a fan of eating, then you've come to the wrong place. Steam is a game retailer, not your local food court. Similarly, if you're a fan of the latter two, then you're a either a pervert or a cannibal and should seek help. Regardless of your strange fetishes, Flesh Eaters is the game you’ve been looking for. (not really)\nSeriously though, seek help.\n\nWith that out of the way, I’ll be scrutinizing the game and everything I can fit within the hour. Moving on to the game, every aspect of it, be it gameplay, controls and visuals, are all as you’d expect of an early access game. These range from typical game crashes (a staple of any noteworthy game in beta), clunky and laggy controls, to endearing AI antics where both zombies and humans alike refuse to do anything except molest doors and have intense staring contests with one another. A shame though that the zombies look more like Saibamen with ♥♥♥♥♥♥-like mouth holes, if not I’d have guffawed at the potential romance.\n\nGameplay wise, Flesh Eaters plays more like a slow-paced strategy game. So if you’re expecting to personally deal deliverance onto grotesque hell-spawn who failed to reach the river Styx, you won’t find it here. You do however, get satisfaction if you manage to plan and coordinate your characters - a squad of four humans, comprised of three potential classes. Though, experiencing the peril of being surrounded by naked abominations as each quarter of your own self dies isn’t bad in itself either.\n\nSupposedly, we’ll be seeing a bunch of updates and promises of a campaign and the like. So, there’s that to look forward to. The game is currently on sale at ¢15, with trading cards on the way, so you’ll likely be able to make your money back there. At 10MB, I’m sure even toasters will be playing this game within the not-so-far future.\n\nApparently, the game was given away for free (I can't substantiate this, since I can't be bothered to google though). You know what I could’ve gotten for 15 cents? 15 cents worth of games, that’s what.\nIf nothing else, 15 cents is alot cheaper than a single mp3 you'd find elsewhere.\n\nSo with updates on the way, there’s no way the game will get any worse ((see: ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) (addendum:see sarcasm)) , and at the price the game is currently at, you have nothing to lose save for the 15 cents you spent.\nWe’re trusting you on this 16bit Nights.\n\nTL;DR: (whether these are pros or cons are up to you)\nNo goats here\nYou beat up ♥♥♥♥♥♥-mouthed monsters\nYou’re suppoting an indie developer\nToasters are the future.\nToaster is Love, toaster is Life (you can burn zombies if you haven't guessed)\nThere are no dragonballs\nFriendship blossoms between the hunter and hunted\nEducational game about how we can all live in harmony by the power our eyes\nThe game is still in development\nYou’ll see more content\nNo doors are safe\nHas spuukisounds\nIt’s cheap\nTrading cards are en chemin\nI don’t have necrophilia, honest.\n\n\nFor now, I guess I'll take my thumb and eat i- I mean recommend it. Definitely not a cannibal here. No siree. Not me.\n\nNote: I’ll update this assuming I’ve gotten a better grasp on the game.\n\nEdit: Alot of the issues I mentioned have been fixed, so I can't help it if my review is outdated. I'll think about updating the review when the game comes out for real, so for now, just consider this review as some kind of historical document. And please, DO NOT message me..","September 2, 2015","true","4.1"," 127 of 171 people (74%) found this review helpful 160 people found this review funny","74","127","171","160","7"

I was buying a few games, had left over money, and found this. The game could have some great potential... At the current stage of development, there isn't much... But more will be added...\n\n*Options*\nAt this current point, option setting are bare... Allowing you to swap from windowed to fullscreen.. Well, it's not much to say the least... This game is very early in dev, around one month old... I know the dev(s?) are working on a story mode, which is great 'n all... But I think you might want to fine tune some of the bugs, and the current content, in the game.\n\n*Bugs I've encountered*\nI've read some of the other reviews on this game, talking about encountered bugs... As others have said, sometimes I launch a new game, "Error reading Squad"... I've also had a glitch where I told my guys to use the work bench, and my mouse disappears! This also happens when I level up members of my group...\n\n*AI*\nI think the AI/Path-Finding of squad members, and zombies, needs to be looked over... Maybe making people able to open doors if you select an area through a locked door... Sometimes the zombies keep see me (well, at least I think) and carry on walking to another window/open door... But, it's a game early in development..\n\n*Gameplay* [I played this game offline for a bit]\nThe game can be a bit of a cluster f**k at times, zombies spilling into rooms, being backed into corners... But that is the point of the game, staying away from those problems is what the game is about! You need to manage your meds, ammo and the health of your 'Squad', which is kinda hectic at times... But thats why it's fun... Some people say it's not very well explained, but if you go to the menu, it tells you what pretty much everything does...\n\n*Over All Verdict*\nThis game is very cheap, £0.79 infact, rightfully deserving a space in any bargain bin/shelf... But not every store would accept an unfinished game... It's worth a note that at the time of this review, 13th August, the game is a month-or-so in development...\n\nIf you don't mind playing a slightly buggy game, have good hand-eye coordination when your mouse disappears, a\nd don't mind playing a game with little optimisation, then enjoy the game...\n\n*When you write a cheesy ending to a review xD*","August 12, 2015","true","0.2"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","30","43","5","1"

Now that it's been fully released...not much has changed. While there is a tutorial of sorts it doesn't tell you much and the difficulty is...unreasonable to say the least. You start the campaign with no resources and only two guys, with only 30 days and very limited resources this would be a challange but add in random chance for both destinations AND results, extremely high resource costs for everything, very slow resource collection without dedicating your levelling to looting (and considering how slowly your guys level up...) and tactical maps that DON'T reset or even change a little on revisits (what are the zombies still doing in the now empty building?), it's blind luck if you succeed. I only ever finished one objective, making a vaccine, because the map you finish it on is easy to defend and has resources. Escaping? You'll either never find information, never get an engineer or never find the workshop.\n\nI'm sorry, but there's challenging, and there's unfair.","May 4","false","4.9"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","3"

However, the devs have done nothing to improve the overall gameplay experience since it first went EA. The controls are infuriating, as there is no precision when clicking on a target...Click on a zombie to shoot it, and your survivor runs straight into his loving arms to have his face eaten. The sandbox got old rather quickly due to its repetitive nature, but I had hoped the campaign might offer some change of pace.\n\nHowever, the campaign mode is absurdly frustrating. Basically, an RNG decides what events are available, which determines what resources are available. For example, If you don't have any ammo, then you can't play a level that provides no ammo, or you will be killed immediately. Given that you only have 30 campaign actions (e.g. search something, play a level, save your game) before you die, and way too many objectives to complete, the campaign is ruthlessly difficult. After about 15 attempts, I decided that there really is little point in playing anymore, since it wasn't even fun by that point. I had hoped for more from this game.\n\nConsidering the low price point, I want to give the devs the benefit of the doubt, so expectations of graphics, sound, and grammar/sentence structure can be overlooked. Even so, this one is going away to the "another dissapointment" section of my library. This is mostly because the game just isn't any fun after a short while due to its RNG-ish nature.","May 3","false","2.8"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","2"

While the rest of the maps are self explanatory, the name should be changed for test lab because it isn’t self explanatory. You have no idea what’s going to happen when playing test lab. Also, a undo or back button would be nice when choosing the difficulty over constantly resetting the game.\n\nCons\n-No time for strategy\nHoly ♥♥♥♥, this is a huge issue I had with the game. Controlling multiple characters at the same time in such a confined area is a nightmare. It isn’t fun or engaging, it’s unfair hard.\nYou’re going to constantly misclick since everything is so packed tight together, and the the hotkey for choosing each character is even worse. You have no sense in which number selects one character, and constantly going through all the numbers before getting the right one within the few seconds the game demands you to execute.\n\nIt’s especially hard for new players who have no idea what’s going on. You don’t teach the player that you need wood and metal to create barricades within 50 seconds, give time for each player to examine the area and get used to it.\nDon’t add a time limit, but at the beginning of the game, let the zombies come once you reached a certain point when the player is ready for zombies.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to fix this, add a pause button. No, not the one you currently have. let the player be able to pause the game and examine what to do, give them a little space to breathe. Let them be able to control where the character role fits while still in the pause menu, before the plan is taking to action after you unpause the game. It’s better than constantly managing multiple characters while having zombies after you in real time.\nIf you don’t understand what I’m explaining (which I understand, I explained it pretty badly), I recommended you a game called, “FTL: Faster Than Light”, it allows the player to strategize before making their actions. And no, it wouldn’t make the game easier. FTL is hard as balls, yet it’s mechanics are extremely easy to master. Create a proper learning curve and give the player a chance to get used to it’s surrounding within the first playthrough. This doesn’t mean the game has to be easy, just make it harder as the player progress.\n\nIf you don’t like that idea, how about the medic is able to slow down the game so the player can examine the area and strategize while playing? So, you can organize all of the characters properly while simultaneously fending off.\n\n\n-Graphics\nThis is honestly just kind of a nitpick of mine, but the arms look ♥♥♥♥ing hideous.\nFunny at first, but it gets distracting real fast.\n\n-no explanation or hotkey\nThe game just drops you and tell you what role this character is, and put it in this certain room to gather material.\nIt doesn’t explain that you need wood to barricaded windows, or that you need this for that.\nNeither does it explain which hotkey does what. What’s the key for healing your teammates with the medic? Do you left click him? do you right click him? Nope! I still don’t know how to ♥♥♥♥ing heal my teammates.\nA little guidance would help, but don’t constantly hold my hand during the entire playthrough.\nOr just let the player decided the pacing of the game in the beginning, just like how I mentioned earlier.\n\nThe only way you learn how the game works, is constantly dying and learning new mechanics. Which is fine, I love dark souls, and the foundation of the game revolves around that. But the key difference between the two is that, one is fair, and the other is not. I already explained earlier how it’s unfair. But even then, dark souls still did a good job explaining how the game works right from it’s tutorial and it felt fair when you died. Majority of the time I died in this game simply from unorganized character clustering around in one area not doing what I planned them to do because it never explained how to do this stuff or which buttons to press.\n\nOther stuff that was on my mind when I was playing:\n\nA multiplayer would be nice. Maybe a vs mode when one player is controlling the zombies, while the other player is defending the place.\n\nCheap game. Didn’t really include this in the positive because the price of the game doesn’t have any effect on the gameplay itself. Unless we're talking about DLCs or add ons\n\nWhat’s the point of a story mode? It seems kind of off when you consider how the game works, and how will it function?\nWill it just be a exactly the same ♥♥♥♥ing thing as the survival? I really hope not, just please add more depth to the story mode then just adding a new layout of the game. That’s just lazy.\n\nit has a lot of potential and could be a more action based game then FTL. It just needs to get over the cloggy controls and unreasonable fast pace.\n\n\n>mfw I spend more time proofreading and writing this damn thing over actually playing the game.","November 21, 2015","false","1.2"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","15","21","3","3"

I purchased & have been watching this game from its early days, eagerly anticipating & awaiting its final arrival...& now thats its here...all I can say is its an extremely underwhelming disappointment.\n\nIn what was recently described by the Dev, as the FULL GAME now being released, I thought great, theres more content now, theres actually a finished story mode to play now...sadly this is not the case.\n\nBefore the supposed final release the game was very bare, with little to do other then a tutorial mode & some simple & lacking sandbox modes.  It appeared there was an, as of then, unfinished story mode that had you sitting at your base/HQ with some cool looking features & an option to choose missions to go on, which looked cool & promising.\n\nThat is what I was looking forward to in its finished state...but after relaunching this 'Finished" product, those features are now, nowhere to be found & instead were replaced with an overly simplistic, dumbed-down, pick 3 random events to chose from every day that gives a you a quick option like loot firetruck for random supplies, in which you take no part in, it takes you to one of a FEW locations, like a hospital, or lab or police station.\n\nProblem is you have only 30 days total, 30 days which are counted with the click of ONE mouse button to proceed to a quick random event or a quick & meaningless venture to one of the few building locations.  30 turns to chose from before the game is over, win or lose...I literally zipped through story mode in 10-15 minutes each.  Not cuz I wanted to, but because there is sooo little content to actually play through.  And the side missions where you actually do go through the police station etc are bugged, so that after going back to these places, they are still swarmed by zed, most often times giving you little to no opportunity to gather any supplies or do anything other then make a hasty retreat.  Rinse & repeat this until day 30, 10 minutes later where you either lose or somehow manage to complete any of the 3 dumbed-down objectives.\n\nI hate to criticize & leave bad remarks, but after waiting for something at least half-way playable for this whole time, only to be treated to this shallow, hallowed out experience is just wrong.  Im especially taking the time to write this negative review, because this game had so much promise & potential & COULD have been one of the few special games here on steam that COULD have stood out amongst a lot of the other crap on here.  But sooo much was left undone with this game & the Dev has stated they are done with this game other then minor fixes or bug tweaks, which STILL will not make this game worth playing, even for the super low price.  I would have to be paid to endure spending any more time on this game.\n\nIn short, at its foundation, this game had the look & the feel & potential to be a very fun, very captivating experience, but instead was left dry & empty & void of any real content & we are instead left with what feels like, just an extremely, very incomplete & unfinished game, which is a huge shame considering the foundation & ideas were solid & this game could have been so, so much more.","May 6","false","2.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","3"

I adore games like these, with survival being the main point of the game, and this game has some good points but every good point is shot down by bad points. Let me start off with some of the pros.\n\n-Multiple characters that you can choose to fit your play style: Feel like being a badass who doesn't need any healing? Go ahead and have only soldiers on your side. Feel like planning a bit and staying in a hole of protection? Go with a mixture of soldiers, mechanics, and healers like I do, or even if you feel like challenging yourself you can do so by getting only one soldier and the rest are medics. This is fun and varies the gameplay a bit.\n\n-Waves give you time to do things inbetween them: You have no clue how many games I've played where the waves go by so fast that you have no time to upgrade your weapons or anything. It sucks when that happens and adds a difficulty that I don't exactly enjoy, especially when the upgrade station is so far away from where the main objective is.\n\n-Fairly good graphics: This one seems a bit of a stretch in reaching for good things, but hear me out. So the top down perspective is hard to work with, but that's not all the graphics have to offer. There's small details in the menues that made me chuckle a bit because it's lighthearted and rather nice to see in a zombie game, and the upgrade menu has a nice feel to it too.\n\n-The upgrade system: Now, this one is kinda nice. You can upgrade anyone at any time, if you have the materials. Even the armor can get upgrades! Your armor can break though so beware of that. The mechanics get some turrets and such, the medics I haven't touched because of reasons I'll get into later, and the soldiers get gun and armor upgrades. It's nice to see the visual change of your character too when you upgrade.\n\nNow for the cons...\n\n-Terrible character movement: When you click on an area for your character to go they can often flip out. You have to click on an area for the character to go there, which is normally not a bad thing, but whenever you click the character can often get stuck on something, or even slip around while trying to move, which segues into my next point.\n\n-Glitchy movement: Your character, if you click multiple times, can spaz out. The first time I clicked three times the character slipped through the wall and out of the main map. This part sucks and I had trouble dealing with it. It happens multiple times and I feel like it's due to poor programing on the character part.\n\n-Overpowered zombies: So this was kind of a huge issue for me. Your first wave starts out easy (Mind you that I'm playing on easy because I'm learning things) but as soon as that second wave comes around you're screwed. The zombie killed my soldier in two hits, or some really fast hits that seemed to do a lot of damage. I couldn't escape because of two issues, one is the terrible movement with the glitchy spazment, and the other is my next gripe.\n\n-The slow character movement: Your characters are barely faster than the zombies! The rooms are about as big as a normal house, right? Then why is it that the characters walk like they took too many drinks and are hobbling slowly because they'll fall otherwise? I don't like that. I'll move on to my next issue\n\n-The door mechanics: So this should be simple, yes? Well, it's not. Since story mode isn't available yet we have to go with sandbox, which isn't too big of an issue. The game is still in the works so I can let that slide, but when it comes to doors I can't. When you click on a character then on a door you will often get the message "The path is blocked", but you're clicking on the door, the only thing blocking the path. This is an issue because you have to click near the door to get your character over to the door and then click on the door to open it. That's confusing because why can't I do that to begin with?\n\nMy next issue is a bit more personal, but still.\n\n-The item harvesting: So you sit in a room with some scrap matal, ammo, and some boxes. You harvest them and have to sit there, just waiting till you can upgrade your character for the next wave. I don't like this. The entire outside is a black void, why not fill that with something? Why not have the outside filled with cars and stuff that you can harvest some metal from to add to the danger? Lower the zombie strength and add some risk to the area. Maybe have some simple things inside you can harvest such as drawers from the kitchen for some wood or maybe some electronics for some metal, but have it limited till you're forced outside to harvest car parts for scrap.\n\nOther than that you have very small nit-picks, such as limited upgrades which feel like they need more tabs, the lack of mele weapons for everyone, and the weird way of healing people.  Those aren't too big of an issue to me. Overall, it's an early access game and shows that. I want to see this become something good, and it probably will become better with the next update. Keep working on the game man. I like it thus far, and can't wait for story mode to open up","September 12, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

Build a team composed of your choice of a combination of soldiers, medics and engineers.  Then zombies appear.  Then you kill stuff.  Then your team dies.  Rinse, repeat.\n\nPretty classic formula... and the game does have hope.  However....\n\nHowever there is a long way to go on this project to make it accessible.  First, the campaign is under construction.  Well, the game is in early access.  But this means the only things to play are "survival" mode or "objective" mode.  At least one of these modes you can win.\n\nThe game is plagued by a lack of information and buggy actions from your team.  If the game is all about micro-managing six people, then for the game to be fun those six people need to do exactly what you tell them to.  There are pop-ups that briefly describe how mechanics work, which will get you the basics of say, gathering resources.  But the first time you go to a workbench there is no knowing what the different objects you can build will do.  This leads to a lot of un-necessary trial and error.  This is made worse because you are always on the clock.  More zombies will soon spawn and are looking to over-run your small squad.\n\nThe other problem is control....  Many times when trying to select a new soldier the click would not register right and instead my currently selected sqauddie would go wandering across the map.  This sort of thing ruins a tightly paced rts where you only have a few people you control.  Even when the clicks do register, you are facing issues of the AI seemingly not triggering to do what it should.  Medics will sometimes not heal, soldiers with loaded guns don't shoot.\n\nMy final playthrough ended with a soldier who appeared to be invincible, with the screen covered in zombies, all who did not appear to be able to damage him.  I was not impressed.\n\nWith luck this project will shape into something special.  Right now, there are better timewasters.  3/10","September 17, 2015","false","2.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","7"

You can also craft new equipment  (weapons, for example). This requires crafting materials you can collect in different ways. After the tutorial you have 30 days in story mode to complete it. Each day is one action you decide from three available options randomly generated for that day. This means you can pretty much lose the game in 5 minutes by choosing the wrong options or you can win it in an hour or two, by extending the time you have to finish (visiting the shelter gives you 3 extra days).\n\nThe gameplay for the story mode is very demanding and requires throughout planning. That is why so many reviewers gave this game a negative review, which pretty much baffles me. Getting to a point where you can extend the time you need to level up and prepare for getting 100% in the game's tasks is relatively easy, and from there you can restock ammo, from the Save us! event, for example.\n\nThere's many different approaches, depending on the way you want to play. I chose the glass cannon approach and invested heavily into ranged weapons, totally neglecting any kind of protective gear. It's possible to craft protective vests and approach the zombies directly, though, so if you're keen on saving up ammo you can follow different ways of obtaining resources.\n\nAs I mentioned before, you get to pick from 3 randomly generated actions, and they could either give you a roullette kind  of outcome - lose hp or get a fair amount of certain resources - or let you save the game at this point, or allow you to attempt one of the tower defense kind of maps, where you can assign your team to do certain tasks.\n\nWhether you level them up to be faster and more efficient in gathering materials up, or more effective in combat is up to you.\n\nI highly recommend Flesh Eaters, as it's a great game for that price and very fun to play.","May 6","true","3.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","1"

It features barricading mechanics, crafting, and zombies. Lotsa zombies. The game's story mode is not yet out. The game is fairly basic for an RTS squad based game, theres 3 classes that you can utilize, engineer(Who can make turrets and mines), medic(Who has a healing aura), and soldier(Who shoots stuff). The engineer can give himself melee weapons, but thats pointless as zombies can inflict countless debuffs on you, usually killing the inflicted within 15 seconds. The medic can't fight(I believe), making the soldier class the best offensive class. Sort of. The engineer can still make turrets, which can't be attacked and can still wipe out plenty of zombies. (I usually roll with 4 soldiers, 1 medic, and 1 engineer.)\nSo, in terms of gameplay, you start off in small map that may evoke wonderful memories of the original SAS: Zombie Assault flash games. Theres barricades, you fix them by using wood, which theres a box of, you use metal and wood together to craft your soldier some better armor, and eventually, some power armor. Each unit can also reecive level ups, for 5 traits(Health, speed, looting, barricading, hand combat). In early game, you should level up really quickly, and maybe even end up max rank before the special infected show up. More on that later, but there are some problems I should point out, firstly pathfinding can occansionally screw up, and when you try to correct that by pressing somewhere else, your unit continues walking on, blissfully unaware of the zombie horde about to close in on him.\nLike many a zombie game, each wave progressively gets more difficult, in terms of zombie numbers and special infected popping up. Theres your regular zombie, fast zombie, fat zombie, and armored zombie. There may be more, but i've either beaten the objective mode too quickly, or died too early.\nSo, all together, I enjoyed this game. Its simplier than other RTS games, but thats not a problem. For a cheap price of under a dollar, i'd say you should pick it up.","September 10, 2015","true","5.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Sort of.\n\nInterface/Menu/Settings.\nGraphics are okay.\nMusic is bad.\nThere is a music and sound volume silder.\nYou can only play this game in Full screen or window mode. However there is no way to change the resolution.\n\n\nAbout the game\nTHIS GAME IS STILL IN VERY VERY VERY EARLY ACCESS.\n\nCurrently there is NO story mode.\nYou can only play 3 modes. Survival, Objective and Test/practice mode.\nThere is a difficulty settings.\nThere is a level system and you are able to choose what skill you are going to increase.\nHas no Tutorial and it lacks a lot of information.\n\nThere are some instruction/help when u start the game, but they will vanish when you start the level and there is no way to turn this on during a level again.\nPathing is bad.\nZombies/characters tend to get stuck.\nThe music is very annoying and repetive.\nThere is no-ingame options only at the main menu.\n1 hit from zombie and you are bleeding/infected.\nNo Manual Reload, They will only reload if there is a zombie in the area and is fully empty.\n\nIt has wonky Mouse controls, and a character has a delayed command if you already give a command before.. Which means if you miss click, you might have to wait a second or 2 until he is doing the correct command.. So lets say, If you want to attack a zombie, but u accidently click on the ground before him, you must click on the zombie again but this will take 1-2 seconds. Because he doesn't have "attack move". This is a really annoying thing during combat.\n\nIf you click to attack a zombie and he isn't near it, he is going to say "out of range" instead of walking to the zombie and attack it. So that means you have to click into the zombie direction and then click again to give the attack command.\n\n\nOther things\nDevelopers are trying to be funny with odd drawings.\nThis game is extremely bad and unplayable.\n\nThis is one of those games that shouldn't be published online if the game isn't ready.\nThis game is CLEARLY not even CLOSE to ready.\n\nBecause you are only limited to play "some" modes and the game is very wonky in many stages.\nI do not recommend this game at all. Not even with discount.\nHas many bugs, Including Crash bugs.\n\nI give this a 2/10","December 19, 2015","false","5.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","8"

This game is a superbly crafted game with good 16-bit (I think) graphics. But in a game like this graphics do not matter. the gameplay is just wow (running out of adjectives already) it has good rts elements and and good well rounded units. One gripe with it is I feel like not just the soldier should be able to fire a gun, Medic and Engie could possibly fire a gun a weak one, much weaker than the soldiers but it would make it a bit easier. Now the actual defense systems like building things up is also pretty good maybe adding more defense other than wood like using metal for barricade as well? there are game breaking glitches I crashed 3 times for 90 minutes and my engie got stuck in a corner twice but yeah it is still in alpha.  But all in all this game for being priced $0.15 (CURRENTLY) it gets a solid 8/10 and for being a amazing indie zombie defense only reason it is not higher is because the glitches and lack of a few things. the reason it is not lower because it is still in alpha. But you creator of this game you should be proud you have made a better game for $1 than games that are $60 these days also an amazing early access.","September 12, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The price is pretty decent and for the time being you only have Objective and Survival which can both be pretty difficult. Always go with the first level if you have not played this game before, I love it at times of how you can upgrade and have someone collect this and do that. And if you do those things you can level up which I did not find out after a few times and then clicked on it and where you can upgrade the resistance to the disease, hand combat, health, speed, and various others. It's a game about trial and error since you have to die over and over again with your selected Medic, Solider, and Technican. Sometimes you'll have the hand to hand kind or the one with a shotgun and can upgrade the vests, hand to hand combat weapons and even riffles. Still a bit more to learn I wish there was a tutorial or something to the game with each guy so if you needed help with anyone of them you would have that guide book to look towards. Also baricades can be repaired and hold up pretty well if you want to just collect and upgrade, just don't keep the zombies out for too long or you'll be in really big trouble. Sometimes the mechanics are fine if you have the door open but if it's closed and you're trying to get one of your guys over there and he says "That way is blocked."

I got a crash after my guys got to level 8 or something. The best strategy seems to have three troopers and a medic, although I can't remember if you need an engineer specifically to repair the car. There is apparently a story mode and achievements coming but ATM the only thing to do is play the sandbox mode. It's really fun until the game crashes.\n\nEdit: It took me about 15 minutes to finish the game without it crashing, and it was really fun.

This game is a superbly crafted game with good 16-bit (I think) graphics. But in a game like this graphics do not matter. the gameplay is just wow (running out of adjectives already) it has good rts elements and and good well rounded units. One gripe with it is I feel like not just the soldier should be able to fire a gun, Medic and Engie could possibly fire a gun a weak one, much weaker than the soldiers but it would make it a bit easier. Now the actual defense systems like building things up is also pretty good maybe adding more defense other than wood like using metal for barricade as well? there are game breaking glitches I crashed 3 times for 90 minutes and my engie got stuck in a corner twice but yeah it is still in alpha.  But all in all this game for being priced $0.15 (CURRENTLY) it gets a solid 8/10 and for being a amazing indie zombie defense only reason it is not higher is because the glitches and lack of a few things. the reason it is not lower because it is still in alpha. But you creator of this game you should be proud you have made a better game for $1 than games that are $60 these days also an amazing early access.","September 12, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I highly recommend.\n\nAlthough I must say that some things need a fixin. Some really major, they inhibit the gameplay a lot and if they were fixed it would make the game much, much better.\n\n1. The movement is a little clunky, running into other members of my team and canceling there gathering really sucks. Not being able to move through a doorway in time to heal my teamates because a mine is in the way or just simply because they dont want to go through, is annoying and need a major fixing. That would be awesome!\n\n2. Game crashes on exit! Just a bug, either way I guess it closes it :P\n\n3. A Majour bug, the mouse cursor isent where it should be, It is way above and to the right. Which makes it hard to navigate properly, although when telling my team members where to go it seems to be pretty on par, which is odd. I use a 1920-1200p Monitor. Just probably different then what the devs use, but hopefully they fix that too.\n\nOther then that again I highly reccommend it. Fix 1 and 3 and Im happy. A story mode and more objectives? Wow... Anything the Dev does more to this game, makes him look fantastic in my books. Will be looking for future games from you in the future (I like keeping track of bad devs and good devs, trust me.

The elements of a good rts/rpg are there I love it how random events occur throughout the levels and how each class has various items unique to them. I can't wait to see what this game will look like in the future. I definatly felt the stress every time a new wave hit and where to position my survivors to keep them all out of harms way.\n\nThat being said I know this is in Alpha and it is great but there are a few things I noticed. The engineer and medic classes felt a little bit like a waste of space since it costs so much at the work bench to upgrade them. Now since this is a survival game resource managemnet and strategy as which items to buy I defiantly felt the preassure to choose. Do I buy my soldier that new gun or get hazmat gear for the engi or get that new medkit for the medic. I absolutely loved that, but the fact that the medic and engi aren't really useful until you get those items then just felt like mindless mining drones. I also felt a bit lost when learning how to play even with the explanations placed I didn't see much of it in action and as a player I had to resort to a lot of trial and error.\n\nThe survirors themselves also had some issues pathing even when it was clear of closed doors and other characters when I gave them a command to move I often found them spinning in circles and dying as a result.\n\nAgain I know this is an Alpha and things are going to change but after playing it these are just a few things i noticed.

Its really fun . Totally worth it 99 cents in Early Access .\nThe story mode is not done yet but its gonna be intresting . You have something like a base/safe house .\nAnd you will be able to plan your attacks and survival strategies . Still not done.. but its gonna be cool .\n~~~----\nFor now this game has :\n* Not done story mode ( only tutorial and base/safe house )\n* Survival mode ( where you survive as long as you can )\n* Objective mode (its the same as the tutorial ( you survive long enough to get recources for one car and then youre gone)\n* Test Chamber mode - You test stuff . There is something like a science building and you can spawn differend enemies and you kill them . Its fun .\n~~~----\nSo.. yeah this was my Early access review for this game in 28.2.2016\nI hope i see you in the future game . Even Better game . I really balieve in you game .\nThere are boob easter eggs in this game","February 28","true","20.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","2"

I bought this game for 22 pence because it was cheap and looked different to what I've seen with survival games that included zombies, I played for a little bit, (By a little I mean about 60 seconds) and I did not enjoy it whatsoever. I could not understand the tutorial as I read it carefully, the way the tutorial teaches new players seems bland to say the least. Not understanding this game made me confused to why I bothered spending little money that I could refund. Also, about 40 seconds in, the building is being flooded with zombies, I don't see how someone who doesn't understand the gameplay could possibly fend off the attackers when they literally flood the building. Perhaps add a new mechanic to the game for brand new players (Checkbox or a setting) where the game is far more easier for the player and will slowing introduce each character, the roles, other mechanics and tips for the new player. As a developer myself, I would like to say that you did a great job on making a game, but It wasn't what I expected nor was it fun for me.\n\nI won't tell others to NOT buy it but if you're curious, buy the game yourself and have the experience. Feel free to agree or disagree with my statements! Keep up the good work guys!","November 21, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","8"

No. Definitely not.\n\nI mean, at just two dollars, you're kinda getting what you paid for, but this is barely a step above the generic flash game you could find on sites like Armor Games. The characters need a little more self reliance, and less standing still, rockem-sockem punching an infinite supply box while a zombie rockem-sockem 'bites' them and infects them. Don't even get me started on how annoying it is to have roughly ONE MINUTE to prepare yourself for the first wave of zombies. Living or dying at the start depends on your soldiers having been given guns, as opposed to their useless fists.\n\nWith more development, this could turn out to be a better game. Given the fact that this game is in Early Access, the current state of gameplay could just be placeholder content. As things are right now, though, it's not worth paying $2 to get frustrated at your characters needing to be hand-held through the basics of moving around a table.\n\nWith more improvements, this game could get pretty interesting.","November 26, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

Regardless its a fun little game right now(sept 2) and if they fix it crashing before I can even finish a round, I'd play it a lot more.\nI'm not sure how well the instructions work since I basically had to die 4 times to understand some pretty basic game mechanics but I also ignored the little screen it starts you with when you start a game. It doesn't really matter since if you give the game a chance most things will be easily found out.","September 2, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

There is no campaign built, yet, and the creators have just released a 2nd map. Options are extremely limited in regards to what you are able to do at this time. There is a list of bugs that need fixing... and with all that being said, I can not emphasize enough how great this game is. It really takes you back to the classics while allowing you to know that this is a modern game. The graphics are not a limitation, but rather are a huge plus to the creativity the developers are using. This game would be no where near as good as it is if it used stunning 3D art and visuals.

Lots of potential. However in it's current state, it's too tough.\n\nPros:\n\nThe Art style: It's great how it's pixels.\nVery tense: Personally it's really easy to feel worried when a huge horde comes knocking.\nGameplay: Making sure your surviviors are at the right place at the right time is extremely important.\n\n\nCons: Here's a bunch of tidbits on how this game can improve. Constructive criticism :)\n\nResource Gathering: Really, Really, REALLY slow. It makes Trove's servers look like The Flash. Obviously you need resources to do things like build guns, fire the guns, make the boards that will keep your imninent death out of reach and mend the wounds. So why does it take 10 months to grab enough metal for a gun? Building guns should be a secondaey option if you can't find guns. All this, however falls into my second problem..\n\nThe Crafting System: The Crafting System fits into this kind of game like butter and bread. But my problem is that the stuff you can build is too expensive. I want to be able to build RPGs for when the Mutated zombies lose their $h!t. Instead of that, I'm fighting with two pistols, a shotgun and a baseball bat against Fat zombies. And that's just not fun. Another problem is the lack of descriptions for each weapon/tool. No mouseover text telling you what it does, so I'm not sure what each attachment does.\n\nEngineers: Easily the least useful of the 3 classes available. There's also medics that I'm not too fond of either but I'll get to them in a bit. Engineers, according to the in game description "Can build traps and turrets. Also he can use melee weapons." In any of my games, I have not been able to build traps or turrets due to the high cost of the toolkits. The last part is false. They can't attack with melee weapons. I would love it if they could build custom weapons, heck, you could at least give a resource discount to building things with them so I can easily welcome them with open arms into the group.\n\nThe "random events": They don't do anything, so why are they in the latest build?\n\nMedics: Medics are cool, because they put bandages on cuts. My only problem is they don't have any form of self defense against the horde.\n\nFinally, the Difficulty spike: After the first 2 waves, no matter what, you will be in deep ♥♥♥♥. Because you don't have time to get the cool weapons, you are going to lose an arm and leg unless you use efficient but boring tactics. There's no timer telling you when the next wave arrives. then again, there's no point, because they arrive too quickly for you to grab anything but ammo.\n\nThis game is in Early Access, so hopefully these problems are sorted or at least aknowledged. This game looks great, it feels great, but iron out the problems and this game will be perfect. :)\n\nGood luck with your Early Access!","November 21, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

It has lot of potential to be one of my favourite indie games. Anyways, I don't recomend TO BUY since it's an early acces, and it is an early build too. The music fits correctly and the first mision I tryed was funny, not tense and a bit like a tutorial (ye I know it IS a tutorial but it could be a little more difficult). The controls feels weird but it's just my opinion. Good luck on the development of the game!","April 22","true","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

The leveling and customization is great but you really don't feel the impact in a single mission. Once your guys transfer between levels I'll be so happy! I love to build teams that cover each other's weaknesses effectively while still staying within the limitations of my resources and can't wait to tackle mission after mission with them. I will admit that since the engineer and medic don't start with items they feel really lack luster early on and you end up just maxing there looting so you can actually make some use of them and there kits. But once you get there stuff there awesome, however the medic needs to be kept close to your work bench so you can swap between the cure for bleeding and infection at a moment's notice. Melee is a very bad idea even with a maxed out medic as you need to max two stats in order to make it work and even then the medic must stay safe yet close. Prioritizing the types of loot as well as the locations is also fun. Some cashes are easy to get to and defend but run out quickly. Others leave you in places where you can get swarmed but you can get insane amounts of supplies from them over a long time. Over all this is looking to be an amazing little game that is fantastically fun for a very low price.","February 25","true","25.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

This game you should know that it is purposefully difficult (Like any zombie apocolypse game should be), unlike darksouls with all the difficult bosses (There are no bosses in this game as far as I believe).  Just know once your main form of defence is down, there is no going back, with this game not being ashamed to kill off your entire team in a matter of 30 seconds.  This game is frustrating at times, but once you get the hang of it, while upgrading your men, and figuring out a sence of strategy, this game gets easier but does not stay easy.\nThis game might not be that revolutionary compaired to big companies like Bethesda or Ubisoft with hundreds if not thousands of workers, but that does not make a small indie game like this bad, this is a fun little game.  All in all, I would recemmend this game to those who are interesting in a fun, stand alone, survival indie game.","February 27","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","8"

I hope this is not just alpha but its something like alpha alpha alpha of alpahs. Te repetitive music, the horrible horrible gameplay and mechanics. The way that people walk or move at all. The zombies voices and so on jeez this game has a long way to go to be able to be called a game ...\n\nUPTATED REVIEW :\nAfter you told me that you finished the game, i gave it a second shot. Because now i think i was too harsh on my first comment i will actually explain why i didnt change my thumbs down and what could be changed to make this game appealing for "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s" like me :)\n\n-Graphics : I acctually dont have anything to say about them, i am a fan of good graphics but i do not think that is it the component what makes a game "a good" game.\n\n-The map is too crowded : i can understand that you made the map so it would be hard to acctually defend and make the game a bit more challenging... i get it. My advice would be just make the mape "look" bigger , i mean make more space in the map but make the zombies and the survivors faster, it would make the game a lot easier on the eye. Why am i still on this topic ? because for people like me who uses high sensitivity for their mouse its a pain to play this game.\n\n-Voice acting: Because one is playing with only 3 survivors in the beggining it gets way too repetitive as voice acting goes, i can understand that. The one i cant understand its the zombies, i acctually stayed and listened for a while and they are repetitive too, you could of just recorded couple of them and changed their tone or even used distortion like voice effects to make it more.\n\n-The clicking: Maybe it is just because the map is too cramped and small but i just had the feeling i wasnt clicking where i wanted to everytime, when the mechanics is trying to build a turret is great one can see all the map, but when trying to move and flee for the zombies and even just clicking on the truck just to get components or meds its just gets frustating when i need to click 3 times on a truck when their is zombies chasing me. You could make it more click friendly just putting a black or white highlight not when one hovers on top of it but when he clicks.\n\nTheir are more little things to change but those i dont think are worth mentioning other then the list above.\n\nI hope you would like my comment and if their is anything else i can do please let me know. I will keep the thumbs down for now:) have a great day/night.","November 13, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","4"

Still seems very alpha-ish- to me. Gameplay is rather bland, literally... get ammo>get parts>repair car>stay alive. I don't like it honestly the UI isn't great music, is also not the greatest the sounds however, (when I say sounds, I mean things to make it seem eerie and creepy not like gun sfx.) are ♥♥♥♥ing great. Gets the creepy feeling of a horror game going, which imo thats a requirement for zombie games. Characters as far as I saw are bland as well, Soldier, Medic, and Engineer. I still don't recommend a game thats done according to a developer seeing as theres still problems in it. Which I didn't delve to deep into the story -or the game for that matter- so for all I know its one hell of a game. Though these are my opinions and I don't care to greatly for RTS games in the first place so those opinions might be blinded by that feeling of the genre.\n\nBefore I make a rant about a game I'll end it here. I give it a rating of 4/10. Could be much better but isn't good enough to cost money.","September 9, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","19"

I got it for 15 cents so I really don't care if it doesn't but some of the bigs I have been experiencing are annoying. First off, there is only "sandbox mode" which is over after you complete thew scenario (first room shown in pictures, you need 200 metal). Basically I just let my guys sit there and shoot zombies while one collected and the other barricaded a few doors. Mindless, but too mindless as to where it wasn't very fun. My hugest complaint is that I found it impossible to upgrade your characters? My characters leveled up obviously and both in the windowed and full screen displays I was unable to select upgrade, or whatever the other 2 options were. I tried to click on them, hit every button on my keyboard, and nothing. There is no 'options' menu or instruction guide so I am unsure if this is a bug or I am just plain dumb.\n\nIn conclusion, game was 15 cents, it's in early access, really doesn't matter if it is incomplete or buggy due to the extremely low cost.","September 5, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","6"

The developers are updating it and taking in feedback. The game is a "Tactical Top Down Shooter" where you have up to 4 people in your squad which consists of  engineers, medics and soldiers. As they have recently gotten the engineer it seems there will be more to come. As far as gameplay goes you control each member of your group to try to survive the infinate waves of zombies in a building. The Medic passively heals himself and others around him. The Soldier uses an assortment of weapons, including shotguns, machineguns and pistols. The engineer can build mines, turrets and use melee weapons. You can level up the characters once they have done enough scavenging / killing. The Zombies are so far 1 type and arent the smartest as AI goes, but I have lost a few times. All things considered this is a pretty good game for an early alpha indie game.

I recomend it souly for, it being fun and enjoyable once the bugs are worked out.\n\nIt has a good basis, and i like the different weapons so far in the game, and the three different classes. But, there are some bugs.\n\nThe Explosive shotgun, and RPG do way to much friendly fire inside, and the RPG takes to long to reload. I suggest investing in atleast one LMG, one shotty, and one good pistol. In story mode the medic seems preaty handy to have around but good luck trying to balance resources to make him worth beans in the sandbox. For ( sandbox ) invest instead in another security guy.\n\nThe looting part should have an increased tick when maxed out, to give sandbox more hope of actually surviving later rounds.\n\nBut, everyone should keep in mind. The game just started and in testing phase? I look forward to the updates and fixes.\n\nPlus, even if your G card exploaded, you can still play this without it!

I can see a lot of potential in this game, if the devs are guiding it in the right way. Here's what I got so far:\n\n+Controls are dodgy, you can't tell if the medics is healing the soldiers or not, the zombie is fairly tough for normal mode  (hopefully it'll stay that way)\n+The music is kinda "ehh" because I hardly listen to game music at all so it'll go down to reference for each person.\n+It's pretty limited so far, but I can see that the devs are working their *ss off so I have a lot of expectation in the future.\n\nThings that I would want to see or change in the future is :\n+Create a more realistic gun sound, add a variety of weapons and make the firing speed more realistics.\n+Polish the controls because I ít kinda confusing. Also it would be nice if I can control the character directly using W,A,S,D.\n+Make each character have an special ability.\n+If possible I would like to multiplayer in the future.\n\nCheers :)","July 8, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","3"

I've expected it to be very repetitive but to my utmost surprise - killing zombies never gets old. Specially here. Two strong downsides are lack of content and bugs often killing you before zombies will. But hey, its called "Early Access" for a reason - so I won't bash on you. Keep it up. The graphics are super cool and take me right back to '90s. The gameplay is simple and easy to understand yet fun.
