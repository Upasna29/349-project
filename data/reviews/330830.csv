But I firgured since this review was getting more views I might as well redo this whole thing. So here it goes:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTales of the Borderlands is a choice-driven adventure game (in Telltale's signature format) in which you play as either Rhys, a Hyperion employee with big dreams and Finoa, a local con-woman ready to make her biggest con yet, taking place after the events of Borderlands 2.\n\nIn the first episode Rhys's promotion and all chances of moving up in the company are ruined when a rival steps in and becomes his new boss. Rhys then comes up with a plan to get back at them by stealing the vault key, an alien aritfact capable of unlocking great wealth and power, which led to his rivals promotion from right under their nose. With the help of his two best friends, Vaughn and Yvette, he makes his way to possibly the most dangerous planet in the galaxy, Pandora. Meanwhile, Finoa in her home town of Hollow Point on Pandora is preparing for her greatest con yet. Helping her she has her sister Sasha and their mentor/foster father Felix. Events unfold and the two must work together to discover a treasure of epic proportions!\n\nPeople who have played any of Telltale's games will know what to expect in terms of gameplay. Small areas to navigate in which you look and interact with the enviroment with simple puzzles along with lots of cutscenes with many quick time events.\n\nNeedless to say, the game's main focus is on it's storytelling which it does very well. People who have not had the pleasure of playing any of the first two Borderlands games might get lost in terms of the lore (as well as a few jokes) but it is not needed as the game does a good job on focusing more on the central premise of the story. People who are familar with the Borderlands games will enjoying getting to see Pandora from a whole different view point (rather than just running around shooting everything). There are plenty of humour to be found in the writing even if you are not a fan and action cutscenes that are throughly entertaining!\n\nSo in summary: If you are fan of Telltale's adventure games then this is basically the same thing you are used only in a lighter setting and I highly recommend.","March 19, 2015","true","19.2"," 1,288 of 1,449 people (89%) found this review helpful 1,282 people found this review funny","89","288","1","282","21"

But if you enjoy one or both of those, you should love this game. It still keeps in a lot of Borderlands elements (inventory, loot, humor, etc.), while still playing like the familiar Telltale point-and-click adventure.\n\nThe first episode offers a lot (about 2 1/2 hours if you look around), and you're immediately latched to the characters. You know about everyone's motives about the second they show up, and know if you like them or not. The writing is still Borderlands-style, so you may get more for your mileage if you're familiar with the series, but it's very well done. It's not full of boner jokes (yet), but there's still the silly stuff in there. The game relies a bit more on the inventory like Sam & Max than Walking Dead (still no combining items again, though) ie. Fiona's character uses cash that can directly influence conversation, whereas Rhys's lets him scan things to let you learn more about the world, and sometimes find items. Which works well from being based on a game centered on loot.\n\nAll-in-all -- it's humorous, well-writ, suspenseful, and most of all - good. If you're hesitant in any way, you could pick up on a sale, but as a fan of Telltale and Borderlands it was worth every dollar. And I'm sure even non-fans would enjoy the ride this game gives you.","November 25, 2014","true","13.6"," 467 of 508 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","467","508","11","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praxis666/recommended/330830/","praxis666","Praxis-[CE]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praxis666/","1529 products in account","I suppose that to the completely uninitiated, Tales from the Borderlands plays out like an action-comedy caper film set in unfamiliar surroundings, but to those who already love the Borderlands games, it feels a bit like coming home. I really love the way Telltale designed the opening sequence, menu screens, and opening credits in the style of the Borderlands games, so from the very start this is exactly how the game feels.\n\nThe artwork from the Borderlands series is a great fit for the Telltale format, and allows the setting to blend seamlessly into the graphic novel-style artwork Telltale uses to render its stories. The music of Borderlands is pretty distinctive too, and the team did a fantastic job of incorporating that into the story as well (in the case of the episode one boss, quite literally).\n\nThe story is very fast paced, with a lot of twists and turns and flashbacks. With two protagonists — a Hyperion corporate lackey and a Pandoran thief — you also quite literally get parts of the same story playing out a little differently from two perspectives. Narratively, it reminds me a bit of Pulp Fiction with the perspective jumps, as well as the rapid-fire pacing and snappy dialogue.\n\nThe action sequences are amazing (if not completely plausible) and really keep you engaged with the story. The dialogue is hilarious, and it was fun picking some of the wittier options and seeing how the scene played out. The voice acting is great too, though I did find it extremely odd at times to have conversations with some of Pandora's bandits and psychos.\n\nIf you're the impatient type, you might want to wait until all the episodes come out before buying the season, as it looks like they're going to be spaced a few months apart. I plan to update my review as the episodes are released, but so far I really love the story and the characters. I can't wait to see "cameo" appearances by some of the other vault hunters and NPCs from the Borderlands games, and I also can't wait to see what happens with the new characters Tales From the Borderlands has introduced.","March 8, 2015","true","3.3"," 246 of 257 people (96%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","96","246","257","13","4"

What else can you ask from a movie that likes to pretend to be a game? TellTale hits the jackpot by continuing to dominate in their very own created genre. I haven't played the original Borderland games, but luckily you won't miss out if you haven't been to Pandora before. Just one suggestion from me, wait for all chapters to come out, then play it (otherwise by the time the next chapter comes out, you'll forget some minor details about the plot and you will miss out on story development).\nAnd when you play it, play the whole game in one go. Don't restart the chapters one by one to see how the story will go if you choose differently - you will be disappointed! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=433465399 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=615069238 Unlocked all achievements!","July 7, 2015","true","10.8"," 113 of 120 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","113","120","3","3"

As magnificent as the series was leading up to its conclusion, the finale was even better. Going to have to put this game up there in my top 10 all time. I wont ruin it for you though, so I will stop here. Just make sure you play this game!\n\n*previous review notes*\n\nThis is far and away the single best Telltale game out there IMO. Episode 5 hasnt released yet, but unless the final episode is a colossal failure, this game will go down as the benchmark for episodic adventures.\n\nFirst off, the graphics in this game are the best TT has put out there. Now, this is probably thanks in large part to the cel shading which is the Borderlands calling card, but regardless, this game looks great.\n\nThe voice acting is also peerless. Troy Baker, Nolan North, Patrick Warburton, and Chris Hardwick are only some of the phenomenal actors enlisted for this game. Mixed with the super witty and hilarious dialogue, and you once again have the benchmark for which all other games might take note and pursue.\n\nThe story....also superb. It is absolutely faithful to the Borderlands setting and lore, and yet stands on its own immaculately. Completely engaging, draws you in, and never lets go.\n\nThe gameplay is even improved from previous TT efforts despite them sticking with their proprietary engine. Fairly well seamless also. The QTE's make sense and while integral, they don't require super fast reflexes on your part either, and in fact, some are designed to fail (which is actually pretty funny and awesome IMO).\n\nAll in all, this is an easy 10 skrags run over by Marcus's bus out of 10 possible. Maybe even 11, since we regularly bend the laws of physics in this game anyway.","October 5, 2015","true","17.9"," 61 of 64 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","61","64","6","4"

There are a lot of references to the two games, and they pretty much rest on the fact that you have played the two other games.

I garuantee something will make you laugh.\n\nOntop of that, telltale manages to go the extra mile to capture every little bit of borderlands. From the weapon selection menu thingies when they turn up in game, to the main menu and even the auto save icon. It all fluids perfectly and is amazing.\n\nI reccomend this from the bottom of my heart.\n\n\nEDIT For EPISODE 2: Episode 2 was a veerrrry long wait, but it was worth it. It's main focus seems to be character development. Vaughn will probably become a more likeable character for people who disliked him in the first episode, while your opinion on other characters may change. Including Jack who, for the most part seems very hard to judge in this game.

For the first time, the world of Borderlands is being used purely to tell a story, and damn me if it's not a good one. Telltale has taken all the style and humor you've come to expect from Borderlands and it's sequels, and melded it perfectly into an interactive story experience. The setting feels like a living world, the narrative is compelling, and the two playable characters are both likable and sympathizable.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's what you'd expect from a Telltale game. The majority of the game is dialogue-based, with some quick time event action sequences here and there. As with most Telltale games, the meat of the game is in it's storytelling.\n\nThe first episode follows the misfortunes that unfold around Rhys as he and his friends attempt to secure a deal to get a vault key from some pandoran locals, stealing the deal from right under the nose of their new boss (and long-time rival), Vasquez. To say any more or to explain how the other Protagonist is involved in this episode would spoil some major plot points that you really should just experience yourself.\n\nMy only real complaint with this title is that the release schedule for the episodes seems to be sorely lacking behind that of other Telltale episodic series; where The Walking Dead consistently released a new episode roughly each month (give or take a week or two), Tales has yet to even see so much as a teaser of a second episode being released after more than two months since the games launch. Episode 2 can out and it's fantastic.\n\nEpisode 2 review: It was bro-tier.\n\nEpisode 3 review: Rhys x Sasha? I ship it.\n\nEpisode 4 review: Too spoilerific to say much. CATCH A RIDE.\n\nEpisode 5 review: "You and 93.3% of players ship Sasha and Rhys"\n\nIf you're interests include science fiction, double-crossing, corporate backstabbing, borderlands, or point-and-click games, I highly reccomend picking up this title.

Much of the game feels like it is a rollercoaster ride, with the polish of a Hollywood blockbuster. It is evident from these sequences that Telltale have come a long way in creating ever more complex scenes to immerse the player.\n\nTftB is a tale of two. Uniquely, the narrative has introduced two protagonists, Rhys (the ‘company man’ but deep down good guy) & Fiona (the seasoned hustler/con artist). As you progress through the story, you frequently get to replay the same ‘scene’ from each of their perspectives. This is creatively woven together with an over-arching storyline & flashbacks. Although it does jump around quite a bit it remained easy to keep track due to the well-crafted story & dialog. I think it was a bold move from a story-telling perspective but this spin works surprisingly well.\n\nThe chemistry between Rhys & Fiona makes for some great verbal jousting, often bickering like an old married couple arguing semantics with some witty banter. The jokes come thick & fast between all the characters interactions, many of which had me laughing so hard! The bro-tastic scene was terrific & some of the other embellishment ‘dream’ scenes were hilarious! It’s not only in the dialog that holds comedic value, but also in the physical comedy that ensues throughout, from the clever facial expressions to the crazy antics in the all-out action scenes.\n\nAll of the characters introduced through the episodes were memorable, great personalities & well voice acted. Hugo Vasquez was one of my favs, voiced by Patrick Warburton, (can’t help but seeing Vasquez as Joe Swanson's evil twin!) along with the ever-so-adorable Gortys; it’s certainly not hard to become fond of the characters you encounter.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545959976 I found myself with many ‘WOW’ moments like you see above, that just were begging for a screenshot to be taken! The world is saturated with colour & rich in detail, with many scenes (& camera angles) used providing something interesting or hidden to discover (if you look closely). I expect there is more Easter Eggs I didn’t even notice not being a player of the original Borderlands series. Rhys has cyborg implants to add another layer to what you can see in the world, which also introduces a number of other gameplay elements that I won’t spoil for you. :)\n\nMy leisurely play though took around 10 hours for the 5 episodes with no real technical issues to report. I did see a couple of minor texture popping issues & the odd clipping issues but neither lasted long enough to detracted from the experience.\n\nOnly two really minor improvement suggestions I have is that TftB, unlike many games, does not pause the game when wireless controller loses connection or has dead batteries. With timing a big factor by design it would be nice if it was better supported for those that do not have a keyboard handy (Hail, to all the Couch Commanders!) to pause automatically so none of those precious seconds are lost.\n\nSecondly, there are scenes using a new, more ‘fighting style-esque’ multi direction responses. The response time of the game was slow when having to hit multiple directions or buttons, often resulting in having to hit them several times before they register.\n\nI did really enjoy the more complex fighting/action sequences overall; it felt at times like a 21st century version of a Dragon’s Lair or Space Ace game! Just wish it was harder! After seeing what was accomplished in the action scenes here, I would love to see a pure action game from Telltale in the future with a stronger focus on timing & precision.\n\nMy minor gripes aside, there is really is nothing to fault in this excellent action adventure game (So very glad I didn’t have to wait between episodes to complete this time). I enjoyed this one so much I played through the last 4 chapters in the same day.\n\nI didn’t want the rollercoaster to stop!\n\nI laughed, I had fun .. I had a blast!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","November 2, 2015","true","11.0"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","39","42","5","2"

Not only did the plot sit nicely as a side-story/sequel to the franchise plot, the two main protagonists - Rhys and Fiona, allowed player to explore unique perspectives from the "evil" Hyperion corporation and as a Pandora native.\n\nThe game itself is humorous, filled with crazy moment that meld seemlessly into the crazy backdrop of Borderlands. The meeting of Rhys and Fiona for instance, which was re-told as recollections from Rhys and then Fiona perspectives, allow players to unfold the truth of the tale in a entertaining fashion, like how Pulp Fiction unfolded the the somewhat puzzling opening scene with Ringo and Yolanda, with the scene Jules (and bathroom-bound Vincent) in their "transition" period at the end of the movie.\n\nThe confrontation scenes across all three epidsodes (thus far) were largely whimsical, befitting of protagonists. Yet, they are always filled with comedic moments or funny narratives that make these confrontation feel more like action sequence in a comedic movie. The final confrontation in episode 3 for instance featured some of the best moments - such as Fiona fending off two bounty hunters while hanging upside down and Rhys travelling at high speed on his legless loader bot, which felt like watching Charlie Chaplin or Indiana Jones in action.\n\nEntertainment aside, Tales from the Borderlands highlighted the innate problem with Telltale games. There isn't much gameplay to speak of, other than quick-time action. Most choices and exploration are pretty close to pointless, like how your choices and exploration wouldn't matter in any linear games (e.g. Final Fantasy, Left for Dead, etc.) other than to uncover easter eggs (alternative dialogue, narratives, skins etc.). Consequently, the game felt really short and unsatisfying, making the interval between episodic release more painful than usual. It's a blessing however, knowing that I could clear all three episodes in five fun-filled hours again before episode 4. Can't wait...\n\nFor lovers of Borderlands, don't be despair with the absence of CL4P-TP. Tales is littered with other familiars like the vault hunters (Zer0, Brick, Mordecai and Athena) and NPCs (Scooter and Handsome Jack), not merely as fan-service, but were involved in pushing the story forward.\n\nBottomline: Tales from the Borderlands is an excellent piece of work thus far (after three episodes), that should bring out a chuckle or two.","June 27, 2015","true","9.9"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","37","39","0","2"

I absolutely love everything about the game from the top notch voice talent (newcomers Troy Baker, Nolan North, and Laura Bailey may just have great things ahead of them if they ever get discovered) to fantastic musical choices (no, it's not dubstep).\n\nThe story starts fairly simple. A jerky company man named Rhys (you) and con woman Fiona (also you) work together and against each other for the prize of 10 million dollars. Obviously, it's not quite as simple as that, but all the twists and turns are the meat of the game and I won't spoil anything further. The writing is excellent and unlike Telltale's other three major franchises (Walking Dead, Fables, and Game of Thrones) it's heavy on humor despite being firmly targeted towards a mature audience.\n\nI honestly can't recommend this one enough. Even people who dislike Borderlands may enjoy it because the setting of Pandora is so interesting even when removed from the shoot and loot mechanics of the franchise.","December 5, 2014","true","12.7"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","38","43","0","6"

This is a Borderlands story given the Telltale treatment. Great writing and voice acting helps tell the story of some non vault hunters on Pandora.

The only thing the game has is the same Telltale "remember your decision" system from previous games but I'm not expecting grand changes to the plot.\n\nI liked the story which is why I'm giving it a thumbs up, but this is a game where you're more of a passive observer as opposed to taking charge and making things happen and for hardcore fans of Borderlands, they may not like the huge departure from the series' norm.","December 20, 2014","true","2.4"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","40","48","0","2"

The complete season is already available since the last episode was released a month ago. As the name implies, the events of this game occur in the universe of the Borderlands series, being chronological situated after Borderlands 2 events. In it you take control of not one, but two highly charismatic characters - Rhys and Fiona - embarking in an adventure filled with humor, living up to this acclaimed series.\n\nThis game uses the same winning formula of the last games released by Telltale. As such, this is a game focused on the story, so there is not much to discuss gameplay-wise. The game mechanics are very identical to the rest of Telltale games, with several dialogue choices that influence the story. At first it will seem that the different choices will all have the same outcome, but at the end they will actually have a special meaning, something that I liked a lot. Quick-Time Events (QTEs) are once more present, working like a charm in the action sections, but it still feels like its little in terms of gameplay. Its also important to refer the addiction of two pretty interesting new mechanics. The first one is Fiona being able to loot money. With that money you can buy many customization items, as in the other games of this series. Playing as Rhys, you have a Cybernetic Eye which allows you to analyze several objects, providing lots of laughs since those objects have delicious descriptions. Obviously this is an extremely linear game, but it has some exploration sections once in a while, being extremely limited though.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=543022481\nIn the games made by Telltale, the story its the most important aspect to me and in this game they really nailed it. When I first heard about this game I though it would be a simple cash-in using the name of the Borderlands series. However, it ended being a really good surprise. The characters are excellent and the chemistry between some of them almost achieves perfection. Besides the characters made by Telltale, there are some familiar faces from the previous games who fit like a charm in the story, like Zer0, Brick and Mordecai for example. The comedy in this game is another of its strong points. Few games will give you as many laughs as this one. Most of the dialogs are very well done and overall the story is very good, with some great twists and a pretty good ending too. Although focusing on comedy, the game has its share of dramatic sequences too, with an exceptional balance between comedy and drama.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539736177\nIn terms of visuals, this game has the distinctive cel-shading of the Borderlands series, which does the job like a charm in this game. The majority of the animations look good but some of the characters body movements still leave much to desire. The performance is also great since the graphical resources of this game are not "heavy" at all, so you will not have problems running this game.\n\nLongevity wise, it is pretty good for a game like this. I took about 9 hours to complete, while being completety stuck to the screen every time I played because of how good this game is (lots of moments of pure action).\n\nIn the sound department, another win. The soundtrack is amazing! It complements this universe in a perfect way. Something that I liked a lot were the opening credits of each episode, all with different songs in it, being all absolutely awesome! The voice acting is also out of this world. An impressive cast that has great names like Troy Baker (Rhys), Laura Bailey (Fiona), Nolan North (August) and Ashley Johnson (Gortys). Patrick Warburton, best known for giving voice to Joe Swanson in the Tv Show "Family Guy" is also present in the game, giving voice to the character Hugo Vasquez.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=541188831\nSummary\nPros:\nF***ing hilarious!\nMany scenes of pure action and adrenaline\nCharacters who you care for\nExcellent use of the Borderlands universe\nSpectacular job in the sound departmentCons:\nOnce more, QTEs dominate the gameplay\nSome animations are a bit datedMy personal score: 9.0/10\n\nFew games are funnier than this one! With frenetic action, awesome characters, exceptional soundtrack and voice acting and a great story, this game puts the standard for comedy games in a very high level. A must-have for those who want to laugh like a crazy man and recommended not only for those who played a game from the Borderlands series, as for those who never played.\n\n----------------------------\nAnálise em Português no site eyeoctane.org / Portuguese Review in eyeoctane.org :\nhttp://www.eyeoctane.org/analise-tales-from-the-borderlands/","December 4, 2015","true","9.2"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","32","36","7","0"

To hear another story of immense fortune and unthinkable peril? Wellllll... I have some time. The Borderlands of Pandora were told to contain mysterious alien treasure troves filled with advanced technology and incredible power. Vaults, the people called them... and to seek one out was to earn you the title of Vault Hunter... at least by me. You could say Handsome Jack was one such explorer, though his methods could be seen as... somewhat unsporting. He ran the corporation Hyperion... and died trying to claim Pandora as his own. History's attention is fickle, my friends. It will remember those pirates like Handsome Jack but forget the adventurers who risk it all for less... ah, obvious rewards. Stories - legends - those are much better at getting at the real spirit of things. Stories remember both sides of the tale.'   Marcos the opening of Tales from the borderlands\n\nWho can forget the first they played Borderlands, a desolate, post apocalyptic landscape filled with uniquely interesting characters, humorous dialog, and more loot than you could shake a stick at.  I remember going on my first mission.  Stepping off the bus driven by our favorite arms dealer Marcus Kincaid, running into CL4P-TP better known as Claptrap and a few minutes later we're knee deep in bullets, psycho's wanting to use us as a meat bicycle, and a budding adventure.  Who would have guessed our first amazing adventure through Pandora would spawn a sequel and a prequel even an MMO.. (short lived and restricted to Russia but a Borderlands game none the less)  Any Borderlands fan is foaming at the mouth just waiting to soak up more Borderlands content, come on gearbox why must you make us suffer... well to ease our pain slightly Gearbox partnered up with Telltale games to create a masterpiece in story telling.  The combined effort of Telltales amazing story telling and easy game-play, fused with Gearbox's hilarious one liners, make for a gamers dream come true known as Tales from the Borderlands..\n\nThe Gameplay\nMy review will contain some spoilers for Borderlands 2 and the Prequel, just be forewarned!!!!!\n\nI'm serious, don't keep reading if you don't want those games ruined for you!!!!!\n\nLast chance!!!!  CATCH-A-RIDDDDDDDDDDDDEEEEEE\n\nThe Story\nTales from the borderlands picks up after the events of Borderlands 2, Handsome Jack is dead, and Hyperion is going through some changes.  You start the game as Rhy's,  a Hyperion middle manager, on his way towards getting a well earned and deserved promotion.  Together with his friend Vaughn the pair jovially joke about what Rhy's will do now that Rhy's will be in a position of power..  Upon reaching the bosses office and heading inside, a strange and disappointing thing happens..  The boss is dead, and a man known as Vasquez has been promoted...   BAD NEWS, since Vasquez is not a fan of Rhy's, in fact the two can't stand each other, it's not long before Vasquez informs Rhy's that his promotion will still happen, but it's not what he expected... Instead Rhy's is "promoted" ahem "demoted" to vice janitor..   After Vasquez informs Rhy's of this terrible news Vasquez receives a call which will change everyone's lives forever.  A vault key (Borderland fans will know just how valuable and important vault keys are... if you aren't a fan of borderlands, just know it's pretty friggin important..)  is being offered for 10 million dollars, hearing this information Rhy's knows what he needs to do almost immediately and sets out on his adventure to steal the vault key, undermine Vasquez and gain the power he knows he rightfully deserves..   Although for any of that to work Rhy's needs to enlist the help of his two best friends, Vaughn and Yvette.  The grand adventure is about to begin.\n\nGameplay\nTales offers you the chance to play two different stories, Rhy's the above mentioned Hyperion stooge, and Fiona the con-women, the game will fluctuate between these two perspectives fairly often and sometimes while the both of them are on screen at the same time, paying attention to the dialogue choices is very important as occasionally you'll be playing one of the characters but have to choose what the other will say.  The Telltale experience has remained fairly similar across every game they've released since The Walking Dead, Tales is no different, a point and click interface interlaced with the ability to move your character around, interact with various objects and talk with teammates.  If you've played one Telltale game you've played them all, the one aspect which sets them apart are the stories, of which Tales tells a very compelling story.   The puzzles aren't very difficult, and most of the action takes place in the form of quick time events.  Typical fair for Telltale games.\n\nPro's\nGearbox humor\nFamiliar characters\nFamiliar settings\nBest Telltale story since The Walking Dead season 1\nFairly lengthy episodes, compared to recent TellTale releases\n\nCon's\nVarious issues with saving choices which are present in every Telltale game\nIssues with button registration on QTE events..\n\n\nRecommendation\nIn order to enjoy Tales from the Borderlands, a person doesn't need to have played any of the Borderlands games to enjoy the content, but with that said, if you've never played any of the games you'll totally miss a ton of the inside jokes and many of the best moments may be lost because you simply don't have the backstory necessary to full grasp what's going on.  As for whether or not I'd recommend the game, I'll say that I highly recommend Tales.  For fans of Borderlands it's a must have, amazing story driven game play,  a continuation of the Borderlands storyline.  The game is officially licensed by Gearbox so it's canon and moves alone the story, setting the gamer up for the third game which should come soon.\n\nSo you're not a fan of Borderlands the games, then I'd ask if you enjoy Telltale games, even without having played any of the original games, you can still enjoy the game, it's Telltale at it's finest, great robust story, amazing voice acting, and graphics which are awesome.. Lets not forget the music, as TellTale games always manages to fit three or four amazing songs in each season of their game.  So if you like Telltale games, you'll love this one.. You should pick it up now without fail, the sooner you get it, the sooner you'll be able to hop back on Pandora and kick some bandit butt...","April 16","true","14.3"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","1"

Great sense of humour. A few really exciting scenes, but a couple of annoying quicktime events (Like every episodic game).\n\nEpisode 2: A few new characters are introduced, including Handsome Jack from Borderlands 2. He turns out to be one of the funnier parts of this episode and also one of the more important choices you have to make involves him. Overall, not quite as good as Ep.1, but still very good and funny.\n\nEpisode 3: The best episode yet. By far the most action and most character development out of any episode. You begin to see certain relationships take turns you'd never thought of at first and probably the best character in the whole game "Gortys" is introduced. It ends at quite an intense spot and I can't wait to see where it goes next.\n\n\nEpisode 4: Probably the funniest episode in the entire game so far. A lot more of Gortys which is a good thing, and a crazy cliffhanger. Not quite as good as Episode 3, but still really good and probably my second favourite.\n\n\nUPDATE:\nEpisode 5: The final episode in this series has just decided it... Tales From The Borderlands is my favourite game of 2015 which is impressive considering how much i love Fallout. I never expected for such a funny game, that I would become so attached to these characters and I really am sad that it's over.

While I enjoyed Borderlands 2 quite a bit, I was never a huge fan of the Borderlands universe, as it just didn’t appeal to me. But they’re Telltale and they’ve yet to make a game that I considered bad. So I forged on, loading up the first episode of Tales From the Borderlands, hoping it would get me to like the universe a bit more.\n\nI don’t think I ever expected that it would quite as much as it did. Telltale really took the series and made it their own, with new characters, new drama, and new locales, all while still using the same universe and basic characters like the psychos. Don’t get me wrong, it is unmistakably Borderlands. I just think that it’s a bit more likable of a take on Borderlands, is all.\n\nSo what’s it all about, then? It’s the story of a Hyperion employee, destined for a promotion, when all of the sudden his boss is thrown out of an airlock and his nemesis takes over, screwing him over and demoting him instead. After overhearing a deal his new boss has planned, your character, Rhys, decides that he’s going to screw his boss over and get to his deal first. It’s also about a woman, raised as a con artist, who’s trying to pull off the biggest con she’s ever pulled. Both of them, really, and how their stories get intertwined. And how they both get caught by bandits and are forced to tell their story to the bandit that caught them.\n\nIt is quite a story, too. True to Telltale’s previous works, the game draws you in from the beginning with an enticing story and then proceeds to play its strengths throughout the rest of the episode. In Tales From the Borderlands‘ case, this is primarily the humor. If you even slightly enjoy the humor of Borderlands, this game will have quite a few laugh out loud moments. It doesn’t miss a beat, or a chance to crack a joke, and I actually found it to be significantly better than the average Borderlands humor.\n\nIt is a Telltale game, though. One of the more modern ones, complete with quick-time events and all. You won’t be escaping them just because it’s based on a first-person shooter franchise. The game is a bit more complex than some other Telltale games, providing different points where you have to manage money or use Rhys’ cybernetic eye to scan different things but it mostly comes down to derivatives of the same core gameplay. They’re nice touches, don’t get me wrong – and they do make the game feel all its own in some ways – but, if you aren’t a fan of the core Telltale gameplay, you won’t become a fan of it by playing this.\n\nFans of Telltale’s games will probably find themselves right at home. That is to say, playing Borderlands does not seem to be a pre-requisite as of yet, the story being self-contained in a time period sometime Borderlands 2. While characters are referenced, primarily bad guys, and different iconic characters, like the Vault Hunters and psychos, may be unfamiliar to you, you aren’t particularly missing out on anything by jumping in right here. The game gives an ample enough introduction for new players and the only character that actually seems to be recurring so far introduces himself well enough just by being himself. That and people talk about him.\n\nThe game also has no shortage of difficult choices. While I only played through once, convinced that there isn’t much point in replaying with different choices until after more of the season is available, they made great efforts to tempt you at every turn. Money or loyalty? Honor or pride? I can only imagine that these choices will get harder as the game progresses, trying to tempt you ever further towards the selfish “dark side.” I hope, at least. Having not replayed because not enough of the series is available yet, it’s a bit hard to tell at this point how much these choices will affect the primary storyline.\n\nIt may be a bit hard for some to get used to the flow of the story, though. There are two characters that you play as. Rhys, the janitor that got screwed over, and Fiona, the con artist, are who you are given to play as. As most of the game is flashbacks, you will constantly be pulled back to present time, switch the character you’re playing as, rinse, and repeat. The game makes a point of making sure you’re aware of when this happens – and when it engages in hilarious indulging the story – but it can be a bit hard to keep up, especially when you start switching characters mid-flashback. I found myself wondering what happened to characters a few times, only to have them just sort of “show up” a while later, seemingly unscathed. Sure, I now know what happened to them. But it would have been nice to have seen that, rather than switch characters while they were in peril.\n\nThe cast is rather great, though. Voiced over by talent like Troy Baker, Laura Bailey, and Patrick Warburton, Telltale has made great efforts to make sure that each of the characters is convincing. They are also a diverse cast of characters that really show the difference between life on Helios versus life on Pandora. And they stick to their ways of life, regardless of what may come. Sure, you can make choices but they are all based on what that character would choose to do. Nothing as of yet seems all that far out of place.\n\nI find that Telltale is really good at opening and closing seasons. Sometimes, the in-between can start to feel a bit like filler but we’ve yet to get to that point. As of right now, the game is a quality addition to Telltale’s lineup and I am quite surprised to have enjoyed the season’s pilot as much as I did. Not only that but, in clocking in at over two hours, the opening episode has made a name for itself as one of the longest single episodes of a Telltale game I’ve played in quite some time. I truly hope they continue with that.","November 27, 2014","true","2.1"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","0"

Another great installment from the developer we know and love Telltale Games. But don't let the title fool you. This is not your regular Borderlands game; It just have the title, humor, and the backstory of the franchise. It's a brand new game with a completely different genre and story taking place in a completely different universe story-wise. A game by Telltale Games is a point-and-click adventure game designed to be enjoyed with a enthralling single player story and character development. A dialogue driven story where your choices have enormous consequences. One thing I can assure you is that Gearbox has no influence over Telltale Games and make games in such different ways that it's not even humanly possible to try to compare the two. In my personal opinion, I suspect that Telltale Games will do something brilliant with the title that Gearbox has not yet succeeded and thus far with Zer0 Sum the odds are really good. They can take any title and story and turn it into a game with extremely satisfying results. I didn't buy this game because it is titled Borderlands - I got it because it is labeled Telltale Games. So should you buy Tales from the Borderlands? Borderlands fan or not I guarantee you it will be worth every penny. I've never been much for Borderlands and never really had the time to play the predecessors, but I had the time of my life the two hours the first episode lasted. It is a standalone experience from Borderlands as we know it.","November 25, 2014","true","38.9"," 43 of 58 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","43","58","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/330830/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","It’s probably fair to say that not a lot folks expected a whole lot out of Tales from the Borderlands. A spin-off of the horrendously successful series from which it partially borrows its name, Telltale has not only crafted an episodic adventure that does justice to its parent franchise but has also fashioned an effort that is on par with its developer’s Walking Dead adaptation. A big reason why Telltale has struck gold so thoroughly with Tales from the Borderlands is because for the first time in a long while the Californian developer has had a chance to properly exercise its comedy glands, making Tales one of the funniest and most downright entertaining adventure titles on the market.\n\nA big reason why the comedy works so well in Tales is because the cast of characters are both extremely well written and performed by their respective voice actors. Troy Baker gives a brilliant performance as Hyperion company man turned cheeky mercenary Rhys, while Laura Bailey excels as wannabe Vault Hunter Fiona and the two of them together create this kind of buddy movie dynamic where they go from helping each other out of tight spots to sniping and making sarcastic remarks at one another.\n\nWhile frequently rib-detatchingly hilarious, Telltale expertly balances the relentless gags and comedy with a smattering of tender and somber moments too. As well as showcasing the impressive range of the voice cast, these touching and personal scenes also show an episodic series which is as tonally dynamic as the cast of characters which inhabit its virtual stage. So, if you were expecting laughs and nothing else, you might want to consider bringing some tissues too just in case.\n\nIn terms of plot, the episodic series focuses on Rhys and Fiona, throwing them together on the heist of a lifetime to obtain an extremely hard-to-get Vault Key and the masses of riches that lay beyond. It’s a story strewn with crosses, double-crosses, angry robots, killers, psychos, faces from the past and all the other assorted insanity that the Borderlands universe has conditioned us to expect.\n\nOf course this being a game which is based on the Borderlands franchise, many of the notable characters from the shooter series frequently cross over into Tales, with the likes of Scooter, Janie, Athena, Brick, Mordecai and a whole heap more besides all serving to flesh out the events and narrative of the series. Nevertheless, while it is definitely a thrill to see favourite characters from the core series cross into Tales, it remains a credit to Telltale’s writing team that the best work is actually achieved with its unique creations Rhys, Fiona and a small handful of others that really brings them up to the same standard as the other pre-established personalities.\n\nThe writing team are simply tremendous; cleverly bookending mysteries from the beginning to the end and setting up some truly unexpected twists and turns in the narrative. Another thing that Telltale has built upon with Tales from the Borderlands is its decision making system, or more specifically, the effect that those decisions have in the long-term. Without giving away a Pandora-sized spoiler, let me just say that the sum of all your decisions is keenly and strongly felt in the final episode's last act in such a way that no other Telltale game has managed to date.\n\nIn terms of how Tales actually plays, the episodic series follows the same remit as previous Telltale efforts in so far as there’s nothing to really tease the brain but plenty of QTE-powered action scenes and dialogue exist to push the story forward. In actual fact, it’s no exaggeration to say the action scenes are some of the best in any Telltale effort to date. From the brilliantly conceived destruction derby death bowl which closes out the first episode to the laser fingers gun fight in the penultimate episode, Tales from the Borderlands arguably boasts the best use of the QTE in recent memory.\n\nIf any real criticism can be levelled against Tales from the Borderlands it could perhaps be directed towards the use of Telltale’s aging game engine. While the engine does a reliably fine job of keeping Tales stylistically in line with the core entries in the Borderlands series, it still suffers from all the usual technical hiccups, such as random frame-rate drops and jerky loading screens, which will sadly prove familiar to players of previous Telltale Games outings.\n\nOne of the coolest moments in the game is being able to use Rhys’ cyber-eye to locate important objects, leading to some amusing descriptions of whatever it is you decided to scan in the nearby area. The devs deserve a pat on the back for adding such elements and staying true to the Borderlands spirit. Also, like in most Telltale games you really can be anything from a straight-up goody-goody, to someone totally neutral and indifferent or indeed a complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nGraphically, Tales from the Borderlands merges the cell shading expected of a Borderlands game with the style of Telltale that we have come to expect. There are even elements of the Borderlands games I did not think would be seen in an adventure game like elemental weapons, cash boxes and changing of skins, some of which felt a little shoe horned in but were a welcome reminder that this was actually a Borderlands game.\n\nDespite the fact that Tales from the Borderlands strays from the series usual shooting stomping grounds, it still manages to effortlessly hit the mark and elevate the core franchise in a fashion that few, if any, spin-offs have ever managed to achieve. With Tales from the Borderlands, Telltale Games has struck gold. Easily its best effort since Wolf Among US, Tales marries the series cheeky humour and laugh-out laughs with some properly touching and poignant moments. This is as essential as it gets.","April 24","true","59.0"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","24","26","3","0"

You will of course lose all of your progress up to that point, though.\n\nIf you haven't played this type of game before, it's kind of like an interactive movie... and yet the moments where you're making your choices aren't jarring or disruptive to the flow of the game/story.  Choices are timed, which adds an urgency to the gameplay and keeps things (even more) interesting, but if you don't like anything timed, no worries -- You can pause the game by hitting the space bar.  Well, that will help with the timed choices, but there are a few action sequences that you'll have to deal with.  Nothing game-stopping for those without good reflexes, though I did have to re-do several scenes.\n\nNow that we've got the boring stuff out of the way, let me preface this review by saying that I only recently obtained the original Borderlands games -- I have not played them yet, so I am not familiar with the Borderlands lore.  This game apparently takes place after the events of Borderlands 2.\n\nTo be honest I wasn't sure that I was going to like the game when I first started playing, as I wasn't sure that I liked the characters or the story line.  By the beginning of chapter 2, though, I was completely sucked in.  There was a moment during the opening credits of episode 2 (of all things!) that had me almost literally shouting, "Oh my god, this is so frickin' AWESOME!"  I DID literally do a fist-pump.  *laughs*\n\nFor those who have played the game, my favorite characters are actually Loader Bot, Gordys, Scooter, and Athena\nNot to say that I didn't like the other characters -- I loved 'em all, good and bad and in between!  I'm just partial to these four.\n\nThis is pure Telltale, with fantastic storytelling, eye-catching graphics, rich characters, perfectly-chosen music and sound effects, great voice-acting, and immersive environments... and yet, it's completely different than the other titles in their repertoire.  There were twists and turns that I never saw coming, and in the end, I was flabbergasted by how far we came in just five episodes.  The Walking Dead will always be my favorite -- 'cause, well, ZOMBIES -- but Tales from the Borderlands takes a close second for me!  Absolutely recommended, whether you're a Borderlands fanatic, or a newbie like me.","January 9","true","15.1"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","3"

I can proudly say that I was more than delighted after finishing the first episode.\n\nBeing the first comedic Telltale game since Back to The Future, Tales from the Borderlands Episode 1 takes place three years after the events of Borderlands 2. TFTBL brings several firsts to Telltale Games, including the first game to feature multiple playable protagonists (Besides 400 Days and Jurassic Park). The shifting narratives between Rhys and Fiona bring several hilarious moments to the story. In one moment for example, Rhys states how he triumphantly was able to convince a man for loot, but when Fiona retells the same story, Rhys is seen begging pathetically for the loot.\n\nFurthermore, you do not have to be a Borderlands fan to enjoy this game. While the game features several references to past entries, they are not vital to the story, and are just put in for those who enjoy The Borderlands Lore.\n\nCombat has taken a larger role in this game, even more than that of The Wolf Among Us and Walking Dead combined! The final 15-20 minutes of the episode for example is almost entirely the equivalent to that of a boss fight in a Borderlands game.\n\nOverall, Tales from the Borderlands Episode 1 paves a bright future for the the franchise, possibly surpassing The Wolf Among Us, and I cannot wait to see what Telltale and Gearbox have in store for Episode 2.\n\n\nEpisode 2:\n\nTelltale keeps the train going with Episode 2 of their journey through Borderlands' world of Pandora. Picking up immediately after the events of Episode 1, Rhys and Fiona must face new challenges as they follow a path to a top secret vault presumably filled with treasures the world has never seen.\n\nFor the majority of this episode, the main group stays separated after an attack by Hyperion, leaving Rhys and Vaughn stranded in the middle of the Badlands without any hope of survival, and Fiona and Sasha to deal with several of the world's most deadly assassins out for their heads, including Borderlands favorites from past entries in the series.\n\nWhile this episode is light on character introductions it makes up for heavily developing those from Episode 1. We get more insight into Fiona and Sasha's lives prior to the events of the game, and we get to see some hilarious conversations with everybody's favorite villain Handsome Jack, alongside other Borderlands favorites like Scooter and Athena.\n\nFor this episode however, I felt that there were not many significant choices in this episode, the bulk of these "groundbreaking decisions" being on what skin you picked for a car, or if you brofisted another character. I was questioning the seriousness of this game's story until the final chapter of the episode, which ended with a surprisingly difficult choice that will keep you questioning your decision until the next episode.\n\nTales from the Borderlands Episode 2 was able to stay on par with the incredible premiere episode back in November, but the story seemed to be to nonsensical for me this time around. I would hope that this episode serves a a breather for the dark atmosphere that the ending seems to be building up to in Episode 3.","December 1, 2014","true","34.2"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","22","23","2","0"

This is the most entertaining TT game to date.\nExpect about ~12 hours to complete. Give or take one.\nAll that's left is to hope that it's going to be acconted for in Borderlands 3.\n___\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI enjoyed it a lot. The characters are lovely and interesting. Voice acting is superb. Writing is good as well.\n\nUnlike in other TT Games, here we play as two characters, who tell the same story. That creates a funny situations where actions of one character affect the events when it comes for the other character to tell his or her part, or when one of our characters lying and we hear "the truth" from the other character.\n\nTook me about 2,5 hours to complete the first episode, so figure. I would say ~15 hours tops when it all comes out.\n\nCrappy Borderlands textures - check.\n\nStrange for a TT game, but there's no puzzles. At all. This is just like a visual novel with QTE and answer selection. Maybe it will change in the second episode, but they did such a good job of simple QTEs, that I'm not worried even if there's not gonna be any puzzles ahead. It looks cool and interesting, and intuitive so that you may know what actions you're supposed to take.","December 30, 2014","true","14.4"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","21","27","4","0"

The harsh world of Pandora is one of the best worlds ever crafted in video game history, even rivaling Bioshock's Rapture, Pokemon's Kanto Region, and Skyrim/Morrowind from their respective games. After patiently waiting for episode 5 to come out so I can finally play this game, I finally gave it a run. After finishing it fairly quickly, I only have one word for this game:\n\nWOW.\n\nCall me crazy like the psychos that inhabit Pandora, but this game might just be the best game of 2015 so far.* I knew this game would be good.\n\n*Second best, behind Undertale. Sorry.\n\nGraphics\nSticking with Telltale's trademark comic graphics and mixing it with the identical Borderlands-style visuals makes environments look absolutely gorgeous. Compared to their other games, I think this one might just take the cake as the most visually appealing Telltale game so far. Not much else to say, but I did notice a few graphical issues, mainly with Fiona. However, these weren't too frequent.\n\nGameplay\nFinally! THIS is what I should see in something like The Walking Dead. You switch between two characters named Rhys and Fiona, and each of them have a special attribute to them. Rhys has an ECHO eye, which can scan and hack various things around you. Fiona, on the other hand, has a special pistol that gets upgraded as time goes on, but I won't spoil those upgrades. There are less frustrating QTEs, a big pro in my books. I didn't see too many puzzles, but I'll let this one slide as TftB isn't the game for those. The items you get throughout your journey will actually affect you in the final episode, and TRUST me on that one. I need to save room for the next big part of the review, but trust me. This is Telltale gameplay done right.\n\nStory\nThe story is near flawless. People who followed my reviews know I'm a HUGE fan of the first The Walking Dead season. Well, this game just John Cena'd it to the ground and stomped on it. I know, that's saying something, because Lee's death was one of the most well crafted moments in video game storytelling. However, even with this game's fairly light-heartedness, this story is absolutely amazing. It had a few moments where I thought, "Heeey, how did they get here?" or, "I can't choose otherwise?" But that is all ignored by the extremely clever and hilarious writing that is miles better than the ones in the original games, plus the fact that the characters are ALL enjoyable in their own right. Of course, this game has its moments of sadness, and I won't spoil too much, but one major character from the whole series is killed off. When combined with the plot twists this game offers, you have an outstanding, nigh perfect plot. I should also mention that the finale is by FAR the best finale of all the Telltale games, even crushing TWD S1's finale. The choices can be absurd, difficult, random, but worthwhile, you can trust me on that. The ending to the game could've used a bit more context, but ended on a very interesting note as well. In the end, TftB's story is just flat out AWESOME.\n\nAudio\nAnother high point to this game, the music choices are excellent. I won't get too in-depth, but I will say one thing: just LISTEN to the end credits song. You won't regret it. The voice actors are all excellent with their roles, my favorites of the bunch being Rhys, Gortys, and Vaughn. Again, not too much info here, but this is also very well done.\n\nReplayability\nCompared to other Telltale games, this one is actually far more open and is much better for replayability. The finale, especially, will have you wanting to go back and play differently. Again, without spoiling too much, watch your money and decisions, as it will all be extremely important. I could see myself playing this a lot more often compared to the other games and still enjoy it as much as the first time I played it.\n\nVerdict\nIn the end, Tales from the Borderlands proves to be my favorite game of the year so far because of, well, everything. Even if Telltale has been doing some questionable and unlikable decisions lately, TftB was definitely not one of those. I HIGHLY recommend this game. And trust me, with how polished this game was, I will definitely remember that. Definitely buy it, whether you played any of the Borderlands games or not.\n\nGraphics - 8.5/10\nGameplay - 9.0/10\nStory - 9.5/10\nAudio - 9.0/10\nReplayability - 8.0/10\n\nGANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK\n\n.:9.5/10:.\n\n+AMAZING finale!\n+Extremely clever writing and awesome voice acting to pair with it\n+Excellent music choice\n+Your decisions actually MATTER\n+Open to replayability\n+Gorgeous graphics\n+Lacking of annoying QTEs\n\n-A few plot holes/unanswered questions","October 31, 2015","true","12.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

An almost perfect choice-based game where your actions affect what happens in the later in the game. This game has a huge mix of emotions whilst trying to retain the same Borderlands feel. With a rich story, interesting characters, an intense plot that keeps twisting, beautiful graphics and amazing soundtrack, this game is a must play for all types of gamers and even more for gamers who've played TellTale Games before.\n\nNOTE:\nAll of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game.\n\nNOTE:\nI'm not going to talk about the story in this review. I think the story should be experienced as something completely new, and unexpected, meaning no spoilers to it.\n\nAbout\nTales from the Borderlands is a TellTale sequel to Borderlands 2 [BL2] that, instead of being like the previous games, is a choice-based game. It focuses on telling a rich story, whilst still retaining the classic Borderlands feel. Just like BL2, it's set on Pandora, not too long after the events of BL2. In this game, you'll be greeted with a mix of emotions ranging from intensity, to humour and even to sadness. You'll recognise familiar faces in this game from all three of the previous games whilst introducing some new faces, including a Hyperion business man and his friend, two sisters raised as robbers and con-artists and even robots. Through this five episode split game, you'll encouter new locations across Pandora, some of which also recognisable from the previous games and much more...\n\nGameplay\nOne thing I have to mention before I go into this topic is that this is not like the other Borderlands games in terms of gameplay! Tales from the Borderlands isn't a first person shooter like it's predecessors, it's a choice-based game, meaning your choices affect what happens in the game. Think of it as watching a movie, with certain parts of interaction and gameplay. Most of the game is selecting dialogue and doing Quick-Time-Events. There are times where you have control of your character, for example, searching through places. The game's story is split between two different characters, so throughout the game you switch to one or the other. One of the things that makes Tales from the Borderlands more unique to other TellTale games is the classic shop menu you see in the previous Borderlands games. The more money you pick up from earlier on, the more you're able to buy things in the shop like costumes.\nI only encounted a few minor problems whilst playing this but I'll only mention the three main ones:\n- Camera posistioning can be awkward\n- Some dialogue can be cut out unexpectantly\n- Your choices don't have much affect when it comes to the end-game.\n\nDesign and Graphics\nSome people might notice a slight increase when it comes to graphics. It still has that cartoonish look which is one of the things thats made Borderlands unique. Whether or not this bothers you, it's your opinion. Graphics can easily be adjusted in the settings and doesn't require a super powerful PC to run it.\nWhen it comes to design I really liked the look of the game. Just like it's predecessors it's beautifully drawn, with lots of detail. Some of the familiar locations look exactly like they did in the other games. Didn't encounter anything negative here, a beautiful game.\n\nUI [User Interface]\nLike I mentioned before, most of this game is cutscenes mixed with dialogue and Quick-Time-Events, all of which are easy to understand. Both characters have their own inventories and are designed only slightly different (mainly just different colours). Overall there isn't much of a User Interface. The game gives tutorials on certain things so it's unlikely you'll be confused by anything. Settings are easy to navigate. No problems here.\n\nPros - A well written story\n- Interesting characters\n- Very humorous at times\n- Stunning graphics\n- Classic Borderlands soundtrack\n- Lots of nostalgia\n\nCons - Camera posistioning can be awkward\n- Some dialogue can be cut out unexpectantly\n- Your choices don't have much affect when it comes to the end-game.\n\nFinal Recommendation\nAfter finishing this game I was very satisfied with the experience I went through, and would definitely be willing to play through it again. It can be sad at times, and it can be hilarious at times. This game captures the feel of Borderlands and puts it into a rich choice-based experience. I definitely recommend this game to others, even if choice based games aren't your thing. This is well worth your money.\n\nFinal Verdict - 8.5/10\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Od_savz7A\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/330830/\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading my review and I hope it was of some help to you.\nIf it was make sure to give it a thumbs up!\n\nYou can also check out my other reviews here - http://steamcommunity.com/id/narukoopa/recommended/\n\nThanks for Reading!","February 28","true","12.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","14","16","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ABudiJ/recommended/330830/","ABudiJ","Budi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ABudiJ/","301 products in account","Tales from the Borderlands is based on the first-person shooter game series by Gearbox Software. Telltale transforms it to a narrative driven, episodic point-and-click adventure.\n\nI was never fan of the game series before. But Telltale converted me with their terrific writing of characters and dialogue. World of Pandora has never been this interesting and fun! The story itself, isn't that remarkable. It's told by two characters, both controlled by the player. What shines in the writing is the hilarious dialogue. Characters have great personalities and are very memorable. Some characters are new and others have been introduced earlier in the series. Besides some familiar characters, there are other nods to the games too.\n\nThis is the best looking game by Telltale so far and It's also faithul to the style of Gearbox's games. Every episode has an awesome intro sequence that sets the mood for the game, it's accompanied by a great soundtrack. None of the five episodes felt filler at all and the last episode especially holds up. You get to see how your choices mattered and the familiar quick time events bring on a twist almost like Street Fighter style.\n\nTales from the Borderlands is a welcomed change of pace for Telltale, their other recent games have all been so dark and gritty. This takes them back to the tone of Monkey Island and Sam and Max games. But no puzzle solving this time either.\n\n[Score: 89]","December 22, 2015","true","11.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

With far reaching consequences far down the line, hours of gameplay later. This is still the case. However this is a much more light hearted affair. Though it definitely nails the very serious emotionally driven decision making aspect.\n\nBudding with new and old characters from Borderlands, Telltale gets this right as well. Very interesting and likable new characters as well characters you want to hate. You enjoy hating and no story worth its merit won't have its heel turn and humanization of the villain. To which its up to you what to do with.\n\nThe voice cast is incredible. I don’t know how they got all these people to do this. Especially because from the offset, this seems like a strange project at the very least. Turning a loot driven FPS with RPG elements into a narratively driven episodic adventure. (That’s where the subversion of expectations of Borderlands comes from.)\n\nI bet you've heard of these people before avid gamer.\n\n- Nolan North\n- Troy Baker\n- Laura Bailey\n- Patrick Warburton (that Seinfeld guy with the very iconic voice)\n- Chris Hardwick\n\nAnd that’s only naming a few. If you've played any of the Borderlands games before and enjoyed that type of humor, the aesthetic, the characters and ever had the thought that maybe the shooting everything kind of gets in the way sometimes. Than this is the game for you.\n\nIts also very nice to see another side of Pandora, what's it like for normal people that are not Vault Hunters? What's it like for people inside of Hyperion? Do you join the 'evil empire' to survive or rest on your laurels and succumb to your base human nature and become a criminal or scavenger starved on vengeance?\n\nLike most Telltale games, I arrived at the end very attached to my crew and the people I got there with wishing it was not over. That there was just one more episode if only to see whether or not my decisions are with the majority. Its hard to recommend a replay as, well.. it goes something like this; I've already made my decisions and gone through that journey, it would be interesting to see how else it could have turned out but that's not my story.\n\nI'll tell ya what, Telltale makes good games.\n\nAnd to sign off.. Catch a ride Scooter, catch a ride.","October 21, 2015","true","10.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

This is one of the many masterpieces Telltale Games produced.

And a lot of typical Borderlands jokes helped out.\n\n9/10\n\nHope to see a sequel, story had its end, but their could be more.\nSoundtrack was pretty nice and voice acting was perfect.\n\nWhen it comes to the boss fight, the quicktime events were much better than others in similar games.

It easily ranks as one of the funniest games that i've ever played.\n- If you enjoy good story telling, you should play this.\n- If you like reading comic books, you should play this.\n- If you like the Borderlands franchise, you should play this.\n- If you've played any of the other Telltale games,  you should play this, it's the best one yet.\n\nLike i've said above, i really liked this game, & i honestly think there's no reason for every single person who likes gaming, to give it a try.\nThe story was fast paced, & gripping the whole way through. It was told from a two-person perspective, with the two seperate storys constantly overlapping with each others continuity. The characters were interesting, & since you control the direction of some dialogue, it's upto you how likeable they are (to some degree).\nIf you've played the Bordelands game, then there are heaps of cameo apperances, & easter eggs for you to go "Ahh, i remember that..." over, but i think even with no previous Borderlands experience (i've only played the 1st & 2nd games, not the Pre-Sequel), if you enjoy a good story, then this game has it.\nThe graphics/ art was very comic book like, similar to the style of the Borderlands fps games, as well as being easily recognizable as a Telltale game.\nThe comedy was great, the highlight of the game, in my opinion. I laughed out loud a lot during this game, i'd even say, just as much as during the South Park game.\n\nOverall, i'd have to say, this is the best Telltale game i've played (G.O.T. next), & i really hope they make another in this series. Even if it's new characters, with cameos by this games cast (just an idea).\n\n9/10","December 5, 2015","true","27.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

I've had genuine good laughs while playing, and even shed a tear (!) when one of my favorite characters passed away. The writing only gets better and better during the season. And the less conservative minds among you will also enjoy the many female characters filling other roles than tailored objects of desire.\n\nGameplay-wise, QTEs don't represent much of a challenge and some parts may feel a bit dull. Stick with it and you'll be more rewarded than you would expect. The gameplay of the finale totally makes sense.\n\nSo if an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book set in the wild sci-fi universe of the Borderlands sounds any cool to you... go for it!","November 16, 2015","true","10.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

And guess what? Seems that your friend Fiona is also there. You're on Pandora but in a earlier life, you were an employee of Hyperion. How come you got stuck on the planet? Besides, how come Rhys was searching for you... Oh wait, you're Fiona too! You're a master of deceipts, but hey, you need to survive on your home planet too!\n\nIn other words, Tales from the Borderlands is telling you the tale of two individuals coming from two different worlds, being forced to work together to survive... and also to find a vault. Because, hey, vault hunting is fun! The gameplay of the game is to make choices, in words or in actions, because everything will have an impact later. You could cause chaos in a couple or mourn a father figure or even choose to kill people or spare their lives. As Fiona, you're mainly the money keeper - thanks to that, you can buy nice stuff. As Rhys, thanks to the ECHO eye, you can scan around, hack into things or even.... well, you're also the guy with the nice talk and with Handsome Jack, a past baddie, in the head, as an AI uploaded itself in your cybernetic when you didn't suspect a thing.\n\nWhile the main gameplay is making choices, you have also some good Quick Time Events, mainly in the fifth episode, when you assemble a team with characters you met and take control of Gortys to fight the scary alien.\n\nTo resume, Tales from the Bordelands is mainly flashbacks as Rhys and Fiona tell the Stranger the story and have some disagreements about some parts.\n\nIn episode 1, Rhys and his best friend Vaughn go on Pandora to steal a deal from Vasquez, Rhys's rival that demoted him to janitorial activity. Unfortunately, the key is revealed to be a fake, thanks to Fiona, her "sister" Sasha and their father figure Felix. And the 10 millions dollars are also stolen by a bandit, so, the five of them have no choice but to run after the money...\n\nIn episode 2, after finding an old Atlas facility and a map that could lead to a vault, Fiona, Rhys, Sasha and Vaughn are separated. While the guys deals with Vasquez and for Rhys, with an AI of Handsome Jack in his head, the girls are trying to run from goons interested in her (and a mysterious woman too). Anyway, their main goal is Old Haven, where secrets lie.\n\nIn episode 3, the gang, after escaping death from Vallory's gang and Vasquez, meet Athena, the mysterious woman, hired by Felix to protect the girls. And while Gortys is activated, they're going into another old Atlas facility to retrieve a piece of her. Gorthys is indeed a key to open a vault....\n\nIn episode 4, Vallory captured the gang because of Gortys. However, the last piece is on Helios, in Handsome Jack's office. So, the gang, without Vaughn, head into Hyperion with a great plan.... that isn't working. It's time for betrayal, for visiting Handsome's Jack office and for some finger guns....\n\nIn episode 5, Rhys has been tricked by Handsome Jack, making Hyperion on lockdown. While Fiona, Sasha and Gortys head for the hangar bay, Rhys (and maybe Yvette) go for the power core.... But by destroying it, they're making it crash on Pandora. While Rhys deals with Handsome Jack, Fiona discovers that a monster is guarding the vault and that Gortys can't handle it... However, after that, time passed.... Rhys and Fiona are now prisonners of the Stranger... They're still not done with the Vault of the Traveller....\n\nThe game relies a lot on satiric humor, as you're in Borderlands's universe. Rhys and Vaughn aren't skilled to survive Pandora apart with their words and that's the comic part. Also, you can choose to worship Handsome Jack or to come to your senses and to hate him. Gortys has a golden heart and is always cheerful, like a kid and it can be disastrous by moments (and without knowing that she's revealing what she shouldn't). Loader Bot seems also to be very logical but he's very loyal. As for Fiona and Sasha, the comic comes from Pandora's life itself.\n\nThe graphics are great too, in cell shader (at least, I think it's called like that). I don't know Borderlands's universe but I think it must fit also the franchise. Also, what is great is also the soundtrack and the songs chosen. It's fitting and besides, the opening sequences are always quite a catch for the eye.\n\nAs you understand, you don't need to play Borderlands to understand the game itself. I know that I loose many easter eggs because of that - the signification of the objects in Handsome Jack's office, Scooter's filiation, Athena's story as developed in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Brick and Mordecai... (yeah, I have searched through the Borderlands wiki to understand some things) - but seriously, you can easily plunge into the universe thanks to Tales from the Borderlands.\n\nThis game is a must-have. Anyone loving Telltale's games will love it. It changes from the dark world of the Wolf Among Us or the hash reality in The Walking Dead. I'm not regretting to have won it and activated it - nope, it wasn't on Steamgifts but on another site. I don't know if there will be a sequel but if Rhys and Fiona come back, I will be among the firsts to be on board!","January 30","true","11.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

As such, I can't comment how well this fits into the style or the lore of the main games.\n\nThat being said, this is a great interactive story. Some of the many funny moments are pretty hilarious, but it still strikes a good balance between serious storytelling and humor.\n\nThe actual presentation is totally flawless. From start to finish of the first episode there is not a single moment where I got the feeling they reached the limits of their engine. It all fits like a very well directed and presented movie.\n\nThe game does contain gore, but it's about on the level of an average MadMax movie. Speaking of that, the story style so far in Ep1 reminds me a bit of a mix of MadMax and Indiana Jones. Not that they're directly borrowing story elements of those movies, but I definitely see some inspiration with the scenes and characters.\n\nNot much to say about the hardware requirements. As long as you've got a seperate GPU it's gonna run at ridiculously high framerates, at max quality.\n\nGameplay is the usual Telltale interactive story with lots of QTE action scenes, moral decisions and very minor point and click adventure elements.\nSo if you're not generally opposed to those kind of games, this is definitely a recommendation for me.

That is what this game is. The game looks just like the Borderlands world we have loved to visit, and we get to visit many great new locations. The cast of characters is great, plus we get to see some favorite familiar faces. The story is very believable and doesn't have the contrived feel that some Telltale Games have. All the situations felt normal (for Borderlands at least). This game was hilarious! I'm so used to the sobering experience of The Walking Dead, so it was nice to see a much lighter game in which choices still matter, but the consequences are not always so desperate. The replayability value is fairly high, since there are so many ways to handle character interactions, relationships, and various plot arcs. I really hope that this game will influence a future Borderlands 3 game or possibly a second season of Tales from the Borderlands. I honestly can't find any negatives with this game, its perfect for me. I love Telltale and I love Borderlands, and Telltale, for me, got it right.","January 13","true","39.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","2"

So the 4th Telltale game where you move a bit, choice actions and what to speak and most time it has a low bis no effect. I was never think that games like this with so little amount of to do, only more to choice, would be funny, especally when the characters are not so great feeling from the start like WD 1/2 and A Wolf Among Us. But that changed very fast at me even with the 2 boys (slick Rhys and nerdy Vaugn) yeah and then the story about Fiona and Sasha and then first you think all will go end up between Rhys and Fiona? Yeah maybe or you get even bigger problems. So i love the story even if they it not something new. The enemys change and you are surprised. I dont know what is best to play but its not wrong to play BL 1, Pre-Sequel and / or BL 2 before. You must decide its all parts of the story together and it show how Athena get captured so that PS can happen and at the end its spoilered she is avaible again so it should be the start to hopefully BL 3.\n\nThe vault and his boss after i seen the destroyer, this 3 head one in PS, and that 2 in BL 2 (Warrior and in the pirat DLC Giant) its worth to be and damn the endfight is nice even if i did it only with 3 of 7 avaible teamfighters. Its like a o homage to Power Rangers, Sabel Riders and the Star Sheriffs and even a bit Transformers, at the ends the 2 robots looks a bit like C3PO and R2D2 (Star Wars) and that feels great and Han Solo maybe gets his Lea again (joking maybe). So the game has many good story changings, things you dont really expected. I make some mistakes and i wish there would be a REWIND/ Change Options for some few story mistakes (i can only give this tips: SAVE FELIX, get as VAULT HUNTER a NAME to get Zero for the end and keep your money all you can and dont waste it). So my end was amazing and i hope the game gets a Sequel.\n\nI want to play this game again in 1-2 years and cant await that day to see how other answers change the end. I miss again german subtiles (one weakness of all TellTale Games), no rewind option (like Prince of Persia, Life is Strange), NO TRADING CARDS, FAST FORWARD/ SKIP ABILITY :( , the game is like always a bit to short and there could be more options to play not only run a bit and choice the right item and thats it\nbut at the end of the game i feel so good entertained as a good movie and so i give FOR ME PERSONAL 95 % to this game. Test it yourself in Lets plays or something that could help you support this game to buy it for some money. ONLY IF YOU HAVE IT PLAY IT TO THE END, DONT STOP PLAYING BECAUSE YOU FEEL THE START A BIT ANNOYING OR SOMETHING. Enjoy it and have a happy gaming day.

(the timer is innacurate, I was on pause for way too long haha.)\n\nPros:\n\n-Game is funny as hell\n\n-The choices are personalized\n\n-You get attached to the characters.\n\n-Borderland feeling is there for sure.\n\n- :D\nzero.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Controls sometimes are not as responsive as I would like.\n\n-mashing buttons never been fun and never will.\n\n-Looking around is limit useless. Just go on with the story. But this is only for the first part I guess.\n\n-Short. I completed this first part in nearly 1 hours. I suggest to pick this on sale as it does not worth 30$ for part of a game. Seriously.\n\n\nAll in all, the game is really amazing. I love borderland and this is just a perfect sequel. Maybe I would suggest to play with a remote. The mouse pointer can turn invisible sometimes making quick decisions complicated.\n\nCan't wait to play all the chapters straight.\n\n10/10 is hype as ♥♥♥♥!\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nEpisode 2 was cool. We learn more about the story. We feel the weight of our actions from season 1.\n\n"Kiss the sky" is one my new favorite songs.\n\nLot of places to explore with little reward. Still, a lot of plot twist.\n\nit was okay. I devoured it so I guess it was pretty good.\n\n9/10\nStory is very confusing. Interesting but confusing...\n\n\n//////////////////////////////////\n\nUpdate 3:\n\nOk now I am on the middle line.\n\nHalf of me loved some new twist to the game, the other half is very desappointed.\n\nPro:\n\n-Precedents items are FINALLY useful. (Inventory is still useless to look at tho...)\n\n-A bit more dynamic. Gives you more shooting occasions.\n\n-A person DIE (The ones who played knows)\n\n-Making you regret certain choices because you feel like betraying someone.\n\nCons (and there is more than pros....)\n\n-That's it? Was that any kind of devloppement to the story?\n\n-New characters? Yay. Would be nice if they had more personality.\n\n-What are those glitches? Frame skips, texture lag, scenery which loses focus. Lot and lot of rough rendering.\n\n-I laughed once. Thanks little robot.\n\n-You have 3 choices, each of them leadinga t the same place. Do we still have any impact on the story?\n\nThere was a few moments where you have to do something... but doing nothing is not an option. You will simply remain there indefinetly. Waiting. Expecting a second choice.\n\n>Press the button. (But it looks suspicious...) Look around... no other options... WHY DID I HAVE THE OPTION IN THE FIRST PLACE? MAKE IT PART OF THE ANIMATED SCENE!\n\n-I just feel like I watched a long cutscene where I had to press buttons sometimes.\n\n\n-Still have the button mashing problem. Why so many button mashing occasions? It's not fun.\n\nconclusion of chapter 3:\n\nWe can notice a few improvements. Sadly, these improvements are buried under many more little problems. I did not enjoy the time spent on this chapter as much as on the other ones. The decisions have no impact on the game. Which basically kills the idea behind this kind of game.\n\n6/10\ncute cutscene.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate 4.\n\nI know I skipped one chapter because I felt I would have bashed it way too much. I was not happy.\n\nAs for chapter 5. I feel like I played a whole new game. so...let's go with pro and cons.\n\nPros:\n-Neon Genesis Evangelion simulator 2015\n\n-FINGER GUNS pew pew pew pew\n\n-Choose a team of elites (or not)\n\n-some good story devloppement ...I guess.\n\n-Fuuuu ♥♥♥♥ is dead.\n\n-epic loot.\n\nCons:\n\n-Might as well make a movie. Choices are still limit useless. Not much impact beside some details that you might not care about at all. A lot of situations you are given control and yet.... you wonder what was it for? Did you really need to do that single clic?could it not be part of the video (same as chapter 3.)\n\n-This could have been a whole different game. New characters. new gameplay. I wouldn'T have seen the difference.\n\n-Weird loopholes. Characters desapears and appears back again later. No reason given. Moments you can swear something tragic happens and yet... nothing too bad as the character comes back pretty well. (Sasha mostly and Athena)\n\n-It feels as if they rushed so many parts of the story. I know they had a short window to come up with the chapters (people urged for the chapters to come faster). They got what they asked for. Unfinished material. Plenty plot holes and the finale is out without much explanations.\n\nI give chapter 4-5 together a mark of 6/10\n\n\nSOOO\n\nIn conclusion.\nYes I still recommand this game. I recommand it only to borderland players. The whole game is filled with insides about borderland games. You'd miss half the jokes without some knowledge of the lore.\n\nIdon't recommand it if you follow telltales games only. This is probably one of their worst if not the worst.It really makes me sad since it was the one I anticipated the most.\n\nit began as something I was so hyped about. I was so happy about a sequel of borderland that felt different and yet, this anticipation has never been met.\n\nI give the whole set a 7/10\ntoo much water. No but seriously. This game could have been better. Pay for it in sale. Get it and play all episodes straight. Don't expect anything spectacular. Just enjoy the ride while it last.","January 4, 2015","true","59.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/recommended/330830/","idiobrando","I DIO!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/","517 products in account","I bet if you told someone last year that a Borderlands adventure game would be one of the best games of the year, I’m sure most people would think you’re full of ♥♥♥♥, I know I would. But now that I’ve finally played through TftB, I have to say that it’s in my Top 3 GOTY 2015 alongside Witcher 3 and Undertale. (That was originally Life is Strange’s spot for most of the year until the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ last episode, didn’t think Borderlands would be taking that spot either) I think Tales is far and away Telltale’s second best game, only being beat out by Walking Dead Season 1. It’s a strongly written roller coaster ride that feels longer than it is in a good way. (And it’s around nine hours or so give or take so its decently long to begin with for an adventure game.)\n\nI think one of the major strengths that Tales shares with TWD Season 1 is that both were free to be their own stories. Borderlands has more of the characters from the original source material appear, but because they’re just a bunch of treasure-hunting mercs from an FPS where they just shoot ♥♥♥♥ and aren’t tied into any real plots Telltale could do what they wanted with them. Funny thing is Tales is actually a direct sequel to Borderlands 2 as its events feature heavily in the plot, but you don’t have to play or even like 1 and 2 to enjoy Tales. Borderlands as a series doesn’t deserve a game as great as Tales really.\n\nTales is genuinely funny on its own merits. The main series is rather infamous for its Internet meme laden writing, but Tales takes the high road and instead has the cast be likeable and have the comedy come from their interactions and other silly situations. If there is any references they tend to actually be good. (Like one real good in Episode 4) And as I said the writing is real strong, the characters are all likable and they develop over the course of the game.\n\nGameplaywise it’s more on the linear side like Telltale’s recent fare, it tends to just shuttle you along through interactive cut scenes, but there’s enough there to keep you engaged. (It sure as ♥♥♥♥ is leagues better than Game of Thrones) You play as both Rhys and Fiona depending on the section of the game, though you play them separately and can’t switch between them or anything like that. Choices are in the TWD Season 1 vein, where you can change the characters' personalities and their relationships.  This is illustrated best with the ending which allows you to recruit characters you’ve befriended throughout the game. The ending itself is great and ties together everything real well and can bring some great conclusions to the characters’ arcs. (One of which most people missed out on, but I didn’t.)\n\nTales from the Borderlands is overall just one of those pageturner type games where you don’t want to put it down until you’re done. Its charming and entertaining as ♥♥♥♥ and if this ends up being the last quality game Telltale ever makes, at least they ended on a hell of a high note.","May 1","true","9.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Borderlands, not so much. The first Borderlands game really had no appeal to me. I liked the silliness and the off-the-wall humor, but the lack of a story made the game absolutely uninteresting to me. Borderlands 2 was a decent game, the mechanics were solid and there was a storyline that I could get a little invested in, but for several reasons I just could never bring myself to fully finishing the game. It's not that there is anything inherently wrong with the game that I can point out, it just didn't really "do it" for me.\n\nThat being said, I think that Tales from the Borderlands is what the Borderlands series should have always been. With a focus on dark humor and story, I find myself much more involved in the game as well as appreciating the brand of humor that helped to make the original games so popular. TTG did a wonderful job capturing the spirit of the original FPS's, while at the same time making the story their own.\n\nIf you like the other TTG products, I would say this game is for you, but you probably already knew that. For everyone who has never bought a TTG game, I would say that Tales from the Borderlands is incredibly worth it. If you were to buy any game they've made, this should be the one. As with all of their games, replay value is incredibly high, and for only 25 dollars, less than half the cost of larger-profile games, you will get the same if not more enjoyment.\n\nI've already played the first chapter through 3 times, and I can't wait to see where the next chapters take us.","January 18, 2015","true","28.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/330830/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","When I heard Telltale was making one of their episodic installment point and click adventures based off Borderlands, I entered a phase of skepticisim. Borderlands has a quick-paced and in-your-face type of humor that I feel Telltale couldn't replicate, seeing as they work better with steady and controlled pacing for their storytelling. However, I got over it since I'm a Borderlands fan and I have great respect for Telltale's writing and in-depth storytelling.\nSo what do I think of Tales from the Borderlands?\nSlapped my low expectations right in the face and delivered a hell of an experience.\nFor Telltale games, this is a pretty big step forward. Not telling their story from one but two points of view in an intertwining narrative that is fun to play through, gripping the players attention, full of action and great characters all ending off on a very fast-paced and intense climax, and that's just episode one.\nCompared to some of their previous releases, Telltale ups the experience with fresh new interfaces and options for the player to get the most out of their time spent. Two characters telling the same story (and bickering about the facts, which is pretty entertaining) about greed, distrust and betrayal. I can't exactly say much about the story since this is a point and click adventure game, which has its primary focus on the story. So revealing too much about it would spoil a good chunk of the game. However, I can say that the camera angles are well done, the action sequences are fast-paced and very fun even if you don't have alot of control and the characters all have well-written personalities and believable motivations. They even got that one guy to do a voice, what was his name? He's in a lot of stuff and I'm too lazy to look up on IMBD for his name but you'll know who I'm talking about when you hear it.\nNow this game was pretty gosh-durn good, a well-written story set in the Borderlands universe with plenty to keep fans of the series giggling. But there are some issues I'm sensing here. The animations, good god are they stiff. Action scenes have movement patterns similar to cut-budget stopmotion and facial motions are stiff and limited. I know there is a valid reason for this, it's because the Telltale Tool is really outdated, archaic even. The company is making a lot of good things in recent years, I don't even have to say what a success The Walking Dead Season One was, so why don't they put some budget into a new, improved and modern game engine? I'm not talking about 100% realism but something to give their visual storytelling a better payoff to the player. Just my opinion, they could be working on something like that for all I know.\nSecondly, and this is a general criticism to Telltale themselves, not directly related to this game so go ahead and skim this paragraph over if you're not interested in what I have to say: You got these amazing writers who have created gem after gem with Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us, why are they always piggybacking off the popularity of others? Why don't they make something completely original? I have faith in them, I was once a snide skeptic of their capabilities but Telltale has proven me wrong time and time again, and have earned my respect. So I would love to see them put their effort into creating something new and entirely Telltale, something that people will look at and think "Telltale Games", not "Telltale Games in association with:". I think they could do it, and if anybody who works at Telltale is reading this: I'M SORRY FOR BEING SUCH A WORTHLESS CYNIC! PLEASE CREATE SOMETHING AMAZING AND ORIGINAL! I BELIEVE IN YOU!\nAnother issue I have with the game is the pacing. I've mentioned earlier that Telltale and Borderlands have starkly conflicting approaches to their dialogue, and it shows. The game lacks the quick-slap entertainment of Borderlands and feels more held back by Telltale's controlled pace. There are a lot of moments where I can tell it was Telltale who made this with prolonged silent moments, following their formula and reducing the value and charm of Borderlands that we've come to expect with a Borderlands title. But that can be considered by some to be a minor nitpick at best, especially seeing how the game has done a very nice job of accomplishing what it set out to do.\n\nSo all that's out of the way. To sum up Tales from the Borderlands: It follows the Telltale formula and adds some creative new ideas into it that make the game stand out in comparison to their other works. If you're a fan of Telltale, Borderlands or both I'd definitely recommend giving this game a run. You won't be disappointed.","December 21, 2014","true","9.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

This Episodic Series explains the Story well, so it's not necessary to have played the previous Games if they aren't your style of Game.\n\nThe Dialog choices were great, and there weren't really any choices that you didn't want to choose, which could add onto the Replayability just to see the reactions.\n\nI do have to say though, that I really enjoyed the Story. It was full of Comedy, Action, and even some Emotional scenes. The Game has very little walking in it like some other Episodic Games, with most of it being Dialog Choices, and Quick Time Events.\n\nPersonally, I thought the Quick Time Events were over done in parts, but that is probably due to my dislike for them. I'm all for Directional Movements, but have little like for repetively pressing a single button over and over [which you'll do a lot].\n\nThe only thing I thought could have had some improvement, was during the Conversations, after your selection 90% of the time the Animations weren't seamless and would "skip". Apart from that, it was a solid Game with plenty of laughs.\n\nGenre\n- Episodic\n\nGame Elements\n- Player Choice\n- Quick Time Events\n\nAverage Playthrough\n- 12 Hours\n\nLiked\n- Great Story\n- Comedy\n- Good Voice Acting\n- Fitting Music\n- Player Choice\n- Nice Visuals\n\nDisliked\n- Animations weren't seamless","November 7, 2015","true","9.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It also maintains the comedy while still eliciting emotional involvement, which is not something I initially thought they could do with such an over the top setting.\n\nAlso have to compliment each episodes opening credits, they knock each and everyone out of the park.\n\nSuffice it to say you should get this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/330830/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Tales from the Borderlands is an episodic narrative driven Point & Click set in the insane world of Pandora. This is a rather interesting game as the Borderlands series is not known for its stories and is Telltale's first attempt to venture into video game IPs unlike their previous takes on famous TV shows like Game of Thrones or comics like The Walking Dead. We start off as a Hyperion employee named Rhys who is on his way to his boss’s office for a promotion only to find that his boss has been thrown out of an airlock and his nemesis has been made the new boss. Rhys has unfortunately been “promoted” to janitor and vows to get revenge. Luckily for him he managed to discover a multimillion deal and decided to steal it from under the new boss’s nose. In order to accomplish this Rhys and his best friend travel to Pandora and this is where our journey truly begins.\n\nUpon landing they soon discover how strange and violent the people on that planet are and quickly get themselves into trouble. The unique thing to Telltale's take on Borderlands is that you are not some gun sling badass and has never seen anything more violent than fake finger gun fights in the office. He is very out of his element on this planet and much of the humor comes from his reactions to all the crazy events that occur to him. His only real talent is hacking and even then he is not very good at it. After a while we are introduced to the second character that we will control throughout this game called Fiona who is a native Pandorian and a scam artist. Through a strange turn of events both characters soon meet and try to survive together. Fiona may be a much tougher person than Rhys though she is no fighter so they usually deal with danger by running, hiding or talking their way out of it.\n\nYou will on rare occasions be able to control your character and solve a simple puzzle but the game mostly has you sitting and watching with the occasional dialogue choice. It works in its favor as the parts where you control the character are by far the worst since your character walks way too slow and has you solve extremely simple puzzles that make you think “Why did they even bother to put this in?”. Like other Telltale games this title is heavily reliant on Quick Time Events and will frequently throw some your way to make sure you are still paying attention. While you have control of a character you can access an inventory system that show you what items you have on you but it is completely useless and never used making it an unneeded gimmick. A nice little detail is that you can open some certain crates or steal from certain people to get money which you can then use to buy masks or give your car some style in certain scenarios. Both are completely just cosmetic and are gone from the game before you can blink but it's a rather nice touch.\n\nThe story is pretty funny but is also shockingly engaging, tragic and mysterious. You see the story is being told by your two characters as some unknown man kidnaps them and demands to know about what they have found in their travels. Who he is and what he wants is a real mystery for most of the game and he comes off as a really cool character. Cool characters is what this game has in spades, nearly everyone you meet is memorable in some way or another since everyone on Pandora seems to be balls to the wall insane. Old characters from the Borderlands series also make an appearance here and there like Scooter and a few of the Vault Hunters. Vault Hunters are exactly what the name says for those unfamiliar with the series. Even if you are not familiar with the Borderlands franchise the games barely have any stories to them so you will get the gist of it in no time. All you need to know is that Vaults are said to have great riches and everyone wants to enter one. Only thing you will really miss out on is the cameos of old character as you will likely have no idea who they are.\n\nGraphics retain that comic book look of Borderlands and looks very true to its source material. Seeing the world of Pandora through the eyes of someone who can't fight suddenly makes you realize what a horrible place that planet is. It helps you sympathize with the characters as well as capture a nice blend of thinking you are going to die and chuckling to yourself in disbelief as your character is saved by a stroke of luck or even pulls off something awesome in a few cases. As I mentioned before this title has a great blend of storytelling methods other than humor and has some shockingly powerful moments. It knows exactly when to be serious, how to present the illusion of choice and when to pull out the dubstep vs space ninja death race battles. The ending left it open for a season 2 though it didn't feel like a cliff hanger was satisfied and was done in a far better way than their previous Game of Thrones game. Tales of a Borderlands is in my opinion Telltale's finest work yet and I would highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys the genre even if they are not a fan of the source material.","December 30, 2015","true","9.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

While they argue it’s being constantly worked on I keep seeing the same issues on every game, random flickering, texture pop ins and out… that kind of stuff totally breaks your immersion.\n\nLess QTEs, more puzzles: I’m sad to see how they keep replacing puzzles with more and more QTEs. They are not bad but they do get pretty annoying after a while.\n\nIllusion of Choice: Telltale has become pretty good at giving you the illusion of choice, I think most people agree that they would like their choices to have more impact on the story.\n\nNow, on to the actual game: Tales from the Borderlands is my favorite Telltale Game so far. They took the borderlands universe and told a pretty compelling story that actually made me care for things the main game didn’t before so heads up and prepare for fun ride, cowboy *points finger guns at you*\n\nEspañol:  Cosas que Telltale debería mejorar en un futuro:\n\nMotor Gráfico: Me encanta el estilo artístico de Telltale, pero si algo claro esta es que necesita un cambio radical en su motor gráfico. En cada uno de sus juego se puede ver como hay parpadeos aleatorios, texturas que aparecen y desaparecen y otros bugs gráficos que en ocasiones destruyen por completo la inmersión en la historia.\n\nMenos QTEs, más acertijos: Es triste ver que con cada juego nuevo los acertijos disminuyen para incluir a cambio más QTEs, ¡no más por favor!\n\nIlusión de Elección: La queja principal, Telltale es bastante bueno haciéndote creer que tus elecciones tienen peso  pero al final del día suelen ser bastante efímeras.\n\nAhora, hablando del juego en sí, Tales from the Borderlands es fácilmente mi juego favorito de esta compañía, tomaron el universo de Borderlands y con el crearon una historia más interesante que la de los juegos principales.\n\nPrepárate para un divertido viaje, vaquero *apunta sus dedo-pistolas*","May 15","true","12.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","0"

One might argue that your choices didn't matter very much in this game, but the last episode had a lot of stuff that was different based on your previous actions.\n\nThe thing I liked the most about this game is the absolutely amazing intros they made. Borderlands is very well known for godlike intros and songs, but this game beats all previous titles. TTG really tried to capture the spirit of the previous games, and they did one hell of a job. It's always a risky move to introduce completely new characters when there are already a lot of loved characters in the game, but TTG is an absolute beast when it comes to character development. Since this is the direct sequel to Borderlands 2 and (hopefully) the follow-up to Borderlands 3, you shouldn't miss this adventure.

If you dont like the Borderlands shooter then thats fine because this is still playable and if you love the borderlands franchise then you will love this game.\nThere are some Borderlands fans that say "This series doesn't have any impact on the actual borderlands universe, it's just a point and click spin-off". This is not true, Tales from the Borderlands has a very big impact on the universe which becomes quite clear in episodes 4 and 5.\n\nOne other point that should be brought up is the fact that the episodes took a while to release and I think It's quite bad to see that the only reasons people have been giving this game bad reviews was because they...\n\n1.Don't like point and click adventure games but bought this one and are now criticizing it because it IS A POINT AND CLICK ADVENTURE GAME (These people are really stupid, 2 seconds of research and you would have found that out)\n2.They don't like the artstyle, which again 2 seconds of research and you would have found the artstyle from the previous games or seen the trailer for this one\n3.The episodes took too long to be released, which is not the games fault it's the developers fault, so people shouldn't write bad reviews about something that is not the games fault and will become completely irrelevant once the full game is released.\n\nEpisode Ratings:\n\nEpisode 1:AMAZING\nEpisode 2:Very good\nEpisode 3:Very good\nEpisode 4:good\nEpisode 5:AMAZING\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nArtstyle: 97/100 - Couple of texture glitches brought it down\nSound/music: 100/100 - No words for how good the music and voice acting was in this game\nCharacters: 95/100 - Very few characters I didn't like or I felt had problems\nStory: 98/100 - You can't predict the masked man\nEngine/Optimization: 80/100 - The Telltale engine still needs alot of work\n\nScore: 94/100","November 1, 2015","true","19.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

And I'm saying that as someone who's not really much of a Borderlands fan AND who has consistently had a bone to pick with Telltale's approach to game design.\n\nGame follows standard Telltale interactive adventure formula with a twist of having two main characters to control this time around, even if they are both on the snarky side to begin with, and benefits from the addition of largely tangential elements like Fiona's wallet or Ryhs' cybernetic eye which really only come up in rare few situations where they were actually used in some meaningful way. They were still good additions though, and precisely what these games need to involve you further on some mechanical level even if it is just inteacting with couple of windows and additional button presses. It should be noted this is by far the most light-hearted game as befitting its native franchise and this comes through in general  atmosphere, characters themselves and writting overall resulting in incredibly zany situations and even crazier directions story goes towards. I would also say a much-complained-about-wait for the final episode was well worth it having finally played it considering it pulls off some decent story resolutions as well as new last-minute system additions I did not see coming while still keeping the doors open for a potential season two.\n\nIn the end, Telltale really outdid themselves with this one and is probably their new benchmark as of right now.","October 30, 2015","true","10.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game has taken that title by miles.   Tales from the Borderlands is both one of the most heartfelt and the funniest story to come out of Telltale, and manages to maintain the style of the main Borderlands games while having a far better story and much more realistic dialogue.  The characters in this game are far more relatable than any of the previous protagonists, and you will probably care far more about them because of it, especially in the moments when Telltale pulls their signature 'everything went wrong' moments out.  But through all the drama it maintains a generally lighthearted tone, with lots of laughs from both physical humour and great writing.  It also has the two best action scenes in any game of this genre.  I won't go into details for fear of ruining the surprises, but believe me that you'll know them when you see them.\n\nThis is a must play whether you care about the main series of Borderlands or not.  If you've never played the originals, they're good games in their own right, but a wiki summary of the series will be enough for you to get a great experience out of this one.

We get space, Hyperion buttheads, and that sweet smell of pyscos getting a little stabby. I really enjoyed it.  It may not be the FPS you're used to when playing borderlands but it's got that borderlands feel. The characters very interesting. I enjoyed The walking dead and Wolf Amoug Us by Telltale and they did a good job on this game. The character switches was a nice touch. Rys and Fiona are a lot of fun and not hard to get attached to.

The game (as: The walking dead season 1,2 and The wolf among us which i've played before this one) is like a movie, in which you decide what to say and what to do, constantly knowing that everything will have consequences in the current or next episodes.\nUnlike The walking dead though, this game has a lot of action situations, where you have to fight back bandits and psychos, with a lot of bad*ss moves of counter attacks. It sure does keep high the interest in the next episodes.\n\nIf you liked playing Borderlands 1, 2 and the pre-sequel for its stupidity and bad*sstitude to approach things, then you're definetly going to love this one.\n\n" Really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really...

We came to Pandora not only to laugh, to cry, to feel relief despite numerous danger out there, we came to Pandora to see our beloved characters to gather to fix their mess, like a family, and only people who experienced the adventure from the beginning can understand how beautiful that moment was. We saw old fellas giving a hand one last time, we saw mysteries finally uncovered themselves to prove that our speculation was all... wrong, but isn't it what we want to see? To be surprised by the clever work of these con men?\n\nAnd when credits appeared, only emptiness was left behind. Every trip has to reach it's destination, every book has the final page, every thing must come to an end. Why don't good things last forever? It felt so wrong to say goodbye to our beloved characters, but then again I'm thankful for it, because now there's one more thing to love and is worth waiting for.\n\nLoader Bot offline.\n\nMy 2nd GOTY of 2015.","December 2, 2015","true","13.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

At its core, it's just another Telltale game akin to The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, and Game of Thrones, so there's nothing too special in terms of gameplay - you know what you're in for if you've played any of those other games. What sets it on the top of the Telltale ladder is the narrative, and that should be saying a lot when you consider Telltale's track record.\n\nTaking place on Pandora, the already-established setting of the Borderlands games, TftB plays around with what it's been given and makes the world its own. I was never a huge fan of the Borderlands games when they first came out, but I found myself enjoying TftB just the same. Where the original series was too try-hard its attempt at edgy and wacky humor, TftB is just naturally funny and brutal, with a surprising amount of those tug-at-your-heart-strings moments we've come to expect from Telltale. Oh, and speaking of which: yes, your choices really do matter here. Well, more than in the other Telltale games, anyway. You'll often be questioning yourself whether or not you made the right decision even in some of the more pedestrian choices, not to mention the life and death scenarios you come across.\n\nIn terms of playtime, each episode lasts about 2 hours, with the final fifth episode going well past that, which would clock in the season at an upward of 10 hours for a single run, with plenty of incentive to go back and replay it to see the different outcomes and interactions, since you certainly won't be able to see everything the game has to offer in that single playthrough.\n\nTo sum up, Tales from the Borderlands is a must-play for anyone who's a fan of narrative-driven adventure games of the Telltale variety, and offers the most engaging story and gameplay of the bunch thus far.","October 24, 2015","true","10.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

For me, 'Tales of the Borderlands' is that game, and I was one that smirked when, upon announcement, people thought that the Borderlands universe wasn't rich enough to tell a serious story with.\n\nThe story has plenty of serious and comedic moments, a story that keeps on ramping up (the stakes get larger each episode), and a few shocking moments that will shock even those who are invested in the world of Borderlands.  Apparently, Gearbox let Telltale, err...tell a tale that wasn't constricted to keeping the status quo, and 'Tales from the Borderlands' is better for it.  It's refreshing after all of Telltale's prior efforts after they gained extreme success, that were very serious stories, to have a little humor sprinkled into a game.\n\nOh, and possibly the best intros Telltale has ever done.

There are so many more funny ones throughout the game.  Is it perfect?  No.  No game is.  But its ♥♥♥♥ing great.  A few glitches here and there but overall really fun and has great replay value.  I grabbed this game during a sale and was happy I did.  This is not your typical FPS Borderlands game keep in mind, but I does give you that Borderlands feel and some really cool back sotries for those who have played throughout the series.  I was very skeptical at first due to some reviews, but I personally never really go off of what other people think entirely.  After playing through my first time I could hardly wait to do my second play through to see how changing my answers would impact the stories and outcomes.  It's like many games of this style in that category, what you choose has impacts even on people dying and choosing characters for end game boss.  I will most likely be playing through this many times as well as replaying all the Borderlands series themselves.  Can't wait to see the next one.  The graphics are Borderlands style and in my opinion good as I like those types.  The sound is great.  The story, is how you choose and always changing.  The content is mature and not just entertaining and will most often leave you smiling or with a literal "lol".  Keep an open mind and give it a try.  Good luck and keep Vault Hunting!

So this was kind of an obvious choice for me, I was sceptical at first though, couldn't imagine what kind of a story could be told on Pandora TellTale style. As it turned out, I really loved it. You take control of two main characters, A gal named Fiona and a guy called Rhys. Both come from completely different worlds and carry some heavy baggage with them. You'll get to make dialog and story choices for the both of them while considering their unique points of view, which is pretty cool and I enjoyed the hell out of it. I don't wanna spoil the story and there isn't really a way to explain it in a short way, let's just say it's about vault hunting (duuh), there's mind blowing plot twists and robots and you get very close to banging! Identical gameplay to other TT games - quicktime events and dialog timers. Rarely puzzles.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- The humor! I laughed at every other scene, it clicked very well with both my mature and immature senses of humor. And no, I didn't mind the memes, I think they fit the borderlands kind of a world pretty fine. Maybe I'm too old to find them cool and I don't give a damn.\n- The characters. They're interesting and likable, I enjoyed watching their stories as much as simply watching them ;) You will meet new people and some old friends.\n- The music, not only licenced songs, also the ambience music really brought my goose bumps up. Opening intros were something I looked forward to much like with the original Borderlands games.\n- The story is pretty amazing and nicely paced. Not once I found myself bored of nothing happening or confused from too much action.\n- The illusion of choice, still works pretty well in my opinion. I understand why the choices cannot have real impact because that would mean creating 20+ games for the price of one. There are exceptions though, see in the did not like section.\n\nWhat I did not like:\n- Save system, sometimes I made a rash dialog decision or forgot to collect items and wanted to reload, not without replaying the last 10 minutes though.\n- Some dialog responses made no sense, especially characters' reactions to my being silent. As I sometimes honor the old saying "talking is silver, silence is golden", I chose to remain silent, especially with the fallen antagonist. To my surprise, nobody really minds and Rhys/Fiona kind of continue their animations and face expressions just with closed mouths. Maybe it's just me but I'd be super weirded out if somebody kept quiet in a 1on1 conversation with me.\n- The forced romance. Don't get me wrong, I liked Sasha. But since the first moment I only had eyes for Fiona and I felt like a jackass telling Sasha to "screw off" all the time as it wouldn't stop shoving convenient situations up my throat only with her.\n- Bleeping and replacing the F-bomb. I know this is nitpicking, but COME ON! Is one word really that much of a deal?\n\nThis game obviously isn't for everybody. It's mostly an interactive movie and I think it's worth it if you're into that at least a little. Sorry I can't give the highest score since I did find some flaws, but that did not stop me from replaying it many times and now recommending it to you with the count of 9/10","March 20","true","58.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

We came to Pandora not only to laugh, to cry, to feel relief despite numerous danger out there, we came to Pandora to see our beloved characters to gather to fix their mess, like a family, and only people who experienced the adventure from the beginning can understand how beautiful that moment was. We saw old fellas giving a hand one last time, we saw mysteries finally uncovered themselves to prove that our speculation was all... wrong, but isn't it what we want to see? To be surprised by the clever work of these con men?\n\nAnd when credits appeared, only emptiness was left behind. Every trip has to reach it's destination, every book has the final page, every thing must come to an end. Why don't good things last forever?

Having received it as a birthday present, I had in fact procrastinated for 4 months before finally deciding to play it in a bout of boredom.\n\nI was hooked instantly, jumping from episode to episode right to the much awaited conclusion.\n\nIncredible storytelling with characters that grow and change as the story progresses (or "development", as some might call it), consistently pleasant (and at times stunning) visuals, top-notch voice acting and an authentic Borderlands soundtrack to wrap it all together.\n\nAt times thrilling and exciting, at some hilariously witty and at others tragic and bleak, the story was masterfully crafted and engaging throughout.

The story is fun and quirky and has very solid pacing. Telltale did a great job with embodying the Borderlands world, with its violent nature into the genre they so very well known for. The Borderlands humor is there as one would expect it but it is used in moderation and for the better in my opinion.\n\nOn the technical side the game runs well except for the very rare occasional audio bug (which might be a personal problem) where the dialogue would overlap a word and then continue as normal. This didn't cause and de-synch issues or lag otherwise.\n\nAfter playing the Pre-sequel earlier this year, the Borderlands formula has gotten a bit stale for me.

You move using your left stick and use the right stick to look around...Or you can use the WASD buttons on your keyboard and use the mouse to look around. There's not much to do tho. Just walk around in a very small area and click on things and the story goes on. There are no puzzles to solve.\nYou spend most of the game either during quick time events or making choices.\nPeople have been saying that your choices don't matter in the Game of Thrones - TellTale Game but you can rest assured that in this game your choices will have an impact on the protagonists and the characters around them.\nPeople actually live or die depending on the choices you've made throughout the game. Even the smallest choice matters. I did something very early in the game that i didn't think will matter much\nbut turned out having a huge impact on some of the characters during the last episode.\nThe game is certainly worth playing through twice if you want to see the outcomes of different choices.\n\nI've been a fan of the Borderlands franchise since the very first game. I just love Borderlands! The mysterious feeling the first game had...The music, the humour, the mixed drama and the feeling of being alone in a ruthless wasteland you know nothing about. Wildlife and bandits rule the planet. The Vault was something mysterious. Something that noone had ever seen. The vault was just a story. A myth. - The first Borderlands game\nset the perfect mood and atmosphere. The setting of the game was "the dung!".\nThis was all ruined in Borderlands 2. I still loved BL2. The gameplay was great and improved. Same can be said about the characters (Handsome Jack is an awesome villain!) and graphics. But the mood was gone\nand so was the mystery. Pre-sequel totally slaughtered everything that there was left of the first games feeling. The gameplay is still good but now the mood of the Borderlands adventure is totally gone.\n\nWhy am i telling you all this? TellTale actually kind of nails the atmosphere the first Borderlands game had. If you haven't played any of the previous games (or you've only played the first one) then the Vault is still\nsomekinda mysterious thing that is very hard to get to. I'd like to think that this game is Borderlands 2. The official sequel to the first game.\nThe game has a lot of humour in it both dark and goofy but it can also be very dramatic and it certainly keeps the tension up. You just can't wait to see what happens next!\nEach episode starts with an amazingly done intro and each episode ends with a well done cliffhanger...Except the last Episode of course. The last Episode does wrap it all up\nand you don't have to be worried about the ending being a lackluster. It's actually very well done.\n\nThe game features scooping out eyeballs, peeling human skin, bandits, corporate douchepouches, vault hunters, cute robots, a skag and lots of explosions!\n\n10/10 - It's perfectly done for an adventure game...For an interactive movie.","October 22, 2015","true","9.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","6","8","4","0"

Taking place after the events of Borderlands 2 we are introduced to the two main and playable characters of the game. First we meet Rhys a handsome jack wannabe working for hyperion who has been screwed over for his promotion. Rhys goes planet-side to Pandora to find a way to screw his boss over and become the new star company man. Second we meet Fiona a stylish con artist and pandoran orphan. Fiona alongside her sister and mentor are working the con of their lives and events thrust Fiona and Rhys into a shaky alliance.\n\nIn terms of game play the game is similar to telltales previous series. In Zero Sum there's no exploration, its all a story driven linear experience.  There's quick time events for all the action sequences which usually require you to do a combination of moving left and right and then aiming on the screen and hitting the right button. The very few areas you have the ability to walk around there are a few objects to either look at and interact with. Telltales format of story driven point and click has at this point become a sub genre of its own and if you've played The walking dead or the wolf among us, you'll be right at home game play wise.\n\nAs is now common place in telltales style of storytelling the game is filled with choices for you to make that dictates future events. Your dialogue choices, action choices will not only effect the immediate situation but as players of telltales previous games know, it will effect events in later episodes. As Zero Sum is the first episode you won't see much in terms of the effects of the things you say but there's plenty of choices in the episode that will have an effect on episode 2 and beyond.\n\nComing into Tales from the borderlands I was curious about was how they would implement and stay true to the core series and its content. After all the Borderlands games are FPS, loot galore games and I was curious to see if any elements of the games would be brought into this series. Interesting while you don't use it much in the first episode your given a small glimmer into an inventory system. Through out the zero sum episode you pick up a few items but nothing much however I certainly hope that in the future episodes that we see interesting things happen with the inventory system and perhaps that depending on what loot you choose to use, that it effects the outcome of situations.\n\nOne thing I was disappointment with which I hope appears in the coming episodes was the lack of puzzles. There was ample opportunity for some good puzzles in Zero Sum, especially when Rhys tries to hack something with his optical cybernetics. Not only are puzzles a good part of point and clicks but I feel they could have been implemented in a really good way in the first episode plus it would have added some decent game play to boot.\n\nGraphically the game hits all the right marks, it looks and feels borderlands. All the locations are well designed and have great detail. I did encounter an issue where the subtitle text would from time to time go out of sync with the sound but its minor. One thing I was really impressed with was the UI design and how it fits perfectly with the borderlands theme. It;s got that futuristic tech feel about it that blends perfectly with the rest of the aesthetic which is great as many games tend to have a disjointed look between the two.\n\nThe story without giving any spoilers has been fantastic in my opinion. Story is certainly a subjective thing and what some people enjoy and think is good others don't. One of my biggest annoyances with the original borderlands games was the potential for good story but they never really went anywhere with it. Borderlands two's story was a lot better than the first but that was due to the introduction of a really good villain being handsome jack voiced by troy baker.\n\nTales from the borderlands story at least in the first episode is told retrospectively by Rhys and Fiona as they have been captured by an unknown bandit who is interrogating them. Not only is the story well told but its packed with borderlands humor too which is very entertaining. What the game does thus far is bring a depth to the universe that I feel was missing from the first person shooters. You will see characters from the other games make appearances too and its all very well executed.\n\nInterestingly enough personally I found more enjoyment out of this than I did the walking dead series. Mainly for two reasons, one, the walking dead became very predictable very fast. Going through, you knew that people where going to die frequently and to be fair I'm done with zombies at the moment.  Secondly, while there is established lore in the borderlands universe, telltale could go anywhere in the story. You feel that they have a freedom with the universe that they never had with the walking dead. It leaves you open to being surprised and interested in seeing the story through.\n\nOverall it was a good first episode. It did a good job of introducing the characters and setting the wheels in motion. I was disappointed with the lack of puzzles and not being able to walk around much. However as story driven games go, Telltale are quickly becoming masters at the art form in this particular format.","November 30, 2014","true","3.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Searching for endless wealth, treasure, and fame. Now you play as a cunning yet timid Hyperion "desk jockey", and a pandoran born swindler just trying to  survive.

You can count on one hand the number of times any of the individual episodes gives you direct control over a character. And that's not really a bad thing; it lets you take control over the things that matter most, which in Tales' case consists of some pretty great dialogue and enjoyable character choices.\n\nEarlier Telltale games were known - and sometimes criticized - for their branching paths. It's hard to know for sure, but "Tales" doesn't feel like its plot would really deviate too much from the choices you make. Which is totally fine by me - it's refreshing that every episode doesn't end up culminating in some "PICK WHO LIVES OR DIES" moral choice that inevitably makes you feel like a horrible monster regardless of your decision.\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is that "Tales" is a genuinely entertaining, funny and creative series, probably one of the best Telltale has done. You don't need to be a Borderlands fan to enjoy it, though it'll provide some helpful context to some of the series' characters which end up making cameo appearances. Each episode has at least one memorable setpiece moment (Episode 4's "fingerguns" is officially one of my favourite things ever), and for once the final episode doesn't disappoint.

This story has its comedic amusements but gets darker when it comes at the end, probably the ending. I wanted to keep this review until I myself finish the game completely. I dont regret the choices I made except I should've had Zer0 at the end (No Spoilers).\n\nThe music was absolutely beautiful, the right tone of genre and song for the right moment. Everyone played their role perfectly and the Loader Bot was the invisible main cast not noticed by all but was secretly there. It.... he was everything the game couldve ever been about. I couldnt ever shoot a loader bot if I had a choice in any BL games in the future. But aside from that it was an amazing game, must look into and especially if you have enjoyed Borderlands 2 then this is a must buy.","October 21, 2015","true","16.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Get yourself into a story full of nonesense, psychos, insanity, and intense moments as you accidentally find your way to a treasure long gone, many things will happen during that journey, but the question you should ask at the end is...\n\n\n...Was it worth it?\n\n10/10\n\n------------------------------------------------ Before the last episode\n\nSo far this game has been a great experience, thankfully i played The Walking Dead series before this one, so i know Telltale has a good record behind their games, the Borderlands universe sure needed a game like this, it might not be for everyone tho. If you like only the action and shooting of the main series then you might want to think it twice, but if you really love the BL universe and you'd love to see more of it, this is the perfect game for you, no doubt.\n\nBesides, it's a great way to pass the time while we wait for the next game, so, pack your gear and get ready because we'll be going back to our beloved Pandora!\n\nPeace kiddos!","June 23, 2015","true","75.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After having success with one style/genre/idea people sometimes overuse it trying to recreate the same virality with sequent games.

Tales from the Borderlands feels a bit like The Wolf Among Us, where you can actually enjoy playing the game, and your choices really do matter, rather than TWD2, where until the end, all roads lead to the same destination.\n\nPersonally I have never been able to get through Borderlands 2, I just lose interest after five minutes of killing large creatures with insane guns, however, this game makes me excited to retry the previous Borderlands games, and maybe even buy the newer one.\n\nEach episode is roughly two-three hours long, this game has a total of 6 episodes to be released. Value wise you're getting 12-18hrs worth of gameplay for $20-30, depending on where you buy it from. If you like to think of these games more as interactive stories, then imagine paying around $20 for a 12-18hr long movie. It's worth every penny.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is how slowly the episodes are being released, they're more focused on the TellTale Game of Thrones game, rather than this one. As three episodes have been released in the GoT series, whilst only two were released in the same amount of time in the Borderlands game.\n\nOverall this game gets a 9/10 from me, and is definitely on the same level as The Wolf Among Us, story wise. Comparing the gameplay between those two games, they have definitely innovated since last year, and created more interactive elements to their game.","April 14, 2015","true","11.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Tales from the Borderlands feels a bit like The Wolf Among Us, where you can actually enjoy playing the game, and your choices really do matter, rather than TWD2, where until the end, all roads lead to the same destination.\n\nPersonally I have never been able to get through Borderlands 2, I just lose interest after five minutes of killing large creatures with insane guns, however, this game makes me excited to retry the previous Borderlands games, and maybe even buy the newer one.\n\nEach episode is roughly two-three hours long, this game has a total of 6 episodes to be released. Value wise you're getting 12-18hrs worth of gameplay for $20-30, depending on where you buy it from. If you like to think of these games more as interactive stories, then imagine paying around $20 for a 12-18hr long movie. It's worth every penny.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is how slowly the episodes are being released, they're more focused on the TellTale Game of Thrones game, rather than this one. As three episodes have been released in the GoT series, whilst only two were released in the same amount of time in the Borderlands game.\n\nOverall this game gets a 9/10 from me, and is definitely on the same level as The Wolf Among Us, story wise. Comparing the gameplay between those two games, they have definitely innovated since last year, and created more interactive elements to their game.","April 14, 2015","true","11.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrpigeon/recommended/330830/","mrpigeon","MrPigeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrpigeon/","1112 products in account","Of all the post-"Walking Dead" series Telltale has done, "Tales.." probably strays the most from what could be considered a typical adventure game. You can count on one hand the number of times any of the individual episodes gives you direct control over a character. And that's not really a bad thing; it lets you take control over the things that matter most, which in Tales' case consists of some pretty great dialogue and enjoyable character choices.\n\nEarlier Telltale games were known - and sometimes criticized - for their branching paths. It's hard to know for sure, but "Tales" doesn't feel like its plot would really deviate too much from the choices you make. Which is totally fine by me - it's refreshing that every episode doesn't end up culminating in some "PICK WHO LIVES OR DIES" moral choice that inevitably makes you feel like a horrible monster regardless of your decision.\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is that "Tales" is a genuinely entertaining, funny and creative series, probably one of the best Telltale has done. You don't need to be a Borderlands fan to enjoy it, though it'll provide some helpful context to some of the series' characters which end up making cameo appearances. Each episode has at least one memorable setpiece moment (Episode 4's "fingerguns" is officially one of my favourite things ever), and for once the final episode doesn't disappoint.

While all these games are similar, I believe Tales from the Borderlands is the best one. It's obvious that Telltale acquired experience from the previous games and they are building on what they've learned. In my opinion, having played Borderlands 2 is a requisite to get the best experience from this game.\n\nSelling pointsBorderlands spirit\nThe game captures perfectly the spirit, humor, and aesthetics of the Borderlands series, something that it sure to please fans of the franchise.\n\nStory\nTo my surprise, the events unfolded in this game are not confined to a tiny part of Borderlands universe, and will impact the future of the franchise.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay wise, there is an improvement over the previous Telltale's games. You alternate between two different characters and the gameplay segments have more variety. It always boils down to point-and-click or button mashing in the end, but there is another layer to better engage the player.\n\nChoices\nThere are some choices that have important ramifications and/or lead to different gameplay sequences, something that I have found other Telltale's franchises to be missing. Of course, most choices only have a superficial impact of the story, leading to minor variations during conversation ,or the events play the same but with a different supporting character, but I've remained engaged all the way nevertheless.\n\nVoice-overs\nVoice acting is top notch.\n\nUnderwhelming aspectsNarrative disconnect\nWhen not controlled by the player, characters often take stupid decisions that always come around to bite them back later on, in order for the story to progress as intended. This is something that is common in all Telltale games, but it's worth mentioning anyway because it creates a slight disconnect between the player and its characters, as they are making decisions he would if he was in control.\n\nAnimations\nSimilar to other Telltale games, the animations are often a little stiff or they have weird cuts. At this point, it is probably a limitation of the game engine, but I believe it could use an upgrade.\n\nAdditional informationCompletion time (one playthough of all five episodes): 12h\nNo crashes and the framerate stayed at a solid 60 fps.","October 25, 2015","true","12.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Best games I've played in a long time, Tales from the borderlands is wow!  I deeply recommend trying their games, if you like great acting/storytelling and can live without a lot of action where you kill as in any FPS game or something similar. Then god damnit!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teh_pixelz/recommended/330830/","teh_pixelz","Hey, that's pretty good","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teh_pixelz/","146 products in account","This is an amazing game. This of course still follows the usual TellTale gameplay. This means you better like QTEs and the movie-game style that they use. This obviously doesn't appeal to everyone, but that's how it is made.\n\nThe story follows something unique to the Borderlands universe, so it might be best to have a general knowledge of the Borderlands universe-though I feel like only people who have played the Borderlands are going to play this. If you don't play Borderlands you can still enjoy the game, but it might (the story) be confusing a bit in some parts.\n\nThe way they inplement rarity and the loot system are really good. I wasn't sure at first how they were going to implement these things but they have done a really good job. There are little loot crates or hidden things which contain money, and then you pick up. There are also some chances where you can buy items (pr pick up items) of different rarity. I hope they will use this system a lot. (You could give the opportunity for someone who has saved a lot of money the chance to get something for only someone who has saved all their money; or someone who bought rare loot could have the chance to sell or use it, and only they would really have the opportunity to.)\n\nAs of episode one I am already really enjoying the story as of now. I've laughed a couple times or had a big smile because of how awesome some of the moments were. The characters are very memorable (IMO), and are well done. My only issue currently is that TellTale is updating as much as they said (4-8 weeks) and they have already given Game of Thrones an episode 2, even though TFTB came before it, which kind-of shows where they are putting their time. Other than that it is a great game so far, and if you like any other TellTale game and Borderlands than without a doubt you will love this game...","January 3, 2015","true","21.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You can understand the story even if you didn't play any Borderlands game before but you won't get some references but the story is pretty easy to understand.\n\nAlso this is canon to the Borderlands universe, so I guess the story will be important for the future games, this also means that Telltale is more free to do more in the game\n\nIf you want to buy the game, then do it. You won't regret it, but keep in mind, when you buy the game for $25 or less (sales) in Steam, you're buying the whole game, that means you'll get the episodes as soon as they come out. And also, this is not a shoot & loot type like the normal Borderlands games, so if you're thinking this is like the normal Borderlands games, it is not. It is a story-driven choice based game with a few gameplay. But the story is pretttttty good & the writing is neat.

This interactive story manages to incorporate some of the frantic action and chracters you know and love alongside new faces. It all comes together nicely and you feel like you are in the universe. The comedy is here stronger than ever, and the voices work well (not sure about Vasquez though, maybe because the voice is a little too familiar).

This is the first "Telltale" game I had ever purchased and I had a general idea that it more story driven than the other Borderlands, but beyond that I was clueless.\n\nWell all I can say is "WOW"!

When they say story driven, they really mean "story driven" this would have been a great made for TV miniseries. For those that have never played one of these "telltale" games, it's sort of like the old "choose your own adventure" books, where choices you make as the story unfolds effect how it progresses, although they are some button mashing action sequences, none of them were that difficult and were made to integrate into the story rather than detract from it, in fact you would pretty much have to try to screw up or not be paying attention to actually "lose".

As a fan of their Walking Dead game, I appreciate the writing, plot, characterization and especially the ways your decisions play out even though in the end it's a pretty linear game.\n\nThat being said, this is what other Telltale Games series boil down to: they're "Choose Your Own Adventure" books mixed with quicktime events and pixel hunting games. Go in expecting a FPS like Borderlands, and you'll be disappointed. Go in expecting an extremely well written, well acted animated cartoon series with limited control, and you'll have an absolute blast.\n\nLike I said, I just finished part 3 and I'm already dying for episode 4 to come out.

First of all AMAZING intros holy ****! The game combines witty comical humour with a sense of action and adventure. I can barely think of words to describe it. You'll find both of the characters very amusing. You might think it's going to be hard to keep track of the two, but don't worry it's not it give a couple of seconds to realize who you're playing as. The best thing about this game, and all telltale games, is that your choices will matter. Every choice you make allows you to have some sort of different effect. Whether it be dialogue, events, deaths, or some sort of wacky comment. It all matters and makes since. There is only one downside, and that's when you see a dialogue thing you wanna saw but the character doesn't say it how you thought he/she might. Other than that this game is absolutely AMAZING.

The art style has never looked or worked better, the music rocks, the characters are so easy to get attached to, there's awesome humor, and the effects of your choices are actually satisfying despite the lack of branching plotlines.

It understands the world it's set in and is as appropriately ROFL-worthy as a result.

The characters were fantastic and interesting, the choices were varied and felt like they mattered (making the game replayable) and the whole Borderlands universe setting (which I'm a big fan of) was very well done. So yeah all around this game is a very fun experience and I'd recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Borderlands or just a fan of these kind of games.\n\nJust be warned though, the game's only avaliable in english, and while this wasn't a problem for me (the voice acting is very good too) it might be for you if you don't maneuver well with it.

Telltale has really outdone themselves with this take on the Borderlands franchise. While it might not be what the gun-loving, fast-paced Borderlands fans expect, each episode of the series pulls you in with choices that shape your game. I found myself laughing, crying, and sometimes overwhelmed with how all my decisions, from the large to the small, affected my playthrough. The soundtrack in particular is fantastic, and I've already found myself humming or listening to each song on repeat long after I've beaten the episode.\n\nIf you're curious about this game and wonder if it's worth the price, I highly recommend it. Get this game, enjoy every moment of it, and enthrall yourself in the story you create. You won't regret it.\n\nWell, unless you buy that secret character in episode 5.

Probably because I really like the Borderlands IP.\n\nThe game does a good job at giving you the illusion of choice. As long as you don't think about it too much or have overly high expectations, you won't notice the rigid path the story is following. (Well, now you do!) That said, lack of choice isn't much of an issue because the story is quite solid. There was a major rewrite of the plot between episode 1 and 2, so those two episodes don't really flow as well together. Everything else is smooth sailing.\n\nWhile the engine is starting to show it's age with poor animations and finnicky controls, Tales from the Borderlands does have some pretty awesome gameplay sequences that put it several notches above other Telltale games.","December 9, 2015","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Expect a great storyline with amazing characters and important choices that affect how the story plays out. The only difference here is the 'Borderlands' addition. It basically means take a fun, explosive, over the top coop action adventure game with great humor and write an amazing story for it. Finally, add the well known Telltale gameplay to it and tadaaa you got a gem of a game! Tales From The Borderlands constantly puts a smile on your face and gets you attached to the characters within minutes which results in you being constantly eager to play the next episode in this 5 part series!\n\nIn Tales from the Borderlands you control Fiona and Rhys, yes you play two characters which basically allows you to play coop with yourself. Rhys is a Hyperion company man which basically wants to be the boss. Fiona is a con-artists which means she only talks to people if it allows her or her sister to steal money from them. Those two meet on Pandora, a planet known for its terrible inhabitants and thug lifestyles and this results in an amazing adventure together!\n\nMy short review of every episode:\nEpisode 1: Introductions, an amazing episode which immediately got me hooked to the game big time!\nEpisode 2: Sets up the main storyline, the least fun episode of the 5 which basically consists of a lot of travelling but and main story introductions. It does have a great cliffhanger though!\nEpisode 3: The main story continues with more fun on Pandora!\nEpisode 4: Things get really really awesome, best episode introduction ever!\nEpisode 5: Vault hunting! What else did you expect to do in a Borderlands game? A plottwist and an  amazing  climax battle!\n\nEverybody who likes Borderlands or its humor should totally play this game!","February 20","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

From start to finish, I've never felt that any episode was used for fillers. Every one of them always had something epic and kept the adrenaline running. It was an emotional, stupid, ridiculous, awesome, crazy, weird, painful, destructive, horrifying, bloody, funny and satisfying experience. The story wasn't rushed even with the small number of episodes, the characters that were made for you to love and hate did their job specifically well and the most important part, the choices actually matter! Even the smallest detail can change some outcomes. Everything was detailed and the fact that this game had big changes to the canon story made it even more enjoyable! They made sure to have the spirit of Borderlands in check every moment of the game. If you played Borderlands, buying this game is a must. IF you're a fan though, not having this game would be criminal. I absolutely loved every moment of Tales from the Borderlands and honestly, I can't wait for both Gearboxes' and TellTales' next game to be released.\n\nGreat job to both developers for making great games overall. In my opinion, this game would be a 10/10.\n\nPros\n\n-Great story\n-Choices that affect many situations and outcomes\n-Keeps the spirit of Borderlands alive\n-Every episode adds something to the story\n-Good pacing of the story\n-Great music\n\nCons\n\n-Glitchy animation from time to time\n-Loading at very important points of the story that ruins the immersion\n-Quite a few Ex-Machinas\n\ntl;dr Great game for a Borderlands player and a perfect game for a fan of the Borderlands series.","October 22, 2015","true","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Each scene had me wondering what would happen next and each problem and obstacle felt like a struggle.\n\nThe music is also top tier, Episode 4 has definitely been the best so far in terms of music, events, scenes and humour.\nThe villains and adversaries are also highly likable and sometimes you really feel spite towards them which is a great way to motivate a player to feel certain choices are much better fitting to act against certain characters.\n\nSo far one of the best games Telltale has made, up there with TWAU, TWD and Sam & Max.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadeball/recommended/330830/","Shadeball","Shadeball","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadeball/","130 products in account","Tales from the Borderlands is almost everything I hoped for when I bought it. The first Telltale game I tried was The Walking Dead, but I put it down after the first episode because I found it so dreary and downright stressful (every decision felt like it was going to get someone killed!). Well, that and I hate QTEs. Borderlands, on the other hand, is delightful, light, and hilarious for most of its 5-episode span. And I was happy to suffer through mashing "Q" for the story and characters.\n\nTelltales masterfully uses the Borderlands world even though the gameplay couldn't be more different. Several previous characters make appearances, to varying degrees of amusement and time. The spotlight mostly shines on the original characters, though, who are very well crafted and voice-acted. The player takes control of two throughout the game and I was impressed that the dialogue always felt 'right' (i.e. no confusing dialogue choices). I may have been lucky but I also really bought into the emotionally charged parts of the game and never felt like the characters were overemoting or that I was apart from the situation (except some excessive antagonism between Fiona and Rhys at one point). It's amazing how much can be conveyed on faces using the stylized animation.\n\nThe music in Tales deserves special mention, as it seems pitch-perfect for the game. I can't listen to any of the tracks without getting the image of a caravan flying across the desert out of my head- the music and characters are irrevocably linked for me now, and I bet most people who play the game and then check out a playlist.\n\nThe characters and their interactions are compelling with plenty of choices that can add flavor to the general storyline. The relationships feel real and, again, are done with a subtle touch that works great (and the game doesn't force you to like, hate or 'like like' anyone). Most of the villains are great (especially one we've met before) though the last couple seem a little undercooked.\n\nWhile the majority of the game delights in humor and light-hearted danger, the game does get darker in later chapters. The really bad things that happen seem to happen pretty much no matter what the player does; as I mentioned, choice in the game is more about the margins than changing the major elements.\n\n(vague plot discussion- not spoilers but skip these two paragraphs if you want)\n-------------------------------\nThere were some real gut-punches in the story. It felt like a departure from the earlier chapters but it's not all that different than the Borderlands 2 plot which got pretty dark later on (and in the Tiny Tina DLC). One of the best moments in the game is the reactions some of the 'bad guys' (like Finch) to one of these moments in Chapter 4 showing that even evil has a heart.\n\nI found that chapter 5 is the weakest link in the game, unfortunately. It's longer than the others but still feels rushed and like it's missing some content and character development. Several characters go from being in dire straits- emotionally and physically  BROKEN- to being fine in the next scene. Some just sorta appeared after being thought lost or dead with very little explanation. Just a lot of "I got better." I thought this was especially true of Rhys story which, depending on some choices made, really seems it's missing portions. In my playthrough he had a great arc up Hyperion (followed by away!) but the defining moment seems to be too brief and short. I would have also liked if he kept the physical changes he goes through instead of just going back to 'normal'. It all seemed gratuitous and the QTE leading up to it was a little much for no real payoff. There was also a second 'gutpunch' that the game attempted at the very end mirroring an earlier moment but it gets aborted and probably shouldn't have been there at all, as the resolution raises as many questions as it answers.\n---------------------\n\nIn general I think Chapter 5 probably should have been broken up into two chapters and included some transition between the lows and highs.\n\nAside from what seemed like a bit of a rushed ending the story was excellent, though. Other minor quibbles:\n- the 'gameplay' (QTEs) kinda sucks. That this is a 'minor' quibble speaks to the excellent nature of the story, characters, animation and voice-acting. I would love to see it improved but I don't know how they would do it without changing the nature of the game.\n- Athena seemed a little bland compared to everyone else\n- Some of Fiona and Rhys's antagonism when tied up feels forced and unnecessary\n- I guessed most of the plot twists (betrayals, etc) pretty easily except for the identity of the masked stranger. The game does let you 'call' people out at times, though, so I was able to at least tell people off just before they screwed me.\n- Eye scream! Eyeballs get ripped out using QTEs on more than one occasion. I'm okay with it (once was one of the funnier moments of the game) but... it's pretty nasty.\n\n\nOverall though it was a great experience and I'm going to start it over again to experience it and try out some different diologue. Geez, I played through all five episodes in a few days, now I'm going to have to wait HOW long for a sequel?\n\n\n--------------------------\nMinor spoiler:\nWhile I've seen it criticized for being a little derivitive, I loved that they brough Jack back the way they did. Not only is he an amazing villian, but in this game we got to actually go a little deeper with his motivations and thoughts. And as he goes along you learn a lot about the sadder aspects of his life including his killed girlfriend and, of course, Angel. I'm not sure how much there is left to build with his character but I do hope he returns for a sequel.","January 7","true","60.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you are a fan of the Borderlands stories, no need for second thought, and just buy it. If you are a newcomer, JUST BUY IT !!!.\n\nThis game has its ups and downs, mostly because it slows down really hard just before the climax/final episode. But mostly it's trully entertaining.\nWith the amazing Story telling style of Telltale and Gearbox combined, you have this Masterpiece that Telltale have ever released compared to their other releases, that is gloomy, sad, and depressing. Yes, This one can get you out of that.\n\nThe Characters developments and Decisions that you've made in this game is in no question really, really, really....good. With the ending of the game hinting at another Season of Tales from the Borderlands, or at least (maybe) a Sequel for Borderlands 2 (Oh God, I hope so).\nNot to mention, the Action Sequences through out all the episodes is pure gold, Especially the final Episode.\n\nThis game made me fell in love again with the Franchise, not for the fun of shootin' and lootin', but for the amazing, colorful, and Interesting Characters that Gearbox has made through out the years. I was kinda skeptical before playing this game, because how telltale is all about serious story telling and how it's going to fit into this franchise, but it Worked ! Rhys and Fiona became one of my favourite Borderlands Character off all-time, vaughn and sasha is inside my list of favourite side characters too. And yes, No one will ever look at a loader bot the same way after they played this game. Especially if you know Star Wars. Yes, Star. Wars. not that it matters.\n\nIn the end, I will give this game..\n10 out of Gortys Thank yous.\n98 out of Vaughn Abs.\n5 out of Vasquez Goatee.\n\nand also -1.\nBecause there is no CL4P-TP.\n\nBUY THE GAME !!!!","October 20, 2015","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The comedy in this was just genius and so, so witty which is what I love to see as a long loving fan of comedy of all genres. I know it went on about having 'great humour' but I imagined it'd be that dumb, stupid humour lots of people seem to love these days (for some reason) but no, this was great and borderline hysterical. Especially the character Rhys. He was by far my favourite of all these great characters and one I haven't seen in a game before. His silly, sarcastic and cocky personality was something you see in real life but rarely ever in a game. He was refreshing.\n\nWhat I also didn't expect was an epic tale of friendship and adventure. I literally thought it'd all be sci-fi comedy, but it was far more. So much travelling and picking more team members up along the way on this weird/interesting planet. This game really surprised me in so many areas and I'm so glad I got it!\n\nTelltale really didn't let me down... again! And the finale was incredible.

There are also a lot of connections to the already existing Borderlands universe and tons of appearances of known characters. The game provides a lot of action and humor and in my opinion it's one of the best Telltale games up until now.\n\nEDIT: I finished playing all 5 episodes, and this - for me -  is the best game of 2015.

This is the perfect game for Borderlands fans and just people who like hilarious jokes and really weird things. The things of which are usually kept in the background in Borderlands games because of the time being dedicated to trillions of guns and shooting increasingly huge monsters in the face is here used to expand the universe and make everything about Borderlands better.\n\nFor an exampel. I was supposed to strange some bandit. I suck at clicking the right buttons. So i failed. Of course i did. But instead of just retrying it, like each and every other game would when you fail. The bandit cheered me on. Telling me "you can do it! i believe in you". It was hilarious and i think it is what shows the soul of this game.\n\nYes Tell-Tale games are nothing but quick time events and walking around. And answearing a question here and there. But this formula is perfectly put to use in Tales from The Borderlands.\n\nI give this game a 9-10.\nThe graphics are beautifully cell shaded, Borderlands style. It brings back fond memories.\nThe voice actors are great. The dude from The Emperors New Groove is the badguy! That alone makes it worth buying!\nThe gameplay in itself is a bit lacking. I know i know, but honestly i can look over that just because of the fantastic rest of the freaking game!\n\nThis game is the most fun, unique and weird Tell-Tale game i have played in years.\nThe Walking Dead brings the feels.\nThe Wolf Among Us Brings the mysteries and the weird\nJurassic Park brings the Nope lets forget that one!\n\nBut Tales From The Borderlands brings the hilarity, the fun, the weird. It is a completely open world. It expands upon Pandora, Hyperion and everything else. I cant wait to get back to it and play the rest. I. Love. This. Game.\n\nIt it worth 23 euro? Well i dont really know. For me it is. I got it on sale. And i would say if it is on sale. GET ON THE SPOT\nIf not. Are you a Borderland fan? Then yes, do you enjoy Tell-Tales style? Then yes.\n\nThis game is Ducking fantastic.\nAnd they actually swear. This game has balls. It goes all the way. And you get a whole load of content for a very low price.\n\nBuy or not buy.

I loved it from the very first moment I played episode 1 and I just couldn't stop. I am highly please with the outcome of ep5, it was worth the wait. This game is very enjoyable, funny, action-packed, chharacters are amazing as well, and the whole of the game takes you into a new world of imagination.\nI can only hope (wish and dream) for a season two. It would be so wonderful to pick where the last ep left off. To continue and follow the stories and journey of Rhys and Fiona. This a very unique game that should continue especially since to take on the roles of both Rhys and Fiona to get their sides of the tales.

Able to strike a serious tone when necessary. Game plays like other Tell Tale games, which can be good or bad depending on who you are. It's a game that can be casual, but the structure is constantly pushing you to continue playing. The game was easy to play for anyone, allows you to pause at any time, regularly saves so you can exit at any time without losing too much progress.

Everything that drives you crazy or make you smile from previous games, or even you’re not Borderlands fan. The adventure spin-off itself contains great elements of scene, humor, violence, and characters.\n\nThe game presents strong characters and development even tons of supported characters will play major roles in storyline regardless on your decisions. I do love Fiona and Rhys. They’re funny and conflicted many times, but they have self-interest and purpose on their goals which add different taste on story.\n\nEach dialogue and decision is well-crafted and written which can lead you to an unexpected outcome. Thanks to Telltale games for implementation on great storytelling, twisted plots, and how it fits well in Borderlands’ universe.\n\nThe action scenes mostly involve on pressing direction button and short quick-time events. It’s fast and full of chaos. It’s actually pretty fun to watch although some are unnecessary and overused.\n\nHowever, I feel like the last episode is bit rushed in term of tight sequence. There is not much difference on choosing Vault team. Also, I’m trying to get close to point of interesting and the cutscene just interrupt when player reach certain area. The placement of script sometimes ruins player self-exploration. I also expect Fiona’s cash could play more roles on choices and inventory system could be manually used for purpose.\n\nTales from The Borderlands becomes one of my great Pandora tour. Not because of its title, but it has mixed feelings of experience and unforgettable taste of what Borderlands should be.\n","December 30, 2015","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It doesn't need to be that deep though, you'll be explained some things when playing. Honestly I was a bit uncertain if this is the title for me as I'm not big Borderlands fan, but damn love Telltale games and if that's what you're wondering as well, I'm going to tell you to go and get it.

Telltale has really outdone themselves with this take on the Borderlands franchise. While it might not be what the gun-loving, fast-paced Borderlands fans expect, each episode of the series pulls you in with choices that shape your game. I found myself laughing, crying, and sometimes overwhelmed with how all my decisions, from the large to the small, affected my playthrough. The soundtrack in particular is fantastic, and I've already found myself humming or listening to each song on repeat long after I've beaten the episode.\n\nIf you're curious about this game and wonder if it's worth the price, I highly recommend it.

As a fan of Borderlands, Telltale has absolutely nailed the look and feel of the original series. As a fan of their Walking Dead game, I appreciate the writing, plot, characterization and especially the ways your decisions play out even though in the end it's a pretty linear game.\n\nThat being said, this is what other Telltale Games series boil down to: they're "Choose Your Own Adventure" books mixed with quicktime events and pixel hunting games. Go in expecting a FPS like Borderlands, and you'll be disappointed. Go in expecting an extremely well written, well acted animated cartoon series with limited control, and you'll have an absolute blast.\n\nLike I said, I just finished part 3 and I'm already dying for episode 4 to come out.

First of all AMAZING intros holy ****! The game combines witty comical humour with a sense of action and adventure. I can barely think of words to describe it. You'll find both of the characters very amusing. You might think it's going to be hard to keep track of the two, but don't worry it's not it give a couple of seconds to realize who you're playing as. The best thing about this game, and all telltale games, is that your choices will matter. Every choice you make allows you to have some sort of different effect. Whether it be dialogue, events, deaths, or some sort of wacky comment. It all matters and makes since. There is only one downside, and that's when you see a dialogue thing you wanna saw but the character doesn't say it how you thought he/she might. Other than that this game is absolutely AMAZING.

From start to finish, I've never felt that any episode was used for fillers. Every one of them always had something epic and kept the adrenaline running. It was an emotional, stupid, ridiculous, awesome, crazy, weird, painful, destructive, horrifying, bloody, funny and satisfying experience. The story wasn't rushed even with the small number of episodes, the characters that were made for you to love and hate did their job specifically well and the most important part, the choices actually matter! Even the smallest detail can change some outcomes. Everything was detailed and the fact that this game had big changes to the canon story made it even more enjoyable! They made sure to have the spirit of Borderlands in check every moment of the game. If you played Borderlands, buying this game is a must. IF you're a fan though, not having this game would be criminal. I absolutely loved every moment of Tales from the Borderlands and honestly, I can't wait for both Gearboxes' and TellTales' next game to be released.\n\nGreat job to both developers for making great games overall. In my opinion, this game would be a 10/10.\n\nPros\n\n-Great story\n-Choices that affect many situations and outcomes\n-Keeps the spirit of Borderlands alive\n-Every episode adds something to the story\n-Good pacing of the story\n-Great music\n\nCons\n\n-Glitchy animation from time to time\n-Loading at very important points of the story that ruins the immersion\n-Quite a few Ex-Machinas\n\ntl;dr Great game for a Borderlands player and a perfect game for a fan of the Borderlands series.","October 22, 2015","true","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

But like all of the telltale story games there is always a distinctive feature, this one's feature is that you play through the perspective of two main characters instead of one (filled with the borderland hurmor of course).\n\nThere are twists, there are laughs, there are times of great bravery and times of great sadness or anger, it might become silly, it might become serious, and most importantly (I think) times of great badassery, from headbutting a psycho to defeating a great villain with one arm and one eye. This game has all the action a story telling game in the borderlands universe needs.\n\nI admit I have made some "questionable" choices in the game that I've regretted (not as much as mass effect) but that is the part of the fun in the game, creating choices that question your morals, decision making skills and ability to think laterally is what I love from this game. You might only play it once or twice (and you need some knowledge of borderlands), but it's worth it!\n\nfor a game on decisons and witty humour I give it a 8.5/10","November 23, 2015","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Probably because I really like the Borderlands IP.\n\nThe game does a good job at giving you the illusion of choice. As long as you don't think about it too much or have overly high expectations, you won't notice the rigid path the story is following. (Well, now you do!) That said, lack of choice isn't much of an issue because the story is quite solid. There was a major rewrite of the plot between episode 1 and 2, so those two episodes don't really flow as well together. Everything else is smooth sailing.\n\nWhile the engine is starting to show it's age with poor animations and finnicky controls, Tales from the Borderlands does have some pretty awesome gameplay sequences that put it several notches above other Telltale games.","December 9, 2015","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Probably because I really like the Borderlands IP.\n\nThe game does a good job at giving you the illusion of choice. As long as you don't think about it too much or have overly high expectations, you won't notice the rigid path the story is following. (Well, now you do!) That said, lack of choice isn't much of an issue because the story is quite solid. There was a major rewrite of the plot between episode 1 and 2, so those two episodes don't really flow as well together. Everything else is smooth sailing.\n\nWhile the engine is starting to show it's age with poor animations and finnicky controls, Tales from the Borderlands does have some pretty awesome gameplay sequences that put it several notches above other Telltale games.","December 9, 2015","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Play it for the story and getting lost playing the interwoven tale between two protagonists: a witty con-artist and a Hyperion company man.  I absolutely loved the character development.  It's short but well worth the time.  I'm a huge borderlands fan and the humor which was lacking from the pre-sequel was more than made up for in the Tales from the Borderlands.

The action is classic Telltale with Borderlands madness and ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious Borderlands humour (I wrote this straight after the finger blaster gun fight in Hyperion...it was a slaughter with 0% casulties)\nI wasn't kidding when i said this gets better episode, because you really start to care about the characters, besides Vallory there wasn't a single character i didn't like...seriously Ellie's Gorty's Robot is even cuter than BB-8.

First of all AMAZING intros holy ****! The game combines witty comical humour with a sense of action and adventure. I can barely think of words to describe it. You'll find both of the characters very amusing. You might think it's going to be hard to keep track of the two, but don't worry it's not it give a couple of seconds to realize who you're playing as. The best thing about this game, and all telltale games, is that your choices will matter. Every choice you make allows you to have some sort of different effect. Whether it be dialogue, events, deaths, or some sort of wacky comment. It all matters and makes since. There is only one downside, and that's when you see a dialogue thing you wanna saw but the character doesn't say it how you thought he/she might. Other than that this game is absolutely AMAZING.

If you're looking for a good story and this gorgeous Borderlands humor, you'll be more than just satisfied. But don't expect a real game, it's more like an interactive movie, worth its money. The replayability is high, cause some decisions will lead to new ways through the story. The only negative point would be the short time to make your decisions.

Not only it’s a pure Borderlands fun without the repetitive shooting routine but since those remaining Borderlandisms are now in the spotlight, they’ve achieved new level of vividness. Facial expressions, visuals, storyline, soundtrack and all.\n\nIt keeps the same old attributes: psychos, bandits, vault hunters, beautiful weapons but now you’re “simple” Pandoran / Hyperion clerk witnessing all the madness from the side and fights are kinda tricky for you. Quick-Time Events demonstrate that perfectly.\n\nNew characters are lovable: eccentric as always, a bit cyber- and steampunky. Trademark humor and everything but some jokes and cameo appearances will require previous BL experience to get the most out of them.\n\nI personally enjoyed it the same way I’m enjoying shows like American Dad & South Park to say the least. It’s no wonder they have Joe Swanson in their voice cast.\n\nAfter this somewhat nostalgic title you’ll may even relapse to shooting things at Pandora.

As a fan of their Walking Dead game, I appreciate the writing, plot, characterization and especially the ways your decisions play out even though in the end it's a pretty linear game.\n\nThat being said, this is what other Telltale Games series boil down to: they're "Choose Your Own Adventure" books mixed with quicktime events and pixel hunting games. Go in expecting a FPS like Borderlands, and you'll be disappointed. Go in expecting an extremely well written, well acted animated cartoon series with limited control, and you'll have an absolute blast.\n\nLike I said, I just finished part 3 and I'm already dying for episode 4 to come out.

It's also a pretty emotional journey, one where I laughed alot at the signature Borderlands humour before being surprised at how serious and dark things could become in the next scene.\n\nAll the characters are truly well written and ooze lots of charm: this makes it easy to get attached to them or, in case of antagonists, having a bone to pick with them. They also show a believable growth as the game goes on and your choices can shape the relationships between them.\n\nTales from the Borderlands is absolutely recommended both to adventure gamers and Borderlands veterans wanting to get more of their favourite series (albeit from a different genre): it's an outstanding title well worth the purchase.","October 22, 2015","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you like Borderlands, if you like Telltale Games, what are you waiting for? I'd definitely recommend it. (Based on episode 1: Zer0 Sum)\n\nThe game didn't quite capture my attention in the beginning, and I ended up only playing one chapter per time. But after the other characters (including the sidecharacters) were all properly introduced, that's where the game kicked off (for me). It started to become genuinely funny, with the characters' witty banter and the game's dry humor. Also, Zer0 shows up to prove that he is indeed, way cooler than all of us put together.\n\nThis game has given me quite a few opportunities to laugh out loud. It's an enjoyable experience which definitely earns its spot in my library when the vast majority of the games I own only end up making me sad.\n\nOne thing I did have to overcome in this game though: UNhearing all the familiar voices in this game. I could not help but roll my eyes when I heard that Troy Baker and Laura Bailey got the leading roles for this game (um, Saints Row, Second Son, Persona 4 and Shadow of Mordor anyone?) but I decided to get the game anyway because at least the two of them have great chemistry when working together and are just terrific voice actors. Other familiar voices in the game are Nolan North and Joe from Family Guy. (There's also Chris Hardwick but I've never heard him in a video game before and he's just doing a good job.)

I bought this thinking it's another Borderlands "game" as I was unfamiliar with 'Tell Tales' but I was not disappointed.\n\nThe story is perfect and is exactly how it should be. The characters suit the Borderlands genre and are funny, entertaining and crazy! You will laugh on the way and love making certain decisions that will affect the way characters behave towards you in the future, you will LOVE manipulating characters by siding with each side, and you will LOVE Handsome Jack!!!!\n\nEach 'episode' will last you about two hours each if you play at a moderate speed. Only 5 episodes unfortunately but I'm pretty sure they're going to follow up with a second season.

Yes, I used to be a Telltale Games skeptic. But already being a fan of the Borderlands series, I thought I'd give this game a shot, and I'm glad I did. I started Episode 1 (don't worry there won't be any spoilers) and I couldn't get over the fact that they got Patrick Warburton (is that a spoiler?) to voice one of the minor characters. I wasn't entirely sold until I saw the intro, which kind of took me by surprise. Although, I suppose it's to be expected since the game is episodic. Anyways, at that point, I was completely sold on the game. I just had a feeling that this game was going to be awesome. And it was. I would stuggle to list 5 things that I didn't enjoy about the game, and that's not just because I'm a Borderlands fan. Yes, the game is filled with heaps of references to previous games in the series as well as trademark Borderlands humour. But you don't need to be a Borderlands fan to enjoy this game. You just need to be prepared for a rollercoaster of a story (and an AMAZING soundtrack).","March 19","true","35.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mroosa/recommended/330830/","mroosa","frips","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mroosa/","223 products in account","I really wish I could give this a perfect review, but it is currently impossible to do so. Why? As with most Telltale games, Tales from the Borderlands has an amazing adventure story, but then then you also have to deal with the functionality of the game. Overall, I would still recommend the hell out of this game to anyone who wants a great story that takes place in the amazing Borderlands universe, as long as he or she is ready to deal with sub-par game functionality.\n\nThe GoodAs is the case with most Telltale adventure games, get ready for a well written, fun, thoughtful, and action-packed story. There is plenty of great scenes packed into the 10 hours (at least) of story between the five chapters. Telltale does a great job of introducing a ton of characters and weaving them into the already robust Borderlands universe without overwhelming the player or feeling out of place. The writing has the perfect blend of drama and comedy seen from the other Borderlands games to complete an overarching story weaved directly into Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. By the end of the game you feel for the characters and care about their actions.\n\nAside from some issues I encountered on my MacBook Pro retina, the graphics are pretty much the same as one can expect from other Telltale and Borderlands games. Pretty much everything is faithfully recreated in Telltale's game without looking out of place or introducing anything that wouldn't belong on Pandora (or Helios).\n\nThe BadIn my experience, the game broke three times during the first chapter of the first episode alone, forcing me to force quit and lose all of my progress since the chapter opener. Additionally, The game kept resetting to the default 800 x 600 resolution when in windowed mode, and would be 4x the proper resolution (showing only the lower left corner) when in launching in fullscreen. I figured this had to do with the MacBook Pro's retina display, but still, the only way to get out of it, was to switch to windowed mode (via Cmd + F) then force quit and restart.\n\nI also had some issues with achievements only working when online and connected to the internet. And even after reconnecting to the internet, the achievements that were skipped over would not activate like in every other Steam game. I had to go back and replay the missing chapters to get them to unlock. So beware, if you want the achievements, you have to be online the entire time, no exceptions.\n\nThe UglyAnd finally, the biggest issue seems to be similar in other Telltale games, considering they still haven't figured out how to properly use a keyboard in the game. Unless you are using a gamepad, your keyboard is only used for quicktime events or free roam walking. Thats right, no keyboard menu access and no keyboard choice access, only your mouse can can be used in the menus and when making a choice. Given that your pointer can start in the far corner of the window (and extremely far away on high resolutions), this means you will have a lot less time to choose your options as you sluggishly move across the screen.\n\n* As a small side note, it took three chapters to figure out W, A, S, D were the same as the arrow keys, which made switching between mouse events and quicktime events much easier. It was not obvious at first, as they are just arrows on the screen, which made it feel like you needed three hands at any given time to switch between all events.\n\n** Additionally, I played this originally on mobile (Android), and a second time on a MacBook Pro retina.","June 1","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm pretty sure Gearbox helped TellTale to do this, but the game manages to capture the true feeling of the Borderlands universe. The story is wonderful, filled with important decisions you must make to shape its course; the characters are rich and show a vast range of emotions, there's no stereotypical villains twirling their moustaches. The most deplorable ones have relatable moments and sometimes you get to question your 'heroes' motives, it really puts thing into perspective.\n\nThe dialogue is absolutely Borderlands-ish. The humor, the wit, everything is there and that's how you get the feeling of being in that universe without actually playing any of the games.\n\nIf you liked The Walking Dead/Wolf Among Us, and even if you're not a Borderlands fan, this game will certainly encourage to play of the original Borderlands games.","October 21, 2015","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beet_Bowl/recommended/330830/","Beet_Bowl","overwatch is the new black","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beet_Bowl/","94 products in account","I will say this off the bat: This game is more of an interactive movie than it is a game. Although it's geared to both Borderlands and Telltale fans, most Borderlands fans will be disappointed. There's hardly any segments where you can shoot people, and when there is, it's a bit clunky. After all, it is a point and click game. However, Telltale fans may be disappointed, because there's less interaction than say in The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us. I'm both a Borderlands and Telltale fan and I enjoyed it immensely.\n\nIn case you don't know, this is an episodic based game. From what I can tell, each episode is about 2 - 2 and a half our long, and there are going to be 5 of them. Using math, that means each episode costs $5 (not counting the Steam sales), which means you're practically watching a full-length movie for only $5. Telltale usually takes around 6 weeks to release each episode, but usually there's a huge gap in between the first and second episode, so watch out for that. You might want to wait until all episodes are out and the game is 90% off.\n\nThe story of this game is great. As I've hinted at previously, this does feel like a movie, and has the storyline of one. You play as Rhys, a company man who works for Hyperion, the big bad company if you will. You're a weakling, so if you try to be a badass it usually doesn't work, and the results are funny. You also play as Fiona, who's a bandit (and more of a badass than Rhys). However, both of the characters don't like to use guns, so don't expect first person shooter action. What I liked a lot in this is that killing people is more realistic than in the Borderlands games, so even a single bullet is lethal to everyone in your group.\n\nNow, the gameplay: there isn't much of it. Again, it is a point and click game, so most of the gameplay consists of walking around and clicking on things. However, there are a bunch of action segments (DO NOT use an Xbox controller to play this unless you want a really hard time trying to "click" things in life-or-death situations. The buttons are colorful, though.) This game does contain some looting. You can pick up money and other items which can help you later in the game, like buying different items. There are a couple of segments where you actually can walk around and loot cash and other things, which are interesting. It's a linear game, so you have a set amount of items you can take and use on a set amount of things. If you're a Borderlands fan, you probably won't enjoy this, because there's hardly any Borderlands gameplay here.\n\nOverall I loved this game, being a big fan of both Telltale's games and Borderlands. The story is great, the gameplay is interesting, and this time around a Telltale game actually felt like the 2 and a half hours were worth the 5 dollars. If you're a Borderlands fan, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're not looking for shooter action. If you're a Telltale fan, I strongly recommend this since it's Telltale's best piece of work so far, but there are less story-influencing interactions. Overall, I'd give this game a 9.5 out fo 10.","November 26, 2014","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, the same with all of telltale games, although the choices you make change the story sometimes no matter what you choice the outcome is the same which is disappointing.  Also the so called loot sytem that they tried to keep in fiona's quest was close to pointless as off this review.\n\nOverall i highly recommend you buy this game because it differs from the traditional borderlands games yet still staying true\n\nI give this game a 8.5/10\n\nJrm96","January 1, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The strengths of the Borderlands franchise was also more in its loot & shoot gameplay rather than its stories or its characters, which doesn't seem to suit it well for an adventure game. At the same time, while I am a big fan of Telltale's recent Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us episodic endeavors, earlier attempts at properties that were a bit more action oriented and less walking and talking like Jurassic Park and Back to the  Future were less than impressive.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised, then, when I came away from the first episode of this series with a grin on my face and a sense of excitement and anticipation for the remainder.\n\nThe game plays like the recent Telltale adventure games mentioned above, like The Walking Dead or Wolf Among Us. Unlike the early telltale adventure games, Tales from the Borderlands plays out less like a traditional adventure game and more like an interactive episode of a borderlands TV show. This may sound like a bad thing to some people, but I would assure them that it isn't. At least in episode one, this isn't a game about picking up inventory items and combining them to solve puzzles using some sort of Elpis Logic. In fact, there really aren't any puzzles at all. Instead, imagine a well animated and entertaining Borderlands miniseries, except you get to make all the major decisions and live with their outcomes, from how you treat a guy you are asking for directions to whether or not you betray an acquaintance. Most of the gameplay involves this kind of dialogue choosing or decision making, almost all of it on a timer. The rest takes place in rather well done quick time events that take place during the action scenes.\n\nA quick note on QTEs: I'm normally not a big fan of these, and playing with a mouse and keyboard I still don't like the whole "mash the q button" one. But, overall, they felt smooth and unobtrusive. For the most part, it consists of pressing a directional button or clicking a moving target on the screen. They make up a decent portion of the game, especially the climax, but I never felt particularly annoyed at them, and they almost never took me out of the game or its story.\n\nA game like that may not sound that much fun, and it might not be if the story and writing weren't so well done. I won't go into much detail on the story or the characters, but I found them to be quite entertaining.  The main story is told as the main characters are recounting it to a third party, giving them the opportunity to bicker about how things really happened, a trick that I enjoyed. The story itself begins as a heist which is always a lot of fun, and the writers know how exactly how to hit the beats of the genre to keep the story moving and for comedic effect.\n\nIn terms of comedy, while there were some jokes that didn't land, most of the game is pretty funny. I had a couple of laugh out loud moments, and there are a lot of little touches that made me laugh or smile outside of real jokes. I think the key is that, with a couple exceptions, the games humor either comes organically from the characters (often as a result of a dialogue choice you made), or from the nature of the world of Borderlands itself. It doesn't really feel forced.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the cast of characters that they have already drawn so far. While the they are a little cliché, this actually works to the games advantage, as it allows you to choose, through dialogue, whether you want to play them against type or to the hilt. This makes them feel surprisingly well developed for a game series that usually paints its characters with nothing more than some joke filled catchphrases. In the end, I actually want to see where the story is going, not because of the plot, but because I want to spend more time with the characters and see how much (or how little) of themselves and their relationship changes over the course of the story.\n\nAnd that is the feeling that I was left with at the end of the game- anticipation. I had a great time playing, and If I could have moved onto the next episode right away, I totally would have. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Borderlands, or who wouldn't mind a more light hearted telltale adventure game than the Walking Dead.\n\n\nTLDR: Surprisingly entertaining and well written. Recommended.\n\n\nA last note for those of you who don't know the Borderlands Universe: Given that I know it pretty well, I'm not the best person to talk to, but I think the game is pretty approachable to the initiated. As I recall, none of the major plot or comedic notes hinges on an inside joke or knowledge of the games, so you should be fine. Most of the issue will be not knowing what the planet is like and the kind of people who inhabit it, but given that one of the protagonists comes in as a relative outsider that might actually be fitting. If you wanted to do some research, maybe look up a short plot summary of Borderlands 2.\n","November 25, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Why not pirate it? I bought it, no regrets. When you buy this game you buy tickets to a movie series which you can interact with and change yourself. The continuation appears later on and each time you're left hanging wanting for more. It may be 2 hours but you can keep replaying it, changing the characters' choices which affect the story more than you might think. It has humor, action, thrill and great soundtrack. Yeah I could pirate it, get the same experience but to hell with that; these guys are worth supporting and if you're actually rooting for the companies that don't make ♥♥♥♥ games this one is a good start.","March 21, 2015","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beet_Bowl/recommended/330830/","Beet_Bowl","overwatch is the new black","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beet_Bowl/","94 products in account","I will say this off the bat: This game is more of an interactive movie than it is a game. Although it's geared to both Borderlands and Telltale fans, most Borderlands fans will be disappointed. There's hardly any segments where you can shoot people, and when there is, it's a bit clunky. After all, it is a point and click game. However, Telltale fans may be disappointed, because there's less interaction than say in The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us. I'm both a Borderlands and Telltale fan and I enjoyed it immensely.\n\nIn case you don't know, this is an episodic based game. From what I can tell, each episode is about 2 - 2 and a half our long, and there are going to be 5 of them. Using math, that means each episode costs $5 (not counting the Steam sales), which means you're practically watching a full-length movie for only $5. Telltale usually takes around 6 weeks to release each episode, but usually there's a huge gap in between the first and second episode, so watch out for that. You might want to wait until all episodes are out and the game is 90% off.\n\nThe story of this game is great. As I've hinted at previously, this does feel like a movie, and has the storyline of one. You play as Rhys, a company man who works for Hyperion, the big bad company if you will. You're a weakling, so if you try to be a badass it usually doesn't work, and the results are funny. You also play as Fiona, who's a bandit (and more of a badass than Rhys). However, both of the characters don't like to use guns, so don't expect first person shooter action. What I liked a lot in this is that killing people is more realistic than in the Borderlands games, so even a single bullet is lethal to everyone in your group.\n\nNow, the gameplay: there isn't much of it. Again, it is a point and click game, so most of the gameplay consists of walking around and clicking on things. However, there are a bunch of action segments (DO NOT use an Xbox controller to play this unless you want a really hard time trying to "click" things in life-or-death situations. The buttons are colorful, though.) This game does contain some looting. You can pick up money and other items which can help you later in the game, like buying different items. There are a couple of segments where you actually can walk around and loot cash and other things, which are interesting. It's a linear game, so you have a set amount of items you can take and use on a set amount of things. If you're a Borderlands fan, you probably won't enjoy this, because there's hardly any Borderlands gameplay here.\n\nOverall I loved this game, being a big fan of both Telltale's games and Borderlands. The story is great, the gameplay is interesting, and this time around a Telltale game actually felt like the 2 and a half hours were worth the 5 dollars. If you're a Borderlands fan, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're not looking for shooter action. If you're a Telltale fan, I strongly recommend this since it's Telltale's best piece of work so far, but there are less story-influencing interactions. Overall, I'd give this game a 9.5 out fo 10.","November 26, 2014","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I understand it's a point-and-click adventure game, but the interaction is at a minimum.

Here, the story takes place after Borderlands 2 which is great, cause it sets no limits as to where the story can go. And it does go places and drastically changes the world of Pandora by the end. The journey is full of humor and creative mini-game like battles(The last one is a must play, just for the experience alone.) As for player choice effect, while I haven't explored what other options will do, it's rather obvious certain events will occur no matter what(Major plot events), yet it does appear possible to influence npc perception of your characters(With regards to relationships and who "helps" at the end).\n\nThe graphics suitably match up with the style from the main Borderlands games and work to benefit as it's close enough to Telltale's usual style. I only noticed a couple texture flicker issues throughout my play, mostly with character costumes but it wasn't distracting.\n\nThe music works well and is the same as the Borderlands themes albeit with more of a soundtrack feel now. I did run into a glaring glitch regarding audio towards the end; some audio clips of voiceover and music failed to play close to the end resulting in some awkward silences. I would suggest having subtitles on just in case.\n\nOverall, I give it a 9 out 10.

It's listed as a point-and-click adventure, but this is a long way from the adventures games I typically play. Dialog choices have a time limit, and you can't save or go back to try a different option. If you don't pick something, the game just continues. I was pretty upset at first because essentially this is Dragon's Lair redux - you just hit left when the computer says left, hit right when the computer says right, click once or twice and you finished the game. But once I realized this was supposed to be more like an interactive TV show than a computer game I relaxed and enjoyed the show. It is a great show. The world is a wonderfully weird sci-fi adventure, a bit like Fall Out: New Vegas but funnier. When you choose the right dialog option it's completely hilarious.

Sure, it's fun, less buggy and true to the Borderlands series. Made me shed few tears here and there. But that's all to it. Like a checklist they included what makes their games great. Unfortunately, it lacks soul. Most of the time I didn't care what choice I would make - there are lots of them but with little to no context. Telltale should stop doing that good/bad type of characters - usually people just pick one type and stick to it. That makes most of the options pointless, cause you're are not going to go breaking bad in the middle of the season and that leave you with only one option to choose. The only "challenge" is to find what letter did they assigned to your prefered style option. It would be easier just to assign good options to X, bad to B, neutral to A and you could just go on without moving your finger. Making the outcome mostly the same for all of them does not help either. There is no places to explore - or if there it is you are limited to some casual go from from here to there in an empty environment - it wouldn't make difference if they just made it a cut scene. You could barely interact with other characters - no time to know them or even care what happens. It's like FIFA for choice based games - no innovation, just stick to  the formula and go with  the little effort as possible. I don't care if one episode has 50 or just two choices - if I can't remember the name of any of the secondary characters, then it's just bland. I haven't played GoT or Minecraft yet, but I really hope they are not the same shallow clones of this type of formula. Verdict: go play this game if you are TTG fan, but don't get surprised if you get disappointed.","November 22, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I will admit when i first heard about this game i was worried. I mean how could you take the crazyness of the boarderlands series and make it work in a five episode season. Well they did. I think what helped was it was a nice fun world to visit. I mean i loved all the characters and yes even the bad guys. The reason why was because they all were people you cold see in a boarderlands game. Besides with all the dark games they had out at the time, walking dead and game of thrones, it was nice to have one full of humor and crazyness. It felt like the choices i made mattered. Also the music was awesome and never felt out of place. I loved this season from the first episode and hopefully they make a season 2.

No point in sitting in front of your computer waitng and complaing).\n\nTelltale totally captures the borderlands atmosphere, and puts you in a game where you view it from a new interesting perspective.\n\nThe only major problem I can see is having Patrick Warburton as a voice actor for the Vasquez character (let alone any character). I know that borderlands likes going for a goofy style that doesn't take itself too seriously, but this character constalntly sounds like he's trying to make a baby laugh with 'googoo gaga' talk. aside from that the voice doesn't even sound like it's coming out of the on screen character's mouth, you can almost smell the recording studio whenever Vasquez starts talking.

It is pure badass, and retains the feel of the regular borderlands perfectly, and has adjusted to the violent world of pandora suprisingly well.\n\nAs with all Telltale games, it's point-and-click centered around dialouge more, but it feels far more fast paced in this, and meshes well with mechanics for combat. The graphics aren't anything different than other Telltale games, but match up perfectly to the normal Borderlands games, and so it feels incredibly real.\n\nWhat really shines in this is not so much the story, which is very good, but the characters. Every one is memorable and will make you invested, and seeing them become closer and stronger is an incredible experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theneomaster/recommended/330830/","theneomaster","TFX | Neo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theneomaster/","371 products in account","Borderlands is a series that puts heavy focus upon the whole "shooting and looting" thing, so some people might imagine that taking all that away would leave an uninteresting, empty husk of a game. This might be the case if the story and writing were on par with the rest of the Borderlands series, but trust me; it isn't. It's brilliant.\n\nIt plays similarly to most other Telltale games--limited time dialogue choices with a scattering of QTEs and adventure game elements, which are nothing special by themselves. So, Tales from the Borderlands relies entirely on a great story to make it work. And I can assure you, it deilvers.\n\nDespite the fact that Gearbox have handed over the keys to Telltale on this one, it hasn't lost its soul. In my opinion, the writing is exponentially better than any Borderlands game to date! It still contains the same sort of wacky humor that BL fans know and love, but it doesn't feel like it's trying so hard to be funny and seems much more well done. Not only that, but playing as a non-vault hunter who, although capable, has reason to be afraid of all the insanity on Pandora, shows the Borderlands universe in a new light. I absolutely love it.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game. If you're a fan of the Borderlands series and have enjoyed the stories in the previous games, Tales from the Borderlands is a no-brainer. If you're not familiar with the Borderlands series, it's still a great game in its own right--however, since it contains major spoilers to the ending of Borderlands 2, I would recommend picking that up first.\n","June 25, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not necessarily in gameplay (because, cmon, it's a telltale game, its an interactive cutscene), but in humor and quality. The only issue I encountered was stuttering after loading transitions, but only when I was recording with Fraps, so that's probably the cause. 10/10, can't wait for the rest of the episodes.","November 26, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I just finished all episodes and feel the urge to do one. It is difficult to describe my feelings right now. This game is just awesome. It is filled with humor, action and emotion. The characters have depth and you will learn to love each and everyone of them. I can only recommend this game. I had a great time and the 10 hours I spent with it are well spent!
