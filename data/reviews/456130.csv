Interestingly it requires Java to be installed. The game will tell you it requires Java 1.6 but that is no longer supported by Oracle and I’m not even sure you can download it. You’ll want to install Java 1.8, but be careful with the install. By default it will replace your browser’s search engine with Yahoo! You can turn that off but it is bit rude for them to default to screwing with your browser.\n\nThe game has 50 levels. You begin each level at a shuttle craft. On some levels you will leave the station using the same craft, but on most you will travel through the station to a second shuttle. Finding your way through the station, and collecting the additional red boxes are the primary challenge of game. You begin with a grapple hook which can be used to pull drums and boxes. When you place them on pads it causes the connected elements of the game to activate. This is all very clearly displayed with neon blue lines on the station floor. There are numerous doors on each station, some of them open when you approach, some require some action on your part, either placing a drum/box or interacting with a computer terminal. The game leaves you to discover the terminals on your own. They can be used to open doors, replenish oxygen, turn off lasers, etc. Like many puzzle games you can only proceed to the next level if you complete all earlier levels. This will mean if you get stuck on a particular level you cannot bypass it and continue. It is completely possible to get stuck in a portion of a station. The only way out will be to restart the level. The game automatically saves when you interact with an item in a useful way, so if you die, you can resume at the last saved position instead of starting the entire level over.\n\nYou play the game from a top-down perspective where your character is always centered on the screen and the station map moves around you as you navigate. The graphics are good considering the limitations of the perspective. You feel like you are on a derelict space station. Dangers are obvious at first glance. Some interactive elements, particularly the boxes, may be missed initially due to their subtle highlighting. There are spacewalks which are particularly dangerous because you have no control unless there is floor beneath your feet. You might be able to save yourself with the grapple but it has a limited range. In space, or an unsealed section of the space station you are constantly using oxygen and must be mindful of the amount remaining. There are numerous places to refill oxygen, and even heal your character on levels where it would be possible to run out of oxygen and/or be injured. Some injuries are instantly fatal, but it is possible to take partial damage and still survive running into, for example, a laser beam. The game uses a haze of color, audio clues, and a vignetting of the screen to indicate both lowered health and lowered oxygen. It is a nice implementation and helps with the immersion and sense of urgency. Although most levels are not timed there are constraints which require quick movement, such as dodging between barriers to avoid lasers. The game could not be described as a twitch game, but it is worth bearing in mind that the puzzles are not simply logic puzzles, you will be required to make quick actions.\n\nThe game is very nicely polished and while it does not have many settings it does let you lower the music and sound volumes independently which is something many puzzle games seem to forgo. The controller is fully supported, though I did completely hang my computer by clicking Find Controller when it had already identified my Xbox One controller. The controller appears to be the recommended way to play but I found I did better with W-S-D-A keys and the mouse. I have played the game both in front of a computer and in Steam’s Big Picture mode and found both work well. The music feels appropriate and has not gotten tiresome despite spending as much as 7 minutes on a level.\n\nI can easily recommend Space Scaven. While I am currently stuck on level 17 I sure I will be putting much more time into the game in the next few days.","April 12","true","3.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
