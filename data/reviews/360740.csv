Unconvinced that Downwell's shockingly fantastic gameplay recommended by several video game review publications at the price of three American dollars (or equivalent) is worth it.\n\nLet me tell you something:\n\nYou're going to make bad decisions on the video games you purchase sometimes, but that's okay.\n\nYou're going to look at something everyone enjoys, and listen to their recommendations to purchase that something. And you will purchase that something, and you will realize that it's not as great as you were expecting it to be. And slowly, you will eat yourself inside out over that purchase. Three months into the future, while you're sitting at a Subway eating a terrible sandwich, you will think: "Boy, that game sure did not meet my lofty standards". A year into the future, when you're looking at the classifieds online for a job, you'll think "Boy, that game did not take the prerequisite amount of time that I consider to be a good game." Five years into the future, when you're getting married, looking into the eyes of your significant other as the pastor reads the words that lead up to the kiss that seals your relationship in the eyes of your family, your God, and the law, you will think: "Seriously, what were the developers thinking? Am I on a planet of aliens or something? Why can't I find the video game that I like?"\n\nAnd you will throw off your covers in the night, fall down the stairs onto your face, screaming "WHY IS VIDEO GAMES BAD? WHY CAN'T VIDEO GAMES GOOD? WHY WHY WHY?" before you are carted off to the hospital, babbling about how the game that other people like isn't something you like.\n\nAll I'm saying is, you gotta take a chance. You just gotta.\n\nOr wait for a ♥♥♥♥ing Steam sale, you cheapskate. Just buy Downwell, it's good.","October 21, 2015","true","19.4"," 719 of 851 people (84%) found this review helpful 715 people found this review funny","84","719","851","715","33"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epilexia/recommended/360740/","epilexia","Epilexia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epilexia/","691 products in account","Downwell combines the never-ending sense of discovery of The Binding of Isaac Rebirth, the randomness arcade perfection of Super Crate Box and the extreme level of polish seen in Nintendo EAD most beloved creations with all the awesomeness and frantic intensity of Sega’s 90s classics. In the best Japanese game created in the last 30 years, that is as influential as the first Super Mario Bros\nWhen Shigeru Miyamoto designed the original Super Mario Bros in 1985, there was a true intentionality behind it of disrupting every single rule and convention to the date. The key to understand the design philosophy behind Super Mario Bros is the turtle in level 3-1. Until Super Mario Bros all in the Japanese games was about scoring, creating a small and enclosed world where every single element had a purpose.\n\nBut Shigeru Miyamoto realized that he wanted to evolve the games to much more complex universes. Worlds not being restricted to a single screen. So for him, the scoring wasn’t the primal focus anymore, being only a second layer in its design philosophy.\n\nWith Super Mario Bros, Shigeru Miyamoto had in his hands a perfect and memorable game for scoring purposes, an unforgettable arcade experience. But he didn't feel in the mood for creating games with restricted rules while he was working at the same time in its design for the ambitious universe of Zelda. So, he intentionally put a turtle in the level 3-1 that serves to achieve an infinite score, like a punk act of insurgency. A turtle that was destined to change the videogame history.\n\nAnd then, after 30 years of this murder of the classic arcade committed by Miyamoto, comes Downwell. That it’s not only a game so well constructed and that it’s so joyful to play as Super Mario Bros, evoking the same sense of magic seen in Miyamoto’s masterful creation. But that it’s also a game that like Super Mario Bros 30 years before, tries to revolutionize the Japanese industry turning it around every misconception and previous rule. In a certain manner, Downwell can be seen as an intent to reverting all the things that the influence of Super Mario Bros changed in videogame history. It’s infused with he same punk spirit of trying to break every known rule, the same spirit that we can see in the level 3-1 of Super Mario Bros.\n\nThe game starts as a declaration of intent from part of its creators, saying to us that they know Nintendo history, that they love Nintendo EAD creations, but they also know that previously to the success of Miyamoto, Gunpei Yokoi was a fundamental figure to understand the history of videogames. The minimal color palette used in Downwell has the same philosophy that can be seen in the creation of the original Game Boy, when Yokoi was obsessed with the idea of suggesting things and evoking a broad range of sensations, via the use of a limited number of colors to suggesting abstract shapes that the player needs to reconstruct in his imagination.\n\nIf Super Mario Bros was all about horizontality, Downwell centers its design in the idea of verticality. By looking at the original Kid Icarus, one of the most iconic Gunpei Yokoi’s creations. And the references to Gunpei Yokoi don’t stop there, as in the first level we can see enemies that resemble the original Metroids. But wen can also meet turtles that we can’t shoot, needing to jump over them. As if the developers want to say that they prefer a pre-Miyamoto world when the scoring was the most important thing and that they enjoy enclosed and simplistic worlds. But at the same time they also feel an enormous respect for the Miyamoto’s creations.\n\nBut with Downwell being a love letter to Nintendo and Gunpei Yokoi’s creations, the game also has a mesmerizing sense of action and a frantic intensity in its shooting parts that it’s on par with Sega’s mid-90s greatest classics. Sometimes, playing Downwell you can feel this particular Nintendo magic, of a game in which every design concept fits perfectly creating a captivating flow. But also this sense of enjoyment and almost hypnotic trance that you could feel the first time when you played Sonic the Hedgehog. Or some of the most greatest Megadrive’s action titles created by emblematic studios like Treasure or the Konami team responsible of Contra Hard Corps.\n\nThis Sega’s greatest classics feeling is emphasized with a brilliant synthetized soundtrack with some dissonant and noisy fragments that resembles Motohiro Kawashima’s compositions for Streets of Rage 3.\n\nAnd if Downwell looks at Gunpei Yokoi as a game designer, it also looks at Yokoi as the man making cheerful toys. Trying to be not only as fun as a toy, but also as easy to learn and enjoy as a toy. With a masterful control scheme designed with only 3 buttons in mind. Adding another disruptive note respect to Super Mario Bros. Because in Mario, with the act of jumping we ascend vertically. So it’s necessary to keep pressed the button. But in Downwell we’re most of the time failing, taking the brilliant decision of using the same button for jump and shooting purposes. Downwell has a control scheme so smart and intuitive, so precise and exquisite, that playing it becomes an unforgettable experience. One of these rare games that you can’t stop playing.\n\nAnd then it comes all of its masterful lessons in game design. It’s incredible how the creators have inserted so many variables in such a simple concept. Every enemy adds a new challenge and needs a different approach. Every weapon or item obtained in a random basis that looks at Super Crate Box, can completely modify the gameplay structure. You will never cease of discovering new weapons, new subtle and small details inserted in the structure of its levels, new tricks to improve your score. And the random nature of the game only increases this sensation of master class in game design. No matter its random structure, every single run in Downwell is perfectly crafted. Every element in its gameplay fits so well that you could not believe it until you play it.\n\nCave Story and La Mulana were two Japanese masterpieces, extracting its greatness from looking at past titles and creating gaming concepts by imitating the classics. But I think that Downwell is a leap forward from past Japanese indie games. Because it not only looks at an amazing period in Japanese videogame history, but also looks at the contemporary occidental scene. Taking its influences from creators and studios like Vlambeer or Edmund McMillen. Resulting in a title that is destined to lead the actual Japanese scene, being its main referent. And a game that will be venerated for future indie creators to come.\n\nDownwell has become the most influential and industry-changer release coming from Devolver Digital since Hotline Miami.\n\n\n( The writer of this review is not an English native.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/recommended/360740/","Dzumeister","zooboo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/","308 products in account","(Here's a 15 min. gameplay video for non-readers)\n\nDownwell is a vertical action platformer with roguelike elements. The game's premise is simple: you are a young person traveling down a mysterious well full of monsters and treasure. Your only weapon is a pair of ultra-cool Gunboots that help you by both slowing your fall and shooting up monsters. It's insane, and I love it.\n\nThis is the first commercial release by Ojiro Fumoto, a Japanese indie game developer. It's obvious that his game design has been influenced a lot by Vlambeer. It's got all the right ingredients: simple gameplay that's easy to learn but tough to master, the addictive qualities of an arcade game, and lots of screenshake. If you like to compare games, the best way to describe this is like a mix of Nuclear Throne and Super Crate Box.\n\nDownwell isn't an easy game. It's fast paced with a good variety of hazards and enemies to fight. Some can be killed through headstomps Mario-style, while others can only be dispatched with your Gunboots. There are 4 different levels with 3 stages apiece (as well as an endboss), and each of them have different themes that challenge the player. However, you can't save your progress at any point with checkpoints or files: you need to perform perfectly if you want to beat the game. It's not impossible; beating a stage will let you choose from character upgrades Nuclear Throne-style, and you can find different gun modules that change up your weapon. Like Super Crate Box, weapon pickups are a risk/reward affair. They all handle differently from each other, and you may prefer some to others so much you might skip some. The catch is that they will always give you an upgrade of either refilling your HP or increasing your max ammo capacity. Combined with a selection of 5 different playstyles to choose from, this game ensures that each run you have will be fresh and fun. Playthroughs usually last anywhere from 5 - 20 minutes, which keeps you coming back for more. It's perfect for players who like to invest their game time in short bursts while requiring quick reflexes and providing unique experiences.\n\nThe production values for this game are excellent. Eirik Suhrke[phlogiston.bandcamp.com], the composer of Spelunky's soundtrack, put together some amazing chiptune tracks. Uroburos, the first level's song, features some great Gameboy-like bass and a great catchy beat to smash monsters to. The music perfectly sets the stage for a strange but epic journey into the depths. It sounds foreboding, but it's never dreary enough to turn you away. Coupled with the great sound design by Joonas Turner of Nuclear Throne, this game feels extremely satisfying to play. His gunshots and explosions are full of punch, and every sound you hear else fits right in with the game's aesthetic. I almost wish he had made more sound effects for all of the monsters, like cries of pain as you stomp and shoot them into oblivion. The bitcrushed shrieks and laughs are sure to give you chills. The visuals are cute and minimalistic, sticking to a 3-tone color palette that still conveys all the right information to the player. Enemies are highlighted with a blend of 2 colors, while tougher ones stick out with 1 bold tone. Though they aren't highly detailed, the animations bring so much life to all of the characters. Everything about this game feels great, and it's nice to know that they put such love and care into the design of a simple game.\n\nNot everyone would like this game, though. It's really difficult, and it can discourage new players from the beginning, especially since there's no saving. The high skill ceiling might keep you on the first few floors for a while, so practice is crucial to moving on to the later parts. Some may find the pixel graphics unimpressive and hard to read because of the lack of coloring. There's other small problems with user interface, like a lack of personal control binding and no option to reduce or remove the screenshake. Some of the finer mechanics like wall-jumping, combos, and increasing max HP are left ambiguous to the player as well. You might complain that it feelsl ike just another mobile port from the lack of support, but fortunately, the developer has promised to change up the interface in future patches.\n\nStill, even if you're on the fence about playing this game, I'd recommend to everybody to get it. It might be the best game I've played all year, and it's only $3 and available on mobile. It has tremendous replay value and the amount of work put into it is very admirable. It's been applauded by many other indie devs (who have probably made some of your favorite games as well), including Derek Yu of Spelunky and J.W. Nijman of Vlambeer. It was made by one guy who lovingly paid attention to every detail and knows exactly how to design a fun game. It's a work of art that has simple but distinct mechanisms and a lot of moving parts, and once you understand how it works and how to best play it, it flows like music. I love it, and I hope you do too. It's definitely one of my favorite games of 2015.\n\nTL; DR: For fans of Super House of Dead Ninjas, Probability 0, Spelunky, Nuclear Throne, Super Crate Box, and good games in general. :)","October 16, 2015","true","96.3"," 44 of 60 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","44","60","0","2"

The idea of only being able to shoot down while falling mechanic is different when it comes to a rogue-like of game, it is an easy concept to grasp but tricky to master. There being many unlocks like screen filters and several character types really gives it some replayability. I find the game delivers for its price point and is a must pick up if you're into rogue-like games and 2D shooters.\n\nPros: Game is affordable and have replayability with achievements and unlocks.\n\nCons: Some pickups are super OP while another will insure a swift GG. Some enemies tend to swarm you in a goldilock zone where you are not able to dodge no matter what and must take damage, mostly getting cornered in doorways. Some combinations of upgrades can sometimes cause you to free fall in a situation where it is not called for due to chain reactions occurring in unison.\n\n\nIn conclusion I give the game a 8/10, you get a lot of fun for the price ;).","October 17, 2015","true","3.1"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","0"

This is one of those games that everyone highly recommends: it's cheap, it's easy to play, and it's addicting as hell.\n\nThe graphics are very simple, with multiple color palettes that can be unlocked by leveling up. The soundtrack is pretty good as well, but it never gets memorable. But the gameplay... it's nearly perfect: you keep falling down a well through different areas filled with enemies and side caves that contain shops and upgrades. And the controls are responsive and easy: when in the air you press the jump button to shoot bullets from your boots. This is the entire game. And it never gets boring, it is never frustratingly hard, and it is always fun to play.\n\nOverall, a really quick and fun game to play for 10 minutes (or 2 hours) a day that never gets tiring. Highly recommended to everyone.

Simple controls, simple graphics, and the campaign is a short 12 levels with a boss.\n\nExcept that you're going to try, fail, and try again multiple times before you even see this boss, let alone kill it. Not trial and error gameplay (Visual cues tell you what's up with pretty much every enemy in the game) but very challenging. Each of the weapons feel good in their own way, and so does blasting through waves of enemies. In a way, Downwell is a reverse shoot-em-up.\n\nPeople on steam like cheap games, but I would easily pay double the price for this little beauty.

Every aspect is carefully and artfully executed. Each component of the experience exists in perfect harmony with the whole. It is unique, addictive, irresistable, and an absolute joy to play. The controls are so tight and responsive that the mere act of moving about becomes fun. The difficulty level is punishingly hard, yet somehow inviting, with a well balanced skill-curve. Game design students should have to study Downwell.\n\nThe concept of the game is brilliantly simple. You get 3 buttons: left, right, and a trigger for your gunboots. You fall down a procedurally generated well, stomping/shooting monsters, and collecting gems and precious upgrades that improve your chances of survival. And from from this deceptively simple mechanic, a rich gaming experience unfolds, like the petals of an onion. Gradually, the priority shifts from just making it far down the well as possible, to doing it in style. Once you realize how the mechanics work, and start stringing together combos that in some cases can even span multiple levels (!), the game takes on a new level of enjoyment. This is the kind of game that makes you feel like a ninja once you get a groove going, bouncing from one enemy to the next.\n\nDownwell brings me to a place of gaming happiness that many recent games (even truly great ones) fail to even approach. If you appreciate 2D game design as an artform, or if you just enjoy tough-as-nails platformers with deliciously responsive controls, you owe it to yourself to play this game immediately.\n\nI consider Downwell to be an All-Time-Top-5 platforming game, even though the objective actually involves avoiding the platforms.","April 16","true","43.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Bought it because it was cheap but it's surprisingly addictive. The controls are simple, move, jump, and shoot. Where it gets more complex is the power-ups. You get gun upgrades as you travel down the well and power-ups at the end of each stage. Stages gradually get more dificult and add more elements the further you go down. I've only reached the third area so far but everytime I die it gives me more of a push to see if I can do better. The more you play the more you can unlock too, different game shaders, as well as different styles you can use to fight baddies.

Armed with gunboots, your character always is going down, shooting and stomping enemies in an almost non-stop pace. All levels are procedurally generated, ensuring a high replay value, and once you’re dead, you can’t continue.\n\nCosting only US$ 3, Downwell is an excellent choice if you’re looking for a cheap game with high polish that’ll provide lots of fun. Be warned, though, that this game is really challenging. That’s no big deal actually, because the gameplay is addictive and is very satisfying to perform combos (jumping from enemy to enemy consecutively).\n\nDespite a lot of players comparing this game with Spelunky, I think Super House of Dead Ninjas would be a fairer comparison. Like that game, Downwell is crazily fast and will put you on the edge, testing your reflexes and skill, all the time.\n\nYou might like this game if:*You’re looking for the perfect coffee break game, with short and fun playthroughs\n*You don’t mind starting over and over (you’ll die a lot)\n*You want an “easy to learn / hard to master” experience\n*You enjoy compete for scores and like challenging yourself to get better\n\nYou might NOT like this game if:*High difficulty and permadeath turns you off\n*You’re expecting the same variety as The Binding of Isaac. This is a simple game\n*You prefer tactical gameplay over non-stop action\n*Lots of unlockables are a must.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/360740/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","Downwell is a roguelite platformer that excels in its design.\n\nThe game appears very simple as it consists of going down procedurally generated levels with only three keys to use: left, right and jump (sadly not possible to rebind... at least both arrows and WASD can be used). While in the air, jump becomes shoot, and the character shoots guns from its feet. Landing allows to reload. Pretty straight-forward.\n\nAnd then, a ton of little details come into place. Some enemies can only be killed by jumping on them, some enemies can only be killed by shooting at them, and the information is graphically conveyed to the player through a color code. There are different kinds of weapons in side caves (the shotgun feels amazing) and different upgrades to choose from at the end of a level. Those upgrades add a lot of flavor to the game and change the tactical possibilities, such as rocket/fire jumps that kill enemies but also destroy blocks. Each set of levels is very different further down, adding new dangers and enemy behaviors.\n\nThere is a second system that allows to upgrade the character, which takes the form of shops that sell health and weapon charges (more charges permit to have more ammo while in the air, and thus to shoot a few more bullets). Health is very precious as there seem to be little ways to recover it, however shops always sell a few health points. Other ways to get health are  a slight chance while occasionally picking up a new gun, and there is an upgrade that allows to eat enemy corpses. And even that upgrade is not overpowered as it forces the player to take risks in order to touch enough bodies in dangerous areas. The health in shops pushes the player to actively seek out gems, which is the currency of the game. Gems obtained through a run also count to a permanent progression system, unlocking new color palettes for the graphics, and new styles/classes (such as a style with more health, but less upgrades to choose from). When a certain amount of gems has been reached, there is some sort of frenzy which allows the player to earn more gems for each enemy killed and new gems obtained keep the frenzy going. Similarly, doing combos without touching the ground has a chance to get health back. Thus the game subtly pushes the player to play better and take more risks!\n\nEvery little bit has been polished and it shows. The controls are tight and the character is perfectly maneuverable, the game feels great, fun and accessible while requiring a lot of skill to progress farther through the levels. The enemies and upgrades are all well thought out and balanced. Finally, the game is very cheap, so there is little reason to hesitate if you enjoy platformers with a healthy dose of skill!","October 17, 2015","true","6.5"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","17","29","0","0"

Instead of rewarding slow, methodical play, Downwell is pretty much all reflexes and timing - the game moves blisteringly fast from the beginning of 1-1 and never lets up.

And like the best platformers, it never feels truly unfair, though I will say that some of the powerups and weapons are little unbalanced and can definitely factor into whether or not a run is successful.\n\nAlso it's three dollars.

Downwell further compresses the "roguelite-like" formula of games like Spelunky and Nuclear Throne for into a twitchy three-colour coffee-break game of fast decisions.\n\nIt's all about descending through vertical platformer maps, and considers the challenges of that in its design.\nShooting your "gunboots", meant to attack enemies below you, also slows your fall, so you can always give yourself time to react.  Despite being about blind jumps and randomly generated, Downwell is fair, and your causes of death will be greed and mismanagement.\nScoring combos and going fast feels a lot more satisfying, but slow is safe, because you can't directly attack enemies that end up above you.\n\nRandom upgrades to choose from make every round different and can make you quite powerful.  The game's fast-paced, but not to the extent of being exhausting. It's fun to learn and there's quite some nuance to the way you move.\n\nOverall, Downwell is well-made, such long-lasting fun and also really cheap.\nI highly recommend it.","February 9","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If that sounds fun to you, go nuts because this game is absolutely fun. The gameplay is incredibly fast, slick, and smooth. And the constant sense of falling is both something you can control but something you can equally be scared about since you don't know what's coming, but the camera is focused with you right in the middle, so nothing ever comes up unexpectedly that you can't handle.\n\nThe upgrade system works very well. As you play, you can unlock new styles and palettes. I didn't really do much with the palettes, but you can find that one style that really suits how you play and can really shine in this game (my favorites were "Boulder" and "Levitate").\n\nThere are some smaller flaws, such as the random perk and shop selections. Like you'll be really hoping for something good, and all three perks are garbage or the shop has no HP for sale. And oftentimes certain red enemies can wreck you out of nowhere, but that's really my fault instead of theirs.\n\nUltimately, Downwell is a game for people who don't care about graphics, but about really, really, really, really, really good gameplay. Everything is fun, fast-paced, and addicting. And the only thing that will ever stop you... is upgrading to Windows 10.\n\nThanks, Microsoft!","February 3","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals are simple, but for a game like this, they don't need to be amazing. The soundtrack is also great. As a note however, I recommend turning off sticky keys, otherwise the shift key (the button that fires your gun boots) will be the bane of you, possibly.

You could say that it's "Easy to learn, hard to master". I would deffinitly recomment this game.\n\nI can't really do a good "Pros & Cons" but I can tell you what I like about the game and what some may not like about it. I love the concept, its a vertical arcade style shooter in which you're a man blob thing that can float and has guns on his boots and eats ghosts, if you have the right upgrade. Some may not like the 8Bit style graphics but I think it does the game well. There are different "Styles" that you can choose to play with that each let you play in a slightly different way.\n\nIts a very quick-paced game, if you can't quickly design whether you can stomp on something and take damage or not then you will find this game to be your arch nemesis.

What makes the game fun is its simplicity. Your goal is to reach the bottom of a well, and through use of your gun boots, you can more easily navigate your way around the various enemies in the well. The visuals are simple, but for a game like this, they don't need to be amazing. The soundtrack is also great. As a note however, I recommend turning off sticky keys, otherwise the shift key (the button that fires your gun boots) will be the bane of you, possibly. On top of that, there are a,so various unlockables, mostly palette swaps, but still, you are awarded for playing the game a lot.

It came out of nowhere, showed up costing way less than it deserves, and is a very solid roguelike platforming experience. With 4 worlds and a surprise at the end, it keeps me returning to play again and again.\n\nIt looks very simple, with a three color palette, but you can soon customize this in a variety of ways. There are several playing styles to unlock as well, to suit your own.\n\nIt's not simple at all. There are a ton of systems in the game and decisions to make, more than you realize at first, and as time goes on you will make these reflexively based on what works best for you. You have to manage your downward velocity, either by bouncing off certain enemies or firing your weapon. Based on your weapon and energy, you need to decide how fast you want to fire. Based on the color and behavior of the enemies, you have to decide whether to bounce off them, shoot from a distance, or run the hell away. Do those enemies leave corpses, and can you do anything with those? Will you avoid hits and try to get yourself more maximum HP with extra food and weapons, or will you focus on getting extra energy? And, if the floor goes away for a while and you're running low on ammo, what then?\n\nIn every other platformer game, I hate pits. I find the concept anger inducing, making you suffer for issues you can't even see. But in this game, you have complete control. Sure, you're falling down a very long well, sort of an endless pit... but you're taking control of your life while you do so.\n\nI wouldn't want to play this on anything but a keyboard or a controller, the controls are good but I wouldn't trust anything needing this kind of speed and accuracy on a phone or tablet.\n\nIf you like a challenge, buy this game. It's not easy, but it's not impossible. And it's a lot of fun. And if you're a real glutton for punishment and find the game too easy, there's a hard mode you can unlock.","November 14, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I've enjoyed my time on it.  The whole strategy of the game is that you want to fall to the bottom without hitting the enemies.  There are platforms while you are falling, but there are also enemies.  You can stomp on certain enemies to kill them (like Goombas).  You also have a gun which shoots bullet below you, stopping your fall and letting you get your bearings.\n\nI bought this for 1.99 and have certainly gotten my money's worth.  At 2.99, it's kind of an iffy buy, as most people I assume will play just a few hours of it.  It's certainly difficult (not Super Hexagon difficult) though and you will probably take awhile to beat all four stages of the game (I've got about 10 hours or so on my game and I've yet to win the game.)\n\nThere is also a hard mode for once you beat the entire game.

Who knows. Perhaps the better question is why you decided to sleep with your gunboots on in the first place (doesn't seem safe, but neither does jumping down a well. Whatever).\n\nNow that we have the bulk of the story out of the way, Downwell is a retro-style (pixel art) game where you're falling down a procedurally-generated well with only your "gunboots" to protect you.\n\nWhile the concept of dodging objects/creatures while falling isn't particularly new, Downwell's mechanics make this game unique and worthwhile. The gunboots have a limited charge that refills everytime you land on something (enemy, ground, object). The gunboots the dual purpose of destroying things and slowing your descent, allowing you to somewhat navigate through the obstacles.\n\nIf the increasingly large, diverse number of enemies and traps don't keep you entertained for awhile, Downwell has a variety of content that adds to the replayability.\n-  The gunboot upgrades grant you some variety, including: Shotgun, Machinegun, Burst, Laser, etc.\n-  Random caves where time is frozen - contain bonuses like gunboot upgrades, gems, health recovery, etc.\n-  A shopkeeper that exchanges gems for items that increase your health or max gunboot charge.\n-  Different color pallettes are unlockable by collecting gems, including: VBOY (all red), Nuclear (green), etc.\n-  Different starting stats (gameplay styles) unlockable by collecting gems.\n-  Randomized upgrades after you complete a section of the well, including: Drones, exploding corpses, and heart balloons.\n\nOverall, Downwell is a very, very well-made game with a lot of replayability.\nThe only drawbacks are: it's hard (that's a given) and it gets tedious/repetitive if you play it for a few hours straight, but it's fun again after a short break. :)","May 8","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

I don't yet know if it will prove to have the staying power of a Spelunky or a Binding of Isaac (I mean, it won't, but maybe close, dunno!), but look at whatever my playtime is for an indicator of that. And for $3, this game is more than worth the price if you like roguelites/roguelikelikes. It's been a while since I played something that was simply so much visceral fun condensed into such a small but elegant package.\n\nIt's a platformer sort of roguelite, only, as you can see, you platform downward, with various upgrades for your gunboots laying around and a Nuclear Throne style choice of upgrades when you complete a level. It is very action-packed and fastpaced... sort of. There are a lot of times where you are very capable of taking things slow and scoping things out, but once you accidentally trigger a bat that flies down at you, well, you can't shoot up generally, so all hell immediately breaks loose. And gets you in more fun-as-all-hell trouble.\n\nIt's very fun.\n\nUPDATE: I just got to the boss accidentally and unexpectedly, with a large degree of luck, while experimenting with a combo-focused, completely not cautious playstyle and build, at a bit over 5 hours in.

It also uses procedural generation nicely, making each run somewhat different so that it's not a matter of memorization, while avoiding the pitfalls of boring or obnoxious auto-generated content - I didn't run into any in the three hours I've spent with the game.\n\nMuch like old action games, it's also not all that long - only 12 short levels and then a boss fight - but it's rather heavy on replay value with all of the times you'll die before making progress. There's also a hard mode you can unlock once you've beaten the final boss once, which makes shops more expensive and fills the levels with more enemies, including a new variety or two on each set of levels. Especially considering how inexpensive it is, I recommend Downwell to anyone who liked the simpler action games of the early console eras, or people who like "roguelike-like" action games in general.\n\nEDIT: I beat the game and unlocked hard mode so I figured I'd edit its description into my review.","October 18, 2015","true","4.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The only thing this game needs is more content, but because it only costs 3€, that isn't meant as criticism. This game is so addicting and satisfying to play, the sound design is especially great. Also the upgrades you can choose from after every stage are all useful and fun, which isn't the norm with rouge-lites these days. The unlocks you get from your playthroughs are a bit dissapointing, especially the color palettes which just change up the colors a bit and probably weren't even a huge effort for the developer. If the game had a ton more upgrades, they could lock some of them away as unlocks, which not only rewards every single run, it also motivates new playthroughs. I think when you beat the final boss you unlock a "hard mode", but that's about it.\nDownwell is small, simple, it doesn't try to do much, but what it wants to do it does exceptionally well.\nI hope there will be a big expansion for this game, with tons more upgrades to choose from, more levels, more unlocks, different game modes, and of course more weapons. It would be cool if you could also upgrade the weapons or something like that.

In general, I like getting 1 hour per dollar spent on games. For Downwell, that'd equate to three hours of playtime.\n\nWhile I presently haven't reached that point yet, I expect I'll be getting more than my money's worth out of this game, and so do recommend it overall. That said, no game is perfect, so if you'd like to get into the nitty-gritty of the game, keep reading.\n\nLike many Roguelikes, Downwell has an itemization system and a bit of a character development system, along with varying characters known as "Styles". The most intriguing of these systems is the itemization one. While most other Roguelikes tend to have some overlap between their item pools (or only pull from one pool) (i.e., Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac, etc.) Downwell has a separate item pool for its shops, caves (side areas that grant a weapon and/or health/ammo), and end-of-level rewards. That is to say, you cannot buy a weapon or passive upgrade from a shop, nor can you obtain shop-upgrades when you complete a level. This introduces a fairly restrictive system overall for character development and, I believe, cuts into the game's overall longevity, as you run into the same types of items in the same places, rather than mixing things up and keeping it random.\n\nThe items themselves are mostly good, however Downwell fits right into the mold of Roguelikes in having a few items that are simply crap. Think Spike Strips from RoR, or The Poop in BoI.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, Downwell is very fast-paced, which is a huge plus for me but may not be appealling to others. Between combos, precision jumping, the Gunboots, and using all of these things at once, a player can (and will need to) be quite active in the game. Unfortunately, some of the hitboxes are in my opinion somewhat wonky, for lack of a better word. Sometimes I'll be able to kill an enemy by hitting them diagonally, other times I'll take damage. Also, there is no enemy/player overlap prevention, meaning that enemies can stack on top of each other (leading to very confusing situations; for instance, an enemy which can only be killed with the Gunboots may be ontop of an enemy invulnerable to Gunboots) and that enemies can stack on top of YOU (leading to situations in which you may take more damage than you should because that one flying enemy followed you around during your retreat). In this vein, the collision of the Gunboots blasts is also a little funky. You cannot shoot enemies that are slightly overlapping you, leaving you very vulnerable in those situations, and many Gunboots weapon types are not especially accurate (even with the accuracy upgrade). Downwell is heavily precision-oriented, but given how much irregularity there is in collision detection for entities/bullets, the required precision of Downwell often becomes a nuisance. Hopefully this can be fixed/adjusted overtime with patches.\n\nOverall, I recommend and enjoy Downwell and look forward to playing it more. I can easily see myself investing 20-40 hours into this game, which, for a $3 price tag, is a steal.","October 20, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

It also uses procedural generation nicely, making each run somewhat different so that it's not a matter of memorization, while avoiding the pitfalls of boring or obnoxious auto-generated content - I didn't run into any in the three hours I've spent with the game.\n\nMuch like old action games, it's also not all that long - only 12 short levels and then a boss fight - but it's rather heavy on replay value with all of the times you'll die before making progress. There's also a hard mode you can unlock once you've beaten the final boss once, which makes shops more expensive and fills the levels with more enemies, including a new variety or two on each set of levels. Especially considering how inexpensive it is, I recommend Downwell to anyone who liked the simpler action games of the early console eras, or people who like "roguelike-like" action games in general.\n\nEDIT: I beat the game and unlocked hard mode so I figured I'd edit its description into my review.","October 18, 2015","true","4.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

One of which results in very addictive gameplay.\n\nIn the vain of Super House of Dead Ninja's; the game is given to you in bite sized chunks. Testing you in on-the-fly problem solving through its very fast bouncing mechanic. Which is extremely rewarding. Granting the player bonus gems ( currency/points ), health boosts and just an awesome feeling of accomplishment.\nI won't bother going to far into to detail as the game is fairly self explanatory based on the trailer video within the store front. I will say that while very easy to pick up, it is an extremely skill based and deep game. One that offers a very nice skill curve that I myself am still exploring.\n\nMuch like S.H.o.D.N/ Luftrausers; the game is brimming with highly addictive replayablity for arcade and rogue-like junkies.\nAlso: It's ♥♥♥♥ing $2.99.

In general, I like getting 1 hour per dollar spent on games. For Downwell, that'd equate to three hours of playtime.\n\nWhile I presently haven't reached that point yet, I expect I'll be getting more than my money's worth out of this game, and so do recommend it overall. That said, no game is perfect, so if you'd like to get into the nitty-gritty of the game, keep reading.\n\nLike many Roguelikes, Downwell has an itemization system and a bit of a character development system, along with varying characters known as "Styles". The most intriguing of these systems is the itemization one. While most other Roguelikes tend to have some overlap between their item pools (or only pull from one pool) (i.e., Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac, etc.) Downwell has a separate item pool for its shops, caves (side areas that grant a weapon and/or health/ammo), and end-of-level rewards. That is to say, you cannot buy a weapon or passive upgrade from a shop, nor can you obtain shop-upgrades when you complete a level. This introduces a fairly restrictive system overall for character development and, I believe, cuts into the game's overall longevity, as you run into the same types of items in the same places, rather than mixing things up and keeping it random.\n\nThe items themselves are mostly good, however Downwell fits right into the mold of Roguelikes in having a few items that are simply crap. Think Spike Strips from RoR, or The Poop in BoI.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, Downwell is very fast-paced, which is a huge plus for me but may not be appealling to others. Between combos, precision jumping, the Gunboots, and using all of these things at once, a player can (and will need to) be quite active in the game. Unfortunately, some of the hitboxes are in my opinion somewhat wonky, for lack of a better word. Sometimes I'll be able to kill an enemy by hitting them diagonally, other times I'll take damage. Also, there is no enemy/player overlap prevention, meaning that enemies can stack on top of each other (leading to very confusing situations; for instance, an enemy which can only be killed with the Gunboots may be ontop of an enemy invulnerable to Gunboots) and that enemies can stack on top of YOU (leading to situations in which you may take more damage than you should because that one flying enemy followed you around during your retreat). In this vein, the collision of the Gunboots blasts is also a little funky. You cannot shoot enemies that are slightly overlapping you, leaving you very vulnerable in those situations, and many Gunboots weapon types are not especially accurate (even with the accuracy upgrade). Downwell is heavily precision-oriented, but given how much irregularity there is in collision detection for entities/bullets, the required precision of Downwell often becomes a nuisance. Hopefully this can be fixed/adjusted overtime with patches.\n\nOverall, I recommend and enjoy Downwell and look forward to playing it more. I can easily see myself investing 20-40 hours into this game, which, for a $3 price tag, is a steal.","October 20, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

For example, it's very clear from the visuals which enemies you can jump on safely, and your character usually ends up making the exact movements you want, even when they're very precise. And the whole game is presented without any tutorial, instead you just learn a bit more of the mechanics and strategies each time you play, and there's a surprising amount of nuance to them. There's choices in how you upgrade your character, how you spend the gems you collect, rewards for completing combos, what types of power ups you go for, etc. and each time you play, you're motivated to try something different, or do better at what you tried last time. The graphics may look primitive, but they're excellent at conveying information. Colors and shapes are used effectively to highlight different types of objects, and even at high speeds, you can see things clearly. The sound effects are also very distinct, and provide helpful feedback.\n\nI'd like to go for all the achievements, but the last 3 might be too hard, we shall see. Maybe I can do it.\n\nOverall Downwell has an amazingly rewarding feeling of improving your skills. At first I looked at the achievements and felt that they would be way too hard, but after a few hours of practice, most of them became easy.\n\nFor people who like this style of skill-based game, I'd say it's perfect.

If gunboots doesn't have you sold right away, I'm not sure anything else will.\n\nDownwell is a platforming shooter where you'll spend most of your time descending deep down into said well, encountering enemies that you either have to stomp on or shoot while collecting gems to buy power-ups. As you descend through the procedurally generated levels you'll come across throngs of enemies that can be shot, stomped or have an invulnerability to one or the other. Your gunboots start off as a basic little pea shooter with a small magazine, but stomping something, like an enemy or torch, or landing on solid ground will reload your magazine, though reloading can also be achieved through upgrades awarded to you upon level completion (which I'll get to shortly). The graphics lend themselves quite nicely to the fast paced nature of the game, their chunky Commodore 64 style allows you to see incoming obstacles clearly and react accordingly, since enemies are easily discernable between one another, and the color scheme only further helps differentiate what's bad and what's safe. For example, the default color palette has your character and stompable enemies colored solid white, while gems and hazardous things to touch are colored a stark red in contrast. This means that even when you reach new level sets with new hazards, it's quite easy to deduce what can or cannot be stomped, like sharp coral or fiery ghosts. You can unlock more palettes upon death or game completion when your collected gems are tallied up towards a milestone goal, but many of the color schemes are horrifically garish, some of them downright painful to look at.\n\nYour character's movement is borderline perfect with enough loose floatiness to your jumps, while firing your gunboots provides sharp, sudden control when needing to redirect yourself in a hurry. You'll come across side rooms during your descent which will contain either a shop to spend your gems for health and extra gunboot magazine charges, a room with a pile of gems for the taking, or a room that contains gun modules that will give you a point of health or some charges in addition to changing your gun type. There are a handful of gun types that you can obtain but you can only use one at a time, ranging from a beefy machine gun to a vicious laser which can grow stronger if you collect enough gems to reach a 'gem high', a multiplier/enhanced character state where your gunboots are super charged, doing more damage and having larger bullets depending on the weapon currently equipped. Each gun type also has different attributes for the kickback received, jolting you up which can often mean the difference between stomping an enemy and taking damage. You can also go for combos, where you're rewarded with bonus gems, health and charges for killing multiple enemies in a row without landing on solid ground - excluding ground connected to a side room. Then there are upgrades you can choose from at the end of each level, which include your stomps becoming explosive, your character being put into a time stopping bubble upon taking damage, becoming able to consume corpses for extra health and more.\n\nWhile the number of gun types and end of level upgrades aren't very numerous, this means it doesn't take long until you know exactly what you're doing and what upgrades to immediately shoot for to tackle the challenges each level brings. Your play style probably won't vary with each new run since death is very likely, and you generally are stuck playing in the same ways; you may play cautiously, focus on avoiding ground as much as possible in order to rack up combos, go completely Rambo and brute force your way, or a hybrid of tactics depending on what the situation is. While other rogue-lites suffer from the issue of getting 'lucky' and having a superb run due to a lone item that makes your character overpowered, Downwell manages to avoid this folly by having character upgrades be incredibly useful in their own ways, not just flatout game breakers - Not to mention the game relies on quick, twitchy reactions and raw playing skill, which is a breath of fresh air. The jetpack is great for when you unload a full magazine and need to save yourself, but it can run out of fuel until you land on something again. The drone may be a great buddy to have for fire support, but it can kill the very enemy you were hoping to stomp on to reload your gunboots.The amount of player skill that Downwell demands while also supplying a surprising amount of depth is astounding for such a little game, and it's all punctuated by being able to restart a failed run in no time at all.\n\nWhat's frustrating is that my only real complaint about Downwell is that sometimes hit detection between the player character and enemies can sometimes be a bit unreliable, especially when coming at them from an angle. Besides that, the game's brevity lends itself miles, not padding itself out with any filler or needless content that keeps you from getting right to the next level and making the big plays. Downwell is cheap, fast, fun and challenging, and at the time of writing this there is talk of the game also getting free updates. Such a little game offering so much enjoyment makes Downwell an absolute treat to romp through and I cannot recommend it enough to those wanting a new rogue-lite fix.","November 18, 2015","true","5.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Only the best games fully marry their concept to their gameplay, however. Downwell has you as an adorably animated little dude plunging to the bottom of a mysterious and randomly-generated well, armed only with his gunboots. Yes, those are boots that shoot things, which means Downwell almost plays more like a vertical shooter than a platformer. The well is full of enemies you can stomp Goomba-style or blast with your boots, though each one behaves a little differently. Red enemies can't be stomped, and a few white enemies can't be shot. So, as you're weaving your way past the strange, forgotten ledges of the well, you really need to be focused on what you're fighting and how to fight it.\n\nEnemies leave behind gems that can be spent at stores to regain health or get more shots. Additionally, you can find weapon capsules that give your gunboots a new shot pattern AND a small health or ammo bonus. These add up over time to help grow your character; every 4 points of health you collect while at max HP extends your max HP by 1, and your shots help slow your descent and make it easier to deal with tougher enemies. Hard-hitting weapons like the shotgun and laser also use huge chunks of ammo at a time, so at the beginning of the game you might only have two shots before stomping or landing to reload, but by the end you might have 4 or 5 at a time. Additionally, after each of the game's 12 levels you can pick an upgrade from a random set of three, and these REALLY have a big effect on your playstyle. They can grant ammo from collecting gems, additional attacks from breaking blocks, a drone buddy that works like an Option from Gradius, rocket jumps, jetpacks, and more. Picking smart upgrades makes a big difference, especially when facing the boss at the end of the game.\n\nThe 12 levels are split into four thematic areas, each with its own unique challenges. I won't spoil what they are, but the latter two areas have new mechanics that prove quite challenging and require you to adapt quickly. And that's what's really going to determine how much you enjoy Downwell, your ability to manage chaos. Everything is rendered in loving detail, so at any given time there are monsters attacking you, shots flying, gems bouncing, shell casings tumbling, and more going on on the screen. Once you start to master the game you can rack up some amazing combos by ping-ponging from enemy to enemy without touching the floor, for which the game will reward you richly. There are new character styles and color palettes to unlock via your total gemcount, and a hard mode with new enemies and challenges once you beat the base game. Any fan of platformers or roguelite games will find a lot to love about Downwell, and I guarantee you'll be spending more time than you'd ever expect to mastering its clever moves.","November 2, 2015","true","3.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

There's always a delicate balance between the risk of stringing together actions without touching the ground for higher combos and just touching the ground to catch your breath before you overextend yourself into losing health.\n\nIt's this constant urge to come closer and closer to the sun without getting burned that keeps me coming back for more.

It doesn’t have the same level of world-building as Ori and the Blind Forest, the sense of discovery of INK, or the retro-done-right of Axiom Verge. What Downwell does have is gameplay that can be described as a cross between The Binding of Isaac and Dig Dug. The graphics, music, and lore seem to be pushed aside in favour of fast-paced action more akin to the action found in old arcades. The game rewards experimentation and risk taking while at the same time pushing the simple gameplay to its limits and creating some of the best twitch-gameplay of 2015. Surely Downwell could be seen as the most ‘simple’ game on this list, but that’s part of its charm. Simplicity only hurts when the core qualities are lacking. For Downwell, this is simply simple fun.","January 3","true","2.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I would rather describe this games as the vertical corridor sections in Metroid but you can only go down and it all happens very fast.\n\nThe game isn’t exactly the best looking game out there but a few minutes into your first play through it is abundantly clear that there is something to this retro inspired action game. As you descend the well stage by stage you are assisted by a pair of gun boots you are wearing (God knows why). These are useful firstly to kill enemies but also to help keep you afloat. As you progress through the game you can upgrade you boots contra style by picking up power ups and the weapons are all different enough that you will soon find your favourites. When I first started playing I spent most of the time shooting almost constantly as I fell and looking for the most powerful weapon but pretty soon you realise this isn’t the best tactic. Firstly because shooting also breaks blocks which you need to land on. Without platforms to land you might land on an enemy or miss a shop neither of which is a desirable outcome. The other important thing about landing is landing recharges your boots and this is needed to progress through the game. You eventually find a confident but thorough pace through the game… well until you get to stage 3 where everything runs under a time limit anyway.\n\nThe game obviously draws a fair amount of visual comparison from the Metroid series. While it obviously has a Spectrum look to it the vertical “corridors” scream Metroid as do the enemies that look like Metroids along with the other variety of Metroid type creatures that inhabit the well.\n\nThere are no continues in the game that spreads over 5 stages each split up into 3 sections and upon death you find yourself back up at the top of the well. At the end of each sub stage you are given a choice of upgrades ranging from a jet pack that slows your descent, an ability that shoots bullets upwards when you collect gems, a knife and fork that lets you eat enemies to replenish health and a drone that mimics your bullets.\n\nAll powerups and shops are in side rooms protected by time freezing barriers. This gives you time to recuperate amongst all the craziness.\n\nAs you play and gain gems a number of different styles and palettes are unlocked. Palettes simply change the visual look of the game. Whilst a fun little distraction the original colours are by far the best and I never really found myself inclined to use any others. The other unlockables are in the form of styles. These slightly alter the gameplay such as removing shops in favour of weapon upgrades or giving you more health at the expense of power up choices. While these are a distraction I found myself usually going back to the standard style.\n\nDownwell is hard, but it is incredibly addictive and I found myself playing it again and again and again. At only £1.99 or your regional equivalent this really is one of the best game to money ratio games you will buy this year. Downwell is fantastic and I really cannot recommend it highly enough… more please.\n\nFor our full video review please follow the link: http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/151026_game-tutor-grades-downwell\n","October 25, 2015","true","17.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Whether or not that's a good thing depends on you, but for me the hook of this game isn't getting ot the end (though that's a part of it), its the god-like feeling you get when you reach your next max combo and the feeling of progression in unlocking new styles and pallets. If you're the kind of gamer that loves score-attack type games, mixed with some platforming, this is most definately for you.\n\nBasically, if you have even the slightest inclination, just try it.  It's the price of a sandwich.\n\n\nHowever, I do have some issues/suggestions for the developer.\n\n1) Variety: It takes about one hour to encounter/use all shop items/upgrades/guns, which I think is a problem. I understand that one can't expect a BOI or Nucear Throne level of variety form a 3 dollar game, but I think this is still an issue that the developer should maybe focus on for future dlcs/updates.\n\n2) Unlockables: More stlyes? Custom Palletes? Please? I would love more complex styles that have real trade-offs. This is all fodder for future dlc, which I would buy in a heartbeat.\n\n3) Screen space: super-super nitpicky, but the borders don't fit the whole screen when in fullscreen. I respect the size of the game itslef, but the presence of ugly black bars on either side of the border art really urks me off.  I would really love for this to be fixed in the future.\n\nAll-in-all, it's a great lunch-break rogue-lite with some minor issues.","October 25, 2015","true","7.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

This is an 8-bit style Rogue-like vertical shooter that is very simple in its core design, but very deep in how you can approach it and is rock hard.\n\nOriginally a mobile game (though the PC version is quite good quality), there are only three concepts in this game, moving side to side jumping and shooting. Your goal is to reach the bottom of each level, avoiding or taking out as many enemies as you can, with the goal of reaching the last level and beating the boss. Difficulty ramps up very quickly though so getting to the final boss will be no small feat and will require lots of replays. You will acquire and purchase various upgrades along the way but as this is a Rogue-like, they will only stay with you until you die and then you have to start over again with nothing. There is a persistent progression mechanic that unlocks different colour palettes and a few rule modifications to mix up the challenge.\n\nSessions tend to last for only a few minutes each and the quick nature of the game play and the feeling of improvement through iteration really gives this that "Just one more run!" feeling. You'll find yourself sitting down to kill a few minutes, only to find out an hour blinked by without you noticing. As hard as the game is, I never found myself getting frustrated or angry, even though I died repeatedly. A good Rogue-like should be tough but also feel fair and responsive and Downwell absolutely does. The controls are sharp and tight and when you die, it never feels like it was because the game cheated you.\n\nDownwell is presented in a very faithful NES 8-bit style. It runs at a constant 60fps and it looks and sounds like it could be running on an NES. The music and sound effects and are very crunchy with a lot of punch to them and compliment the game play very well. I played this on my laptop with Intel graphics as well as my main gaming rig and it ran fine on both. I suspect this will run on a potato.\n\nThe best part is that this is only $3! This would be a steal to me at 5 times the price and I can't recommend it enough from a value perspective. Even if you aren't sure you'll like it, there's practically nothing to lose. If you're a fan of Rogue-like mechanics and/or arcade, lightning-fast mechanics, get this, seriously. I'm having a blast and will likely put many more hours into it. As someone who only enjoys specific types of Rogue-likes, this one has me hooked.","October 20, 2015","true","9.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

As you may guess by the name, Downwell is a game about... well, falling down a well. What initially intrigued me about downwell is one of the core mechanics of the game, your gunboots. They act exactly as they sound and allow you to fire shots out of your feet, attacking enemies below you. The main focus of the game is trying to make it as far as you can without dying. Downwell has some aspects of a "rogue-lite" type of game, such as randomly generated levels. As you fall, you will also occasionally encounter side areas and shops that might contain upgrades and gems that are used as currency. Some items might simply increase the number of shots you can fire from your gunboots before you need to reload, while others change the way your gunboots work, such as adding rapid fire or causing them to fire in a shotgun-type blast.\n\nNow that we've covered the game mechanics themselves, let's talk about the game's controls. The game feels like a dream, the controls are extremely responsive and I never once felt like I didn't have control of my character. In addition to jumping and moving around, if you are near a wall and jump away from it, you can wall jump for extra height. It all feels extremely natural.\n\nThe combat itself boils down to jumping on enemies a la Mario, and shooting them with your gunboots. Some enemies have spiky shells that prevent you from jumping on them, requiring you to use your gunboots on them. You have a certain number of shots that you can fire with your gunboots before you run out, at which point you can reload simply by landing on the ground (or an enemy). Some enemies maneuver their way above you, causing problems that way and forcing you to either get above them to attack, or keep moving downward.\n\nThe game's difficulty felt spot on, to me. Between the combat and the controls working extremely well, I never had a death that I felt I didn't deserve.\n\nThe game's sound is top-notch. The sound effects of the gunboots feel absolutely perfect, and really added that extra punch to the combat. The music itself felt spot on, too. It really fit the game without feeling distracting or taking me out of it.\n\nOverall, the game is a ton of fun to play, and I would highly recommend it. For only a few bucks, it is an absolute steal, and it's on both PC and iOS, with an Android version in the works. You should definitely check it out. Thank you guys for watching, and I'll catch you next time.\n","October 15, 2015","true","1.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Descend the well, blasting monsters and collecting gems to buy powerups in the shop. You can stack and synergise powerups and try out a variety of different guns.\n\nDownwell features eye-popping minimal pixel art graphics and superb animation, with a large array of colour palettes to unlock, along with 'styles' which change the character's appearance and the game's rules.\n\nYou get a lot of bang for your buck here, and most importantly, developer Ojiro Fumoto has an eye for responsive, satisfying, weighty control. The design is fair, hard and super fun. Nothing feels frustrating here, the game is incredibly well designed and just feels so fun to control.\n\nI can't recommend Downwell enough!

You only have two controls:  jump and shoot, all controlled with the same button, so you'll either be using the directional pad of your controller, jumping, or shooting.  When you shoot, your fall is slowed down until you run out of ammo, but your dude will reload after you either land on a rock or platform or stomp an enemy.  You'll also collect gems as you destroy rocks and kill enemies, and you can use these gems in shops on the way down to get better gun upgrades or refill your HP.  Each level concludes with you reaching the water at the bottom of the well.  The wells get deeper and take longer to complete the higher levels you reach.\n\nIt's a rogue-like, so you'll keep playing and progressing until you die, then it's back to level 1.  It will take your gems and give you a progress bar. Once it's filled, you'll unlock different colors for your screen as well as styles of play.\n\nYou'll die a lot when you first start because you'll think you have the game figured out and you so don't.  You're not just falling and shooting stuff.  There IS strategy involved, it's not just dumb luck.\n\nMy suggestions are these:  TAKE YOUR TIME.  It's not a race to the bottom.  You want to stay alive as much as possible. Also, know your enemies.  Some of them you HAVE to shoot in order to kill and others can be stomped on the head.  Those little dudes scaling the sides of the walls with the spikey backs..SHOOT THEM.  Those birds can be a nuisance too, so blow them away when you get the chance and don't linger because they will chase you and take a nice bite out of your HP.\n\nKnow your guns.  Not every gun is as effective.  While some are really powerful, they have a very short "magazine", so if you're spamming it all the way down, you'll be empty more times than not.  My personal favorites so far are Burst (B), Shotgun (S), Fist (F), and Machine Gun (M).  Laser (L) is my least favorite.\n\nPick your post-level upgrades wisely.  You can drastically change your survivability by choosing the right one.  Giving yourself extra HP is fine, but not if you're not doing as much damage as you could.  You'll just take slightly longer to die.  The Droid is a great upgrade for clearing rocks and enemies as you fall.  I usually grab that and couple it with Triple (T).   I also like the upgrade that reloads your gun as you collect gems.  The less I have to think about reloading the better.  I'm trying to get to the bottom of the well with as much HP left as possible.  The right combo of gun and upgrade can make all the difference.\n\nDon't try to kill every enemy.  Remember, your goal is to stay alive, collect gems, and reach the end of the level, not clear the well of all enemies.  Some enemies you will seriously need to ignore and keep moving down.  If they get persistent, THEN dispatch them, but you're gonna gain gems regardless, so don't waste time trying to kill everything, lest you put yourself at risk of dying early.  You can fall faster than they can chase you, so destroy what's in your way and bypass what is not.\n\nHave fun!  This is another great game from Devolver!\n\n9/10\n","December 15, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game conceptually plays like the offspring of Super House of Dead Ninjas and Luftrausers; a game about fluidity, speed, reflexes and screenshake. Lots of screen shake.\n\nYour goal is to perpetually move downwards, through a procedurally generated well, killing or avoiding enemies, collecting gems and weapon upgrades, before making it to the end of the stage. At the end of each stage, you are rewarded with a choice of perks/abilities; think Nuclear Throne.\n\nThe main joy in this game comes from the superbly fluid controls, allowing for instinctive, twitch platforming. All good platformers are defined by their movement mechanics, and this game has really nailed it. Couple this with the game's brilliantly nostalgic art style and soundtrack, and you have a real indie gem.\n\nDownwell may not be everyones cup of tea, but for fans of the genre, this is an amazing game, at a steal of a price.","October 22, 2015","true","4.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Your goal going down the well is finding gems, and with those you can buy upgrades in shops that appear as you traverse down. You also get upgrades from occasional siderooms and when you make it out of an area.\n\nI've yet to beat the game, but I'm having loads of fun with the different ways you can travel down the well and there's a lot of charm to it.

It's a quick, snappy game which you can literally load up and go in a couple of minutes.  The graphics, while two bit, still convey the needed information.\n\nEach run begins with a descent, and ends with a descent.  It's a constant downward movement, and unless you're patient with your gunplay, you'll miss gun upgrades, which will either heal you or increase ammo, as well as change the bullet style.  Each bullet style offers different things, and you will be quick to latch onto a favorite.  There are also the occasional shop, letting you trade in gems earned for provisions and ammo.\n\nGoing deeper into the run, and as you play more with the particular bullet styles, you start to develop habits.  Machine gun is the best for some jump combos, which the game rewards for racking up several kills without so much as touching the normal ground.  Laser is for the ridiculously power hungry who just want to annihilate everything in their path, and it's glorious to do so.\n\nThe gun styles can also compliment the styles of play as well.  A floaty style with machine gun results in a heap of combos, while the more patient with lasers will appreciate the tanky approach of the boulder style.  This kind of play results in waiting for a shop to fly by, or to wait for reverse engineering so you can collect upgrades without fear of changing.\n\nThe end level upgrades also provide a nice incentive to finish, and some will synergize well with particular shots.  The easy to run out Shotgun and Laser bullets will appreciate the extra air time the Safety Jetboots offer once they're depleted.  Most styles will synergize with the upgrades as well, except for Handstand.\n\nThe game offers a lot of variety in terms of areas.  And each of them demand their own playstyle.  The first area is a sort of tutorial area, to let you get used to the mechanics of the game.  Later on, they start throwing curveballs until the point where there is little ground to land on safely.\n\nAll of this can be your's for three ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bucks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZachDaniel/recommended/360740/","ZachDaniel","ZachDaniel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZachDaniel/","403 products in account","Downwell does a lot of things right.  Starting with the visuals.  For a game whose active play area is a vertical shaft, they've done a great job as making the space outside the play area both both functional and attractive.  I don't have to wander far from my character to see my health or number of bullets available.  And the inclusion of various backgrounds to fill out the area is a nice touch.  I, for one, really enjoy the simple 3-color aesthetic (Luftrausers is similar, but contains a lot less contrast).  And the ability to swap the palette is great, especially for people who might be put off by the default one (which I am not, I love it.)\n\nThe sound design is great.  No action is ambiguous, and every sound effect feels natural.  The music is really good.  Too good, because I wish there was more of it (like Spelunky has a rotating list of tracks per area, I wish Downwell did, as well).\n\nThe controls are "tight" as one might say.  Very intuitive and responsive.\n\nThe enemies are varied enough to keep you on your toes.  You can't just chain-bounce everything, but you also can't just go in blindly firing off your gunboots.  The area variation is really good, too.  All the guns feel good, and are well balanced.\n\nOverall, it's a really solid game, that's lots of fun, and could get away with being sold at twice the price, so for $2.99 it's a no-brainer.  Pick this one up, and have blast!","October 19, 2015","true","19.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was just looking for something decent  to play and this was very affordable.\n\nThe game starts off  very simple, you're on the surface and you jump down a well and that's mostly it for the story so far. As you continue you realize how tight the game is and how good it feels to play, jumping off enemies heads and using your guns to boost yourself up and shoot enemies below which drop gems that you can use to buy items to make you better as you delve deeper in the well, also when you die I beleive either your expierence or your gems unlock new things in the game like guns, themes, and more.\n\nIt's really not the most complicated game in the world but for me it's really quite enjoyable and tight, the thrill of risking to jump on an enemies head or shoot them down one more time risking your final bit of HP only to pull it off, fall into a room where a shop is and finally be able to heal is something amazing.\n\nI apologize in advance if this review isn't as well written or formal as some, but i hope i did my best to convince you to take a plunge down the well.\n\n10/10 game, and for 2.99 it's an absolute steal.","October 16, 2015","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GetOutNowDontStayLeave/recommended/360740/","GetOutNowDontStayLeave","Jack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GetOutNowDontStayLeave/","608 products in account","Alright, I've played for a good hour. A good hour solid. And I can say that Downwell is the best Indie game I have PERSONALLY played in a while. And with good reason. This game is simple. Amazingly simple. And that is brilliant.\n\nLet me firstly talk about the controls. When I say simple, I am mostly talking about the controls. You need to use a whopping, THREE keys to play this game. That's right, only three keys. A, D and Right Shift. Personally, I thought this game was going to be one of those games that would be a pain in the butt to get used to with controls, but within my first run of playing the game I have the controls figured out. That is one of the biggest signs of a good game; easy controls which don't take long for you to understand and figure out.\n\nArt style in this game may look amazingly basic... And, well, it is. Once again, that is perfectly fine! You realise that the art doesn't take away from the basic gameplay of the game, and you soon realise that the art doesn't affect this game or the way you play it. That can be said for tonnes of other games, but it's not for this review. The art, whilst being basic, is lovely looking. It's not a strain to the eyes, it doesn't make me want to stop playing it after a good 10 minutes and it's really visually pleasing.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this game has a very simple style of how you play it. You fall, whilst stomping on enemies or shooting them with your Gunboats. That's it, attack enemies. Sounds simple, right? It's not. It's really not. Your inevitable thoughts of being good at the game will soon be counteracted with how amazingly hard it actually is. Now, I mean hard as in "You-get-better-as-the-game-progresses" type hard, and not a "This-game-is-so-unfair-and-not-fun" type hard.\n\nIn terms of upgrades and such, when you complete the current floor you're on, you get a few upgrades to choose from. So far, each of the upgrades I've seen actually help you and none are a direct downgrade. There are small little enclaves which contain things to help you. You can either get weapons, health, a combination of both or even a shop. Gems are used when you die. They unlock skins for how the game looks. No, it doesn't change the art style (not that I know of, still very early in!), it changes the colour and theme of the game. I've currently unlocked a few skins, and I must say they're rather pleasing to have.\n\nAll in all, this game is great. I currently have no flaws with it. Except for the bats, man screw those little things. It's not a flaw, merely just a thing I'm going to have to get better at dealing with. And that's about it for this game, for such a cheap price you cannot go wrong with this game. And currently there is nothing wrong with this game that I can find! Extremely fun little game to just pick up and play for a good 10-20 minutes at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy the review? Please consider checking out my curator! I recommend many games similar to this one. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JacksGamesOfChoice#curation","December 20, 2015","true","3.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","6","14","3","0"

Yes, I've only played for less than half an hour. Yes, I am ready to wholeheartedly recommend this game.\n\nIt is a fast paced, simplistically beautiful arcade game that does exactly what it sets out to do. It's a fall-n-gun platformer that knows how to make things clear. For instance, it is quite obvious which enemies are stompable and which aren't by the color scheme, and the controls are simple and elegant and immediately clear.\n\nThe only opaqueness is the weapon system, and that quickly becomes clear (you learn fast that S is shotgun and L is laser and what that means, for instance)\n\nHighly recommended","December 22, 2015","true","27.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

The exception is that there's literally no way to backtrack, and if you decide to progress you won't be able to retrieve any items you missed or to get in better position against an enemy. If you jump down you have to get ready, as with several leap of faiths and scarce health every jump and bullet counts. Speaking of which, you better calculate your jumps and where to spend the ammo until the next safe landing. Probably the best way to describe this game with a single word is "compromise".\n\nThe game is short once you get the hang of it, but for such cheap prize and the usual RNGs of the genre will make you come back for atleast kill some brief time once in a while. Other Rogue-Likes like Binding of Isaac or Risk of Rain takes atleast an hour to get a good run or fail on their final areas, but Downwell's fast playthroughs are a good alternative if you don't have the time to invest.","November 2, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/360740/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Downwell is one man's quest to save a cat that fell down a well by using his only weapon: gunboots. It's kind of like Vertical Drop Heroes in that the majority of your movement is vertically downward, with only your boot "bullets" and stomping on items/enemies to slow you down. You have a limited charge of gunboot bullets before you run out (and then enter free fall) but this can be replenished by landing or bouncing on an object or enemy. Additionally, killing enough enemies before you "land" on a flat surface will run up a combo counter that pays out generously if you can make it to 25 (extra heart, charge, and 100 gems). The game gives you a choice of one of 3 upgrades per level and there are shops to boost the amount of HP and charge you have.\n\nI found the controls to be pretty good, especially in the floaty style which is really forgiving for players new to the game and the game itself really is easy to learn. However, the randomized levels and red enemies, which cannot be stomped, really ramp up the difficulty a lot for players looking to try and get 25 hit combos for that extra HP. To make things even more difficult, each of the zones adds additional stage hazards, making your journey to the bottom even more perilous. You are going to die a lot over and over again before you can even get “okay” at this game. I found myself really wishing there had been some sort of easier mode or maybe even save points.\n\nDespite how fun the game is in all of its difficulty, I decided to finally throw in the towel after around 12 hours and making it to the final boss for the 4th time only to get quickly destroyed yet again. For now, this will be another roguelike that I just can’t finish, despite really wanting to.","January 7","true","12.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Your controls are Left, Right, and Shoot (which can also be used for limited hovering). For each stage you survive you get a free perk, and you'll frequently have to swap out your weapon for others in the form of pickups that may or may not be well suited to the situation, as each time you do so you'll recover some health or increase your clip size. None of the weapons are outright terrible though, which is a plus.\n\nLess getting hit means more opportunities for maximum health or clip extensions, which you're gonna need to survive all the nonsense to come. Apart from shooting enemies, you can also bounce off of some of them, and even get huge bounce combos going once you're more familiar with the game. I really like it, getting a good flow going and bouncing off of everything feels great.\n\nIt's available here and on iOS for about the same price, but although it's the perfect sort of bite-sized game to take on the go, I'd recommend it on PC or something with a decent controller, as it's a bit twitchy for touch controls, even with just 3 buttons. Especially if you're ever going to even think about tackling hard mode.","October 23, 2015","true","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RadioactiveMoth/recommended/360740/","RadioactiveMoth","RadioactiveMoth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RadioactiveMoth/","231 products in account","First I'd like to say I'm not saying Downwell is a bad game that no one should bother playing. Since Steam doesn't allow a "neutral" or "in the middle" or even a "has things that can ruin the game for some but not others" option I'm chosing to not recommend this game at the current moment. Updates may change this. Steam should really add middle option though, because I'm more just saying things that I really dislike, and that are fair things to warn about.\n\nDownwell has a lot of things I like about it. It has art direction I like, music I like, and gameplay I like. But I still have a big problem with the game. The graphcis are too clustered to tell what if going on, especially when there's little color variation between you, the background/enviornment, and enemies. There's also lots of explosion effects, gems to collect, and other such effects that get in your way of seeing where and what enemies are. I found that I would get hit or die because there were enemies that I just either couldn't see, or popped up too fast to react to when they're hard to see.\n\nThere's also no control rebinding, and little sound and display options (only a master volume setting, an option to turn BGM off, and to play in a window instead of fullscreen.). If the developer updated the game to give an option that would maybe give enemies an outline, or remove effects that get in the way of seeing what's happening on the screen, or maybe some other remedy that would make it easier to see what is happening, I would recommend this game.\n\nStill a game worth considering, and if you think you'll be OK with the issue I stated, or don't find it a problem, go ahead and buy the game. It's refreshing and has some fun to be had.","January 5","false","5.2"," 25 of 53 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","25","53","2","9"

Sometimes you can earn bonuses or use them as stepping stones to reach new places. Downwell is an entire game about this.\n\nThis is a very well-polished, well-balanced action game with a neat visual style consisting of about only four colors.\n\nThe object of the game is to jump down the well, fall through twelve stages, and fight a boss. Each run is different, as the levels have randomly generated terrain, and there are also a few simple perks, stats, weapons, and upgrades to earn in a different order each game. Every three stages, the environment changes into something surprisingly different which will probably kill you the first time you make it that far, but a pleasantly stable skill curve will reward your persistence. Through dying many times you can also unlock different characters and palette swaps for the entire game, some of which will make your eyes bleed, others which are awesome enough that they might actually improve your skill level.\n\nDon’t be fooled: this is no metroidvania or roguelike. It’s not a game about exploring the scenery, hunting treasure, and slowly proceeding forward. It’s more like a vertically-scrolling Canabalt where you only have a few moments to react to whatever the game throws at you. It also has the same addictive “just one more try!” quality that runner games have.\n\nAlso, don’t make the newbie mistake of thinking that the gunboots are your main weapon. Your main weapon is your ability to stomp on enemies, and the gunboots are mostly just there to help you stabilize and aim your jump. Downwell is all about the combos. The game rewards you with money and stat boosts for killing many enemies without touching the ground, things which can add up and make all the difference by the end of the game.\n\nI had a blast with this game! It’s got a refreshingly new type of gameplay for a platformer, and the shadowy, creepy pixel graphics were stylish and fun to watch. The last achievement is quite tough, and achievement hunters can expect anywhere from 10 to 40 hours of gameplay depending on how they handle the daunting final challenge the game has in store.\n","December 29, 2015","true","23.1"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","12","27","0","0"

Fall down and shoot enemies. It's really fast paced and controls really well and feels good to do it right. It's a really good game for short bursts, might even be better to play it on your phone if you'd rather. I enjoy it on the PC tho.\n\nOnly downside is that there are some pretty unexplained mechanics in here that I had to kind of look up myself. Example being, getting a combo of 25 + will heal you 1 and increase your charge by 1 so it's better to just end your combo at 25 for the most part. Also when you're at max HP, if you get a healing item it fills up another smaller bar beneath it and if you do it 4 times it increases your max HP.\n\nOther than that, it's very worth it at the price.

It's really good. But sucks at the same time. I got this game as a gift. I actually decided against getting it myself due to reasons explained below - for what it's worth, this might be interesting for people with similar tastes like myself who are still unsure wether Downwell is worth it.\n\nThe thing about Downwell is this: 50% of it is a crazy-good concept. The other 50% are modern indie-hipster ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ideas that ruin it (for me). Let's talk about the good stuff first, Downwell plays with a whole bunch of old sidescroller-traditions. Instead of horizontally scrolling levels, these are all vertical - but unlike, say shmups for example, you try to move down instead of up which changes the entire dynamic of the thing. Jumping and falling help you get down the well faster and also enable your only means of defense - the gunboots. These turn the game into a jump'n'shoot - though, you cannot jump and fall guns blazing forever, you need to reload on the ground - much like you would recover your flight ability in Gargoyle's Quest when resting on a wall. All of this is genius and plays well (a bit floaty, perhaps). I love it - with actual leveldesign, this could have been the next Super Meat Boy.\n\nHOWEVER: it is a modern indie-game. Published by Devolver. This means randomly generated levels, perma-death and randomly available power-ups / perks at the start of each level are a thing. All these elements do exactly NOTHING for me and I hate the game for them - I love fixed patterns, well designed levels built around the movement and attack options of your character and games that give you some sort of leeway when it comes to making mistakes. I knew Downwell had these elements and thus decided against getting it, because I was afraid that these elements would be more dominant than the stuff I like - but as mentioned above, got this game from a friend and it all went down the well from there.\n\nAt it's worst Downwell is a waste of time - death means restarting at level 1. Since everything is luck-based you might be facing a situation entirely different from situation you died to before. The likely outcome being that you die again, restart - rinse and repeat. I really strongly dislike this design decision, because I am not learning jack if I have to replay constantly changing ♥♥♥♥ to even GET to the point I died before. Extralifes and Continues, heck - even passwords are NOT a bad thing, I want tangible "progress" and all this permadeath-♥♥♥♥ feels way too much based around random factors that can (and will) screw you over. Absolutely not my style. And the game gets RIDICULOUS past World 2, it's really frustrating, soulcrushingly hard even. Ain't nobody got time for that, I could be learning Street Fighter combos instead or scoreattack levels of any given shmup in trainingmode.\n\nStill, I can see a lot to like about Downwell and it sure is fun for a while. I am just not willing to put in the time it takes to "git gud" and hope that RNGesus is with me on my next run. Fans of Nuclear Throne and the like can pretty much get this right away - everybody else should try it out, because it is at it's core a really great game. But only extraordinarily lucky and/or hardcore people have any hope of making it through Downwell alive and with their sanity intact. Thanks, but no thanks - I'll pass but you should give it a try anyways.","December 2, 2015","true","1.4"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","3"

But i cant.\n\nThis is a fast-phased platformer, that progresses vertically. It is hard but fair (on most times), and skill is more important than luck, even though it's randomly generated.\n\nI first want to say that i'd like to give a mixed review, but since that's not possible, i will have to give a negative review\n\nThe First Problem is the utterly ridiculous amount of crashes i`ve experienced, which is not only disappointing for a game that came out in 2015, but the game also feels small.\n\nThis is the kind of game that hides that it doesnt have a lot of content by making the gameplay hard. That`s usually not too bad, but because of the common crashes, it`s just... sad.\n\nFirst of all, the graphics.\nthe game has this black and white art style that is broken with another color, creating a very interesting art. And i personally really like that you can also change the palletes\n\nSecond - Gameplay\n3 buttons, not complicated. works well, and that`s what matters\n\nAnd now, the enemies. From what i know, there arent many at all. there`s 5 areas, the caverns, the catacombs, ocean, void and the boss arena. There`s about 5 different enemies in each area (except the boss arena) and one boss.\nThat`s the amount of content a game that came out a long time ago has to offer.\n\nYes, it`s only 2 dollars, and there is some replayability because it`s randomly generated and it has ``different modes``, but they change almost nothing.\n\nI find it pretty disapointing, but if the crash problems dont happen with you, you will really like the game. If you get those problems, than you will know what i`m talking about.\n","May 27","false","5.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

At night and by myself (not in the workplace). I know that some of them may find this offensive. But it’s a compliment. Plus, it’s not like I have rapey fantasies (I GREATLY dislike the porno sex). I treat the ladies right in my awake dreams. And in my sleep dreams, too.\n\nI can see us right now.\n\nImagine two of us at some venue. Someplace where levity reigns. And we’re laughing.\nAnd later on, we end up at her place, where she pulls me to her couch.\n\nWhat happens next depends on the lady. Different women have different fantasies, waiting for me to make real.\n\nAnd as you look at the screenshots for Downwell, you may think that it’s just The Sims with lesser graphics. But there are many subtle differences, altogether making the games quite different. For one thing in Downwell, instead of being about running a family and their home, you’re a white man falling down a VERY long well. Also in The Sims you have a massive wardrobe, along with careers for characters; while in Downwell you’re just the one dude (presumably unemployed or vacationing), and you’re naked except for the boots you wear with the guns in them. This is very different from The Sims, where usually you have to use starvation or drowning or guinea pigs to kill your characters. The Sims doesn’t let you kill via any guns attached to boots. Downwell is Japanese. The Sims is American.\n\nI like imagining myself taking off the heels (or boots) of my coworkers, and kissing up the inward sides of their legs.\n\nWhile with some of the ladies, I like to imagine holding them from behind, placing my hands and stroking wherever it feels right. And while doing this kissing the side of her neck and just behind her ear, compelling her body to want to fall backwards, as her mind focuses on the touch of my nose and lips and hands. Sorta like when you fall down the well, and you finally get to the 2nd level; and it looks spooky! There are ghosts and skeletons!\n\nIt’s so satisfying seeing yourself masterfully make your way through those enemies, through the side shops, and finally to the next floor.\n\nAlthough I have heard people complain about the colors. The graphics are fairly minimalist (it may take three seconds for you to download the game). Enemies you shouldn’t touch at all are red (at least on the color pallete I’ve stuck with), while the others are the other main color. White by default. I’ve noticed games critics complain about it being too samey, setting players up for visual confusion and unfair deaths. I agree that the deaths can feel unfair.\n\nBut you should never see the fairly solid color of a co-worker’s skin as a bad thing. Her skin tone makes her more interesting. And if a rare color, exotic. (Remember the green lady from the 2009 Star Trek film?) From one’s body, I just want it to be healthy. And I want her to be happy. I want to make her Very happy. Happier than she’s ever been with any other man, or woman. My coworkers deserve that. And not just the lady ones, but the male ones, too. I can be open-minded (for my sexy coworkers).\n\nWhich reminds me, Downwell strikes what seems a near-perfect balance between simplicity and complexity. It has just three buttons, with which you can have many dramatic moments due to all the variables the levels throw at you.\n\nLosing life becomes drama.\nGathering gems (to buy power-ups) becomes drama.\nShopping even becomes drama!\nQuickly deciding when to fire your weapons is drama; you really don’t want to miss your targets. And it almost all moves so fast--you’re usually falling--with those time-freezing bubbles feeling sublime. It is all so close to being perfect. Like the minds and bodies of the ladies and gents at work.","November 11, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","23","3","13","4","0"

(disclaimer: i have not beaten the game)\n\nNOTE: my grammer sucks im forgien\n\nABOUT THE GAME:\n\nthis game is about a boy who found a big whole that leads to the underground...then the boy jumps into the whole (idk why but just deal with it!) and then the game starts...moving on\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nthe game is simple the controls are the Arrow keys, and the Spacebar so as you can see its is very simple and has very little inputs BUT the game has no toutorial so i guess this review is also a toutorial so you start with with like 8 bullets BUT those 8 bullets will recharge after you hit ground or stomp an enemy BUT you CANT stomp on all enemies heres how you know what enemies you can stomp on if you see anything white its safe to stand on if you see red its danger so stompable enemies are half white and half red and not stompable enemies are completly red (i recomend you to see atleast one video of the game just for a visual example) btw you can buy more bullets at the shop to fire more bullets in the air speaking of the shop where do you find shops? well you find them every where you just have to find them they usally have a sign above that says SHOP and they have a red circle that stops time when you enter it shops are not the only ones that have circle things treasure rooms gun rooms have them also speaking of guns there are a bunch of them like 6 weapons and every one is usefull there is no better gun and the guns are amazing you can feel the impact of the guns for example your screen vibrates every time you shoot the laser and it feels...AMAZING! and there are also white bars under your health bar those are for the extra health that you will collect if it gets maxed out you will get an exta life! another thing in the game is called gemhigh you get it if you collect a hundred gems then once it starts you can keep it going without ending as long as you are collecting gems fast enough another thing this game has levels its not about score like timber man for example this game has levels i wont spoil the levels beacuse they will suprise you! and every time you beat a level you get an upgrade BUT after you die you loose every thing and you start from the begining speaking of DEATH you will die ALOT this game is hard and fastpaced and so even though this game has alot of positives its not for every body this game is DIFICULT (or mabey i suck) you will die ALOT and restart every thing! thank for reading this review and have a great day!","November 23, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","1"

Potential 'Game of the Year' material. Downwell is a curious game about a young person venturing down a well in search of untold treasures with only his Gunboots for protection. Make your way further and further down into the darkness filled with nasty creatures and mysterious secrets to collect the spectacular red gems scattered about the rocks. Step into precariously placed shops and buy some helpful items or level up between levels to battle well-dwelling monsters and uncover hidden caves filled with riches and relics.

It takes a bit tenacity, and fistful of fast reflexes, some quick enemy identification, and a nice heaping of luck to navigate this vertical scroller. The main challenge of Downwell (and any horizontal scoller section) is reaction to the unknown- as oppose to a typical sidescroller that runs left to right, which gives the player a good deal of insight as what will come next due to the display dimensions of the typical screen. (Most screen and wider than they are tall) This in turn, makes such sections a practice of trial and error, memorizing the map and hazards and react to them before they are displayed on the screen. Downwell shakes this up by having randomized maps and enemy placement, which leans gameplay into the “false difficulty” territory. The game is “difficult” because you don't know what will come up and you have to react to in short order.\n\nCompleting a section rewards the player with a choice of power-up. Many of these are negligible as they add little or no benefit to your survival.(a few tend to hurt your survival) Different weapons are stowed in side areas, which have a greater influence on the gameplay though the “hang time” they give a player and damage the deal. Though your default gun works wonders and there is little reason to change it. Oddly, there is poor incentive to shoot enemies with the gun itself, as most can be stomped on, instantly defeated, and have greater rewards. Enemies that can only be defeated with the gun are better off avoided. Indeed, I found ignoring most enemies is the best strategy for survival on the mobile and PC version. The young lad you play is nimble with a small hit box and most enemies are sluggish, making them choice targets to evade rather than engage.\n\nOverall, I find the game better suited to the mobile device than PC, thus my rating- its a cheap, shallow, slightly luck-based game to pick up and play when in transit. In short, it plays like a “falling” or vertical version of Flappy Birds, and if you like that sort of game, you will enjoy Downwell. For a mere three dollars, you get exactly what you paid for.","December 5, 2015","false","2.5"," 28 of 74 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","28","74","0","0"

Art-style is detrimental to the gameplay since in heat of the game it's really hard to recognize the characters, enemies and collectibles in 3 colors. Hit detection fails, when you would swear that you stomped on the enemy from the top and yet game announces "-1" to your HP. Strangely enough, framerate likes to drop in those particular moments, making the confusion even worse. Enemies that were seemingly left off-screen like to come back in the least expected way and you have no reliable way of taking them down. You need to drop lower making the chase even bigger in the process (ghosts and bats be damned).\n\nIn addition, controls are not so tight as I would like and there is a lot of "luck-factor" involved. Not as severe as in Spelunky case, but it's a similar style of random annoyances you need to work around constantly.  If you didn't like Spelunky, like me, make a quick pass and look for something else.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game may be fun at times, but there isn't any incentive to go back to it. It's just a unremarkable experience. Solid, but giving nothing longworthy stays with you, as you uninstall the game the moment you beaten the final boss. I recognize great games, when they suck me in back right after finishing it, when I can easy say to myself: "I want more". Not here really...\n\nSome may say that for 3 euros you can't go wrong. While damage may be minimal in this case, it's still a bit of money wasted for something you may not be personally satisfied. I got this game as a gift, so it's a bit heartbreaking for me to vote down this game, but I'm at least glad I tried the game and confronted the hype head on, so I'm at least really greatful for that someone who allowed me to try it out. Thank you.\n\nStill, this is my honest opinion. Proceed with caution.\n\nPS Opening screen is lovely enough to point it out.

Most of the weapons I pick up feel like downgrades from my basic one...and I can't switch back to it if I want to.\n\nIf I save my ammo for an enemy I can't jump on...I can't. The hitbox for jumping on enemies is extremely precise. If I wanted to get to a room I missed...I can't. The gunboots won't let me go up high enough.\n\nIf I want to keep my base gun, which is easily the best one...I can't. Other guns give health (Which you can otherwise get in the shop for extreme amounts of funds) or energy, which determines how much I can shoot. Most guns shoot much less than the default.\n\nAnd God help you if you miss an enemy. They will chase you to the ends of the earth.\n\nI usually enjoy games like these. I have considerable time spent into Nuclear Throne, and thought this would be similar. It's not.

The whole thing is just filled with awkward, like it was designed for a phone first.\n\nThe lack of mapping is a game killer for my current setup.  I have no comfortable way to enjoy this until  I get home to my desk.  It will not see my travel controller.\n\nFor the game so far.....It's an awkward back and forth between frantic shooting and walk around looting. But you may not want to loot;  There are items, but you have no idea what they do before picking them up, and you can not go back to your first gun, which I think is the best so far.

It likely won't support yours either if it doesn't use the Xbox 360 standard. Not a fan of the 360's Dpad, so I don't use one.\n\nI refunded when I could not get it to work in the program. It would be ideal if it worked with things other than the presumed Xbox 360 controller & without and interpreted over an additional compatibility program like TocaEdit CE.\n\nIf you get Direct Input controllers working, I will instantly repurchase & take down this review for another after I've played the game for a while. Mine should work in that case and without fiddling in external emulation layers that will increase the input response time.\nA button config might be nice too.\n\nLooks like a cool game though; wish I could play it.\nI trust the developer can handle this eventually, so I'll look forward to the day.\nHopefully someone will message here when that happens!\n\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: It's just a 3 dollar game! Quit your ♥♥♥♥♥ing.\n\nHonestly it looks good enough I would probably pay more. A 'runner' twitch game with a nice aesthetic like this is right up my alley. I really like that your acceleration just keeps increasing so long as you interact with less enemies or platforms. Since it's so cheap & if I like it, I think it would make a great gift. If that's the case for not only me, but others as well, then I think the developer would be gratified for the recognition & money.\n\nQ: Why not just use a compatibility layer or XInput emulator like TocaEdit or Joy2Key?\n\nThese cause a small delay in the input. On top of the input device itself, processing time & potential output delay, this can compound the problem of delay in an action game. The best solution is to simply implement it in the source.\n\nQ: It's probably because your controller is just some weird obscure thing!\n\nThere really isn't anything special about this controller and the basis for it's workings are trivial to implement. It's a direct input device, when I plug it in it shows up just fine under the joystick settings. If you're fine with your XInput controller you won't have this problem, but I like this controller. I mean, I guess depending on what language it uses, there might be no way at all to do it.\n\nQ: This one small issue is why you're leaving a bad review?? Isn't that a bit much?\n\nIt's a bit subjective to call it a small issue. For me it's a flat out deal-breaker! I think at least one concise review of the problem should remain up until this issue is resolved in case any other users have a direct input device that won't work. The issue has been reported & once it's resolved I *will* be checking this game out.\n\nQ: Why don't you just offer your support to the developer! Do it! Tell him you will code it yourself! I double-dog dare you!\n\nOkay Rex, you lovable & modest fan. My Japanese is terrible, but I have programmed something like this before, so I tweeted the guy's English account. I actually expect that he will get around to it himself some day. I don't even know what language the program uses, but even if it's Java, I'll just adapt and give it a good shot. Why not? Sounds fun.\n\nQ: Grr, this just makes me so mad because I love this game so much!\n\nLOL, it's okay!! I will take down this review the day the issue is fixed.","November 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 11 of 70 people (16%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","16","11","70","8","30"

It is a mess.  It is pretty much random if you get down, sometimes landing on enemies kills them, sometimes landing on the same enemy hurts you. Red enemies always hurt you, that much is easy to learn but the bats and jellyfish(?) sometimes you will just take damage for landing on them. Oh and the bats, oh the bats, better hope you didn't miss one, it will follow you all the way down, waiting for you to accidentally land on something and boom damage.\nWith nearly no way to recover from mistakes, you might as well restart the moment you take 1 point of damage.  Upgrades you get for completing each stage are rarely even noticeable as an improvement. The power up that had the most potential seems to be more limited than its description implies(eating corpses for health) There is some variance in the gun boots you can get in the side chambers. but they mostly feel the same and you will play the same regardless of what you get. Useful mostly for the possible health up.\nAnother issue I don't see how people ignore, is the gems. Obviously you are encouraged to collect them. They serve as currency in the overpriced and often useless shops. You can hit a gem high that I have yet to figure out what it does.\nI will continue to play this for a bit longer, and see if my opinion changes. It is of course cheap enough to give it a shot yourself, see if it is your cup of tea.  I could be being petty and or ignorant of something, who knows.

If you loved the momentum-based movement in newest Raymans, Speedrunners and Cave Story, you will feel right at home here.\nHaving a fitting graphical style: I'm not all that much into pixel graphics, I'd always choose drawn art over 10x10 chunks - assuming they both have good animations, because not having these makes your game unplayable. However in Downwell the graphical simplicity is a part of gameplay design - the game has only three colors, and they all mean something different. Also the animations are really great.\nBeing procedural: As much as I prefer handmade levels, the "always different" aspect is crucial here as the game has literally no story at all and boy, it's been programmed really well. The game mechanics are simple, so the game needs constant changes in order to keep being fresh. Just like f.e. Binding of Isaac.\nHowever there are also some minor issues: FPS drop when invincible (I feel like it has been programmed that way but it's not good at all) and no DirectInput support - if your pad doesn't support XInput, you'll need x360ce (or InputMapper in my case).\n\nOverall it's a great game, definitely worth the full (3$) price.","November 2, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While only a very small number of indie efforts from Japan really make it over the various ponds, this right here is a shimmer of hope that there are more little masterstrokes like this out there and that more publishers like Devolver will make the effort to seek them out and make them known to a wider audience.\n\nEven Downwell has room for tweaks, sure... World 2 seems to be the hardest to me, or maybe the most unfair because the enemy types are just so damn unpredictable (how I hate those huge burning skulls) and Levitation Mode should maybe just be called Easy Mode but every minute I spent with the game made me more and more aware of how much attention to detail and loving craft went into its design.\n\nShould you break your combo chain because you seriously lack some cash? What weapon suits your playstyle best? Why the hell is that balloon shaped like a heart but never gives you any love?\n\nBefore really getting into Hard Mode I have to take a break for a few days though - this game will deliver some of the most frantic 10-15 minutes of your gameplaying career.\n\nKeep on munching those corpses!\n\n\n(Looking forward to playing your next game, もっぴん様)\n\n\n","October 29, 2015","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Permadeath and fast gameplay loop (a bit like in Rogue Legacy), also score hunt, if that's your cup of tea.

You want to get better. You're encouraged to try different styles of play, see which suits you best.\nIt's satisfying to play and even more satisfying to play well. You get comfortable with the rules, then are constantly getting into situations you can't prepare for.

There is an assortment of enemies that you need to deal with in different ways. This isn't so bad when you figure each individual enemy out. The bigger challenge comes when you are falling down the well and everything is coming at you in a blur. You need to be able to react in split seconds in order to stay alive. You also have to be able to catch yourself in order to make use of the powerups and shops that appear at the side of the well.  I tell you, that is very challenging and will result in many deaths and many disappointments. No worries, though. Each playthrough gives you experience points that unlock new pallettes and, more importantly, new playstyles, which affect small aspects of each playthrough.\nThis is a game that I won't spend too much time on but can see myself coming back to time and again. One negative for the game is that it could easily get repetative for some, especially if you don't want to put in the effort to hone your reaction times. This is necessary to advance further into the well. Small variations and upgrades give the game enough diversity to make me want to keep coming back to do this. Highly recommended!

In a similar vain to Super House of Dead Ninjas, you run into a hostile environment where everything wants to kill you, with one weapon, and see how long you last.\n\nIn Downwell, your weapon is the titular gunboots. A suspiciously situational weapon that just so happens to function perfectly for this area. What untold treasure you're looking for, I have no clue. But I'm guessing it's a weapon that can function beyond a purely vertical environment. Along the way, you discover gems. Which are both a form of currency and an illegal narcotic, as collecting enough gives you a gem high. I have no idea what the gem high does, but like all crippling addictions it can only be sated through unsavory acts like murder (killing enemies) and vandalism (breaking certain blocks and background objects).\n\nIf you're willing to part with your gem-shaped narcotics, however, you may find a shop within the caves. Run by a man I like to call "Master Onion". Master Onion isn't too smart, but he's more than happy to help by supplying you with health and ammo for your continued survival. Just don't go behind the counter, or he'll make a grumpy face.\n\nIf luck favors you, you'll stumble upon small caves containing gems and gun mods. These caves are protected by Time Voids, which stop all time outside when you enter them. Allowing you to take your sweet-♥♥♥ time collecting what's inside. Gun mods change the way your gun fires, and it's in your best interest to pick them up, as they provide additional health and ammo. Making it through the various sections of the map allow you to pick upgrades, which are passive bonuses to further assist your survival.\n\nWhen you are inevitably murdered by whatever critters lurk inside the well, you earn XP, filling up the bar unlocks Palettes (which change the color scheme of the game in various eye-straining ways) and Styles. Styles have the minor affect of changing some of your sprite animations, but the major effect of changing certain game mechanics. Such as your health, the frequency of visits from Master Onion, etc. Picking the style that suits you most, along with some practice, is how I imagine you'd make your way through this gauntlet. I've not seen past the beginning of the second area, and as far as I know there are no checkpoints.\n\nDownwell is one of those games that I imagine I'll never be able to beat, but I still enjoy playing the hell out of it. Get it while it's cheap, though the full price is a meagre 3 dollars.","December 22, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fun game but I would class it as a timewaster that doesn't have much replay value or depth aside from a hefty amount of unlocks from new colour schemes to animated characters that offer slightly different starting abilities, that's the aspect I liked.\n\nGood music, but forgettable for my taste. Great sound too.\n\nThe levels work in a progressive difficulty, as can be expected from such a game, take it fast, take it slow, it's your choice, but as you get further, the game won't let you just stand around.\n\nWeapon variety is decent, basically everything you'd need for most people's interests, I was a fan of the laser. Just a big beam that destroys everything.\n\nCan't really complain though, this game is probably as good as it can be, what more could they really add or do aside from more powers and such?

In a similar vain to Super House of Dead Ninjas, you run into a hostile environment where everything wants to kill you, with one weapon, and see how long you last.\n\nIn Downwell, your weapon is the titular gunboots. A suspiciously situational weapon that just so happens to function perfectly for this area. What untold treasure you're looking for, I have no clue. But I'm guessing it's a weapon that can function beyond a purely vertical environment. Along the way, you discover gems. Which are both a form of currency and an illegal narcotic, as collecting enough gives you a gem high. I have no idea what the gem high does, but like all crippling addictions it can only be sated through unsavory acts like murder (killing enemies) and vandalism (breaking certain blocks and background objects).\n\nIf you're willing to part with your gem-shaped narcotics, however, you may find a shop within the caves. Run by a man I like to call "Master Onion". Master Onion isn't too smart, but he's more than happy to help by supplying you with health and ammo for your continued survival. Just don't go behind the counter, or he'll make a grumpy face.\n\nIf luck favors you, you'll stumble upon small caves containing gems and gun mods. These caves are protected by Time Voids, which stop all time outside when you enter them. Allowing you to take your sweet-♥♥♥ time collecting what's inside. Gun mods change the way your gun fires, and it's in your best interest to pick them up, as they provide additional health and ammo. Making it through the various sections of the map allow you to pick upgrades, which are passive bonuses to further assist your survival.\n\nWhen you are inevitably murdered by whatever critters lurk inside the well, you earn XP, filling up the bar unlocks Palettes (which change the color scheme of the game in various eye-straining ways) and Styles. Styles have the minor affect of changing some of your sprite animations, but the major effect of changing certain game mechanics. Such as your health, the frequency of visits from Master Onion, etc. Picking the style that suits you most, along with some practice, is how I imagine you'd make your way through this gauntlet. I've not seen past the beginning of the second area, and as far as I know there are no checkpoints.\n\nDownwell is one of those games that I imagine I'll never be able to beat, but I still enjoy playing the hell out of it. Get it while it's cheap, though the full price is a meagre 3 dollars.","December 22, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you loved the momentum-based movement in newest Raymans, Speedrunners and Cave Story, you will feel right at home here.\nHaving a fitting graphical style: I'm not all that much into pixel graphics, I'd always choose drawn art over 10x10 chunks - assuming they both have good animations, because not having these makes your game unplayable. However in Downwell the graphical simplicity is a part of gameplay design - the game has only three colors, and they all mean something different. Also the animations are really great.\nBeing procedural: As much as I prefer handmade levels, the "always different" aspect is crucial here as the game has literally no story at all and boy, it's been programmed really well. The game mechanics are simple, so the game needs constant changes in order to keep being fresh. Just like f.e. Binding of Isaac.\nHowever there are also some minor issues: FPS drop when invincible (I feel like it has been programmed that way but it's not good at all) and no DirectInput support - if your pad doesn't support XInput, you'll need x360ce (or InputMapper in my case).\n\nOverall it's a great game, definitely worth the full (3$) price.","November 2, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While descending, you'll encounter enemies which can only be killed by stomping them or killing by them with your pair of gunboots. You'll also discover various guns which may contain extra charges for your afformentioned gunboots or extra health, shops which sell health and extra charges and also powers after each level section. It has a really simple and addictive premise that's a lot of fun.\n\nPros- It's really cheap, I mean $2.99 come on now\n- Great rogue-like feel consisting of easy to learn, hard to master gameplay\n- Tight controls you can move left or right, jump and shoot. If any error was made platforming it always your fault\n- Great simple pixel art style consisting of 3 colours black white and red (main theme)\n- Great audio and music from composers of Spelunky and Nuclear Throne fame\n- Scratches that 'one more try' itch because of it's combo and depth delving mechanics\n- Influenced by MossMouth's Spelunky and Vlambeer's Nuclear Throne and that's great\n- It's a difficult game if you don't understand the gunboots mechanic don't spam but feather (buffer) your shots and stomp to recharge\n\nCons- Slight slowdown when you get hit, it doesn't affect the game but it might\n\nVerdictAn extemely fun and addictive vertical action platformer rogue-like with only 1 minor problem. The challenges you on how well understand its mechanics and leaves the execution up to you. You're low on health, have an strong gunboot equipped, do you exchange [x] weapon for +1 health or do you weather the storm keeping your pair until you reach a shop where you can buy health. It's an amazing game and if I may quote a certain space fighter this game is about "falling with style".","October 17, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can get a game in in about 5-20 minutes.\n-Fair. Though the game is very hard, the difficulty is fair to the player; doesn't punish him/her unjustly.\n-Pallettes. Throughout the game you unlock color pallette choices. This is a great addition. After I had unlocked the G-boy Pallette I couldn't change it. I love it! It feels like I'm playing a gameboy game.\n\nCONS:\n-Not a lot of variety in upgrades and weapon choices.\n-Leaderboards exist but there is no daily challenge mode. It would be fun if players could compete against eachother on the boards each day, facing the same level.\n\nBottom line: This game is only $3. Its a steal at that price. If you're into rogue-like gameplay a-la Binding of Isaac, Spelunky and the like: this game is right up your alley.","October 17, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Downwell is one of those games that you will sit down to play for 5 minutes & then all of a sudden it's been over an hour.\n\nPROS\n-Solid Controls\n-Buy & Find Upgrades\n-Unique, Fun & Challenging\n-Randomized Levels\n-Unlockables\n\nCONS\n-High Difficulty\n\nThe game is all about going down the well.   You could compare it to Binding of Isaac or Spelunky in that both games go deeper & deeper underground & as you get deeper the game's difficulty goes up!  You also will probably die a lot.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nYou will be falling a lot but you will need to hone your senses so you don't fall too fast or miss the all important upgrades along the way.  You could probably play this game with an Atari controller if you have one.  All you do is Move/Jump/Shoot & the latter is done all with one button.  Upgrades are always given once you finish a level but they can be found in Shops & Caves which are all guarded by a Time Warp Circles that freeze time as long as you're in it.  As you keep playing the game you earn points that give unlocks for new games but you can only equip one at a time.  These are fairly simple but can have both pisitive & negative effects such as increasing health while lowering your upgrade choices after each level.\n\nYou collect GEMS as well which you spend at the shops that are usually at the beginning of each level.  As you progress shops get less & less common. They sell food & weapon upgrades.  If you are full health & eat food you gain 1/4 of an extra health point.  Once you get 4/4 you get +1 Overall Health.  This means you gotta not get hit in order to increase your health which is easier said than done.  Enemies are rampant & will group up against you if you let them.  You can also find ammo/gun/food upgrades in caves or at the end of a level.  It might be best to try to find everything you can because a gun upgrade can also give you food or an ammo upgrade along with it.\n\nRED = DANGER  If you get hit by a red enemy or part of the enemy that's RED you will take damage.  Red terrain also means there's a trap of some kind so you will need to keep your guard up while moving down the well.  You can safely jump on WHITE terrain & white parts of enemies. Whenever your feed touch the ground or an enemy your ammo gets replenished. So you could shoot a red to death, jump on a white then proceed to shoot another red.  If it's RED shoot it, if it's WHITE jump on it.  Some parts are a tad confusing, though.  Like a white skeleton throwing white bones & since you're white it's easy to lose track of yourself amidst all the chaos going on if there's a lot of enemies.\n\nOVERALL\n\nEverything about this game is great!  It feels retro & brings forth that nostalgic feel if you're an old fogey gamer like me.  It even has cosmetic changes where you can make the game look like it's running on a Commadore 64, GameBoy or even Virtual Boy.  This is one of those games where death's mean progress so don't get discouraged if you die frequently.  For under $3 it's really good for the price as well.","October 19, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With standard roguelite features and a stage based item system (and an almost Contra-esque Weapon system). It's strangly addicting and compelling - each run lasts a very short period of time, but I sat down and burned an hour in the first sitting.\n\nLet's break it down though:\n\nPros:\n- Sharp contrasts make the screen easily readible despite only utilizing essentially 3 colors in the default color scheme (Red, Black, White)\n- Nice difficulty curve and pacing - the levels change at a frequency that keeps one area from getting stagnant within a run.\n- Lots of variety to weapons/power ups/etc. - while it's not Binding of Isaac levels, even after a few hours in you'll run in to situations of "oh, I haven't seen that before!"\n\nCons:\n- Can get repetative, you are just falling down a well after all.\n- 4:3 with the backgrounds (so you still have black bars, even with the backgrounds)\n- Has a Virtual Boy Skin (burn it with fire! - this is my review, I'll list that as a con if I want! - the rest are fine though)\n\nIt can get chaotic at times, but for less than the cost of a good sandwich, you can have a few hours of fun? sounds like a great deal to me.

On the first night I played the game, I spent two straight hours playing through it, a testament of how fun and addicting it is. It's a retro style platformer, but instead of side scrolling, you constantly go down. The point of the game is to try and advance through the different levels all while avoiding damage and taking out enemies. You get various upgrades and abilities that makes the experience a little bit easier as you go on. What's interesting about this game is that the levels are never the same. They're randomly generated so it's never the same level. One cool thing about this game is being able to change the color of the screen. So far, I've noticed that there are 9 different colors and it changes quite a lot. Overall, I recommend this game and I give it a 4/5.\n\n2/10/16 6:30am: I've just finished beating this game and though it was a hard and infuriating journey, it was worth it.","January 5","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art is simple, but expressive. The music sounds just like it's coming out of a Game Boy. I do have two issues with the gameplay itself though. First of all, I can't tell if the hitboxes are off or if the walking doesn't have enough momentum, but something doesn't feel right. There are times when I'm wondering how something hit me and others I'm wondering how I managed to get away unscathed. Secondly, there isn't much variety. Not much enemy variety, not much weapon variety, not much powerup variety - it's just lacking content. I'm sure there's cool traps and enemies in later stages that I never got to, but the thought of having to replay the first level over and over just to see something new is not appealing.

Though a little repititve, the game is worth it at its low price.\n\nThe plot of the game is essentially that you're a kid who fell down a well and encounters a lot of dangerous creatures. You kill them by jumping on them or shooting them. All while falling down. Only being brought to a stop by flying rocks and little stations where you can buy upgrades, or get some for free.\n\nThe stylized graphics look really nice, in my opinion. And you can't help but feel like you're playing an SNES game. Which is a big plus, in my book.\n\nThe game does however, get repetitive after some time. The game will manage to hold on to your attention just a little longer though. And how does it do that? By giving you new color schemes and falling animations (which also change up the gameplay by changing the initial rules).\n\nSo yes, this game is definitely worth it.","December 24, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a roguelike? (Or is it rogue-lite? I can never remember the difference) We already know that. That its controls are tight and responsive in just the right way? That despite the increasing horrors you encounter down the well, you want to keep going to see what happens next? All of that's been said before, by people more articulate than I.\n\nWell... one thing that doesn't seem to be said too much is that Downwell is hard, punishing even, but at the same time fair. You're going to die. You're going to die often. And yet, at no point does it feel like the game is punishing you for anything other than your own mistakes. At no point does it feel like the game is cheating, or punishing you for mistakes *it* made.\n\nAnd that's part of what makes the game so compelling. It's easy to dismiss J. Random 12-Year-Old when he tells you to "lern2play, nub", but it's a lot harder to dismiss the cry of "git gud" when it's coming from inside your own brain.\n\nDownwell will make you swear. It'll make you rage, even. And then you'll jump right back into the game because dammit, you can't stop now, not before you've made up for that screwup you just done did.","October 20, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerd_destroyzer/recommended/360740/","nerd_destroyzer","Gafy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerd_destroyzer/","113 products in account","Downwell is a fast paced rougelike that is procedurely generated. If anything I would say this game gets a lot of attributes from Nuclear Throne and Binding of Isaac.\n\nThe gameplay consists of going straight down, making the walls very close and claustrophobic. That's not a bad thing, because it makes the game seem a little bit more dynamic and where your eyes can see the whole playing screen instead of just one part at a time. You are equipped with gunboots, which will shoot straight down in fashion to the enemies usually appearing below you.\n\nThe difficulty is staggering, so if this is your first rougelike, be ready for hell. Seeing as the game goes down, all the enemies must be below you for you to kill them. Meaning if something is above you, and it can fly, it's going to chase you and wreck your ♥♥♥♥. But, if you're quick enough, you can jump on them or shoot them depending on the enemy. The enemies range from frogs to turtles on the first 3 levels, but the bats are definatly the worst part. The bats can fly, so obviously they can attack from above. However, they always show up in the worst possible places, like on a wall directly above you when you stomp on a turtle. They wake up, and take 1 of your HP with them.\n\nThe aesthetic of the game is very appealing to the eye, as it looks like an NES game with a black white and red pallate, including several other color pallates to unlock. However, the only one I ever found myself using was the normal black white and red, as all the other pallates hurt my eyes as I was travelling at high speeds.\n\nI haven't made it past 2-2 yet, but it's still really fun to try.\n\nAnd about getting attributes from other games, the Nuclear Throne side is because of getting a mutation (or in this case just an upgrade) every level. And in Binding of Isaac, you get an item on every level.\n\nChecklist Gameplay - 9\nPresentation - 8\nReplay Value - 10\n\nOpinion Downwell is a very fun and fast paced game that nobody should miss out on. The game resets when you die, so you can play through over and over again.\n\n9.5/10","October 20, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get weapons (similar to contra's style.  There's various siderooms with nodes that have a letter on them, corresponding with what the gun is.), powerups between stages(3 stages in 1 level), and can even buy items with benifits from shop rooms.\n\nCollecting coins lets you not only buy from the shop, but also moves you toward progressing on permanent stuff like color schemes (Default, Aqua, Green, Gameboy Classic, Virtual Boy, etc), similar to how Luftrausers works.  You also get a few alternate guys to pick at the start.  They all have pros and cons, with the default being the most generally well balanced.\n\nThe art (and controls) reminds me of another Devolver game, Luftrausers. The art style is simple but well done, and is very pleasing to the eyes.   The various color schemes you can choose really help enchance the game and let you personalize it.\n\nSimilar to Luftrausers, the platforming is very fluid and I feel like if I die its entirely my fault.   That's how a platformer/roguelike should be.   My main complaint is weird hitboxes with the bats, but everything else feels solid.\n\n\nThe rng isn't too heavy, while still making the game fun and exciting.  What upgrade is going to be in this sideroom or what upgrade will I be able to choose?  It's small rng, but for the most part is controllable.\n\nOverall, if you like fun/addicting games to play in short burst, then Downwell is a great choice.   For only $3 bucks at full price, you can easily get over 3+ hours of it in no time.","October 15, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything is easy to see and has nice little animations which adds a lot to the gamefeel, esp when it comes to picking up and shooting things.\n\nThe music and sfx are very nice as well and fit the atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is wonderful. It takes a while to get to know the different enemy types and how to approach them, but they are all managable and the colour coding is cleverly done. Any enemy that is almost entirely or entirely red can not be stomped and has to be shot to be killed. The enemies also have a nice variety in how they move, keeping you on your toes. And then on top of this you get a bunch of different weapons to find and upgrades which greatly add to the game too.\n\nAll I can say to sum it up, if you like action and got $2.99 handy, get this.

It's a roguelike? (Or is it rogue-lite? I can never remember the difference) We already know that. That its controls are tight and responsive in just the right way? That despite the increasing horrors you encounter down the well, you want to keep going to see what happens next? All of that's been said before, by people more articulate than I.\n\nWell... one thing that doesn't seem to be said too much is that Downwell is hard, punishing even, but at the same time fair. You're going to die. You're going to die often. And yet, at no point does it feel like the game is punishing you for anything other than your own mistakes. At no point does it feel like the game is cheating, or punishing you for mistakes *it* made.\n\nAnd that's part of what makes the game so compelling. It's easy to dismiss J. Random 12-Year-Old when he tells you to "lern2play, nub", but it's a lot harder to dismiss the cry of "git gud" when it's coming from inside your own brain.\n\nDownwell will make you swear. It'll make you rage, even. And then you'll jump right back into the game because dammit, you can't stop now, not before you've made up for that screwup you just done did.","October 20, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerd_destroyzer/recommended/360740/","nerd_destroyzer","Gafy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerd_destroyzer/","113 products in account","Downwell is a fast paced rougelike that is procedurely generated. If anything I would say this game gets a lot of attributes from Nuclear Throne and Binding of Isaac.\n\nThe gameplay consists of going straight down, making the walls very close and claustrophobic. That's not a bad thing, because it makes the game seem a little bit more dynamic and where your eyes can see the whole playing screen instead of just one part at a time. You are equipped with gunboots, which will shoot straight down in fashion to the enemies usually appearing below you.\n\nThe difficulty is staggering, so if this is your first rougelike, be ready for hell. Seeing as the game goes down, all the enemies must be below you for you to kill them. Meaning if something is above you, and it can fly, it's going to chase you and wreck your ♥♥♥♥. But, if you're quick enough, you can jump on them or shoot them depending on the enemy. The enemies range from frogs to turtles on the first 3 levels, but the bats are definatly the worst part. The bats can fly, so obviously they can attack from above. However, they always show up in the worst possible places, like on a wall directly above you when you stomp on a turtle. They wake up, and take 1 of your HP with them.\n\nThe aesthetic of the game is very appealing to the eye, as it looks like an NES game with a black white and red pallate, including several other color pallates to unlock. However, the only one I ever found myself using was the normal black white and red, as all the other pallates hurt my eyes as I was travelling at high speeds.\n\nI haven't made it past 2-2 yet, but it's still really fun to try.\n\nAnd about getting attributes from other games, the Nuclear Throne side is because of getting a mutation (or in this case just an upgrade) every level. And in Binding of Isaac, you get an item on every level.\n\nChecklist Gameplay - 9\nPresentation - 8\nReplay Value - 10\n\nOpinion Downwell is a very fun and fast paced game that nobody should miss out on. The game resets when you die, so you can play through over and over again.\n\n9.5/10","October 20, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The composer also wrote the soundtrack for Spelunky, so expect engaging melodies and varied themes.\n\nThe game mechanics is nice and tight, due in part to the simple control scheme.  The control scheme is accessible, but the meta game requires very quick reactions and flexibility.\n\nAt the end of the day, 3 dollars is a bargain for a deep rogue-lite experience.\n\nNOTE: The display options allow for moving the UI into the playable viewing area, basically optimizing the game for monitors in portait position.

It's a roguelike? (Or is it rogue-lite? I can never remember the difference) We already know that. That its controls are tight and responsive in just the right way? That despite the increasing horrors you encounter down the well, you want to keep going to see what happens next? All of that's been said before, by people more articulate than I.\n\nWell... one thing that doesn't seem to be said too much is that Downwell is hard, punishing even, but at the same time fair. You're going to die. You're going to die often. And yet, at no point does it feel like the game is punishing you for anything other than your own mistakes. At no point does it feel like the game is cheating, or punishing you for mistakes *it* made.\n\nAnd that's part of what makes the game so compelling. It's easy to dismiss J. Random 12-Year-Old when he tells you to "lern2play, nub", but it's a lot harder to dismiss the cry of "git gud" when it's coming from inside your own brain.\n\nDownwell will make you swear. It'll make you rage, even. And then you'll jump right back into the game because dammit, you can't stop now, not before you've made up for that screwup you just done did.","October 20, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The description of the game sounded interesting and was craving for an arcade fix. The thing that made the game truly shine is it's frantic way of beating levels. You're going down a well with gunboots. Smashing and shooting your way through bricks and scoring gems. Also, the levels are procedurally generated so of course you will see the layout of the level of bricks, powerups, and enemies placed at random parts of the well when playing through each level. So far the game has a nice replay value if you did include the randomization of level generation and highscore leaderboards.\n\nThe price is a downright steal for such a unique arcade game and this being a debut of 23-year-old Ojiro Fumoto is a rather impressive game for such an awesome price. I beg of you dev if you can improve this awesome formula you have concocted I would pay you a significant amount of money. If any of you have not picked it up yet I suggest you do so now. It plays fine with a keyboard if you do not have a game controller. Game pad or not the controls are rather simple and satisfying.\n\nPick it up!

Don't stomp on pure red enemies, shoot them. White = all right!

Go on and buy it!\n\nDownwell may look really simple, but actually packs quite a lot of gameplay for its price. The base game is as simple as it gets. Move left and right and press once to jump, and a second time to shoot down from your gunboots. Some platforms can be destroyed. Some platforms can be shot through. Most enemies are killed by jumping on them (except the red ones, shoot those instead). Collect crystals dropped by fallen enemies. Get to the bottom of the well without loosing all your hit points, or it's game over. Death comes quickly if you make too many mistakes.\n\nWhat makes the game interesting are the weapons, the items and the powerups. Weapons are found in little caves off to the side of the well. Some are more powerful than others. I personally love the laser. Overpowered? Nah. :) Some caves contain shops where you can buy items to restore hit points or add more shots to your boots. Each well you complete rewards you with a choice of one out of three powerups, which stack up as you move from well to well. Some of them are really cool and combine in interesting ways. The challenge is to try and hold on to those powerups for as long as you can before you inevetably die and have to restart.\n\nThe controls are responsive (as is essential for this type of game). The graphics are very minimalistic and are likely to run on a toaster. The sprites are nicely animated. There are a few colour schemes you can unlock to change up the game's look.\n\nI heartily recommend this game and will be playing it a lot more myself.","October 19, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With standard roguelite features and a stage based item system (and an almost Contra-esque Weapon system). It's strangly addicting and compelling - each run lasts a very short period of time, but I sat down and burned an hour in the first sitting.\n\nLet's break it down though:\n\nPros:\n- Sharp contrasts make the screen easily readible despite only utilizing essentially 3 colors in the default color scheme (Red, Black, White)\n- Nice difficulty curve and pacing - the levels change at a frequency that keeps one area from getting stagnant within a run.\n- Lots of variety to weapons/power ups/etc. - while it's not Binding of Isaac levels, even after a few hours in you'll run in to situations of "oh, I haven't seen that before!"\n\nCons:\n- Can get repetative, you are just falling down a well after all.\n- 4:3 with the backgrounds (so you still have black bars, even with the backgrounds)\n- Has a Virtual Boy Skin (burn it with fire! - this is my review, I'll list that as a con if I want! - the rest are fine though)\n\nIt can get chaotic at times, but for less than the cost of a good sandwich, you can have a few hours of fun? sounds like a great deal to me.

Very easy to hop in and out of at a whim, as expected of a well-designed mobile port.\n+Rouge-lite elements give a sense of progression both within and out a run, e.g. Upgrades, gem unlocks.\n+A decent sense of balance. No upgrades or weapons feel terribly overpowered from the getgo, unless you go out of your way to find a decent synergy which even then isn't gamebreaking. However...\n-Some styles are clearly better or worse than others, like Levitate Style compared to Normal and Arm Spin to generally everything else. There's not much incentive to take the others beyond self-imposed challenge. Nothing's gamebreaking here, though.\n+Three-tone pallet works well enough, enemies you can and can't stomp are clearly identifiable, leads to color pallets being rewards.\n/Music's okay. I was more impressed with the sound design, though.\n\nTL;DR: This is an honest-to-god game. It's not a terribly large game, but it's designed well, it's presented stylistically, there's never a dull moment, it's cheap, it's addictive, and for what limited content it offers, it is very replayable. I would definitely recommend this to anybody, and I look forward to the Android port.","December 10, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A simple game at it’s core, it tasks the player with guiding the nameless (as far as I’m concerned) hero down a series of randomly generated mineshafts in an attempt to attain unbelievable riches in the form of gems and kill The Boss while at it. Why exactly are we doing all this is never explained, and frankly does not matter, as “Downwell” is a twitch platformer and getting better is really all there is to it.\n\nThe game presents us with a bare-bones platforming mechanics, where we are able to run left or right and jump, and also fire our weapon called Gunboots. They shoot straight down and can be modified by a few different pickups that can be found in the caverns. They also have limited ammo which recharges when we touch the ground or stomp an enemy, which in turn is a mechanic essential to pulling out combos. Those give us bonus gems, and gems are… well, they are shiny and worth a lot. They also allow us to buy things in the occasional shop, sometimes boost firepower, and unlock styles (which modify the game in different ways) and palettes persistently, even when we fail in our quest (hence the “rougelite” element). All this makes up for a simple and yet solid mechanical makeup of the game. Dying is common, but it’s all skill-based and I almost never feel as though I was killed off randomly.\n\nMinimalistic pixel art style works well for “Downwell”, as it makes discerning enemies and backgrounds easy, though the screen can get a little cluttered at times. Enemy designs are varied both visually and mechanically, and whole presentation is just oozing style. Sound design is kept in similar simplicity, though I personally find the music a little bit too monotonous after a while. One thing that perplexes me is that the game has trouble maintaining 60 fps even on a relatively strong PC – it must be an issue with underlying game engine, as there is really nothing here that should stress any modern system whatsoever. The controls stay responsive and precise at all times, so it’s not that much of a big deal.\n\nIn the end, “Downwell” is a minimalistic, tough platformer where only rewards are really in your head. If it’s for you or not – that’s a personal thing. I was very pleasantly surprised and I’m constantly finding myself running the game for a quick run now and then. Plus, it’s very reasonably priced, so if you’re not absolutely fed up with retro-themed games and you like a challenge, I’d say it’s worth a try.\n","March 26","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Go on and buy it!\n\nDownwell may look really simple, but actually packs quite a lot of gameplay for its price. The base game is as simple as it gets. Move left and right and press once to jump, and a second time to shoot down from your gunboots. Some platforms can be destroyed. Some platforms can be shot through. Most enemies are killed by jumping on them (except the red ones, shoot those instead). Collect crystals dropped by fallen enemies. Get to the bottom of the well without loosing all your hit points, or it's game over. Death comes quickly if you make too many mistakes.\n\nWhat makes the game interesting are the weapons, the items and the powerups. Weapons are found in little caves off to the side of the well. Some are more powerful than others. I personally love the laser. Overpowered? Nah. :) Some caves contain shops where you can buy items to restore hit points or add more shots to your boots. Each well you complete rewards you with a choice of one out of three powerups, which stack up as you move from well to well. Some of them are really cool and combine in interesting ways. The challenge is to try and hold on to those powerups for as long as you can before you inevetably die and have to restart.\n\nThe controls are responsive (as is essential for this type of game). The graphics are very minimalistic and are likely to run on a toaster. The sprites are nicely animated. There are a few colour schemes you can unlock to change up the game's look.\n\nI heartily recommend this game and will be playing it a lot more myself.","October 19, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the 8 bit artstyle combined with the choice of unlockable palletes like Luftrauser.\n\nSoundtrack is fitting for the levels I've been able to get to so far.   The composer also wrote the soundtrack for Spelunky, so expect engaging melodies and varied themes.\n\nThe game mechanics is nice and tight, due in part to the simple control scheme.  The control scheme is accessible, but the meta game requires very quick reactions and flexibility.\n\nAt the end of the day, 3 dollars is a bargain for a deep rogue-lite experience.\n\nNOTE: The display options allow for moving the UI into the playable viewing area, basically optimizing the game for monitors in portait position.  I have yet to try it, but its a very interesting feature of this game.","October 20, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can get a game in in about 5-20 minutes.\n-Fair. Though the game is very hard, the difficulty is fair to the player; doesn't punish him/her unjustly.\n-Pallettes. Throughout the game you unlock color pallette choices. This is a great addition. After I had unlocked the G-boy Pallette I couldn't change it. I love it! It feels like I'm playing a gameboy game.\n\nCONS:\n-Not a lot of variety in upgrades and weapon choices.\n-Leaderboards exist but there is no daily challenge mode. It would be fun if players could compete against eachother on the boards each day, facing the same level.\n\nBottom line: This game is only $3. Its a steal at that price.

This game is a testament to the phrase "less is more", having restrictions, keeping the design simple, clean and tight.\n\nAlso one of the rare games that actually really benefits from procedural level design. The dev haven't just included that feature in sake of being in the "procedural hype train". And why it works then? Permadeath and fast gameplay loop (a bit like in Rogue Legacy), also score hunt, if that's your cup of tea. The game still reaks of huge emphasis on skill driven gameplay, despite of little randomity here and there (also like in Rogue Legacy, and I do NOT mean this copies RL, just pointing it out as a reference).\n\nIf you read this far, I'm sure it should be clear now whether to buy this or not.

It is easy to understand, and you learn how to handle different situations by being thrown into them.\nThere's enough sense of progression in unlocking pallettes (which only requires time, not skill) and seeing new areas. You want to get better. You're encouraged to try different styles of play, see which suits you best.\nIt's satisfying to play and even more satisfying to play well. You get comfortable with the rules, then are constantly getting into situations you can't prepare for. And that's good.\n\nI do have some medium-sized complaints: I continue to struggle with precise movement needed for combos, but perhaps I simply need more practice. Every so often an enemy's hitbox will surprise me, damaging me when I expected to bounce, or vice versa.\nAnd the fourth area is a rather sudden change of expectations, and honestly seems a bit lazy (the Jetpack upgrade is a must). Indeed, after the second area, there's really only one way of playing that will let you survive.\n\nBut it's much easier to come up with gripes than it is to put to words my enjoyment.

There is an assortment of enemies that you need to deal with in different ways. This isn't so bad when you figure each individual enemy out. The bigger challenge comes when you are falling down the well and everything is coming at you in a blur. You need to be able to react in split seconds in order to stay alive. You also have to be able to catch yourself in order to make use of the powerups and shops that appear at the side of the well.  I tell you, that is very challenging and will result in many deaths and many disappointments. No worries, though. Each playthrough gives you experience points that unlock new pallettes and, more importantly, new playstyles, which affect small aspects of each playthrough.\nThis is a game that I won't spend too much time on but can see myself coming back to time and again. One negative for the game is that it could easily get repetative for some, especially if you don't want to put in the effort to hone your reaction times. This is necessary to advance further into the well. Small variations and upgrades give the game enough diversity to make me want to keep coming back to do this. Highly recommended!
