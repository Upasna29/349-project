As far as I could find anyway..\n- To even get the game to work, you must edit the games folders (cutscenes, splash). You must rename them or the game crashes when you create a profile. The reasoning is because they use flash files for cutscenes which apparently causes issues.\n\nI think I got this game in a bundle of some sort which made this game less than a dollar. I certainly wouldn't recommend spending more than that...or recommend getting it at all!","March 5, 2014","false","2.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

A 1920s woman who desires to be a star reporter. When she achieves her dream, she gets more than she bargained for. Murder, political scandals, and the mob are just some of the things our intrepid, plucky heroine investigates in her search for her next story.\n\nI'm a fan of search-and-find games like this, so I had to buy it. I wasn't disappointed. The gameplay is excellent, if not very challenging. The objects aren't too hard to find, especially since you can view a silhouette of the object. The ability to recharge your hints through linking items, finding batteries, and a train/trolley ride every level is great, though I rarely needed to use the hints myself. The puzzles throughout the game are not too challenging either.\n\nThe graphics are superb. The backgrounds and the items are all detailed and good-sized, so there's no pixel-hunting. These areas are photo-realistic. The characters are more cartoonish, but still very well-drawn. The scenes in between that further the story are even more comic-like, but not in a terrible way.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game. The plot, graphics, and gameplay were excellent. Though not very challenging, it's good if you just want to have fun and enjoy a game without having to struggle. I highly recommend this game to any fan of search-and-find games, anyone who enjoys a good mystery, or anyone who just wants to play a fun, yet simple, game.\n\nMy rating is 9.5/10","January 12, 2014","true","6.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Sound exciting enough?  For a hidden object/puzzle game this one is alot of fun, full voice acting makes it interesting with an actual mystery to solve.  Unlike other games where a garage sale throws up, this one is more down to earth with its hidden objects, the puzzles are very fun, from search and find words to making headlines there is a variety of puzzle elements to keep the gameplay from being rinse and repeat puzzles.  This puzzle game can be challenging for veterans but also enjoyable for players new to puzzle/hidden object games.  There are hints if you get stuck, you can skip puzzles, and an image of the item needed to be found during the image searches so you cant get stuck in the game.\n\nRating:  10/10   Value:  $8.99","November 10, 2013","true","5.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Valerie Porter has truely captured the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ disproportional and airbrushed look of the 1920s. This is truely a game that defines a time period where women  went around barging into people's horrifically messy rooms and offices with a shopping list of things to steal and/or clean up.\n\nThis game takes the tension of a scandalous secretary that went above and beyond the call of duty to become a vigilante maid. It is only up to the hardiness of the player to ensure she avoids the police enough to do god's work.\n\n8/10.","February 19, 2011","true","0.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
