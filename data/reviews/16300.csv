It has some very unique artistic and musical sensibilities, and even its game design is pretty far outside the norm for shoot'em ups.  The game actually gets easier the more times you replay, because you earn points to unlock things like extra starting lives.  Each level follows vastly different logic and behaviors for the enemies, that keeps the game feeling fresh with each stage.  And while the challenge is intense, it's not really about winning, so much as existing in a state of focused flow while immerse in such beautifully strange visuals and the hypnotic music that synchronizes perfectly with it.","February 14, 2014","true","10.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

If you don't have a decent pair of speakers hooked up to your system, use a good pair of headphones before playing this one. The sound track is soulful, funky, hard, grinding, brilliant and the sounds are used masterfully to make the music more!\n\nThe gameplay is simple. Your basic twin stick arena shooter but the level design is what makes this fun and interesting. Every level randomly generated and has a catalyst to create huge chains of destruction. The 8-way shooting is a little disappointing but on a BoI level, also make it more challenging.\n\nOverviewGameplay: Twin Stick Top Down Abstract Music Driven Bullet Hell Arena Shooter (whew...)\nGraphics: Great Abstract Art\nSound: Absolutely Brilliant!\nControls: Decent 8-way Twin Stick\nReplayability: Yes, like your favorite album!\nOverall: 9/10 (-1 for 8 way aim)\n\nThis game was my little secret, well it's time that I expose this gem.","October 3, 2014","true","3.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Stunning, almost overwhelming visuals and the melodies bring the utmost life to this abstract 2D shooter.\n\nThe progression is solid, but can be somewhat confusing as to what each of the elements represents. You'll find the mechanics switching between tunes and having to re-learn what mechanics are important for that song. Once you master this understanding and adapatability, you'll quick enjoy moving song to song.\n\nThe actual gameplay mechanics are decent, but you'll often struggle with just the intensity of visuals happening at once. Similiar to titles like Geometry Wars, you'll be placed into the full color spectrum of insanity quite quickly. Fear not though, again once you grasp the "rules" for that specific song, you'll like fair ok.\n\nMy biggest complain on the tunes I played was not having the "Clear All" mechanic found in bullet hell games. It certainly would have saved me in a few areas. The controls responded well and I was able to competently play without much struggle.\n\nIf you're into abstract/cerebral games, Everyday Shooter is one to pick up.","November 10, 2013","true","0.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The basic gameplay mechanic is similar to the twin-stick shooting mayhem of Geometry Wars, but the devil is in the details.  Each level is different from the last and part of the game is learning how the rules permutate as you go.  Shooting certain things allows you to make progress, others build up point multipliers, and others cause chain reactions which release mass tokens that can buy game upgrades.  The upgrade system is pretty neat in that it could almost be called "buying cheats" but not really since the upgrades help to give you better access to the later levels rather than forcing you to grind your way through the early parts if you're tired of them.  In addition to all this you have an interactive musical score with guitar effects that are synchronized with the onscreen action providing an amusing jolt to your activity.  The visuals are pretty abstract and trippy.  A little slight, but fun.  I like it.","July 12, 2012","true","1.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The idea is solid and I very much enjoy playing it.  The idea is that the game is basically an astroid-esque game where you stay on one static screen and things fly at you or shoot at you.  The flavor comes from the music.  There is a base rhythm and when you do anything from shoot to hit things to die to blow things up, a specific tone or set of notes is played and meshed into the existing music.  This means endless fun while having a constantly dynamic soundtrack in the background.  Sadly, I haven't seen any more development in this game since it was finished.","January 31, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I also really appreciate that for once someone made a game with (at least somewhat) procedural music which is NOT electronic. It's all samples of guitars and stuff, which gives the whole game a totally different feel from the usual stuff like this. I just wish the actual "shooting and collecting points" part felt a little better than it does, but it's still reasonably fun.","March 28, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
