YES!\nFor now there is one word: Potential\n\nHuge potential for this game, it needs more content, more destruction,  better imersive graphics and UI, chances to Multiplayer, a Map Editor with WorkShop support to create and share custom challenges, several gameplay modes, improved physics, also liquids,  and more themed and unique content that we unlock over time, progression so the gameplay experience feels fun and it doesn't get repetitive.\n\nI hope Devs look at the potential and create one unique game, that is already fun in my opinion. :)","January 9, 2014","true","2.9"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","26","35","0","1"

So....don't buy this game and, seriously, stop begging to be gifted codes to it. While playable at the most basic level it's missing about 90% of the features that would make it a real game and it has tons of problems, including a few levels that cannot be finished due to issues with the level design.","June 25, 2014","false","1.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

No progress or updates added what so ever, not much response of any kind on forum etc.\n\nIts playable in its current state, but quite repetetive, needs some tweaks on aiming and other details. Its too unpolished and flawed in its current state, that i would recommend it to anyone. If updates startet coming, then yes, but with nearly 6 months of absolutly nothing - DONT buy it.","May 1, 2014","false","1.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The devs are open to player feedback and suggestions and active on the forums.\n\nAt the moment its highly playable and addictive (I daren't load it up while I am trying to finish a few other games such as ni no kuni as my last 'quick' go stretched to over 2 hours and I had to drag myself off M&M to go eat), some levels will frustrate you but also you get that must have one more go feeling that an addictive game requires.\n\nOnce this game gets random maps and quests I can see my free-time just being eaten away...","January 11, 2014","true","7.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

There is no obvious objective, and gameplay balance needs a lot of work. I'd suggest waiting to purchase this game until several updates are out.\n\nTo the devs... 3 shots to eliminate 8 or more 'enemies'? Really??

Yes, it's Angry Birds like but it has a complete different feel with the upgradeable munition. Does take a little bit to get used to. It WILL seem frustrating at first with the fact that you only have 3 shots per level BUT once you complete easier levels/ reset your map to re complete them to gain more munitions you get it down and it makes the game so much fun.
