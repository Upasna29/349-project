Your child only need be familiar with the very basics of using a mouse. There is nothing in it that a parent would disapprove of. If you're looking for a game for your child that doesn't have hitting or violence of any kind...this is the game...or game series.\n\nMy daughter is 6 now and still loves it...even though she is tearing through it much faster :)\n\nCheers","June 28, 2014","true","14.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","12","13","3","0"

Putt-Putt®: Pep's Birthday Surprise shows the story of a post-apocalyptic wasteland where humans have mutated with vehicals and the struggles/importance of keeping up morale in a world where survival is easier said than done. This is shown through the Pep, the main character's trusty prisoner who has been kidnapped and abused all his life, and his journey to find a reason to continue living. The objective is to keep Pep from killing himself by throwing him a party, which is a unique plot device for an indie project such as this. When people say video games can't be art, I show them Putt-Putt®: Pep's Birthday Surprise.","December 30, 2015","true","0.3"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","82","14","17","25","0"

It just lacks the imaginative environments and characters of the previous games so it's not very exciting. The animation is worse than the other games and the voice actor changed again (worst one yet!). There is less gameplay and lengthier animated scenes, which isn't helped by the sloppier animation. The key creativity left Humongous before this game was made and it definitely shows that this is just a quick cash-in.\n\nWhether you're looking for nostalgia or a kids game, any of the other Putt-Putts are better.","July 26, 2014","false","1.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

The voices sound AWFUL. Considering they've never been great, either...\nThe dialogue has also been dumbed down to the point of being insulting, the puzzles are barely puzzles, there's so much reused scenes and animations... it's just a cash grab version of the older games with no effort put into it. Really, avoid this one. Not really even part of the series as far as I'm concerned.","August 16, 2014","false","1.3"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

Not because my standards for them are low, but because usually they are very interesting and fun despite the fact I am now an adult. However, Putt-Putt: Pep's Birthday Surprise is a lazy cash-in to a franchise after the original company (Humongous) was absorbed by Atari. Backgrounds are blatantly reused from older games, there's something horribly wrong with the audio (as in I can hear the microphone Putt-Putt's actor used during all of his lines), the voice-acting is stiff, and when I tried to give this game a second chance, the cut scenes kept glitching on me, something I didn't expect from this kind of game. In a game where you're just supposed to have fun and figure out what to do, it's somehow completely devoid of anything resembling fun.\n\nPutt-Putt was always my least favorite of the main Humongous Entertainment games, but they were good, with this one major exception. This game is terrible, I urge you to not cave in and try it for yourself.","February 29","false","1.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
