Before you say anything about my playtime, listen. My friend told me that Soccer Manager 2016 came out not too long ago. 2015 was okay even though it had problems, but I was like "hm, let's see what they did with the game". So me and him checked out the game for like an hour. Now, I downloaded the game just so I could write this review. And this is basically what I got from that hour of playtime.\n\nFirst thing that bothered me is the whole "share with friends" thing. Okay. I get it. You want that friends compare the state of their clubs and stuff, BUT STOP TELLING ME TO SHARE EVERYTHING WITH MY FRIENDS THE WHOLE TIME! Jesus, you start the game, why don't you SHARE IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS?! Sign a player, SHARE IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS! Could you PLEASE stop shoving those words in my face, I already said NO! I don't have to share it with my friends, mostly because most of my friends would never play this.\n\nSecondly, why did you remove the feature where we could make our own formation? Makes no sense. I want to have some freedom when deciding the team tactics... I'm supposed to be the MANAGER, the creative mind of the club, yet I'm being limited to default formations? Also, the player info doesn't appear as a pop-up... Why? It was fine as it was. It's a small thing, yeah, but it was good as it was.\n\nThird point, your team (i.e. West Ham) may win 3-0 against City, but then they will lose against Shrewsbury in the FA Cup 4-0, even when you use the same team that beat City. "Realistic" simulation, huh?\n\nI could ignore all of that... But I can't ignore this: THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SHOP.\nNow, I understand. It's a Free-To-Play game but you still want to make money for the hours of time spent on developing the game. But come on... You LITERALLY can't do ANYTHING without buying stuff from the shop! In FM, you can ask the board for more money. Here, there is no football board, and in order to get money, you have to pay REAL MONEY?!\nIf you want to make money, why not just charge for the game, and not have this BS of a shop system.\n\nAlthough these points have only been negatives, I like the game, I want to support it because I think it has potential. But the thing is, the potential is fading away. You can't say it's realistic when I can add 80 million in cash to my team's bank with real money. When the club needs money, it's the BOARD that gives it. Not the MANAGER. You can't market the game as realistic when these kind of stuff are in the game. I get so annoyed when a game has so much potential, but then they blow it.\n\nI think it's a 5/10 game. You can try the game out yourself if you want to. It's not bad, but the points I mentioned above make it fall to the below-average category.\n\nAs for me, I'll stick with FM.","November 3, 2015","false","0.2"," 51 of 70 people (73%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","73","51","70","16","27"

An alarming amount of own goals that were supposed to be backpasses or just dribbled into the back of the net and indirect goals (ones intended to be balls in). If this was just every now and again, it wouldn't be too annoying but I haven't conceded any goals that aren't like this other than afew corners. Fix this, and I'll love this series of games again.\n\nEdit : Yep. Still happening. And another thing also happens now. Defenders pass it around at the back, then give it away. Lost 0-8 at home to Tottenham as Swansea. 2 own goals, 1 indirect goal, one normal one and 4 ones due to passing it around at the back. This game is broken and desperately needs an update. Annoyingly, the app isn't affected by these problems, which means the developers are perfectly capable of making a great game and clearly don't feel the need to give the pc version any attention.\n\nEdit 2: When I realised there was an update, i got really hopeful that this broken game might have finally got fixed.

Then I found SM, and since this time I can't leave him. By all this time SM made huge progress, and now on Steam I can say - "this is best f2p football manager game". Of course this game have bugs and many other cons like language translates or 2d pitch (isn't refined to the end). Anyway it doesn't affect gameplay so much. SM also have many pros, like huge database (from "soccerwiki" so player's ratings not always are realistic, however this isn't bad, imho), many manager's functions, for example - training, scouting etc. Also you can upgrade your stadium, training base, scouts, junior's academy and much, much more. Finally, two other important pros. First - game is updated frequently. Second - this is not "pay2win" (of course you can buy coins for new save slot or you can buy a player immediately).\n\nSummary:\n+ database\n+ many functions\n+ not pay2win (you don't have to buy this and you can still 'be the best')\n+ many updates and new functions\nand much, much more.\n\n- translations (especially polish translation is horrible)\n- some bugs\n\n+/- 2d pitch\n\n*and this beautiful, average english, love it.\n\n---------------------------\n\nPOLISH\nDwa lata temu bardzo się nudziłem, postanowiłem więc poszukać jakiegoś darmowego, przeglądarkowego managera piłkarskiego. Trafiłem na ten tytuł, i od tamtej pory się z nim nie rozstałem. Wtedy grałem conajmniej dziesięć godzin tygodniowo, a teraz od początku istnienia SM na Steamie, nie odinstalowałem go. Gdyby porównać tą wersje do przeglądarkowej, można byłoby powiedzieć, że ta produkcja zaliczyła ogromny progress. Nie ma takiego czegoś jak "niedopracowanie", nie licząc języków (szczególnie polskiego, nie wiem jak to wygląda w innych) i boiska 2D. Jest też o wiele mniej błędów, tych w grze i tych z zapisem gry, lecz wciąż się zdarzają. Dużym plusem jest również zawartość bazy danych, warto wspomnieć że jest ona własnością "soccerwiki", przez co ratingi graczy są momentami dość śmieszne. Nie jest to oczywiście żaden minus, jest nawet trochę ciekawiej, lecz czasami monotonnie. Już w menu kariery możemy zobaczyć wiele funkcji, jak treningi, skauting itp. na dodatek możemy ulepszyć nasz stadion, szkółkę juniorów, centrum medyczne, skauting, baze treningową itd. Jest więc co robić, na pewno się nie znudzisz. A to nie wszystkie zalety, więcej znajdziesz ich już w grze. I jeszcze dwie, bardzo ważne rzeczy - gra jest regularnie aktualizowana, twórcy wciąż dodają nowe rzeczy, więc wkrótce SM może stać się cholernie dobrym managerem, który będzie konkurował z tymi płatnymi. Drugą rzeczą jest to, że nie jest to gra "pay2win". Co prawda w grze można znaleźć mikropłatności, lecz ograniczają się one tylko do dodatkowego slotu zapisu gry, zakontraktowania piłkarza natychmiastowo czy też by odkryć potencjał jednego z piłkarzy.\n\nPodsumowanie:\n+ baza danych\n+ masa funkcji zarządzania klubem\n+ zero pay2win (nie musisz wydawać, a i tak możesz być najlepszy)\n+ ciągłe aktualizacje usprawniające rozgrywkę, dodające do niej nowe rzeczy\ni wiele, wiele więcej.\n\n- tłumaczenie niektórych języków\n- bugi (choć i tak jest ich mniej)\n\n+/- boisko 2d","November 8, 2015","true","74.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","9","9","3","0"

Its really fun if you just wanna pass some time or you're really bored. It would be great if they keep it a free-to-play but i wont mind paying a small sum for a more complete game which is more realistic..thats what they gotta do if they wanna compete with Football Manager. So, here are cons which could prove to be helpful in developing the SM17 game hopefully:\n- Unrealistic ratings. Most average players are 85+ rated and this is too unrealistic..developers should give more effort to giving ratings similar to Fifa, cuz thats the only football game out there with realistic ratings. Players like Sven Bender should not be 91 rated.\n- The results are very predictable. There should be more pressure given to managers to think hard and bump up their tactical game.\n- Narrow variety of features and customization.\n- No option to choose the currency of the in-game money.\n- Not enough changes made from SM15.\nOnce again, I dont mind paying for a game which is a few bucks well spent, FM16 is a great game but overpriced, so if SM17 is going to be around 2,3$ for a better and more complete game, its probably more thoughtful than keeping it as a free-to-play.","May 28","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a simple way pf managing a wide range of teams. Though if you want an in-depth game this isn't the type for you. You basically buy and sell players and set up your sqaud; you do upgrade facilities and players get injured but it doesn't change much.\n\nThere are in game purchases which gives you more money for buying players.

Which is sneaky.\n\nThe scorelines and games are quite realistic unlike your my mate who has 100 shots and wins 31-0 in a friendly they're realistic.\n\nI like the randomness of outcomes you could be in a winning league situation and then keep losing in the last five games and qualify for the Europa League next year.\n\nThis game is easy to learn by yourself and can get quite addictive. So overall I would rate the game 8.25/10!\n\nPeople also say this is unprotective by suspicious looking things though it's really not. Trust me your 100% per cent safe :)","December 21, 2015","true","11.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I am enjoying playing what I feel is a simpler version of Football Manager and it is the simplicity of it that I like. Of course it could be improved by adding more realism to match ratings, matches themselves and player star ratings (outside of matches). Scouting would also be nice to not need credits for but it does not make anything compulsory to pay for which helps boost the games credibility. Overall, I do like this game and I was surprised at the level of quality considering it is a free game.

I wanted so hard to like this. But I can't. Here's why. This game has so many major flaws it's unbelievable. I know it's free but this is just autism. Straight up autism. I really wanted to type this because most of the reviews are "wy u no use steam itz so eazy nuuuuuub gooooosh ♥♥♥♥ dev ♥♥♥♥ dev ♥♥♥”\n\n- Crap AI: The AI is unbelievable. The goalkeepers are emberasing. I've watched them run the ball into there own net. That's great. Defenders will do it too. Strikers can't get a damn shot on target! How hard is it! I can freaking do it with my fat ♥♥♥ how are they fluffing every shot unless there right in front of the net?The most dangerous shots you have a game is five. Five. Everything else that's "dangerous" is them saying LOOK HOW FAR I CAN SHOOT IT! *fluffs ball* Oh and gotta love the goalkeepr not grabbing the ball that's right ♥♥♥♥ing there. MMMMM LOVE IT!\n- Laughable budget- The money you get is just plain wrong. Manage the richest team in the world? Here's ten mil. Players that would fit your club are 50 mil. DOn't like it? Pay for cash injection. Either with real money or grind hardcore for the managing points that take longer and longer to get. Now listen I understand you guys gotta make money I get it I get it. But really? That low? You expect me to with the Champions League with no good substitutes and just pray my players don't get ebola for five months ruining my career. By the waaaay the board wants you to win the leaaaaague. HOW ABOUT A CASH INJECTION????? Heeeeeey the transfer window is open. Kind of hard to get all those world class players with one dollar. HOW ABOUT A CASH INJECTION????? The transfer window is gonna close soon. Maybe you can get all your shortlisted players if YOU GOT A CASH INJECTION!!!!! Transfer window is closed. GET THE CASH INJECTION ANYWAYS!!!!!!!\nUnrealistic Results - I'll be top of the table destroying title contenders. Looses 3-0 to a team facing relegation. I know it happens sometimes in real life but not every team I manage will loose to a freaking team gasping for points. How does ♥♥♥♥ing paris loose to Tollouse 4-0?????????? I bet Bayern looses 6-0 to Hamburg right? Logic.\nBearly any tactics - Theres bearly any tactics and some clearly don't work. Got a 1-0 lead over a team who would normally tear you a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? Well let's just go on very defensive that should work. Wait you can't tell them to just hold possesion. Oh your defenders just gave up the ball. Oh hey there scored 4 goals. Mmmmmmkaaaaaaay. Can I tell them to stop trying to go for super long shots? Can I tell them to quit passing it out of bounds? Can I tell my ♥♥♥♥ing world class 50k a week defender to stop passing it right ♥♥♥♥ing to them in front of my net? CAN I? NO! NO I CAN'T!\n\nNow I know I've bin saying a lot of negatives but lets talk some positives\n\n- It's free.\n\n- Theres so many clubs to manage. I never cared for managing a team in Qatar. But knowing it's there fills me with happieness.\n- Because it bearly takes up any space I can happily uninstall with no hasle.\n- I don't need to refund it.\n\nI want to love this game and because I am an abused wife I will keep playing with this abusive husband hoping that it will one day love me and award me for all my loyalty. But we know it won't. Please avoid the abuse. For all of you saying it's better then paying $50 for FM. If $50 saves me from cancer.

I appreciate a slow game, where you don't have to be in front of the screen all the time, but this game is too slow in a sense that you cannot do anything really. There are only a few functions in this game, definitely not a full game so far. Many things do not make sense, such as shots on goal from my team 15, shots on goal from opponent 2 - my team loses the game 0:2 or 1:2. No matter what I did, it always goes like this. Imagine how the score looks like when the opponent team has 6 or 7 shots on goal...you guessed it. I have read this issue from other players as well. It feels imbalanced and unfair. If you do not fire half of your team (you will still have plenty of players) you will be bankrupt.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/llDracoll/recommended/407120/","llDracoll","Siggu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/llDracoll/","41 products in account","Before taking anything into consideration, one must take into account that there's literally no reason to play this if you can afford to buy Football Manager, as it's better in anything you can think about... except price, of course. This does give Soccer Manager a solid niche as the poor man's football management game, and it does not do bad in that regard.\n\nNow, let's get to the game itself.\n\nPros:\n+ If you ever played FM (Especially up to FM09), you'll be able to navigate quite easily.\n+ Extremely lightweight. You could teach Sports Interactive a thing or two in that regard :P\n+ Wide league selection. Nothing near FM, of course, but bigger than several not-free football games. *glares at FIFA and PES*\n+ The microtransactions are not intrusive at all.\n\nNeutral:\n~ I'd take the splash screen out of this version, to be frank. I would simply replace it with some "Login with Facebook" option available in every screen, but not a dedicated screen for it.\n~ There is no option to create customized formations, but I can give it a pass. It's not easy (In terms of it being reflected in the engine. If Football Manager can struggle, then why not this?) and... I guess it has to be portable and multiplatform.\n~ It's not exactly the most realistic thing in the world. Mostly comparable to FM Mobile. Expect some crazy moves... but it can add in the flavor.\n\nNegative:\n- Somehow the game does not look as well at 1366x768 than in 2015. For instance, I have to scroll down in the tactics screen to see the entire pitch.\n- There are several interface issues that were not fixed from 2015. Several "intuitive" actions that cannot be done. For instance, you cannot pick players from the squad screen, and you cannot sort players by star rating in the tactics screen. There are others, but I want to keep this short: The number of clicks that are necessary to perform an action should be reduced. And add some kind of indicator for hyperlinks in news posts.\n- Some leagues have the wrong format. For instance, Argentina uses 20 teams and no average point system instead of 30 and average points.\n- The Copa Sudamericana does not exist, and the Libertadores uses the same format as the Sudamericana.\n- The translations are a loooooong way to go.\n\ntl;dr What I said at first - good if you cannot have FM. Stay away otherwise. The story *could* be different on mobile platforms, but I can't test that.","February 29","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I find it to be far less complicated than football manager and and for me is more addictive. I have played with one club my entire time and it really is a blast.\n\nThe only problems with the game is microtransactions, which I understand why they are in the game, as it is free. I however have not bought any of the coins and have had no need to. If you however want to have two saves for example you will need about 1000 of these coins. Another problem is with all the pathetic backpasses that lead you to concead absolutely stupid goals and is really frustrating to watch.\n\nOverall I would definately reccommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the beautiful game.","May 31","true","67.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
