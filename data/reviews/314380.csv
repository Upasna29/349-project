Unfortunately, broken gameplay, poor design decisions, and a buggy client make it really hard for me to recommend Lantern Forge in this stage of development. The game isn't marked as Early Access - it really should be, since very little about its gameplay or aesthetics feel polished enough to be a final released game.\n\nEssentially: Lantern Forge's combat system is crippled by its own controls on top of balance issues, while its survival aspect lacks challenge. The game has limited content to explore, and story-wise, the game provides no plot, no choices, and no sense of urgency to motivate me to keep advancing.\n\nGameplay Problems:\n\nMovement issues: Controlling your character is awkward at best in both movement schemes. Mouse-based movement, which was the only form of movement available when I first wrote this review, was completely broken due to bad click detection (leading the character to start mining if you clicked anywhere near a rock), bad collision detection (getting stuck on thin trees that the character didn't seem to be anywhere near) and a complete absence of pathfinding (walking into a wall when a door is less than a block away).\n\nThe devs later implemented a W-for-forward-movement-based-on-mouse-position movement scheme. Although it's *better*, it's only preferable in the same way that getting the flu is preferable to getting pneumonia, because in exchange for fixing the click detection and pathfinding issues, it hamstrings your ability to move effectively in combat. More on this in the next point.\n\nCombat, Part 1: All combat is click-based. You have to hold down the cursor over an enemy to continue attacking, but due to the poor implementation of click detection, it's trial and error to figure out where you should be clicking to actually hit an enemy, and good luck if the enemy is moving. Now recall that all movement is *also* mouse-based. Because you have to click on the enemy to attack, there's no way to strafe around and get into a better position without interrupting your attack. Playing as an archer or mage? Tough. You're going to start running towards the enemy anyway if you misclick, might as well as put on heavy armor.\n\nCombat, Part 2: Combat Mode and useless hotkeys make your combat skills painful to actually use. This game relies on the Diablo II control scheme, where left-click attacks and right-click uses a single registered skill; while you can register a skill to a hotkey, hitting that hotkey doesn't activate the skill - it just switches your right click. This was tolerable 10 years ago; it feels absurd today. Worse, you have to be in Combat Mode to even activate skills; if you're in Build Mode, which you will be for the majority of the game, right-click performs context-dependent actions on the surrounding landscape instead (building, farming, mining).\n\nIn effect, to even use your character's skills instead of bashing enemies, you have to 1. make sure you're wielding a weapon and not just swinging your currently equipped tool, 2. make sure you're in combat mode, and 3. make sure your current right-click skill is actually usable by your equipped weapon type (so no bows for sword skills). This needs to happen every time you run into an enemy.\n\nCombat, Part 3: Enemies are both unbalanced and cheap. All melee enemies in the game rush you as soon as they enter the screen, as long as they have a path to you. The prevalence of mob spawners in this game means that's usually 3-4 enemies at once, and the problem with this is that at the same level as you, each enemy does about 5x the damage you do to it per hit, since all your weapons have absurdly low damage-per-hit (if high attack speed). Your character's regeneration rate is high, but not that high, and the lack of usable AoE skills in this game mean that while you bash ineffectually at one mob, three others are chewing on your face.\n\n(Knights, the ostensible melee class, have only 1 AoE skill which costs 50% of starting mana if you don't have any mana-boosting items. It's also based on your weapon's damage-per-hit... you can see the problem with this.)\n\nThe end result of this is that when dungeon-delving, you'll usually be stuck grinding against enemies 5 levels below you because anything higher is too hard, and getting appropriately low-level equipment drops. This gets tedious rapidly, and the problem is this is the entirety of the game.\n\nDesign Problems:\n\n1. All progression is grinding. Past the first two tiers of items (copper and iron), I realized there was absolutely nothing new that would be added by digging deeper and hunting for later tiers. No skills to unlock, no bosses, and no new mechanics, besides a numbers boost and even-more-absurdly-overpowered enemies. The game's complete lack of story or even a framing device just makes this worse, because while you *can* build your town and collect all the vendors, there's no reason to.\n\n2. Survival is a cakewalk. Once you have even a small-sized farm set up, the survival aspect of the game becomes trivial, and you can probably feed yourself entirely off wild respawning apple trees. Furthermore, there's zero consequences for dying that I've noticed besides moving to your spawn point, not even an item drop.\n\nOther Issues:\n\n1. Aesthetics and UI are poorly implemented. There's no minimap, with only a (x, y, z) numbers-based position marker indicating where you are, so good luck finding your way back if you get lost deep underground (or you could just die and respawn, but how cheap is that). The crafting window is difficult to navigate for several reasons, and shortcuts for moving items are not indicated in any documentation. There's also no way to remap controls.\n\n2. Bugs. I've crashed to desktop once, and noticed memory leaks in the form of slowdowns after a few hours. Background music seems to be buggy in that the daytime music starts playing at midnight instead of dawn, and every so often, a weapon you're trying to craft will spawn with 0 attack.\n\nI've come back to Lantern Forge twice since I first started, and each time it's disappointed me greatly with how little it's improved on what I'd think are fundamental problems. Although I'd have sincerely enjoyed this game with some fixes, I can't recommend it to anyone at this point in time.","July 26, 2014","false","14.7"," 135 of 161 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","135","161","0","6"

But to be completely honest, it tries to emulate so many games that it doesn't know what it wants to be.  Basically you start in the woods with nothing and have to survive, build things, and explore dungeons.  Sounds good on paper, but all parts of it are bare-bones and nothing is really fleshed out.\n\nIt doesn't focus on the survival like Don't Starve\nIt doesn't focus on the sandbox stuff like Minecraft/Terraria\nIt doesn't focus on the dungeon-crawling like Torchlight/Diablo\n\nIt's got incomplete bits of all of those without specializing or expanding any of those and it ends up as kind of a bland, forgettable mess. It gives a bad impression right from the start with the controls. It has "W" moving you towards the cursor...but no full WASD controls, which it SORELY needs. Gathering resources has a pretty crazy range, so you'll find yourself chopping trees/grass/rocks from 10 feet away with the same bland animation, which makes it feel really bad as well.\n\nThe survival aspects aren't challenging at all.  Night brings monsters, but you can easily craft a bed.  Once it's crafted, you just need to right clock and bam...no more night.  Food is insanely easy to craft as well.  There might as well not even be Hunger and Fatigue meters because they're ridiculously easy to get filled and move on. There's no point in the sandbox stuff because there's no multiplayer and thus no one to ever really see or use what you've built.\n\nAnd the dungeon crawler stuff is pretty limited to clunky-feeling combat in one of the 'big 3' paths of melee/ranged/magic, where splitting between them just hurts you in the long run.\n\nSo in the end, it's really repetitive/grindy and I'd say avoid it, unfortunately.","October 25, 2014","false","3.8"," 71 of 86 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","71","86","5","3"

A shame considering the game seems mostly complete in terms of overall design and such.   Just needed a few more months of content addition and bug testing.\n\nThere's no point in buying since it will almost definitely never be completed.

Game's got a lot of potential. But I'm kind of leery. After all, something similar happened with Towns, even down to the game is dead, game is back in dev.

It showed a LOT of potential. It was fun for a bit too. Kind of like Dont Starve, but more RPGish.  I dont remember if it was officially Early Access, but it should have been because it was in a "late beta" is playable but kind of bare bones and needs some bug stomping and balancing and the devs promised more content.\n\nSo I sat back and waited after playing for a bit and then getting frustrated and annoyed at the incompleteness. Seemed like it was worth waiting for.\n\nUntil the Devs declared they didnt get enough sales so the game would no longer be updated because they had to get jobs and couldnt work on it full time.\n\nThen work on it part time? Nope. Its dead now.\n\nThey couldnt even be arsed to finish their game, when its mostly complete and just needs some polishing.","April 12, 2015","false","6.0"," 64 of 89 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","64","89","3","12"

Instead we are stuck with the W moving towards your cursor, making movement nothing but an irritating chore.\n\n"Combat"  is clunky and imprecise.  Click on an enemy to attack it... except most times your character will just move forward because of the aforementioned movement controls.\n\nI can't play this game for longer than 30 minutes without it crashing or glitching out. I've also had my save data corrupted once as well.  All that work down the drain.\n\nNear-constant runtime errors,  glitches and bugs (sometimes my character's hair will disapper. Sometimes the animal sprites are replaced with large blinking white boxes.  Other times my hair stays visible but my armor disappears.  And further still, sometimes my character is just replaced with a big ol' white box.)\n\nWhen questioned on the forums about this, we were given empty platitudes.  How do I know? Because I reinstalled it and tried playing it again recently. Sure enough, the game crashed within 20 minutes but not before my character disappeared and walked around as a floating patch of hair.  The animals were replaced with glitching white boxes again too, for good measure.\n\nIn short, this game is a broken glitchy mess and I can honestly say it was a complete waste of money.\nPerhaps my game time would have been a bigger number by now if the game didn't crash as much as it had.\n\nAvoid this game if you value your sanity.\n\n\n\n","December 1, 2015","false","27.1"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

There are a number of elements that work together well here, from making simple shops, trading with your merchants, farming crops, crafting and just decoration.

You begin by building stairs down which generates a whole new underground map each level you explore and there’s nothing apparent limiting how many levels down you want to go at any time up to the cap of 90.  You do this again and again, every staircase down increases the difficulty and generating a whole new area with better loot and material.  Though each level is different they aren't very unique, you'll quickly find that if you've seen one level you've seen them all and it slowly becomes frustrating as each staircase adds one more load screen.

Once you get there, if there are any surprises, boss fights, secrete treasures or other gems I've not found or heard of them, its simply another layer and load screen.  When you start to level up from the grind you'll have the option of the three traditional classes, melee guy, range guy, or magic guy with a sprinkling of an all encompassing utility option.

First the good: The combat is fun (although simple), and the RPG mechanics give it a little extra flavor that other similar games lack. Now, the bad.\n- There is only one surface level, so you can't build 2-story houses.\n- There's no reason to explore the surface. Anything you find there can be found underground. But the surface is featureless anyway. The only terrain feature is water, and it just acts like another tile type.\n- Farming is fairly useless, because you will always have plenty of food from killing enemies.\n- There may be 100 levels underground, but when they are all the same, what's the point? I've gotten down to about level 50, and haven't seen much different from the first 10 levels.\n- Combat isn't balanced, Mages will kill you a lot quicker than you can close on them.\n- Pathing is terrible. You character is constantly getting stuck on corners in the tunnels and on small trees on the surface.\n- No WASD movement. (Seriously guys?)\n- There's no reason to build a house. Monsters attack at night, but you can use a bed to instantly turn it to day time, so you never really have to face the night.\n\nSo, that's my opinion. I hope the game gets better, because it is kind of charming, but right now I simply can't recommend it. This game really should have been labelled as early access.","September 25, 2014","false","21.2"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"

Those issues include the very obviously clunky movement scheme(s), the lack of real content beyond cosmetic crafted items, the almost missing survival aspect, and many others.\n\nMy biggest gripe is probably with the "Town Center" aspect - what is the purpose of having these vendors come and set up for only yourself.  It is an obvious nod to Terreria, but with even more limitations.  I would much prefer to have other NPCs as if I were actually creating a town - with houses, shops, people walking around, etc.  I wish Terreria had this too...\n\nThe second major issue I have is that progression in this game just doesn't flow smoothly at all - too much work for too little payoff.\n\nThe game can be enjoyable, but after some serious playtime with it you will more than likely wonder why continue.  Again, if they can fix or change these things, my review would also change.","December 5, 2014","false","15.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

There are a few game breaking bugs and the UI in general is not great. I really hope the creators continue to update it and fix it.\n\nExploration:\nThe biomes are all very different.\nThere is no map that I could find. Though in it's place there is X,Y coords of where you are and where your bind place is.\nThe path finding is not great. When you click to go somewhere most the time you end up stuck on a block or tree with your character trying, unsuccessfully, to get around it.  You also end up hitting trees, logs, and rocks on accident.\n\nSurvival:\nI think this part of the game is almost too easy. Maybe I'm just used to Don't Starve and I think after this first day I shouldn't be able to have a pack full of food. Also almost every tree dropping a sapling is over kill. I wish food and trees were a little scarcer, only because:\nI really enjoy the farming in this game. Each plant has it's own grow time so if you plant two carrots next to each other one might grow in a couple game hours and the other in days.\n\nCombat:\nThe combat is a little clunky. I think that the UI could be improved so when you go into combat mode you can't accidentally select an item to use that's not a weapon. Also I wish that when your current weapon breaks that it would switch to your next weapon automaticly.\nAs I've played both ranged classes it's easy enough to have monsters follow you down a hall and kill them as they come at you.  Sometimes when going from your special abilities (right clicking) back to normal attack your character wont do anything few seconds.\n\nCrafting:\nThere is alot to craft in this game weapons, armor, gems, enchantments, decor. When you make certain items they have sockets to gem. You can also add enchantments to your items.\nThe Crafting UI leaves alot to be desired. If you are using the smelter to make pitch for torches you then have to close the ui the reopen to make the torches. There is also a bug where the stations don't show you everything they can make and you have to re-open them.\n\nOther than than the UI being unfinished and the crashing. I am really enjoying this game a lot.","July 19, 2014","true","35.4"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

Yes, the devs sort of left us hanging and it hurts since the game is very fun and has a lot of potential to be something more, but the game you do get is very enjoyable and has a lot to do for that $10, and has replay value.\n\nThe devs have also been poking around and patching a bit lately and have improved performance (one of my biggest negatives since changing z-levels was painfully long) and added some content.\n\nThe characters are fun to play and build, there's several tiers of crafting, lots of gathering and building to do, lots of exploring of procedurelly generated open world/underground to do, several different types of biomes both above and below ground with a nice variety of mobs and content to experience.\n\nFor the whopping $10 I think this game is definitely worth it - you can easily play enough hours - and have fun doing so - to make it (more than) worth the cost.  I feel some of the negative reviews are way, way, too over the top in criticizing what is a decently feature and content filled game for a low price.\n\nI could definitely come up with a list of other early access games or even released games that cost more money and/or were far more disappointing.  Some people just have too much time on their hands to troll and be negative and/or have ridiculous expectations for very low cost indie games.\n\nPS - I have over 46 hours played, mostly before recent patching.  The top negative review is by someone with 6 hours played and IMO it's kind of silly for someone to be complaining about a game being incomplete when they haven't played enough to complete what IS there.","October 9, 2015","true","46.1"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

It's a mixture of Harvest Moon with FATE and admittedly doesn't feel too good in both areas due to the numerous bugs I've encountered so far. One of the most prominent is the random times your character seems to be blurred out by a white block by equipping certain tools or armor. {For me, it was a copper axe, then copper greaves}. The game lacks any sort of tutorial and is a bit of a deep leap when trying to figure out how to begin unless you watch players on youtube. It does however boast a rich enviroment of building. The other thing that irks me about this game is  it feels as if the walls do not properly connect. Also, quite a few items boast no pictures in the inventory or play screen {Bricked Items, Iron Curiass}. This game needs a lot of spit and polish because I would recommend it to anyone because I've decently high standards when it comes to "Role Playing Games". The interesting thing about this game though, if you put up with the bugs, is the ability to build a town center you can teleport to, teleporters you can place underground, and merchant townspeople. The townspeople however do tend to overcharge. You can't sell most items for very much but it's still good to play around with. Not sure about the item refresh rate. I can't say I'd recommend it, at least not until it is a fair bit more stable as it also tends to crash randomly and for no reason. You lose large amounts of items in this fashion.","July 19, 2014","false","11.4"," 35 of 61 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","35","61","0","5"

Add 20+ hours to the actual playtime shown.)\n\nPros:   This has the basic crafting element with your other 2d/3d indie sandbox games but with a twist. First off the game has just as much emphasis on survival as it does crafting. However, unlike Don’t Starve when your hunger meter gets down to zero you don’t die. Instead you have less than 10 HP and are very fragile.  This allows you to still craft, build, farm, etc. at your house but will keep you on your toes.\n\nYou can make your own farm by planting the seeds and harvesting them. Then you can cook food from crafting ovens. In addition to that you can trap animals like, cows, sheep, etc. so that they can produce milk, wool that can be used as crafting materials. That in its self is a fun meta game.\nIn addition to a hunger system if you take the mage path there is meter for mana regen. You ether need to sleep in your bed to refresh or you can make teas, etc. This balances out magic as it is powerful.\n\nAlso, everything from swords, armor, wants, etc. has a durability. They get worn over time and unlike other game you have a reason to make the same pick axe or armor over again. Also, when you die you take a durability hit. This really adds another layer of dynamic strategy to the game.\nThere is a nice RPG element and you can chose, mage, warrior, archer, or adventure path. There are no classes just a skill tree system.\n\nThe game is fully launched but the developers are continuing to make updates and improvements to the game all the time. Tones of replay value here and worth the asking price of $10 USD.\n\nCons:   While the bird’s eye view is a nice touch, sometimes it can be difficult to see certain angles when playing blocks while building your house. Game used mouse instead of WASDE controls. At times this can make combat annoying but after a while you will get used to it. Combat through doorways while in dungeons can be annoying when you right click it closes the door instead of combat. This can be resolved by letting the enemy pass through the doorway first.","July 19, 2014","true","9.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

If you are too, and you grew up playing a lot of the old school PC rpgs, you will fall right in love with Lantern Forge. Don't get me wrong, gamers of all ages can find something to love about this game, but in my opinion it hearkens back to the days of yore. Those days of RPG classics such as Diablo, Diablo II, Ultima VII, Ultima Online, etc. It has taken elements of all those games and mixed them in a pot with Minecraft, Harvest Moon, Rune Factory, and Terraria to name a few.\n\nYou can build a base/ house/ mansion/ entire town. You can build shops that will attract merchants to buy/sell. You can tame animals and keep them close to home so you can collect their furs to craft ever more supplies. You can grow crops of all different types, (there are a ton, and they all have different growth cycles). You can build stairs into the ground that will take you down into a dungeon that is might as well be infinitely huge. There are rare and unique weapons and armor. Hell, there are even rare and unique tools, which are what you use to till the land, cut down trees, mine ores, and harvest crops. It literally has elements of every cool RPG/survival sim/hack and slash/ dungeon crawler ever made. To avoid a massive wall of text, I'll stop there, (because I could go on.......and on).\n\nThe graphics in the game aren't the greatest, but this is yet another case of content and gameplay > graphics. Let's face it, most mainstream games are all graphics and no content. They are like watching a movie rather than playing a game. That is why many people are turning to indie developers, and the developers of this game are great. You can really tell that they are fans of the games that inspired Lantern Forge. You can also tell that they are fans of their own game, because although their are some UI woes, everything is fully functional, fully immersive, and most of all, fully fun to play.\n\nI sincerely hope that this game catches more steam, (get it?) and that a ton of people purchase it, because I'd love to see it continue to get developed. Oh, I didn't even mention how every world is procedurally generated. That equals infinite replayability for a measly ten bucks.\n\nSo to summarize my gaming brethren.....what are you waiting for? Show support for awesome indie games and buy this gem.","September 24, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Developpers seem to be active, so that shouldn't be a problem. If a few bugs and a somewhat rough UI do not bother you, this is a really promising game, and already really enjoyable.\n\nPersonal rating : 7/10 at the moment, could go up to 8 or even 9 maybe (taking into account the price), depending on how it evolves.","July 19, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Having the movement control be the same control used to mine objects was probably a very bad idea, and combined with a complete lack of pathing (you will have to manually click to get to a corner THEN go around it, otherwise your character tries to walk through a wall) and control can be frustrating. The lack of any real in game help is also frustrating.\n\nThat said, if you can get use to the controls and get past the initial learning curve, the game is actually a great deal of fun. It plays like a mix of Minecraft and Diablo with the ability to set up a merchant right outside your front door thrown in. Getting your first real weapon is a pain, and until then you're stuck using your pick to fight off anything you encounter because you can't craft weapons without a workbench that requires copper to make, but once you have it and one or two levels the game is a tad overly easy. It is however still a lot of fun.\n\nI would recommend it to anyone who likes Minecraft and/or Terraria. The Diablo-esque aspect is fun but the overly easy combat and heavy emphasis on crafting makes the game less fun if you're expecting that sort of thing, especially early on. But it really shines as a Minecraft-like experience once you get past the terrible control scheme and complete lack of in-game tutorial to teach said controls. There is a help function but it only teaches the basics of crafting.","July 20, 2014","true","24.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

To start off this review is for the game as it is right now, ver. 1.04.\n\nTo begin, the game reminds me of playing games like (the failure of a unfinished game) Towns or say Gnomoria but without the management of people and focused on your character alone.  You start out gathering sticks and stones and make your tools to go further with your Mining/Foraging to open up even more items to craft, etc etc.\n\n(as others have said it, think Minecraft/Terraria in an adventure/rpg style game)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE MAP\n\nThe world has some nice variety to it as it currently has 8 different areas in the world of Lantern Forge; Each having their own unique tilesets, trees, and plants that grow in those areas.\n\n-Grassland\n-Forest\n-Desert\n-Tundra\n-Swamp\n-Tropical\n-Graveyard\n-Fairy\n\nAs you progress in the game you go further and further underground opening new levels to explore.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE SKILLS/COMBAT\n\nSkills are divided into four classes and four tiers, you are not limited to putting points into one class but in order to invest points into a higher tier you will need to at lease invest 5 points in the tier below it in order to have access to it.\n\nCombat is fairly straight forward, left click enemy to attack it, hitting space bar swaps from COMBAT/CRAFTING mode with will open 4 slots for abilities from the talent tree (for whichever you choose)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nCRAFTING/BUILDING\n\nRight now, crafting can seem a little confusing to some as the requirements for items will hopefully one day be clickable to see where and/or what you need to make the materials themselves, along with not knowing which crafting table you need in order to make the item(s).  Other than that it is perfectly fine and goes parallel with the new zones/levels of the map as you progress through the game.\n\nWith the game you can also craft walls and such to make yourself a shelter, which is handy as right now as creatures cannot break in to attack you.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs with any EA game, there are bugs, but I have yet to run into one that hampered my game-play.  In the end I find this game more than worth the $10 price, as, depending on what you wanna do in it, you can easily play many hours out of the game.  As the game progresses through the patches I will update the review as anything notable is added.  In the end its up to you if you want to play this game, so look around and watch some game-play videos on YouTube to get an idea on it.\n\nGAME ON! :D\n\n","July 24, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The graphics are awesome, I loved the different biomes that made each game unique.\n\nThere were minor bugs that were usually corrected by restarting the game.  Some gameplay issues I saw that would make things more enjoyable:\n\n1. Give us access to a starter weapon like a stone sword.  The first few minutes can be rough until you start mining and collect copper/copper forge.\n2. There's too much ground clutter.  You could cut the amount of rocks/twigs/trees by 75% and there would still be plenty. This would also encourage people to plant all those saplings that drop.\n3. Slow down the leveling process.  I found myself constantly fighting stuff way below my skill level by the time I got enough ore to create the next level pickaxe.  For example, a little while ago  I was level 14 and trying to scrape up enough iron to make an iron pickaxe.  Slow it down so we have time to explore each level, gear up, and be fighting mobs our own level.\n4. Portals.  I love the idea, but you have to mine down ten levels to get to the silver you need to create them.  That's a lot of load times.  Maybe make them accessable earlier in gameplay so by the time the player gets to level five and starts getting sick of the load screen, they have access to it?\n5. Loading map deaths.  Most of my deaths seem to occur when the game lags while loading a map.\n\nThe above are little complaints.  I still recommend this game and can't wait to see what comes next.","October 11, 2014","true","255.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

So I will recommend it as a "yes" with many caveats which you might want to read through before dropping your cash on the game right now.\n\nI play a lot of sandbox, city-building, and simulation games.  This one drew my attention as I was looking at the newly available games.\n\nI wanted to like this game.  I tried hard.  It's pretty, has enormous depth and goals which I have yet to achieve, and I'm sure a lot of re-playability.  But it has some flaws which prevent me from achieving happiness with this game, which made me quit earlier than I would have liked because they were so central to the game play experience.\n\nOne, the lack of ability to rotate the perspective of the character, is fatal for me.  Once you put up walls, the only way to see behind them is to demolish the wall, build what you wanted to build, and then rebuild the wall and hope that the engine lets you put the wall back in the right place.  For example I built a fort with log walls and then wanted to build farms up close to the walls so as to utilize my available space.  I can't precisely place torches or other lighting sources on the inside of walls on the bottom part of the fort.  So, the southern walls of everything that gets built will not be able to be decorated.  It's probably a minor annoyance to some, but as a sandbox builder, I want that rotate control.\n\nTwo, I somehow managed to zoom out.  Whatever controls I had hit in frustration to do so, I could never figure out how to recover as the in-game help was well, no help at all.  I had to delete that save game and rebuild.  Annoying.\n\nThree, no WASD support??  I finally figured out that I could hold down W and move the mouse to achieve some pathing, but that's a big red flag and terribly annoying.  The entire industry has already made us gamers accept WASD as the movement keys, and heck, my keyboard has 4 red WASD keys.  So don't make me learn a new interface.\n\nFour, no hotkeys?  See WASD above... lack of hotkeys (or at least the ability to find a hotkey reference) made this game very taxing to keep mousing around the user interface.  At least "I" for Inventory seemed to work just fine.\n\nNow, for the things I did like... bows.  Lots of food to find, grow, cook and eat.  Bunnies that drop furs that you can use to make fur clothing.  Grass beds in the beginning.  Apple trees that drop apples.  I like the rustic-ness one can achieve with all of the wood items and grass.  I like the feel of starting out as a hunter-gatherer and then moving into agriculture.  The ability to crate up tame animals and carry them back to base to release them (unlike another game which makes you lead the animals by taunting them with food).\n\nThis game could be a 10 - but instead I have to call it a 6 or 7 overall.  Big, deep world, lots of things to do, but lacking fundamentals in terms of expected user interface.  These are the equivalent to me of having a spanking resume for a high-paying job but noticing as you sit down for the interview at the number one company in the world that your resume is filled with spelling, grammar and punctuation errors.\n\nI'd be willing to spend more time playing the game if these items were fixed in future patches.","August 24, 2014","true","9.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

For now, the balance is still usable, but in future, I can't imagine the PVP... I have 800 HP and I can only deal 20~30 damage per cast...\n- The craft screen UI should be adjusted.

And please notice that craft screen UI have some BUG, some times I need to active the craft screen again and again to load all the recipes.\n\n- After days of playing, it becomes less attractive.

I can nolonger defeat the monsters above the ground.\n- In easy mode, the wild enemy should be easier.... maybe the level of enemy should be calculated with the deepest level player went, not the level of player. For a newbee, underground is far more safier than above the ground, unless I jail myself with walls and fences.\n- Monsters destory their den sooo easy... You need to balance the data. For now, the balance is still usable, but in future, I can't imagine the PVP... I have 800 HP and I can only deal 20~30 damage per cast...\n- The craft screen UI should be adjusted. The function of search the recipe with some material should be separated from recipe list. For example you can add another slot to put an item in, in order to search the recipe. And please notice that craft screen UI have some BUG, some times I need to active the craft screen again and again to load all the recipes.\n\n- After days of playing, it becomes less attractive. Every upgrade is same : damage increase. I hope there will be more content for me to experience, some different skill or so. Hey take a look at diablo!\n\n- Oh, and please store the game saves at steam cloud, I think I have take my USB disk to office every day if I want to play the saved game at my home.","August 3, 2014","true","12.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

Every games got to start somewhere right. Just hope it does not get abandoned.\n\nMake a base, make some workbenches going, make a town center, get your NPC's up and running, throw down some stairs and start mining away.\n\nExploration can be a little dodgy with terrain generation momentarily freezing the client - otherwise it's fairly stable.\nThere's quite a lot that needs a tweaking;\nI personally feel the mob range vs your level might be a bit wide, obviously the larger hideouts have to be a challange, I have died quite a few times, but I do like a challange.\nThe UI definately needs some love, seems clunky and 'in your face'. The startup screen has little to be desired...\nHit registration can be a tad annoying at times, trying to chop down a tree and end up moving your character several times to find the 'right spot'  - would be better if the hit boxes were a little bigger.\nI absolutely adore the customization of the characters, not just the armor/weapons/trinkets etc, the skills and adjusting base stats is rather nice. Gives a feeling of uniqueness.\n\nI get a 'FairyLand' feel from the graphics, but hear nothing but Runescape from the audio, kind of trippy.

This game has been abandoned!!!!\n\nInitially I gave this game a good review, I've revised it since.  This game went too soon out of Early Access. Game is bugged and laggy.\n\nEach new game starts with a random map. And not all maps are equal. My first game, I spent hours digging to only find a few scraps of ore. And the ability to make stairs didn't even appear until my character was 16th level (game bug). My last game, lots of ore and the ability to craft stairs was available right off.  Crafting is still bugged, sometimes you have to click multiple times on whatever crafting table you're using to see all the recipes.\n\nIt tedious going from level to level in the dungeon. It's not smooth, you have to wait for the next level to load. Try going down 35 levels or 90 levels even. They've fixed that a bit with being able to contruct a teleport carry it with you and then being able to drop it anywhere you want so you can teleport back and forth, unless ofcourse you don't have the materials to make it, then it's a pain. Or you forget to drop it on the level you're on, you teleport back up, and then have to reload all the levels, one at a time.\n\nThere's 90 levels to explore. I've only gone down less then 45 (you have to count to know how many levels down you are). I have all the best armor, gems, weapons, enchantments, and my charater is max level (50) so what would be the point of playing. Unless you're into having many charaters and doing the same things over and over. There's really nothing to do now, except beautify my house or dig for more ore/coins/items to sell, but again, what's the point.\n\nWhile the dungeon floors are randomly generated, they're all still the same. You fight the same monsters on every level, except they're just a higher level then the previous.  Up top they level with you.\n\nRanged weapons are it. If you have a melee character, expect to die alot. The farther down you go, the more ranged monsters you encounter.\n\nIt doesn't look like it, but your charaters inventory is small, so you're constantly going up and down (load, drop off, load, run back to your spot and hope the stuff you couldn't pick up is still there).\n\nGame store description says 8 different biomes, I've played multiple characters and only found 3 (grass, desert, swamp) on all of them. Unless they're also counting underground (underground and 2 types of dungeons (but they're really the same, just different graphics)) and little ponds scattered around and the void (end of map), so I guess that makes 8.\n\nEdited : In the last update, I forget when that was, they added a copper lantern post  (they seemed proud of) to the game for additional light. What a utterly useless item. All I found myself doing is constantly getting stuck on it, back to torches, atleast you can walk thru those. Game is still bugged greatly. And the new patched added new game  bugs.","July 31, 2014","false","46.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

It's played in isometric view in a randomized world.\nAs always you can collect and mine ingredients and cook or craft them at various tiered workstations into other stuff. There are not a lot of flavor items however and I hope more will be added so that my base looks less boring.\nMonsters seem to spawn from the dark or monster dens.\nYou can craft vendors and have some kind of town.\nThere is no story whatsoever - sandbox only. Don't know if there is some master boss like in Minecraft.\n\nIssues with the game include: no pathfinding except between two open points straight, crashes to desktop sometimes, non-intuitive controlset and odd placement of walls and fences, also loading times on state-of-the-art machine.\nStuff I like: randomized magic loot, rpg style experience levels, (somewhat) easy to get into the game.\n\nRecommended because it's fun but needs a lot of polishing.

It's a typical RPG in many ways, but it has a fully developed food and hunger and farming that most games lack.  You can farm raw foods and then make cooked foods which restore your hunger.  The progression in the foods is done really well.  You can also craft potions - healing, mana and energy potions and others.  In addition to the potion crafting and food crafting, you can craft weapons, armor, socketable gems and random enchants.  You can also loot these items from monsters, but the crafting is well-implemented and easy to do and very deep.  There are many different biomes which hold different resources which gives a good reason to go exploring above ground.  Some of the biomes have been hard to find in order to get needed resources, but the developer has mentioned he will look into increasing certain biome spawns.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is the movement.  It's "point and click" to move instead of wasd.  My hand does get tired of clicking, but the developer has mentioned that he will look into adding wasd movement.\n\nI think $10 is a very fair price on this little gem and will bring many hours of fun.

I used to play that game day after day for months because it was so easy to get into even if you just had a few minutes to play, yet so addictive you'd usually be there for hours.  There's something about the play and pacing that's just right.\n\nThe part that's so much like Rogue is the multi-floor procedurally generated dungeon chock full of mobs, loot, and persistent modifiable terrain.  Rogue had more character customization, but in both games you may end up struggling a bit if you try to force the game to play in one certain way; instead if you step back and just think about what abilities and resources you do have, you can sometimes discover to your delight a totally different way to play.\n\nWhat's been added to this formula is an equally engaging surface world to explore, and practically another full-blown game building things and leaving your mark on the world.  Here also you shouldn't let the limitations of other games trap you into thinking there's only one way to play, i.e. survive the night, build a shelter, find some food, start a farm, farm the farm, get some weapons and tools and start exploring the dungeon, blah, blah, blah.  Once you figure it out, you can skip farming if you want, and you don't even need to build shelter - you can live like a nomad and carry your camp with you.\n\nThe game isn't without problems.  The pathfinding really needs some work, and the UI could use a lot of improvement.  The big issue for most people of course would be the crashes, and certainly these need to be fixed.   I've had a few dozen crashes so far myself, but it's only been a minor annoyance - restarting the game takes less than a minute and I find I've usually been rolled back no more than a minute or two of play.  Definitely a problem, but not enough to make me want to stop playing - I'm just having too much fun.","July 21, 2014","true","61.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can't stay in one place and grind out XP and materials. You have to explore for rare items, and you can't explore far/deep too quickly, or you get squished. Instead, you end up gradually expanding your base and tunnels, gathering materials, XP, and generally powering up at a nice rate. No grinding needed.\n\n- Building structurs is easy.\n- Crafting is straight forward but the UI could use some improvements. (you can't search for a list of items you have the ability to build)\n- Farming is simple and doesn't take an excessive amount of time. Leave your farm going while you adventure, and pick up more than enough food whenever you drop by your base.\n- No crashes (5 hours of gametime so far)\n\nThe only thing this game needs is minions and town management, which is obviously not the direction they are going in, but still. It would be shiny.","July 23, 2014","true","8.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Functionality kind of a mix between Minecraft and Terraria. but with a better character class development.\nProbably my biggest compliant is that when you level, all surface creatures level at the same rate, so you can't really venture out at night without getting killed.  You should be able to survive on the surface at night easier as you level, allowing you to travel further distances from your bases without having to hunker down each night.  If they fixed this, it make exploring much more effective and less time consuming and better game play.  Obviously certain areas could be still filled with higher level monsters, but general terrain should be more moderate.","December 3, 2014","true","27.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unless you have a clear idea of what you want to do, it'll be rather hard to figure out the best way to enjoy this. Fortunately, they have alot of variety to the game and what you are able to do with it, as well as giving you a chance to enjoy all the skills and classes you want to take or experiment with!\n\nLantern Forge can be classified as a basic RPG, but with quite a few twists. There are no real classes there, since you're not limited to only choosing one set of skills. Your equipment can be mixed and matched, so if you like to wear a mage's armor, but prefer to go Gandalf and swinging swords around, it's all good. There are some npc's to start with after you gather all the materials for a town center, so you'll have more ways to earn money, like selling crops or ditching extra gear you don't need.\n\nThe community of players for this game is large enough that they won't lead you off into the deep end if you ask any questions, and you'll find lots of post and screenshots of how people are doing. Once extra content like bosses, base-destroying monsters and extra events pop up, things will be getting interesting.\n\nThere are a few pros/cons to this game, so I'll go ahead and list them all off as I've seen them.\n\nPros:\nFairly Infinite Re-playabilitiy\nLots of variety in building things, like castle towns, manors, small towns, etc.\nVarious and assorted monsters\nPick and choose the skills and playstyles you want\nEasy to understand controls\nVery friendly gamers to help you out with questions\n\nCons:\nLots of loading screens\nIt can be very difficult to get some of the items you need to progress further into the game\nMoney is too abundant\nThe surface has monsters that are scaled to your level, so leveling up is easy\nDungeons are too small and easy. They need way more variety, as well as traps and harder monsters.\nNot enough controls, nor is there a better way to move about. Clicking around only gets you so far, and can be fatal.\n\nThis is a good game, just a bit tedious in it's control scheme.

However, even without the polish, Lantern Forge still offers an immersive, satisfying gaming experience. It lacks a comprehensive tutorial for the newcomers, but the developers and community are chock-full of advice and posts for those struggling with the initial get-go. Although, with just a bit of experimentation, it doesn't take much to figure out the gameplay mechanics and come up with your own strategy for how to get going in the world.\n\nControls can occassionally frustrate with pathing problems during combat, but holding down SHIFT will lock your character into attack mode and prevent you from just walking off toward your pointer. Combat isn't possible without some kind of weapon (no running up and fist-fighting your friendly neighborhood goblin), which limits your options severely until you're able to gather the first tier of advanced materials for class specialization. Before then, it is possible to use your starter tools (stone whatever-you-make) as a form of defense. (Not recommended for mobs). There is also a lack of bosses in this world, but the developers have stated they are planning on implementing them.\n\nLeveling up yields you points for stat calculation and skill tree building. The list of skills is not extensive and with only five points to cap out a skill, it doesn't take long to build your strength. Which leaves acquiring gear matched to your level to deal with enemies (also at your level) the basic challenge for combat. Which leads to trading.\n\nThe option to create shops for trade does seem to take some of the challenge out of the game. Copper (the in-game currency) is pretty easy to acquire, so trading with the shops can be almost too lucrative at times. It makes finding the gear you need just as easy as a visit to the merchant you've created, which unfortunately levels with you and allow you to acquire gear before you've reached the necessary underground level that would yield the same material.\n\nThis is a 2-dimensional isometric world, which limits your movements to a standard 2-dimensional format. But the graphics are engaging with a charm that has quite an appeal.\n\nAs a final product, I wouldn't recommend it. But as a work-in-progress with a dedicated development team who have stated that there is still work to do before the game can be considered final, I say the price is right.","July 28, 2014","true","43.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I am quite impressed.  I do recommend Lantern Forge.  (Why it is called that I know not.)  However, the recommendation comes with some... reservations.  That is to say, I have thoroughly enjoyed the game but I'm not sure if some of the things that I have appreciated will go over well with the majority.\n\nPro's:\n- Isometric view.  Check.\n- Multi level underground environment.  Check.\n- Procedurally generated maps with multiple "biomes."  Check.\n- Plot.  Completely absent.\n- Sandbox Game with multiple activity types.  Check.\n- Quests, missions and side quests.  Completely Absent.\n\nCon's:\n- Player pathing is...  well it needs work.\n- Player mouse control... I do tend to attack stuff accidently.  A lot.  And by stuff I mean EVERTHING.  Walls Cows Fences...  The move to button is the same as the attack button is the same as the harvest button.  Not so good but not a game breaker.\n- Combat.  It works it's just a bit basic.  So if you are looking for a Mine Craft type you will be right at home.  If you want Diablo 4... try Full Mojo Rampage.\n\nNow, by now, I know a lot of you are wondering, "Did Selva say the absence of plot and missions was a good thing?"  Why, yes, I did say that.    See, in my humble opinion, a sandbox game like this doesn’t need narrative elements to be a good game.  It doesn't have to have a "story to tell" to be enjoyable.  So far as I can tell the plot is "You are in a forest.  There are Monsters.  Try not to starve to death."  From there, you do what you bloody like.  Wish to be a nomadic hunter?  Good on you.  Want to build a town or a farm?  Go for it.  Want to dig deep into the ground searching for rare minerals or dungeons?  Just do it.  You do not need some NPC telling you to do these things, or when or how many of these things to do.  That's your business.  No one else's.  To many modern games get caught up in having to tell a story.  It's good top know that some game makers haven't forgotten that the stories came later.  So, yes, not burdening the player with Narrative and structured quests missions etc, is a good thing.\n\nThanks for listening.","December 4, 2014","true","103.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I usually don't play games with mixed or negative reviews, but this one caught my eye. It even got a (very unexpected) recent update. The reason I am not recommending this game is that, I didn't get to play the game. I opened the game, and got a black screen. I couldn't close the program with Alt+F4, and Ctrl+Alt+Delete didn't show the task manager. Nothing short of a hard restart could get control back for this game. I am NOT the only one with this problem, I have seen multiple mentions of the same problem in the forums for this game. The developers seem to be ignoring this problem, maybe because it doesn't effect many of the players. If you want to risk the 10% (or more) chance that you wasted your money completely, go ahead and buy it.\n\nAlso, if they ever fix the problem and let me play the game, I will happily change my review.

It looked like such an amazing game. Crafting, village building and dungeon delving all in one! Who could refuse?\nThe game itself is enjoyable, as long as you take it at face value. Controls are clunky and oftentimes unresponsive, however, many features that are supposed to be in the game do not in fact work, combat appears to be highly unbalanced, making the game a walk in the park, amongst other issues. On top of these, you'll often find the game crashing after a massive memory leak that hasn't been fixed since release.\n\nKeep these things in mind if you're looking to try the game out. For $10, it's not terrible - I got around 10 hours of enjoyment out of it, and I consider that acceptable.\n\nThe sad part came when the updates stopped. For a full year, we waited, uselessly. Disappointed.\nI'm ecstatic that we do finally have an update (released September 6th this year), but devs? Don't leave it that long again. We all, with good reason, assumed you'd abandoned the game. Even if you can't release content, give us a short announcement to let us know you're still there, and haven't run off to Sweden to make a hefty deposit to a new bank account.","October 5, 2015","false","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't super great, but all in all there are plenty worse that do well.  It is a bit quirky, kind of expected more from a full release.  Not sure if they are still doing any work on it, have not see anything pop up for updates.  If no more updates or fixes come, then might want to wait for it to go on sale.  If they fix the stupid little thigns and clean it up, I think it is well worth the price of a whooping $10.","January 25","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a building/survival type game that I'm glad I bought. The beginning was a bit clunky, but that's mostly because it doesn't use the usual control setups so the finger movements are unfamiliar. That's not neccesarily a bad thing, though. Once you get used to the controls, the game's great.\n","May 17","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
