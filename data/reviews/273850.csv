The camera cannot be moved around freely, it is in a fixed spot, and no zoom.\nWhen building the infrastructure in your ski resort you chose from a list of particular attractions, which builds these things in designated spots; you have no choice where you locate, ski runs, restraunts, hotels ect.\nThere is no budgeting to know if your making or losing money, and no way to tell your income/expenditure. Only the money you have to spend.\n\nThere so no gameplay value. For example, I simply built the first lift and ski run, carged the maximum price and people still came. I then proceded to click the "next day" button continuously and made a fortune.\n\nThere is also a component of the game involving maintaining your resort, such as using oversnow vehicals to clear roads, groom runs ect. This is simply boring, and hard to control.\n\nIn conclusion this game if very poor, no effort has gone into making this game fun or playable. Do not waste you money on this like I have done!","November 18, 2014","false","1.1"," 199 of 227 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","199","227","6","6"
