The ships and weapons all look different and each conveys their feel and performance. The best part about it is that everything looks great in its own place. The worst is that the game generally has a very low visibility range as objects fade out of view if too far away.\n\nSound/Music:\nGenerally all sound design is decent. Nothing too bad or obnoxious. These is a very obvious lack or any voice-over except a couple of cutscenes. The music tends to be somewhat repetitive but not too annoying so as make you turn it off.\n\nGameplay/Controls:\nIf you played Homeworld 2 the controls should be quite familiar. The game supports an organised and logical set of controls that almost always make sense. The map may appear featureless but it is actually very functional. There is a very handy Speed Time function which allows you to speed up time and the game also includes useful functions like "Pause of Enemy Detection". The biggest drawback is that you cannot rebind ANY functions, WASD doesn't work and i personally had to use an AutoHotKey macro for the "Speed Up" and "Speed Down" functions.\n\nProgression: The game features a decent progression system but it is fairly linear in a general sense. You cannot choose your main ship outside of story missions but you have full freedom on how to outfit your fighters. Each character has its own progression talent trees and each usually focuses on a specific job (that guy is good at missiles, that girl is good at repairs). Ships can be customised with various support and combat systems such as extended radar, remote repair, stealth/cloak, anti-missile PD, missiles, torpedos, lasers, blasters, cannons, railguns, etc... Each particular item has about 3 to 5 tiers of variants, one more powerful (and expensive) than the next.\n\nStory: Yes, this game features several endings that are actually quite different depending on which faction you chose to help. The story itself is quite decent but sometimes forces a gimmicky situation just to advance the plot - "My ship blew up for no reason because the plot is giving me a new one". The characters are interesting enough for immersion and you won't be disappointed, but don't expect any feats of writing.\n\nOverall:\nTHIS IS NOT AN RTS, this is more of a "Dragon Age meets Space Rangers" with your hero and allies on an adventure. This is an older game so some of the things you may take for granted today may not be present here so expect some mixed reactions in the beginning.\n\n4/5 for those interested in the genre and definetly a good choice for anyone interested in this type of game. Pretty good until the end and has good replayability if you're interested in the various endings by trying a different approach/loadout.\n\n3/5 If you don't care about space strategy, the controls will annoy you and the mouse is quite sluggish. Not a waste of money but not the best introduction to the genre.","November 27, 2013","true","47.9"," 73 of 81 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","73","81","0","0"

There were times when I was excited and times when I was bored.\n\nPros:The story is not the best I have read so far, but it keeps you on track, which is good (see con #2) It also let's you pick different solutions for missions, but not in every case (see con#3).\nShips can be equiped with a variety of different weapons, missiles, add-ons. I spend a good amount of time in the equipement screen to adjust my loadout to the upcoming missions.\nCharakters can learn new abilities. From certain attack moves to maneuvers, from calling reinforcements to disabling enemy shield there are a lot of possible combinations.\nConsThe game assumes you have played a star wolves game before. That's why you really should use the tutorial. It tells you how to use waypoints and that is one heck of an important thing to know! But it does not tell you everything, and that's a pity. Wonder how you can assign points to perks? No information given (dock all fighters and dock at a station).\nIf you'd like an open world game: you're wrong here. The world opens after a few missions, but unfortunately there is pretty much nothing much to do than to hunt pirates. No random missions, nothing.\nThe scripting is my major con. In the first missions you need to do exactly what you are told to. Want to fly to another sector than told? Watch a cutscene where your ship is destroyed. Fly to a station you are not supposed to fly to? Watch another cutscene... The world opens after a while but until then it really can be a pain. And later in the story one of your crew members leaves. With the current ship and equipement you handpicked and were lucky to find. Later a ship of your crew member exlodes, which is part of the story, but you think, they were hit by a missile or something and start that situation over and over. Until you realize, it's a script...\nCan I recommend buying the game anyway? Yes, now that you've been warned about some parts. If you have played the two others and had fun, you will like this very likely.\n","November 26, 2014","true","46.3"," 48 of 52 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","48","52","0","0"

You command a mothership with several fighters, which fly in 3d space, try to get on each other's tail and make attack runs, with real-time calculation of shell hits and importance of positioning. This one was made by the fan community of the first game, as the continuation of their highly appraised story mod. With all the consequences of a low-budget indie game, both good and bad.\n\npros:\n- Immersive, highly branching story - if you loved the first game, or story mod, this one is even better. Long-waited ending to plot twists of original story mod. It's good to meet old characters and participate in their deeds.\n- Game engine is improved to it's limits. Obsolete, but good-looking graphics; many new features were added like at last meaningful capital ships.\n- Lovely attention to details.\n- Combat is challenging, balance for the weaklings!)))\n\ncons:\n- Too heavily sripted. Though no game breaking bugs, quest logic could sometimes go hairy.\n- No voice acting. Just plain walls of text.\n- Outdated engine; some hardware/OS issues could arise.\n- Combat is poorly balanced: it could be either difficult and unforgiving, or boring and tedious (thankfully, fast). Tactical options are fewer now - firepower is the winner.\n\nOverall, it's really a gem, despite some possible problems. If you love space games, or games with well-crafted combat system and gameworld, with slow pace and high immersion - you should play it. I'd recommend play Star Wolves 1 first, to become acquainted with game world and characters; gameplay-wise, they are the same. *\n\n* Though it's important to know that Star Wolves 1 ending or whole Star Wolves 2 story is not canon. Unfortunately, Empire Legacy story mod - the prequel to Civil War - was not translated to English.","November 30, 2013","true","61.9"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","44","47","0","0"

Play the first one if you have not yet, it's the best part of the series. If you like the gameplay then you can try this game afterwards.\nIf you decide to play this you should go the icc forums first & download the mods there (you can find a package with 3 good mods).\nKeep also in mind that for normal players the difficulty levels are not labeled correctly. There is no easy setting! Easy = Normal / Normal = Hard / Hard = Insane.\n\nIf you're stucked and get killed all the time you can activate the god mode (=cheat).

Some minor and unfortunately some major as well. Like in all previous games this one also has somewhat weird and uncomfortable controls, it will take time to get used to it. It can get very frustrating and hard when you realize that some missions spawn endless waves of enemies until you run out of skills, ideas and rockets (or at least until you figure out what you are supposed to do) or find out that during some quests you may encounter a scripted auto-deaths just because "Middle finger for gamers not playing our games as we want them to". There is ZERO voice acting in english version, you have to read every single line of dialogue. The AI - while singificantly improved than in previous games - is still buggy (occasionally you will see both allies and enemies entering a "U spin me round" state - small ships start spinning very quickly and moving in one direction until then hit something or die). And let's end this list by the biggest flaw of this game: extremely poor optimization on Windows 7. My computer was built one year ago as a "Ridiculous machine" and it can play newest games in full HD and 60 fps, but Star Wolves 3 can occasionally drop from 60 to 30 fps for absolutely no reason or even to 10-15 if there are large battles with dozens of ships on the screen. It seems that my graphics card is not even spinning up it's fans while my CPU is working it's butt off to make this game running, no idea why. Tried many things, nothing worked. You have to live with it.\n\nSo as you can see, you have to forgive this game A LOT. But I still think it's good and it has a lot to offer for it's price. Why you may ask? Well, let me give you the fast version:\n\nIt's entertaining, it has a decent non-linear plot with a mystery and some enjoyable twists. It has graphics that - while not stunning - often can surprise you with some great images and big explosions with rich particle effects. It has a dangerous open world consumed with civil war, with many systems to explore. It gives the player many options and possibilities, hundreds of items, ships and other equipment while still managing to keep things simple. You can go to abandoned systems and fight in maps filled with literally hundreds of pirates, then after all that hard work collect a stash hidden inside an asteroid with a blinking light on it, sell it for a ton of cash, give escape pods with pirates to star patrol and get even more money as a reward - then buy some colorful lasers, hard hitting plasma guns and tremendously powerful torpedos and head to the border sector in order to fight aliens with ridiculously durable shields. Or try to beat an entire fleet of berserkers - sentient machines, that rely on hundreds of small, poorly armored bots with extremely hard hitting weapons. What, you think that "quality over quantity" is always right? Well, it's not. You will learn that the hard way. When you finally become a space badass with a big mothership and strong, reliable team, you can then try to attack MSF's or NESF's warehouses which have latest, experimental equipment, but will immediately spawn a fleet of dreadnoughts to protect them. Go to no-man's land (space?) and visit a smuggler's station if you want to buy missiles based on alien tech, and then wipe out an entire wing of fighters with just a single one of these lethal gems.\n\nI could go like that for hours. There is so much to do in this game. Every time I find something new. Something awesome. Even easter eggs - chek out the description of a X244 system in Border Sector. Very Dead Space-ish, I tell you :) So far I've put 160 hours into this game and I keep coming back to it when there's nothing new to play. It's just a really fun and solid game, what else can I say. If you like space strategies, give it a try. Who knows, you might have a lot of fun too.","December 29, 2015","true","173.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

It has a feel of carrier command being able to deploy fighers to engage ur enemies, pilots have upgradeable and can pilot craft based on which skills u choose. i understand that this game boasted about free roam tho it is pretty scripted and linear, this kind of got me a bit upset as well as the unforgiving ai an tutorial, make the wrong decision and u will regret it. but i was soon able to make more logical choices due to learning from my mistakes and was rewarded for it.\n\nI didn't play the previous star wolf games so im not very big on the plot but in this u play as trader ship pilot who ends up becoming more a mercenary, taking on missions from different sources, he also meets pilots that became permanent crew. the story isn't one that very much appeals to me but i read on since i kinda like to know whats going on atm (yes sadly there's little to no dialogue, so prepare your reading glasses).\n\nThe combat seems pretty good as the fighters will use the lack of graviy in space to float by their opponents to open up with their missiles or machine guns. the focus of early combat in the game seems to be to keep enemy fighters off of your mothership since the destruction of it means gameover. making sure each fighter has some type of missile defence will also help u out in battle as well as keeping your missiles in ample supply. extra fire support comes from employing mercenaries from nearby spacestations for when your fighters are not enough to take the enemy, mercs will ask for continued payment when moving from sector to sector.\n\nThe rpg element in the game is ok as well, as your pilots take part in combat they gain points that you can later use on their specialization tree making them more effective in combat. choices u make in the game also have an a pretty significant effect for example, choosing between fighing through a team of mercs or paying them to guide u staight to a new mothership they were protecting.\n\nWARNING this game is not for the impatient or for those who expect to command a legion of ships, this game will also requier for u to save often! but if u have a love for any type of space combat, or just like ordering around a squadron of fighters taking out pirates, then i think u might like this game. i dont really feel like i wasted my money on it either, im a dude that loves space games weather its rts, exploration, or just straight up action, its an ok space game i no there are other good ones but this one is pretty fun to me in my opinion. atm moment its on on sale, tho I've also been hearing that ppl were having problems starting and or playing the game, I took the risk and it works fine for me I'm using a laptop with a core i5, its really not that amazing a laptop but im able to play this game on high settings no problem.\n\nMothership tips: when your game pauses from combat, stop your mothership where it is, then engage the enemy squadron with your fighters before they notice you, then draw them closer to your mothership so it can provide some support to your fighters. this tactic works fairly well on the mission where you must attain a new mothership from a band of mercs, tis better to fight for it than it then buy it.\nYour mothership is your home protect it no matter what, fighters can be replaced. if losing is unavoidable retreat to a different sector, repair, rearm and restrategize if your tactics keep failing.\nAlso before you enter your mission sector buy a pack of mercs, dont try to buy them in your mission sector unless you feel you can, but it never hurts to give it a shot.\n\nEnjoy\n","November 28, 2013","true","58.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

So while it is possible to juggle your fighters to keep them alive, YOU WILL LOSE FIGHTERS.  The skill system is not reversible, though you can get enough points to level up your chosen specialization fully, so which specialization you choose matters as do which skills you get and when.

Personally I think this one is better than freelancer.  Not just about the graphics, but the whole game including game mechanism and everything.  The game play is very similar to freelancer, except you wander around with a 'mothership' instead of just one vessel.  The mothership can release up to 6 fighters in battle as long as you got enough pilots.  Thus the control is different from freelancer too, it is more like EVE type rather than freelancer's 3rd person space shooter.\n\nYou can replace your mothership and fighters with more powerful onces, or upgrade them with powerful weapons/modules.  There is a good varience of different weapons in game.  Unlike some games where different series of weapones just differ in names, the weapons in this game are quite different from each other in practice while still being quite balanced.  You actually have to consider using different fighter/setup against different enemy or to match up pilot specialty.  And yeah, there is also a skill tree system where you can choose which battle style you would like to go with.  Each pilot's skill tree is a little different while the protagonist can select from 4 quite different skill trees in the beginning.\n\nAnd the storyline was rich and vivid, too.\n\nThe only complaint I have about this game is that you can not 'free play' as in freelancer after story ends.  Although there is a period of time before the end where you can go anywhere and do anything you want.\n\nBTW, it is not an easy game and might make you frustrated in the very first few missions as I was.

Games like Endless Space and Sins of a Solar Empire have occupied lots of my time with such replayable gameplay.\n\nIf you like spaceship adventuring and being a captain of your own mothership, then you will probably enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are good, the music and sounds match the atmosphere and are nothing too crazy. The voice acting and cutscenes are below average, but do not take away from the game too much. Some of the cutscenes also do not appear to be skippable, which is slightly annoying to me since I can read faster than the text stays on screen. The story seems to be decent, with lots of factions vying for control in the Star Wolves universe.\n\nThe controls may be difficult if you aren't used to this type of gameplay, however, experimentation and practice with what each button does will help familiarize yourself with fairly quickly. The learning curve is moderate to difficult - especially considering that there is no in-game tutorial. It is strongly recommended that you first check out the tutorial missions before jumping into the main game. You can die very, very fast in this game. Save often just in case.\n\nGameplay can be sped up to 8x normal speed, and you probably will be using that option a lot during your travels. You can select 1 of 4 classes to start with, each with its own specialized skill/perk tree.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, you are constantly presented with numerous decisions, which I found to be very nice for open-world style gameplay. There are a variety of ship parts and weapons to select from. The galaxy map is very, very large and expansive, allowing for a lot of exploration.\n\nThere is a lot to do in this game, and you can even dock fighters inside your mothership.\n\nIf you really enjoy spacefaring and space combat, check out this game.\n\nRecommend.\n\n","July 30, 2014","true","2.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The translation is terrible but the gameplay is in the right place.  You play a crewmember onboard a small carrier (the largest can feild 6 fighters).  Its fairly open ended game play with scripted missions, but often with time in between to earn money through fighting or trading.   Skills are upgraded through xp, and fighters can be exchanged and componets upgraded.  The english speaking modding community is small, but there are some out there worth checking out.  I admit that I spent a lot of time 'playing' the game while in school or at work...or asleep.  I parked my mothership and let fighters kill pirates collecting their resources and geting xp.

I really wanted to love this game, but it's like being in love with an abusive girlfreind that just likes to out of nowhere kick you in the balls because she thinks it's funny.\n\nAs endeering as this game is and as well as the intent, I can not reccomend this game to anyone who has a low tollerance for bugs, bad translation or missing features. This has all of these, some of them in droves.\n\nI don't even want to know how rushed the translator was with that many simple, common misspellings and horribly broken grammar. The text in game would go from "meh, ok" to "OH GOD! I THINK I GOT CANCER FROM READING THAT!". It gets so bad, that even should you want to become engrossed with the story line; as I did, you wont be able to as you will have to fall out of any sense of connection just to try and peice the wording together.\n\nI would say the gameplay was ok, but yet again, I can not claim this was a good point. The scripting REALLY jumps out as a terrible punishment for the player. You WILL, and quite a bit - JUST DIE. It is not because you got in over your head, or because you did something that stupid. It will simply happen. In the start of the game the scripting will kill you 9 times out of 10. Just out of nowhere with no warning, 600 ships appear around you and bomb the hell out of your ship - GAME OVER.\n\nExamples - went into one of the beta systems on a secret mission, ended up on the run. Jumped out of the system, enemy ships were waiting. Killed them, went for the station to equip a new pilot I got. As soon as I got to the station, out of nowhere, 600 ships appear - BAM dead. Get a new ship with 7500 sheilds - jump into a system - BAM! dead, mother ship explodes with 75% sheilds 100% hull. That happens ALOT. You will find your self saving just to see where the death traps in a mission really are. It is so bad at some points you will just be flying, along the path the game has plotted BAM! 600 ships spawn, you die.\n\nNo need to make this any longer.

I have tried to play the game for over ten hours and am still unable to get past the prologue.\n\nThe prologue is designed very poorly if you deviate even slighty your instantly killed and have to start from a point often at least half hour from were you were due to the fact that the auto saves are spaced far too far apart. This would be forgivable but there is also a ton of information missing from the tutorial. I thought I had missed something but I went through the tutorial 3 times to find the information that was missing. It was not there. I looked up a walk through and found a community post that is a walk through of the prologue. It was very helpful until I reached a point where it didn't tell me everything and I'm stick between several auto kill zones and can't find a way to continue.\n\nThis is an open world game but I am forced to follow a script that I dont have access to and can't read. So Im trying to blindly follow a script and if I go even slightly off course, I lose at leats 30 minutes of my time. I'm sure that after the prologue I would enjoy this game, but its not worth the less than two dollars I spent on the game to try to get past the prologue because it is the most frustrating gaming experience I have every had.","March 4","false","9.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPINerd/recommended/46260/","RPINerd","RPINerd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPINerd/","470 products in account","In one word, Star Wolves 3 was a disappointment.\nFull disclosure, I went into the game not knowing what specific sub-genre of space simulation Star Wolves was, but I have a soft spot for anything space themed and that love spans many genres.\nAfter booting the game, I was immediately both enamored and jarred by the graphical fidelity of the game. Many would say it was dreadful, but it immediately reminded me of my first time launching Freelancer way back in the early 2000’s. I maxed out the graphics, got my settings all nice and balanced and started up a new single player campaign. Immediately I was struck with a wall of text followed by an absolutely chaotic character creation screen. Again, in a way this was almost charming, I loved plenty of titles with worse openings than this. After putting together my character I was treated to a Freelancer-esque cutscene which did the job visually, gave very little in the way of context or plot creation. Next thing I knew I was sitting in space. That was it. After figuring out how to work the camera, I looked around only to see a huge asteroid sitting off in the distance. 15 minutes and a consultation with the control settings menu later I figured out how to move the ship, so I do. I travel about 10 feet “forward” and a huge fleet jumps in and some guy is threatening me over the radio. Next thing I know, he opens fire and I’m space debris with the very first volley. Game over. I’m taken back to the start screen.\nI honestly don’t remember the last time a game has made me sit back in my chair and say aloud “Excuse me?”\nI don’t like judging games by first impressions, I would have missed out on innumerable gems by doing so, but Star Wolves 3 has nothing to offer me that would redeem such a first impression.","November 10, 2014","false","1.6"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","11","25","0","0"

Well there was to an extent but I couldn't find a way to escape the Viper storyline because first,  if your lion mothership is underpowered in a preceding mission, you die.  So you get all the best sheilds and weapons on the lion.  But then if you choose a mission fork and disobey Viper you get kicked out of the Lion that she brought to the battlespace and guess what to win the last mission with the hardest sheilds and turrets well you have to fight the Lion to escape and your new mothership is an unamoured unsheilded freighter with no weapons.   Well I tried a lot of things but there was no way to beat the lion if you didn't want to go viper's way because if the sheilds were too low in the preceding mission you couldn't complete that and choose the fork.  Thus I uninstalled the game in frustration which was sad really because it is a game that held so much promise it is fun collecting ships and resources and zipping about the galaxy but it is basically terribly scripted and assembled and it's basically a huge pia.  Pain in the Auxiliary exhaust.   Following that there is supposed to be in existence a 4th instalment that maybe some problems were fixed in but that is likely wishful thinking. & It's not the only game from this developer (1c) that seems to start well and end half-finished with rumors of patches fixes and whatever but nothing readily available?  If I could spit acid and vitriol they would be suitably envenomed.","October 5, 2015","false","91.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I did not really like Space rangers HD, or the UFO series, only this I really liked. (Parkan 2 was a decent game) I sort of like the story, but it is WAY TO LINEAR. I found myself wanting to do one thing, when I was forced to do something else, I felt very restricted during it. Space seems empty, rarely ever encountering anything (Mods helped). I Haven't beat it yet, but so far, the only voice acting is just from the start (and possibly the endings) I get very little editing to my character, not even a simmple gender or race to choose from, I am automaticly just some guy, who I can't customize. Now the missions in these games are repetitive, fly to this zone, fly to this zone, fly to this zone, kill someone, rinse and repeat throughout the entire game so far. And guess what, if I don't do what the Game wants me to do in a certain mission or two, I AUTOMATICLY DIE IN A CUTSCENE. Like... WHAT!? Like here is an example, generic pirate lady and I have to set sail to some system to get an ID change on our ship, if I stray off to a small station, just to change my current weapons, since the starting ones sucked, I GOT INTO A IMMIEDITE CUTSCENE OF DEATH. Combat is ok, trading sucks, not much explanation of how the game works, Tutorial does a crappy job. Kinda hard to make money unless you are doing a mission. Pirating doesn't seem to get me into really ANY trouble and I make some side cash off it, good job government, I get away with pirating, RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR GOSH DARN BASE...! The graphics are ok, kinda edull for a 2010 game, the game feels more like a 2004-2007 game. It could really have more diplomacy features and more interactive non-linear gameplay. Also, for some reason some MASSIVE SHIPS at shipyards are completely free, got a huge alien destroyer free of charge for no reason at all. Doing this though made the game stop working. So after floating around for a little while with it, I got a deathscene of death again. The game is much better then other 1c Space games, But I don't recommend it to newcomers of the genre or even experienced members, hard-core members at best. Not much exploration either, all the systems feel the same and junky. And I just want to point out one little, last thing before I end the review that really, REALLY BOTHERS ME ABOUT THIS GAME. When attacking Government officials that have threatend to fine you if you don't, move away from a portal after a little bit, you are still fined... I mean, I was talking to a friend on steam, just came out of a portal and guards threatend to fine me if I didn't move out of the way for other people, so I blasted them away with my cannons, YET I AM STILL FINED!? 6/10. 7/10 with improvements added, highly doubt that will happen though.

I did not really like Space rangers HD, or the UFO series, only this I really liked. (Parkan 2 was a decent game) I sort of like the story, but it is WAY TO LINEAR. I found myself wanting to do one thing, when I was forced to do something else, I felt very restricted during it. Space seems empty, rarely ever encountering anything (Mods helped). I Haven't beat it yet, but so far, the only voice acting is just from the start (and possibly the endings) I get very little editing to my character, not even a simmple gender or race to choose from, I am automaticly just some guy, who I can't customize. Now the missions in these games are repetitive, fly to this zone, fly to this zone, fly to this zone, kill someone, rinse and repeat throughout the entire game so far. And guess what, if I don't do what the Game wants me to do in a certain mission or two, I AUTOMATICLY DIE IN A CUTSCENE. Like... WHAT!? Like here is an example, generic pirate lady and I have to set sail to some system to get an ID change on our ship, if I stray off to a small station, just to change my current weapons, since the starting ones sucked, I GOT INTO A IMMIEDITE CUTSCENE OF DEATH. Combat is ok, trading sucks, not much explanation of how the game works, Tutorial does a crappy job. Kinda hard to make money unless you are doing a mission. Pirating doesn't seem to get me into really ANY trouble and I make some side cash off it, good job government, I get away with pirating, RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR GOSH DARN BASE...! The graphics are ok, kinda edull for a 2010 game, the game feels more like a 2004-2007 game. It could really have more diplomacy features and more interactive non-linear gameplay. Also, for some reason some MASSIVE SHIPS at shipyards are completely free, got a huge alien destroyer free of charge for no reason at all. Doing this though made the game stop working. So after floating around for a little while with it, I got a deathscene of death again. The game is much better then other 1c Space games, But I don't recommend it to newcomers of the genre or even experienced members, hard-core members at best. Not much exploration either, all the systems feel the same and junky. And I just want to point out one little, last thing before I end the review that really, REALLY BOTHERS ME ABOUT THIS GAME. When attacking Government officials that have threatend to fine you if you don't, move away from a portal after a little bit, you are still fined... I mean, I was talking to a friend on steam, just came out of a portal and guards threatend to fine me if I didn't move out of the way for other people, so I blasted them away with my cannons, YET I AM STILL FINED!? 6/10. 7/10 with improvements added, highly doubt that will happen though. Buy it if you really are a sci-fi stategy or Star wolves Fan, also, get it on a sale.","February 3, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you played Freelancer and X3 and decided that what you really want it for those games to play as an RPG with squad-based real-time-with-pause gameplay, you might get something like Star Wolves 3.  Character progression is somewhat limited, the plot is linear, but with branches, and there's a large world out there but you won't be interacting it in a freeform manner.\n\nThe writing is excellent and the characters have personality. The English translation was done in a rough "literal translation" style, which butchers English grammar something awful but leaves the flavor of the characters intact. If you've spent any amount of time on the Internet, this is not so shocking... I played the game with the feeling that this is a group of pilots brought together by chance, none of whom speaks English natively but who are using it as a common language, and that fits pretty well with the game world . If this bugs you, you'll hate the game. I really had no problems with it--a rough translation of good writing is infinitely preferable to a lot of the native-English bad games I've played. If the voices used in the ending movies are any indication, the game was significantly improved by the omission of English language audio. :)\n\nI'm not so much reviewing as I am just rambling on about what I think of the translation, am I? I'll summarize: After 50-odd hours of play, I feel like the game ended too soon, and I'm ready to restart it and take a different career path. I am sad that the sequel/followup was cancelled. Highly recommended, but follow the FAQ for the first few missions.","February 7, 2015","true","53.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Recommended, but wastes a lot of potential.\n\nAs a game designer I can see two issues with this game which make it look bad after just a few minutes of play time. But I think one can endure both of them.\n\nFirst Problem: It's kinda slow unfolding and seems to be very hard. It's old school. Save a lot and try missions more than once if you fail the first time. You got destroyed when you took the left route? Then try the right route or hire merceneries. Don't get demotivated by sudden deaths.\n\nSecond Problem: I see and feel a big lack of immersion in this game. I never felt as a part of the game world, nor did I care about the story or characters. That makes the small mistakes in the game machanic even more apparent.\n\nOne can definitely have fun with this game, but you have to embrace it's old school style.","August 30, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are not that many games today that can pose a challenge, and here well... Let's just say it takes a while to get to the level where you can safely engage even the common pirates.\n\nAlso , its much more tactical than SW1. There - you could just fly towards most things & shoot. Here, long range scanners are a must. Because behind 1st wave of enmy ships there is usually more comming.\n\nShortly speaking - the game i better than SW 1 in most aspects, but the time you need to spend to "fly from place to place"  can be sometimes annoying. Hence final grade - 7/10 same as SW1.\n\n","July 5, 2015","true","52.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game gives you a choice to fast travel to a mission location (once per mission), but you can't fast travel to previously visited sectors. However, you can speed up the game up to 8x.\n\nDocking anywhere is frustrating and time consuming. Docking into the mothership for repairs can be a pain in the middle of battles.

The spaceship mechanics are almost a direct copy of Homeworld. The game is an open world with a central storyline like IWar2. It is a party-based RPG with a focus on tactics like Blackguards, my favorite genre.\n\nThe story and dialogue are pretty good. There are multiple branching paths and different endings. The English translation is sometimes rough, but not too bad. I like the combat, ships and itemization. No real complaints here.\n\nThe main aspect this game failed at is the open world. The star systems are pretty boring, and there's not much to look at. They're all pretty much identical, though there is the occasional weapons cache hidden away in a remote sector. IWar2 had much better exploration. Luckily, the game lets you skip most of the exploration and proceed directly to the next story location. So it didn't bother me a whole lot.\n\nOverall, I liked this game and would recommend it to people who like Homeworld and RPGs.","May 12","true","97.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
