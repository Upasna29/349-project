There's such a low amount of players on simultaneously, yet the gameplay seems like it would be very fun if there were players frequently playing together. I haven't had a chance to test out the game with a full minimum lobby of players (6) without bots. If you're going to argue about my hours I am often offline on Steam and my hours do not record.\n\nSo here's my review about the game. Pretty much the spacemen must complete the objectives first before the monster kills the spacemen. It follows the general idea of many other objective-based horror games. But even though the developers do borrow this general idea from other games, they have put their own unique twist into the game, locating the gameplay in space and adding a variety of "environmental" factors into completing the objectives. For example, oxygen is needed for the spacemen, so their time to complete objectives outside is limited, allowing the monster to take advantage of their need for oxygen.\n\nI do admit the visuals are quite good-looking for the alpha state of the game. The HUD looks great and the dark and lonely feeling of space are very present. I've known this developer team since their last unfinished game, The Dead Linger, which ended up being a trainwreck as far as visuals and gameplay goes (no offense, devs :P) and am quite impressed with the visual quality difference between this game and their last.\n\nCombat mechanics are relatively simple. I'm not impressed with them but am not disappointed either. Grenades, guns, monster furiously swiping at the players, not really anything unique or new. The lasers from the guns look nice, although I do believe the rounds hit the target before the laser reaches it visually.\n\nIt all really comes down to how this game ends up in the future, whether or not the developers end up abandoning it like they did their last game, and if they continue with their development roadmap and implement the good-looking content listed in it. I'll be waiting for future updates for sure. Oh, and the lack of players makes things irritating, since the AI don't even shoot back if you're the monster and you're shooting them to death.\n\nTL;DR Lack of players on at once make the game not worth the price, even though the core gameplay and visuals seem decent at the very least.","May 9","false","2.4"," 39 of 57 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","39","57","4","7"

Make of that what you will but if you don't like to gamble then this is a definite no for you.\nMost of the positive reviews so far (if not all) are from alpha testers of the game, which i'm guessing are also on duty to spam that downvote button on reviews like this, actually the player base is so heavy on the "got this for free as an alpha tester/streamer" side that Steamspy detects this as being a free to play game, yet hardly any of them clicking that little "got this product for free" button on their reviews.\n\nHave now been forum banned by the "dev" (blueprinter) for a mixture or warning him about selling other companies trademarks as cosmetics for his game and only having 2 products left in my account (after refunding this and removing the broken TDL). First he claimed he had made the textures himself (before he deleted that message), which even if true (hint, its not) does not allow you to sell it, as it's another companies trademark, just ask Walmart, who got sued for making their own smiley face and using it to promote their products. Secondly, just because you download a "royalty free" image, does not mean you can sell it as your own:\n\n"Another restriction on a basic royalty-free image license is that the products on/in which the images appear cannot feature the image as the dominant visual if the end product is then going to be sold. For example, when you buy an RF image, you cannot then turn around and print the image onto a t-shirt and sell the t-shirt if the image is the dominant one on the shirt. Similarly, you can't present the image available for download from a website, such as for computer wallpapers.

Its not going to be an everyone game because of the sort of game it is, however it is fun and i can see it becoming more so once the big issues are resolved.\n\nMany have probably heard that the company that has made this game also made a title before it called The Dead Linger which gained alot of bad publicity much of which was fitting.  However much of the things said about TDL had alot of things mixed in it of personal nature and opinions, the truth was that the company ran out of money and had to halt development on TDL.  There is still very mild speculation from a few people that maybe after some successes development might resume but due to the cost most dont believe so.\n\nThis company is as honest as they come, they are transperant and those that stuck with the entire process of TDL know this regardless of their personal feelings.  Keys were also just given freely to all Kickstarter backers of TDL as a gesture of good will.\n\nIf your not very convinced its a good buy at this point come back to it, but the experience off the hat has been a much more pleasent one and i wish Sandswept the best of luck with this and future titles.","May 7","true","0.9"," 25 of 55 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","25","55","0","2"

I see tons of negative reviews praising the gameplay and concept, but crying the game is buggy and un-stable.  No sh!t.  The game is in Alpha, geniuses.\n\nWith that said, this game is pretty hysterical, and I typically dislike FPS.  It's basically a 15-minute murder-mystery in space.  The best part is when you're the monster, and hearing the screams and surprise of murdering the spaceman you've been helping for the past three minutes, as he turns and see you suddenly morph.\n\nYou can set traps (the air lock decompression is always satisfying) and you can sabotage the power, equipment, etc.  You got to be slick though, because if peeps see you acting weird ... blamo!  Much of the games charm also comes from the in-game voice-chat.  You have to be a little bit of a real-life actor to "accidentally" shoot, push people offa bridges, drop a flash bang or call people to a room to kill them one-by-one.\n\nThe game is currenly $12.00.  It's buggy as hell, but it has great potential and well worth the price in it's current state.

There are still some remnants of the connectivity/loading issues mentioned previously, but the rate at which they appear has been diminished significantly. They might even have gone away entirely since the Sunny Side Up patch but I have not played since that patch was released so I can't verify entirely.\n\nBut, that said, the bugs have been worked out to a point that I think is very acceptable for an Early Access game so I am changing this review to a positive! The games I was able to play were fantastic and filled with fun and tension. A lot of it depends on the people you play with, and the more talkative players you can get, the better. Playing as a Spaceman is a fun mix of paranoia and tension and the rounds are a good mix of winning and losing, depending on how the monster plays. There are also numerous ways to go about your objectives as the monster so it varies each round, which keeps things fresh. The 15 minute time limit is a perfect amount of time to get objectives done but also keep you constantly moving and preventing the game from stagnating. There are multiple maps, but all anyone ever plays on is Echo. I tried out some of the other maps but people just mostly complained until I changed it to Echo. That is another downside though is that the game doesn't exit back to lobby and there isn't a way to vote for a map change or even force change it yourself as host at the end of a round or set of rounds.\n\nThe things I would recommend being aware of if you are a new player are the small playerbase (not a lot of people are on and you need to play in peak hours to find a game). Basically, don't expect to play outside of the hours of 7ish to midnight. Also, there is a bug (again, SSU patch may have fixed this) where servers will only list 1/31 players in the game, regardless of how many players are actually in it. So you have to join the game to see how active it is.\n\nI would also be aware of the crashing/joining/connection issues. They have, for me, almost gone away entirely, but your experience may vary. Also, again, keep in mind that a lot of your fun depends on other players. I have not had any bad experiences with the community, but as it continues to grow, this could change.\n\nLastly, the pistol damage seems too small. Everyone starts with it though, so I get that it can't be too powerful, and the balance of heavy weapons on the map seems good because you don't want everyone powered up, but I got into a pistol duel with someone and we shot at each other for literally five straight minutes dancing around and neither one of us died and we eventually just ran in opposite directions. If you have just a pistol and are facing down the monster, it is better to just run.\n\nI don't want to end on a negative note so I will say this: this game has, I believe, a terrific future ahead of it. The devs somehow took a horror setting (imo) and, instead of it becoming less frightening with more players, it just gets scarier. That is an achievement in itself. That's not to say that you won't experience some goofy/funny moments, but the overall feeling is very tense and that is a big positive for a game like this. The devs also seem very active in their work on this. I gather from other reviews that there might be some bad blood from a previous project? I can't speak on that, but I can speak on what I've seen with this game and the updates come frequently and they seem to be very aware of the current issues, what needs to be done to fix them, and where the game is heading.\n\nI would definitely recommend buying this game. It is a unique multiplayer game that blends a lot of elements together in a wonderful way. The more people that play, the better the games get, so I would love to see more players involved. I'm typically very wary of Early Access games, but I can say that from what I have seen with this, it is at a point where you should feel safe investing your time and money into it. It is only going to get better. I hope to see a lot more of you Spacemen out there.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT 1: I played the game since the new patch, and while the crashing problem has gone away, it seems to have been replaced with (or maybe this has always been a problem and I never got far enough to try it) connectivity/loading issues. Mainly, when trying to join, I will get to in-game screen and I can see other Spacemen running around, but will get no options to do anything. If it's not that, then I'll get sent to a black screen where it sticks in an infinite loading screen. Anytime this happens, I am forced to ALT+F4 out because there is no other recourse, so basically it went from crashing on its own to forcing me to crash it. I tried joining after the host sent the game back to the lobby, and I still got slammed into the never-loading start screen when the host started the game again.\n\nI managed to get into and play one game, which was fun (mostly bots, but a handful of real people). We lost due to the time limit, but I had a couple tense, close calls with the monster that were exciting. The gameplay is fun on its own, but the true experience seems like it will be heavily dependent on the people you play with. I am glad that my initial thoughts that it would be fun were validated by it actually being fun.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to leave the review as negative. The general instability as a whole is just too much to be able to overlook it, even in Early Access. Getting into one game out of six attempts is just no bueno. It is a good sign that patches seem to be coming out on a pretty quick basis though, and I have no doubt that eventually (and possibly very soon) this review will turn to Positive, but I just can't do it right now. If it were solely based on the gameplay, it'd already be a Positive, but if I can't get to the gameplay, then what's the point?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nORIGINAL: The concept and gameplay look and sound fun from videos I watched from other people, but that is about all you are going to be able to do. It seems like luck of the draw whether or not the game will run for you. At any point, for any reason it feels like, the game will kick you back to the menu, or completely crash. This can happen in menus, in the lobby select, in-game waiting to start, in-game while you spawn, and just at any point in-game, period. This is even if the game will launch in the first place.\n\nThere are numerous other bugs, things you would expect from an Early Access game, so I'm not going to list those. But when the game is near-completely unplayable, it should not be released in any form, at all. I have not once been able to complete a whole match, and the most I ever got to play of a match was three minutes.\n\ntl;dr DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

Now luckily, I know the story behind TDL and I understand that sometimes, sh*t happens. The developers have moved on, and so have we. (They've also given previous owners of TDL a 65% discount on this little gem right here, which is more than generous).\n\nNOW. Bring forth, Unfortunate Spacemen. The concept of this game had me interested right off the bat. Think of a multiplayer game version of the movie The Thing. Sounds too good to be true, right? This game aims to make that a reality. Mind you, that's only one of the many inspirations behind this title. Unfortunate Spacemen truly is a unique, new, creative, and most importantly - fun game to play.\n\nNow of course, it's Early Access and that means some issues, some frustrations, some bugs, and some other bullsh*t. "Purchasing" this game is an investment. If you are'nt prepared for some unfortunate stuff to happen during development, please don't buy into this. Too many people purchase an EA game so they have something new to b*tch about. Honestly that goes for all games. Right now the only issue I have with Spacemen is the matchmaking. It's very rough, and hopefully is a top priority BUT - it still works. I had a server going with 18 people connected, and it was awesome.\n\nI'm gonna' skip right ahead to the meat and potatoes of the reasons why I'm bothering to write up this "review". I'm doing it because the developers - so far - are totally rad. For example I had an issue where I was trying to buy my friend a copy, since I have 65% discount that they gave owners of their previous game. It wasn't allowing me to purchase a gift copy, so I made a post, to which a dev replied in a matter of minutes and immediately sent an e-mail to Valve. Valve then revealed that they turned off gifting options for people with a discount because they didn't want people getting multiple copies of the game for cheap. Yet, the developer told them to allow it anyway - that immediately earned my respect. On top of that, these guys are actually playing their own game (shoutout to Thunderfist), and they actually communicate with their players.\n\nI love the concept, I'm happy with how they've executed it, and I'm more than pleased with how the developers have presented themselves and treated their fanbase.
