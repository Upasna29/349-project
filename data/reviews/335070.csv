VRC Pro gives you access to the world of modern RC cars and racing and provides a method of training for amateurs and veterans of RC racing alike. While it may be intimidating at first VRC Pro is an excellent way to get in to the world of RC motorsport.\n\nA word of warning, don't expect this to be an RC racing game because that's not what it is, this is a simulation game and a realistic one at that. Also I'd just like to say I've never really raced RC cars in real life, I used to own some RC cars which I used to drive around but that's about as far as my experience with RC cars goes.\n\n+Great graphics\n+Realistic physics\n+All of the included cars (15) and all of the included tracks (22) are real\n+A good variety of different types of car and different types of track\n+A huge amount of customization options for the cars included as well as the ability to create your own from scratch\n+Has gamepad support as well as support for real RC controllers (adapter required)\n+The controls at first seem complex and difficult to use but once you get the hang of them they're great\n+Great performance\n+A fixed camera view as well as an up close 'following camera'\n+There is a practice mode for races, helps to familiarise you with a track before you take part in the main race\n+Practice cars (AI) are very good\n+Several different game modes both offline and online\n+Good amount of people online and I believe it can be played with people who own the non-Steam version also\n+Provides a good way to enjoy RC racing without having to spend a lot of money on a real RC car\n+The developer is active on the Steam forums\n\n+/-You pretty much have to play this with a controller, personally I'm fine with that but I know a lot of people get annoyed if they can't play with KB&M\n\n-You can't pause the game even when playing offline\n-Some of the tracks seen on the Steam store page aren't included in the Steam version of the game\n-Not all of the tracks have the option for you to practice or race against AI, kind of annoying if you're like me and only want to play the game offline\n-It's not very begginer friendly and it only has a very simple tutorial\n\nVerdict:\n8\n\nA great way to learn how to race RC cars with realistic physics, great graphics, a fair few cars to drive and a number of tracks to drive them on. If you have any interest in racing RC cars then this is definitely a game you should pick up.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","April 15, 2015","true","4.2"," 73 of 93 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","73","93","5","24"

The problem is i decided to buy this game through Steam only to find that all the extra DLC like cars and tracks etc thats on the official VRC Pro website version is its not availible through Steam and once you have brought it through Steam you can no longer buy the extra DLC from the site as it becomes linked to Steam only. Anyone looking to buy this game at the moment and wanting extra DLC i would suggest buying it directly from the official VRC Pro website as you will be able to buy all the extras and addons. I am hoping that all the DLC is going to be availible via steam, so Steam please hurry it up and get all the DLC added, so until then im just gona have to stick with the limited stuff from this steam version at the moment.","March 30, 2015","true","91.5"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","38","43","0","2"

The videos/pics show some tracks not yet availible in steam version and felt slightly slighted by the fact I thought I would be getting some of the ones in the videos/pics. After reading their forums and the steam forums it seems they are aware of some of these things and are fixing them. The other tracks from what I gathered will be released as a "deluxe" dlc. I am dissapointed that $40 did not get get me the "whole package" or what I was expecting. HOWEVER this is a SIM and a polished one at that and I completely agree with their asking price (for now).\n-Will be fixing steam/non steam compatabilty or previous buyer issues. (more forum info)\n-Wish more tracks were included\n-Is an older game, ~14 years, other than graphics it really dosen't show, and the graphics are not bad by any means.\n\nConclusion:\n-Definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in a sim rc experience or anyone who has had an rc car.\n-DO YOUR RESEARCH on what you will get with steam version/non steam license. Steam version contains more than enough to really enjoy this game I just personally wish there were more tracks included. Everything seems like it will make it's way over to steam and the playerbase will only grow from that.\n-Asking price is fair.\n-Use a gamepad at the very least if not a real rc controller (xbox 360 controller worked fine for me)","March 26, 2015","true","78.9"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/335070/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3204 products in account","Disclaimer : Base game was provided via a review code by the developer. I've spent some considerable time providing feedback and suggestions to said developer, which has resulted in the implementation of the deluxe packs as seen in the DLC section of the store page, his willingness to adapt and provide new ways for players to get involved and experience this game should be seen as a pure positive, and I purchased the deluxe cars pack as a measure of support. Developers who act inclusively should always be supported in such a manner.\n\nThis isn't your father's RC game, this isn't Re-Volt either...\nWith that out of the way, let's get some misconceptions out of the way, what VRC-Pro is and is not. First off, it's not a casual racing game. This isn't a knockabout toybox racer like say "Toybox Turbos" or "Blazerush". Whilst VRC-PRO deals with miniature racing cars, it should be treated with the same respect as say Assetto Corsa or DiRT Rally, you will need to either -have- an interest in the subject matter (namely RC car racing) or be willing to learn and take an interest in the hobby to get the most out of this. This is a "simulator" as opposed to a normal racing game, except here we're discussing simulating radio controlled cars, and that's a different mindset. It takes a different approach to get used to, but once you get over the learning curve, it's most definitely an entertaining and satisfying experience.\n\nA more considered approach to Radio Control cars...\nThe core package provides you with a good slew of tracks, both indoor and out, time trial and practice modes, as well as practice against the AI to get you used to the core concepts, it also provides you with an arsenal of components ranging from spec grade controllers, batteries and motors, all the way through to a selection of bodies that come with their own decals and colour schemes. Critically, all of these components can be fine tuned in much the same way that one can tune a full size car in AC, except now you're dealing in the fractions of millimeters and fractions of degrees, but the principles are very much the same.\n\nYou'll be adjusting to balance downforce against top speed, working out the best gearing ratio for a given track to optimise for speed versus acceleration, the user interface provides a solid level of information as to what each change will affect, so you're not left in the dark as to what your adjustments will cause. A useful addition is the marker that shows where the original setting -was- before you started tweaking, so you can assess how big a change you're making before you commit. Pitting in track allows you to make some adjustments, but for the full suite you'll need to go outside of the track and take the car apart, that also allows you to change components, and with the deluxe car pack, there's -tons- of options available.\n\nDinky scale, dinky graphics, dinky sounds...\nThe graphics are solid, the track are well appointed, and the cars are suitably detailed, the game runs at a rock steady 60fps and I doubt it's going to tax anything that's been built in the last five years. The only hiccup is the flat textures that represent the people around the edge of the track, but you won't really be paying attention to them when you're trying to set good times.\n\nAn important note is that the physics engine most -definitely- feels convincing. These machines may be light, but they have grip and traction once they're up to speed, and using something with an analog control (such as an xbox pad) is deemed *critical* if you want any chance of setting decent times. The game supports the full gamut of controllers, and in a full nod to authenticity, even supports RC radio controllers if you order a USB dongle from the VRC PRO site. This allows people who are testing their RC setups to port their configurations into the game, and then test them from the PC environment using their RC controllers with full and immediate feedback, this is an important plus.\n\nSound? It has some. It won't win awards, but it does the job. The music is .. music. I'll be kind and say you can set it to "off" if it doesn't flick your switch. Multiplayer is stable and the netcode is reliable, in the tests I ran it didn't hiccup once, and there's a good and solid community that's been running alongside this game for an extended period of time, which is a nice to have. The skill levels range from hobbyist right the way through to high end (as evidenced by the time trial leaderboards), so there's always likely to be a race that suits your tastes.\n\nA strong spine, and a solid foundation, much like Asetto Corsa, there's a future here...\nThe one thing it lacks right now is a true Single Player "Career" mode of sorts (a la Project CARS), which means that beyond Time Trials and Practice VS the AI, you're going to be reliant on the community and your own enthusiasm for the world of RC simulation as for how much you get out of it. In that sense it's going to be a lot like Assetto Corsa, if you have a love for the subject matter, this is an easy sell. It's a very niche product, but what it does, it does exceptionally well.\n\nVerdict : Highly recommended for serious RC fans, and worth wishlisting even if you're not. This is definitely "one to watch"","May 14, 2015","true","3.6"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","22","37","0","0"

It seems to have some elements of Trackmania, but much more difficult and sim emphasis over arcade. My biggest issues so far is that due to lack of players, im often just doing time trails racing myself without competition which can get DULL+BLAND!  MP IS DEAD ***SO DEV ADD AI PLEASE*** or may change my thumbs up to a down!!!!\n\nThis is a game that will take some time getting use to the controls, perspectives (although F2 can give you the car POV rather than a controller on the sidelines). Lots of customization options, but the menus can be a bit annoying or difficult to maneuver at first and lots of content is off limits or expensive DLC. Its challenging, very fast cars on small windy tracks overall which is cool. The physics are good but the gamepad and controls are limited. I do like using the dpad to steer similiar to real life controls but R1/R2 would be good options with braking too. I noticed some cars dont have reverse though requiring the annoying voice and space bar to reset, with no options on the gamepad to do so!\n\nGraphics are decent, although the people are cardboard cut outs holograms literally lol, I don't care though. They have a few glictches but nothing big. Load times can be a bit long even on a good pc and connection. Now all we need is a robot wars game where you craft your own machine, i guess that is twisted metal lol.\n\nWith a few fixes (controls and add AI to races) and if DLC is more affordable its a solid niche game for fans of the sim racing genre. I recommend when its on sale for casuals as myself. I got the Offroad Tracks #2 DLC with 5 extra and bigger tracks for 10% off so $9 which suggest checking out.

But it's very lacking.\n\nSC Trucks are very popular now in RC and they have one to chose from... ONE.\nYou get to drive a 4x4 Associated in team or RTR version. Don't like that? Don't run SC then...\nPicked it up for the sole reason of practicing and having a little fun on the road with the lap top.\n\nGraphics. Not bad, at first glance, but they way they line you up against the track is always some odd way, never actually straight up against it, the zoom levels are terrible trying to set up something useable. Either way to close when it comes near the podium so you can't see anything around it or to far so you can't tell propper orientation when on the far end of the track. Follow mode helps for a walk around sort of thing to see what the track actually looks like, but also makes the track seem very "2D drawing" looking.\n\nYou can't change controler settings or camera zoom settings (you can set over all zoom, or one of 3 different cameras) while actually in game so you can see the results. Instead you have to load in and out constantly to try and make these adjustments. Almost all of my game time was spent doing so.\n\nColors to take to wheel color changes, accessories show up then dissapear from the list when trying to out fit your vehicle and the list of them is very short even when they do all show up.\n\nBody customization is very very limited, when changing shock positions they list numbers on a sheet.. but if you don't own the truck and know where these holes are then you are shooting blind making changes.\n\nGame jumps and glitches about, check my profile for system specs.. No reason a game like this should have a issue running on my set up, Witcher 3 doesn't at 4k  but this one at 1920x1080 has problems...\n\nMaybe in the future but not worth it even on sale as it is.\nMy oppinion, maybe not yours.\n\nIf it ran better, didn't have options that failed to apply, had more realistic visuals for angles (seems like only under truck shadows, no sides) so you could tell better it's angle where it was pointing, had the vehicals I was looking for and equipment I wanted to use then I would be more interested. It does not.\n\nAll the negative above in consideration... The physics seem pretty good...\nMight spend another 13 and get the adaptor... Still trying to give this thing a shot so you may see\nmy play time increasing for a bit. Hoping in the future they add some 1:10 buggies, and some 2wd SC trucks.","December 28, 2015","false","3.9"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","16","28","0","0"

If you are willing to learn this is a great game to help do that since there is so much detail.\nI have a history where I was really into electric R/C racing for a few years (10+ years ago). This is my re-introduction to the sport since I do not have easy access to supplies to get back into the hobby. I think to appreciate this game you need to go into it with the mentality that this is a simulator first and foremost, not a game. Thus, I can imagine that tweaking the many parameters for each unique vehicle and component must be a monumental task. Therefore I take my prior R/C training experience an apply it here: I only used to race stock class for the time I spent in the hobby. Why? Because the general skills that are transferrable from class to class do not depend on having the exact setup that you have. If you have a faster motor to begin with you will just spend all day crashing and not having a good time without understanding why. Stock or Spec classes let you get the feel for how you should be driving while making it more approachable. I am again only tinkering around in spec class until I get really comfortable with the Spec classes using lower power motors since you can learn how to handle the car (or SC truck in my case) for the specific track. Once you can race stock class very confidently then moving up to the hotter motors can make sense. This games makes it so that faster does not equal better. A good driver with a stock setup can do quite well against someone who is not such a good driver using the fastest and best setup. As it stands I am mainly playing in the electric short course 1/10 scale class, so I am not too familiar with nitro or road racing. I have tried nitro, and it is an unfamiliar beast for me. I have tried road and I do not have any interest in the class.\nWithout some sort of controller or game pad the game is not worth getting. I am using an XBox 360 controller which is quite nice, I hope to get the USB adaptor to try using an actual radio transmitter soon. Make sure to calibrate the dead zone since the controls are much less forgiving than in other games.\nEdit: I now have had the USB adaptor and use it with a Spektrum SR210 reciever. This requires cutting some of the plastic on the USBs plug to get rid of a corner so that it will plug into the SR210. It works great and I highly reccomend this.","March 28, 2015","true","57.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Even if your not an RC fan like *myself* it's still worth picking up, because it's heeps of fun!! I can say this is one of the funnest car games to date! A must buy if you love cars! expecially RC cars "Not like myself though" Can't say i would ever consider one of these in real life, i think i'll pass on that one lol","March 28, 2015","true","4.0"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","10","17","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtenebrous/recommended/335070/","jtenebrous","jTenebrous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtenebrous/","628 products in account","Updated Review, Thumbs Up (28 Aug 15):\nIn short, I used to take issue with the long-standing fact that not all content was available to owners of the Steam release of VRC-Pro, and that the various platforms were not at parity with one another.  That issue has now been largely resolved, in the form of an all-inclusive DLC which unlocks everything for the life of the product.  The full package doesn't come cheap, but I feel the asking price isn't unreasonable considering the niche market, licensed content, and comparitive pricing of other simulation dlc (e.g. DCS World, The Pinball Arcade, etc.)  In every other regard, I continue to feel that VRC-Pro achieves its aim of providing a realistic simulation of and training tool for rc motorsports.  So the devs have delivered, and fair is fair - I would now recommend VRC-Pro to all rc enthusiasts, including those who prefer Steam as their gaming platform of choice.\n\n\nOriginal Review, Thumbs Down (18 June 2015):\n\nI would like to rate VRC Pro positively - I really would.  But I can't at this moment in time, and I'll elaborate as to why, with the hope that I can change this rating in the future.  Do you see the 15th of June (2015) update posted here on Steam with a video of offroad track "Psycho Nitro Blast 6"?  You can't race that track if you own VRC Pro on Steam rather than the Freemium/Subscription version.  Or many, many others.  Also, you can't access a number of performance parts that top race winners are using.  Even if you buy all the Steam DLC, there is a heap of content that is not offered to you.  It's been this way for awhile now.  You can have fun, as well as high-performing RC cars, with what is on offer in Steam VRC version... BUT... there's a glass ceiling built into this version, which means it is just not-at-all on a par with the Freemium version.\n\nI find it really grating to be left behind after I've shelled out ~£30 plus the cost of a real RC controller and usb adaptor.  Some users will point out how inexpensive this is compared to a real RC car and track time...surely I should be thankful that I *only* paid £30 for a handful of cars and tracks? By that logic, racing a Ferrari around the Nordschliefe in Assetto Corsa or flying an A-10 Warthog in DCS World should me cost thousands of pounds for the experience!  After all, I *would* probably be a better IRL A-10 pilot if I mastered the DCS version, no? In the virtual, PC software world, however, £30 is the price of a quality full-release title, sim or otherwise, and I'm not pleased that the Steam release of this title is a second-rate citizen.  And yes, I will pay for good DLC - but the developer has to actually offer it up for sale first!\n\nHow is VRC Pro as a an RC simulator, then?  Well, credit-where-it's-due, it's pretty impressive.  The physics are realistic, as far as I can tell, and it does feel quite a lot like I remember of driving my high-performance nitro RC vehicles some 10+ years ago.  The graphics are good enough to suit the purpose, though the camera can take some fiddling around with to make it feel right.  I play it stretched across 3 monitors, and find that to be a really nice option if you have such a setup.  Overall, I could easily feel more positive about VRC Pro if all existing versions of it were at parity with each other.  If you think you can be happy having a decent collection of cars to bash around a decent collection of tracks, and aren't necessarily wanting to access more than is bundled here, whilst being teased with new-release videos of the sweet new tracks accessible only to the Freemium version players, then, by all means, give this one a go.  Otherwise, perhaps it's just best to skip this version and decide if you'd be better served by just going straight to the Freemium version.","June 18, 2015","true","43.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","5"

Everything about the simulation is pretty much spot on with how it is in real life, aside from the occasional glitches that are to be expected with any software, One of the things I like about this title is, when you crash your car (and you will crash...I still crash...a lot), you don't have to worry about breaking anything.
