But what has really changed? Is Godus now the God Game we all thought it would be when Peter asked for our money on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access or is it still something you should avoid if you haven't bought it yet?\n\nThe short answer is: Godus is way better now but still not worth your money, maybe at a 75% discount but not if you have to pay 19€ for it. Do you want to know why? Keep on reading.\n\n2014-05-27: Review is still accurate, Godus is still not a real (PC) game.\n\n\nCore Gameplay\nThe land in Godus consists of different layers which you can push, pull or completely remove, but not add. This so-called sculpting it the main mechanic of the game, you will spent most of your time flattening the land so that your followers have enough room to build new abodes and spread.\nCompared to the previous versions you can now sculpt more land before you have to click again, which is a real improvement but the mechanic still doesn't feel quite right. It's more enjoyable but only if done in small peaces, if you try to sculpt larger areas it gets really annoying especially cos stuff like digging down or moving multiple layers doesn't unlock till way later in the game.\nIn addition to sculpting you have some god powers like beautifying land, plant trees or conjuring rain to aid your farmers. These powers look neat but you won't use them very often, they just don't add anything noticeable to the gameplay.\n\n\nBelief\nIn order to sculpt land and to fuel your god powers you need belief, the main resource in Godus. Belief is generate by your people while they are breeding and appears in form of bubbles over their abodes which you than have to collect manually. Granted, the mechanic has been vastly improved compared to 1.3.1 cos you can now click & hold the mouse button and then drag the cursor over as many bubbles as you want to collect them instead of clicking each one individually, but it still is unnecessarily complicated and makes the game feel like a mobile game.\nThis is especially annoying - and concerning - cos pretty much every alpha and later beta player complained about this from the very beginning. People basically begged 22Cans to automate the collection of belief but they just didn't listen.\n\n\nTimeline, Stickers and Chests\nYour civilization's progression is represented by a timeline (former scrap book) which consists of technology cards that unlock once you reached a certain number of followers, crops, ore and so on. To activate cards some of them have to be assigned a certain amount of stickers (starting at one but raising up to above 20 very soon). These stickers come in different categories like social, tools or industry and are obtained by either playing Voyages of Discovery missions (see below) or by finding them in chests which you have to dig up by sculpting land.\nThis "resource" system is probably the most flawed system in Godus. First of all digging up chests to get random stickers is not fun. Secondly it hurts the sandbox element of the game cos chests (or missions), and therefore stickers, are extremely limited. And finally it's just a shallow and uninspired substitute for a real resource system.\n\n\nSettlements\nOnce you have unlocked and activated the respective cards you can place different kinds of settlements (regular, farming, mining, ...) on plots. When you do that a settlement is create that contains the plots or abodes in it's close proximity.\nCompared to the previous versions settlements now no longer just gather belief of all the abodes in their area of influence they now allow you to customize your civilization a little bit. The people in a settlement can have one of three jobs. Breeders create new people (as long as their are abodes for them) and belief, Buffers increase the belief generated by your Breeders and Worker do the job specific to the settlement. In a regular Settlement Workers are just common builders (your regular people), in a farming settlement your Workers are Farmers that can create Farms on free plots and harvest crops and so on.\nThe new settlements really add to the game and most definitively are the feature I like most about 2.0. Granted, assigning people jobs is still a little bit clunky and I can't for the love of god figure out how to deal with that stupid unemployed people that just waste valuable space in my settlements, but it is still a great idea.\n\n\nVoyages of Discovery\nVoyages replaced the rather lackluster PvP Battles and story missions in the former versions. Voyages basically play like a light version of Lemmings, you have a small group of followers that have to reach a shrine. Your job is to make sure that there not just is a path that allows them to do so in time - there is a timer ticking down - but also that they avoid hazards that try to kill them on the way. On a successful run you get stickers, if you fail you lose all the people you send and you to use belief to get a new group.\nAs simplistic as this might be it also is kinda fun, it's the type of mini game you might wanna play during lunch break. However, it also is incredibly annoying that you have to do all these mission to get the stickers in order to advance. If you don't grind Voyages you will run out of stickers rather soon and won't be able to play the game anymore.\n\n\nFollower AI\nOne 2.0's big features was supposed to be the follower AI. Your people would not longer hide inside their abodes and only come out if you had a job for them. Instead they would stroll around and to interesting stuff.\nWell, that's true and false at the same time. Your followers now actually do stuff but it's a) basically always the same (resting beneath trees, gathering around camp fires, standing next to each other and talking), b) only very few of your people actually do that stuff (maybe 10-15%?) and c) it has no affect whatsoever on the gameplay nor does it reassemble the behavior of a real civilization.\nThe world looks more alive in 2.0 than it did before, but, at least for me, it's still not enough, not by a long shot, it's just a nice little start.\n\n\nLook and Feel\nAll in all the game still looks and feels like a mobile game, it is designed to be played on a 5" display and not on a 24" monitor, and that might be a K.O. criteria for many people. Godus has no tooltips at all, instead you always have to bring up an info screen that covers the whole monitor. There is no quick action bar to select god powers, you can't use the mouse wheel to scroll threw the timeline but you have to click and drag it instead and so on. The  more time you spend playing Godus the clearer it gets that this game's main target group are mobile gamers, it being on PC is just an addition to that concept, not the other way around.\nAnother aspect of the game that just screams mobile are it's timers, it takes ages to get anything done. It starts of okay but once you reached the second age building simple abodes take more than 20 minutes and rebuilding a new shrine requires several hours. That's okay if you just want to play the game for 5 minutes and then leave it till these things are done (currently you have to keep the game running cos there is no server yet) but if you are the kind of gamer that likes to play a game for at least an hour straight you will run out of things to do and spend most of your time waiting.\n\n\nJup, still bad.","November 27, 2013","false","29.0"," 3,167 of 3,493 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","167","3","0","64"

Look elsewhere. This game is about digging up cards in the dirt.\n\nThe bulk of this game has you flattening land for your followers so that they can, in turn, build structures to live and prosper in. The world is made up of layers, like a cake, and you peel those layers to shape the land. In order to unlock spells (that are completely worthless) and expand your influence, you need to collect trading cards in buried chests scattered across the land. To dig up chests and flatten land you need a currency called 'belief' and to get this you need to collect bubbles of 'belief' on top of your peasants' houses. The generation of this belief is on a timer and you'll find yourself waiting hours to do anything substantial. Basically it's a facebook game.\n\nDid I mention there is a cash shop where you can buy power and progress (Thus skipping the otherwise forced wait)? Oh yeah, there's that too. I was hoping this game would be the "re-genesis of the god genre" but it wasn't really. I don't know how I might have thought that-- oh wait, the developer said it, silly me. Multiplayer might be cool in the future-- that is if it actually becomes... ya know... MULTIplayer. Right now it's just an AI skirmish mode where you play against a bot. When you go to the multiplayer lobby you are inundated by a flood of fake IMs from a 13 year old girl or something. It's weird and a bit creepy. Somebody wrote her dialogue, winky faces and kitty faces included. By the third match and subsequent IM deluge, I started to hope that the writer of this was on a pedophile watchlist.\n\nHowever, this game is not currently finished. It is a steam early access title and I will update my review as it becomes appropriate.","September 25, 2013","false","9.9"," 2,681 of 2,989 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","681","2","0","34"

I would have recommended it in a heartbeat to anyone who showed an interest in it. I even bought a copy for a good friend of mine so he could play it too. We even had PvP matches in the now removed multiplayer side of the game.\n\nThe game is not what I paid for anymore. I did not pay for a mobile touch screen game. The fact that 22cans have gone this route with Godus has made me play it less. I used to spend hours on end playing until it was changed to this mobile style.\n\nJust take a look at this old screenshot which shows a few features I miss from the game:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=186039142\n\nFeatures like flags on buildings to show when they are full that wave in the direction of the wind!\nAnd a follower who is named after a friend who I beat in multiplayer PvP match.\nNot to mention the better looking buildings with more variety.\nThe side bar of skills was easier to use than the current system.\nHow about the other races, like the ginger hair race or the mountain men. Now we are just us and the Astari :/\n\nAnd have a look at this old screenshot too, the larger towns created using a statue with actual roads:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=327651332\n\nJust these 2 screenshots alone show how far backwards the mobile style game took. So much variety removed to make it 'more suitable' for the mobile devices.\n\nAgain, I did not pay for a mobile game. I feel like I was cheated out of my money, led to believe I was getting a cool game that I actually enjoyed playing only to have it taken away from me and replaced with an inferior substistute, not worth even half what I paid for, that mobile users can play for free!\nI get the feeling that this is what 22cans intended from the start, get our money and use it to launch themselves into the mobile gaming market.\n\nFor this I can not recommend Godus anymore. It's a sad case as I loved how it was going before they took the mobile route :(","October 16, 2014","false","152.7"," 337 of 344 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","337","344","0","8"

I really want to enjoy it and spend hours on end sculpting worlds, making everything better for my little worshippers and punishing those that dare oppose me or my little minions.\n\nI just can't.\n\n\nI supported the game in the Kickstarter campaign and I was thrilled to see Peter Molyneux reinvent the Populous game. This was awesome and I wanted in. Following the team develop the game gave me hopes and concerns, unfortunately most of the latter. I saw some appalling design descions and hoped they would change it or that I just would be proven wrong. Gaining access to beta in 2013 (two years ago) told me first hand, that that was not the case. At the time, they told us it was at most 40% complete.\n\nI played it an entire evening and afterwards I felt I had been waiting for the fun to happen the whole time. It was like, I just have to play a little more, and then the real fun begins. It had potential but it's a slow, grinding, waiting and ultimately boring game. Disappointed I left it there and haven't touched it until yesterday.\n\nTwo years have gone. There's a counter ingame that says it's 53% complete. Almost nothing happened to that progress bar in two years!\n\nTruth to be told a lot of features have been added but the core game is still slow, grinding, waiting for the fun to begin and ultimately it's still a boring game. There are so many design decisions that seems to be in place to slow the game down, make the player do senseless tasks and grind to oblivion and back.\n\nRealising that the game has actually been redesigned to a mobile game with in-app purchases to speed up gameplay makes all of the above make sense. This is however not the game I bought. Peter Molyneux revealed himself a fraud unfortunately.\n\nI want to love this game but I just can't.","October 9, 2015","false","9.2"," 380 of 396 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","380","396","7","5"

You cannot close this game unless you use the task manager. The quit and close buttons in this game either do not work or freeze the windows. There has been no hotfix and its been like this since whenever they last updated - a few months ago?\n\nThis is a mobile game being funded on Steam.\n\nThis is an updated review for Godus 2.0.\n2.0 hours: Around ~10hrs+\n\nOnce again, I suggest waiting before purchasing - after all, there is supposedly a mobile version coming out that will be FREE.\n\nFirst, I just want to say: Voyages are very annoying. I can't stand it and I would have to say it is the only reason I am not advancing through the game as I want to - because it takes so much effort for me to even attempt a voyage. Some of the voyages don't even give you enough time, even WHEN the AI chooses the correct pathing. If you're going to time it, at least give extra time if a follower enters the goal so the OTHER followers who are RIGHT behind the first follower has time to enter. It's just so stupid when you lose a follower when he's ABOUT TO ENTER THE DOOR. By Godus he can even SEE the house! HERE is where I  would want the pointer we had in the previous version, where a light appeared from the sky and the followers see it and set a path towards the light. Seriously, are we as the Watchers of our people just going to let them wander around and get LOST? We should be guiding them, not with just shaping the world around the people but also have a guiding light. It is not a good thing when you have a god game and you feel HELPLESS as your followers go full noob on foreign ground.\n\nIf the developers want voyages to be like a sort of mini-game with a challenge. Dont't make it a challenge for the players to hope the followers choose the right AI and go in the correct direction.\n\nLet us point towards the direction we want our followers to go and instead of making the followers act like they're blind, give us some randomly generated challenges. Give us the ability to put our God powers in action. In one of the earlier challenges, there is a Giant who I am pretty sure was dangerous for our followers. Thankfully there was a second path you could force ur followers to take if you block the path towards the giant quick enough. But say you couldn't find another path and must face the giant. Can I not just say....squish it with the finger of god? We can easily incoporate ways to use beautify to stop swamps that are slowing the people down, or activate a speed totem to bring my followers faster to their destination. Instead all my followers are using a broken compass.\n\nThere should be no reason to have chests laying around with resources that don't come back. Is the world which was created lack actual resources? The followers should be using material around them. If that is too hard to do for this game, I feel the chests should replenish like the trees and rocks in the game. Maybe not to the amount the latter comes in, but at least every 6 hours or a day if you want, there would be some random chests in the world. This way you can make the voyage system look attractive but not required - people can WAIT to earn resources for their game, or play voyages to get them faster. After all, we have to wait for belief, it wouldn't change the fact that coming back to check for chests would be a reason for the God of the world to visit the homeland.\n\nThe interface is a little better than the book in my opinion, as its cleaner and a lot faster than the previous one where I had to scroll through all the resources if I wanted something or just simply never looked at it. I think the previous interface for the god powers and totems should have stayed however, opening so many screens does the art of the Godus world no justice if you cover it up. There were a few interface suggestions within the forums I hope don't go unnoticed.\n\nOne of the biggest highlights in this game has to be the way the world looks. It is very simple yet is what makes the game beautiful and makes me want to stare at the screen endlessly. I was especially happy with the addition follower interaction. Seeing a follower sit by the river to bathe made it look like the people had things they did outside of their homes - they had minds, they communicated. But it is purely just asthetics and have no influence over the world itself. Other than improvements to the art part of this game, there doesn't seem to be much improvement from the previous version in terms of mechanics.","November 25, 2013","false","131.6"," 1,218 of 1,403 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","218","1","0","0"

There it is, my badge of courage! They can stop me from saying my piece there, but they can't stop me here. The game is utter trash, no play mechanics, no updates, not written for PC, etc. etc. etc. The game has no basis to exist. On the forums, when players say what needs fixed, or added to the game, the devs. ignore them. Instead they start asking what should be done w/ the trees. Oh yeah, rotten game but I really want to see changes made to the trees.\n\nIn development, but you would never know that, since there have been no updates for over 5 months. That's not all you won't see, expect no information from the devs about what is being done w/ the game, the devs. have little/no contact w/ the player base which shrinks daily. The only people still having anything to do w/ this game are the people who have recently wasted whatever amount of money they just spent on this garbage. Steam should have removed this game from their catalog about 6 weeks from the day it was first offered for sale, if that long.\n\nThis game is Early Access & that is a bad thing, because this game has turned the public away from this mode of development in droves. Developers who were considering this type of format, should be seeking out Mr. Molyneux & lynching him for killing the concept. The game also went through Kickstarter & gave that format a bad name too. The reason it is being sold on Steam is to grab more cash to develop the mobile game. When did Steam start selling mobile phone games?\n\nPeter Molyneux (the person in charge, or the one ignoring this mess, take your pick) was hailed as the creator of the god game with the release of Populous. Many games followed, but if you want them named I'm not going that route here, that's what a search engine is for. A few games on his list after Populous had some interesting play mechanics, but Peter has a mouth that offers what his a$$ cannot produce, but that's where most of his recent work has spewed from. THE MAN FLAT OUT LIES!  Don't believe anything he says, if he states it will be in the game, it won't. If he says it won't, you are guaranteed that it will.\n\nGodus is not a PC game, don't think that for a minute, it's a cow clicker phone/tablet game that needs no actual thought to play. It's click, click, click, until you go into a fog & come out the other side wondering what did you just do with the time you wasted on this? Nothing, you just passed time that's all.\n\nI've already turned this review into a TL:DR post which is sad. I could go on for paragraph after paragraph. Let me end w/ just one more thought, if I stop just one person from spending any money on this loser, that alone will make my time writing this worth it. I hope it is you dear reader. Thank you for your time, please don't waste your money on this tripe. My rating is -10 out of 10.\n\nEdit 8/13/2014\n\nThe knuckleheads who continue to leave comments about how long I played this crap need to realize that there are multiple timers. Some of them running for periods of up to 4 days... yes you read that right, it's not a typo. I left it running more in the background than I did in actual game play. As far as Early Access, periodic checks I have made in the forums still indicate that the game is in just as bad shape as it was in the time frame in which this review was posted. In fact, the devs are still engaged in working on the mobile apps, & forsee no major changes being made to the PC version until "sometime in the fall". Since they make more false statements than anything else, that equates to maybe never to me.\n\nCheck out the Ipod store. This "game" is up there, & the devs have stated that they are engaged in working on the android version. So if that is where their current thrust is, just how much work is going toward the PC?  This "game" has sat at the 50% completion level for a year and a half now. Say whatever you like about my review, come back here after you wasted your money on it & let me know just how much you like it. This crap was put on Steam merely to generate more cash so that work on the phone apps work could continue, nothing more. Go play it on your phone, it's free but the timers can only be over ridden by the purchase of gems costing real cash.

Since it's first iteration, it clearly showed it was a mobile game transplanted onto a PC. Regardless, I loved the art style and I played it for many many hours. Then 22Cans went silent for months and I lost interest and abandoned it. Recently they picked up and I've spent a few hours playing the latest build.\n\nAnd it's ♥♥♥♥ing dreadful.\n\nThe mobile game transplated onto a PC has fully metamorphosed into a pay to win mobile title. As an example, take farming. As soon as you discover farming, you can no longer build. Anything. Unless you have wheat. Each farm produces wheat - in 90 minutes of real time. REAL TIME? WHAT IN THE ♥♥♥♥? So every one and a half hours, I can build a couple of houses. (And the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ farmers can't harvest the wheat, oh no, you have to do it yourself).\n\nOf course, you can always buy wheat using gems. 22Cans love gems. They go out of their way to constantly point this out. They have built a game around the microtransactions of gems. Because PC users have already paid for the game (their words), PC users don't have to buy gems. Instead, we can sacrifice our followers in a pit to get a gem. Of course, that makes your followers hate you, also triggers another real time timer to respawn that follower - in 30 minutes or so. Whilst the new faction (which I have to admit, is funny) steal your followers.\n\nThe last update also added voyages, frustrating mini games where you try to get your little dudes to a temple for rewards. Of course, if you screw up then you can either way HOURS of real time for reinforcements to arrive to try again or... you got it, pay gems.\n\nThis game has so much promise. I really like the art style, the humour, and the ideas of the game. But the implementation is ♥♥♥♥ing attrocious.\n\nI have never sworn so much in a review... I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the direction of this game and it shows.\n\nI shall go back to playing Banished.

I have played over 30 hours and have tried to feel out and understand this concept of using REAL time as the main form of currency in this rather UNgodly city builder. This attempt by 22cans to carry over Gems from the mobile version (gems being the currency that users pay real money for in the iOS version) and trying to squeeze them into the PC version is absolutely a bummer. For a few days I started to think that it might work alright, but in the end its just an empty currency middle man that really doesn't feel like it belongs in a game I have already purchased for a premium price. All the gems in the world are currently not helping me reduce the absurd wait times for generating specialized followers (farmers, miners) one of my wait times is currently 21 hours (REAL HOURS) for 1 new farmer to be produced. That 1 new farmer allows me to increase my total farms by 1 and makes me shudder at the future cards that have yet to be unlocked that require... 70 farms... or worse... 50 Mines. That is literally weeks of forced waiting just to unlock in game functions that are less than enticing. And like everything else in the game, the price and wait times increase with every added specialized follower or item placed. At this rate, I would assume the last farmer of my settlement will take around 2 days to be produced. 22cans wants you to believe that these "valuable gems" are their gift to us gamers who want to "play at our own pace" when really its just a misplaced ported currency that might make sense in a freemium mobile game model where you want your casual pocket gamers to be dropping $5-50 a pop for small offerings of gems that are really only used to bypass timers. How fun? These gems in their current form do not belong in a paid PC title.\n\nNot that you're reading any of these complaints, Peter Molyneux, but I was a big fan back in the days of Populous and up to Black and White, but you have proven time and time again since then that you are completely out of touch with what your fans (and now your duped financial backers) want. 21 hours for a single farmer Peter? What PC gamer has the time to check in constantly to collect belief? How have you managed to take such a neat looking little sandbox antfarm with so much potential and turn it into a game about waiting and the tedious collection of such ridiculously related resources? You sold your backers on the idea that you were going into this without a publisher, telling us that this would lead to completely unhindered creativity and maximize community influence on the product. How did you think we would feel when you revealed that you are building this game around a freemium mobile business model (because you DID end up partnering with a publisher after all) and that we the PC users and financial backers would now be stuck with shabby "pay to play" mechanics? Waiting so long for relatively unexciting things to happen completely disrespects the time of the gamers who want to sit down and actually play a game for more than the snippets of time between the various and superfluos wait timers. Im lucky to get a half hour before I literally run out of things I can possibly do.\n\nYou've lost it Molyneux, or you've just gradually become more and more of a con man over the years. This kickstarter is almost theft, as you used our money (when you have millions) to fund a game that you are hoping will saturate app markets and shine just enough when compared to the morass of bad free to play games so that you can... what... sell gems for a living and retire this profession you obviously stopped caring about? Next time, do it with your own money, chap.","November 4, 2014","false","50.0"," 199 of 210 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","199","210","0","7"

I usually find myself enjoying the mechanics and art style of the game, but the development for the game has been pretty bad.\n\nThere used to be multiplayer, there isn't, anymore. This is just one of many things that were supposed to be in the game, and now will apparently never be included.\n\nThe reason for that? It's pretty much "done" in the eyes of the company making the game, aside from some finishing up.\n\nCommunication has been quite bad from 22cans, with nothing answered clearly enough to indicate that they're not abandoning the game.\n\nFrankly, the game is pretty fun to play, if you're into the whole sim-people sort of genre, but it lacks focus, development, and a future.\n\nWith those faults, I wouldn't recommend it at this price, as in retrospect, the idea of what it would become was probably what motivated me.\n\nKnowing the game will never become much more than it is now... that kinda kills all passion to play.","January 28, 2015","false","97.7"," 220 of 242 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","220","242","7","0"

There was a fair bit to do, controls seemed easy enough and it was quite fun with very little restriction in exploring the World even though. You had to ctrl+alt+del to quit the game but I expected some big bugs.\n\nThen everything went silent, for months there were no updates and no communication. Nothing was announced until the update was around the corner. A complete over-haul of the game was done which completely changed the game, some new things were added which restricted the original explore at your leisure feeling of the previous version. It also changed from feeling like a PC game to feeling more like an Android app that I'm able to play on my computer. You still had to ctrl+alt+del to exit the game which was a tad annoying.\n\nSome minor and additions changes were made. A happiness meter which was added to this re-vamp turned out to be game breakingly bugged. The ways to make them happy were expensive and very inefficient, while in the game your citizens would become depressed within seconds of anything happening. A warring faction that was introduced would just wreck your village with you being pretty much unable to fend off as it happens pretty early on and frequently. You still had to ctrl+alt+del to quit the game which was getting tedious.\n\nNeedless to say a patch was quickly developed and removed some of the key features. Nothing was really added to the game until the next major update, some tweaks and changes here and there. None of these updates kept you from still having to ctrl+alt+del to exit the game though.\n\nThen the big downfall happened with the next major update. Had they spent all these months adding lots of new content to the game and fixing bugs? No! Well, technically no. The time spent in those months was in bringing the unfished, buggy pile of crap into the mobile phone market. It's free, but leans heavily on the pay to win aspect. What had they done to the PC version? They turned it into the style of the mobile app and kept the pay to win aspects with it, instead of paying money for these aspects you had to pay with resources and such. You still had to fecking ctrl+alt+del to quit the game.\n\nI had hope for many months, after 18-24 months I was still clinging on to some sense of hope that something would emerge positively from all this waiting. All that's happened in two years is a revamp with no real game progress, the game developed and re-coded into a mobile phone version, then the game seemingly being ported from the mobile app with a few tweaks. I quit the game for a long time until about a month ago. I thought I'd see what's new and what's been added since I spent a few months away. Well turns out nothing was really new, the progress I made was less than when I played the 1.0.3 version. After a few days of getting to a point where progress was just halted, I was getting a handful of stickers a day and it turned out I could use the "pay to win" aspect to get more I just uninstalled the game and vowed never to return. Oh yes, I had to ctrl+alt+delete to quit the game before uninstalling it.","May 5, 2015","false","45.9"," 150 of 155 people (97%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","97","150","155","30","2"

Guess what Peter M - I don't get lost in my land when I rotate my camera, just like I dont get lost when I walk in more than one direction in real life.\n\n9 - It's moved from Alpha to Beta 2.1 - but there seems to be a game missing??\n\nI still would not recommend this game to anybody that I wanted to remain friends with.\nI'll check in next year and see how we go.\n\nKickstarter estimated release date September 2013..... yeah right.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nReview - December 2013\nFirstly I'm a massive fan of Peter Molyneux past games, Dungeon Keeper being one of my all time favs.\n\nWith that said, I gave this game 100+ plus hours of gameplay, restarted several times to give the game the best possible chance to grow on me.\n\nThe game concept has a lot of potential but is hamstrung by several of the core mechanics.\n1 - it plays like a facebook game\n2 - click everything, click faster, click now, you will end up with a wrist injury in this game...click, click, click, click you get the idea.\n3 - it feels like it was designed for the mobile platform, but the devs says it isn’t.\n4 - it feels like it was designed to be monetised on the mobile platform, but the devs say it isn’t.\n5 - Tiering up is actually less efficient than keeping your entire population stuck in the stone age\n6 - sculpting land is one of the most painful experiences I've had in a game, not that sculpting any given area is hard, its just that you need to do so much of it.\nThe initial fun of doing a little bit of sculpting (an hour or so) is killed by the knowledge that you will need to do another hundred hours of slow slow slow mind numbing, frustrating, rubber band breaking boredom and pain.\n7 - the devs don’t communicate, the official forums are nearly dead, and even the mods on the forums seem to have given up.\n8 - game updates, well we had one two months ago.........\n9 - complete feature sets are missing, but that’s OK its an Alpha, but with the speed of updates it might always be an alpha.\n\nSo, after all of that, I still enjoyed parts of my time in the Godus world, I still think it has potential if some of these core mechanics get redesigned.\nCan I recommend it to anybody I want to remain friends with, Sorry but NO.","December 11, 2013","false","144.3"," 307 of 356 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","307","356","0","5"

In the majority of early access games, i can say that, but only if i then say "But it might get better". With Godus, this is not the case. The game is terrible, and it isnt going to get better. Let me say a few things, before i get to the review, in fear of losing some people to boredom.\n\nIf you want Black and White 3: Do  NOT  buy this game.\nIf you want a city builder: Do  NOT  buy this game.\nIf you want a town simulator: Do  NOT  buy this game.\nIf you enjoyed farmville or other such games: You MIGHT enjoy this game.\n\nThis games very core concept is simple, really: use your "Dragging" Power to drag the land (Think of the land as a layer-cake, with evenly-sized "layers" to the landscape) to make areas of flat, even land. When a large enough area of flat land is found, a house plot will be placed. By clicking on a nearby house, a person will appear to walk over and build on the new plot of land.\n\nThe reason you do this is to generate a arbitrary resource, over time, called "Belief". With belief you can drag the land, place statues that increase the efficiency of the people and a few other, minor, things, such as directing your people in a specific direction.\n\nTo gather this belief, you click on a house when a pink bubble appears over each of their individual houses.\n\nThen you drag some more land and get more houses.\n\nBut that isnt all, thankfully. You can also "Tech Up" through several "Epochs" of civilization - bronze age, iron age, and so on. To do this... you find "chests" scattered around the world - some underground, some out of your area of influence, some found by doing arbritarty minigames that amount to doing what you were doing already. When you find enough "chests", you can place the "Stickers" you get from the chests onto "Cards", which unlock "Technologies" which results in a advancemnt of "epoch". The reason all of those were in quotations was due to the fact that all of the above thing; Chests, Stickers, Cards, Technologies and Epochs, are all completetly arbritary. You find a "Furs" sticker, and nothing happens. You get the "Family" card and nothing happens. You advance a epoch, and nothing happens.\n\nAt best, the technology system is nothing more than a glorified banner representing how much you have played the game.\n\nThere is a horrible sounddesign (Wind that gets annoying, and various "PLING. PLONG. PLING" noises from clicking things) The graphics design is awful, consisting of manequin people (devoid of all personality, emotion, or even looks) Houses (Which are basically brown squares that all look the same) and the landscape (Which frankly looks just weird, really.)\n\nPlease. Dont buy this game. It is a waste of money. There is so little game in this game for the $20 you could spend on it. Go and buy another $20 game, or go get a book. Watch a movie. There is no reason to spend that large an ammount of money on this game.","May 22, 2014","false","7.5"," 314 of 375 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","314","375","0","0"

The moderators of the forum have, two days ago, created two subforums where they have placed all negativity to give the illusion to newcomers that everyone is happy happy happy.\n\nThe disturbing thing is, as recent and deplorable as that is, it is only a contender for the worst thing the PR team does.

I remember long nights playing Populous: The Beginning when I was younger - even the little phrases of the braves, "waybo? Gid'aye" after all these years are still etched in my memory. I still from time to time come back to this game as a timeless masterpiece of the God Sim from the original God Sim master himself, Peter Molyneaux.\n\nHow the mighty have fallen.\n\nGodus sounds good on paper. It sounds like a spiritual successor to Populous, and I was an early supporter. I forgave the game it's early flaws;  a complex, confusing morass of "stickers" and "cards" for gameplay progression, a repetitive AI and gameplay, a directionless, non-existent story. Such was my reverence for Populous I was convinced that "it'll get better with the next update." I couldn't be more wrong. After some time now, various updates and promises to a loyal fanbase that this game will get better I am now finally giving up.\n\nGodus is a frustrating and unrewarding experience. I have played since the first version and through all the updates and I still have no idea what is going on, how to progress or improve my villages and can make no sense whatsoever of the sticker system. I have found myself doing exactly the same thing since the start - continually clicking stupid little purple bubbles just to get enough "belief points" to move the slightest bit of land.. continually coming up against "you do not have this power" message, with no clear path towards gaining said upgrade or ability except another 60 hours of repetitive clicking.\n\nThis game is an insult to the legacy of Populous and the God SIm genre. It's almost an embarassment to admit that I have purchased it and I have finally had enough of wasting any more time with it.\n\nFor those who have played Populous: The Beginning and hope for some kind of spiritual successor I strongly advise to look elsewhere. This game is so awful and tedious I wouldn't even download it if it were free. I so wished it would be different and for months now I have given it chance after chance, without any improvement. It pains me to say it, but I see no hope of redemption, since it's actually gotten worse as time goes on.\n\nAvoid - and if you are unfortunate enough to buy this game, the next time you load Populous you might notice the braves all speaking English - "told you so!"","January 28, 2015","false","63.7"," 143 of 154 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","143","154","0","2"

Sculpting burns through your "belief" resource like crazy bananas, so you get to spend a lot of time not playing the game while waiting for more belief to spawn.  Of course you can spend gems on belief and other resources, but to do that you have to sacrifice your people to the pit of doom, and wait about an hour or so for them to respawn.  Oh, and forget about dragging your followers from the far reaches of your civilization into the one and only pit of doom- IF the buggy controls dont end up guiding all your little people to some random spot on the map you didn't intend, they'll have routing issues and just get stuck until you kill them.\nHaving to wait an entire day for a farming colony to spawn a farmer is just frustrating as all get out.  One would think with all the 'pay x gems now to do y' they would have included an option to fill a settlement with workers in exchange for gems but nope.  You get to wait.\nVoyages are frustrating annoying mini-games, which I honestly can't tell if they're broken or not for me as I completed one and then could no longer access the menu to it.\nThere is no easy in game option to restart the game fresh, you have to manually locate the save.  A minor nuisance, but still.\nThe graphics could be better- I prefer to play most god-like games zoomed out for a better overview but it doesn't like to render that far out.\nThe unlock cards though gameplay mechanic seems straightforward but NOPE.  You don't actually unlock the feature on the card until you put enough matching stickers on it- oh and you can use gems to buy more stickers.\n\nI actually do enjoy the sculpting aspect, despite it's quite buggy nature.  However having to wait for hours for enough belief to actually do it is annoying.\n\nIt's only playable if you only spend 15-20 minutes on it here and there, since the timers elapse in real time.  That said, I'm glad I got it on sale for really cheap because it is NOT worth the 20+ dollars they're asking.  It's still considered "early access" and it says only 52% complete so... here's hoping they fix it so it's more of a real game and not just a gutless imitation of a pay model.  Until then, it's not worth more than 5 bucks.","October 17, 2014","false","48.0"," 112 of 117 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","112","117","0","0"

Nope, time passes real-time, and makes no difference if you don't actually run the game. Which is annoying when you have something that you can only access over the next 72 hours, but you're away visiting family/friends/SO.\n\nI hate this game for expecting to keep me on a leesh, like it's a pet that needs letting out. I've played 4 hours... the first 3 were fun, the final hour was after a days break... I ran out of stuff to do in that 1 hour, and the game made clear that I should come back the next day.\n\nAs other reviewers have written, this is a mobile game that the devs have purposely sold as a computer experience to raise funds to make a game they can monetize in micro-transactions.

As a long-time fan of Populous and some other of Peter M. games, I was really excited to see Godus appear. I even bought a copy for my son as I expected he would get the enjoyment I did out of Populous.\n\nI played the early betas for hours and enjoyed up to a point. I always accepted these were betas and fed back to 22Cans when I encountered issues. They were prompt in replying and fixing these issues. I was impressed and felt positive about the future of Godus.\n\nAs time has progressed, the game has not progressed well imo. It has become very frustrating and certainly doesn't come close to any Zen like experience. In fact quite the opposite!\nI just played the latest version, 2.4 or something. The first thing I encountered was a stuck title screen. After bashing my keyboard a few times expecting it to move on, I went to desktop and found, by accident, a popup telling me it found to saves and asking which one I wanted to use. Good grief what a school boy error it is for this to appear in the background!\n\nEventually, I got into the game. Whoopdidoo, the tutorial - AGIAN!! And yes, 22Cans, your voices ARE aggravating. Why can’t I press the space bar to zip past the tutorial? Why do I have to go the options menu to skip tutorials? And why oh WHY! Am I presented with yet another stealth popup in the background asking if I actually want to skip tutorials??!!  I only found this when I did ctrl+alt+delete to bring up task manager to kill the game. I was tense and shouting at this game by now and I am a patient person – honest!\n\nI still hope they get this game something close to what was envisioned by Peter M. but I admit that I am losing faith by now. Fingers crossed it gets better.\nIf you are considering buying this game, I would seriously wait until it is complete and then read some reviews of the finished article. At this stage, I don’t believe 22Cans deserves our faith or money in their ability to deliver something great!\n","March 28, 2015","false","37.1"," 97 of 101 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","97","101","5","0"

I had big hopes and I really fell in love with the idea of the game and it's mechanics. Now, three years later my patience have run out. In the beginning when I got to play alpha (beta?, don't remember anymore) I got really excited. Some stuff was really cool and some mechanics needed to be changed, which I think is normal for a game in alpha (or beta..). 22Cans send out an survay and asked people what they thought about the game, and I felt like they really did listen to us. Many of the things I (and many others) thought needed a change, they actually changed - after this everything fell apart.\n\nThey suddenly decided to focus on the mobileversion of the game, and almost left the PC-version to it self. There have been so many updates, and so many "new" beginings - and the worst part is that the game actually gets worse and worse in some aspects. It feels pretty bad that after spendig money on kickstarter for a PC game, that the developers changed their focus over to the mobilversion.\n\nI really, REALLY, advice you to stay away from this game - at least until it's 100% finished (which I think it never will be), since the game is 2 years late already. Keep your money and spend it on something else. I can still spend 5-10 hours on it sometimes, but it's just not finished and it dosen't work as inteded.

Why? please read.\n\nAs far as the Early Access goes, this is a game that should be in Mobile Devices and worth as much as, incredible amounts of grinding and the best game to compare it with, is FarmVille, but without the microtransactions... at the moment?\n\nAt the moment, It is a landscape editor with funny little animations of Slender Man-like people building villages...your work? other than edit the land to make some space for your little guys to do all the work, you'll have to dig holes to look for resources like wood, no... no chopping down trees or telling your guys to do it for you, the wood, fire, pelts and more cards (yes, cards) are only found in chests hidden underground (it would do way better with resource gathering, like Age of Empires) these are used as requirements for upgrades, usually new buildings... and you need to click over every single house to collect their "Belief", yes, one by one, every 5 or so minutes (I've had to click over more than 50 buildings), yes there are ways to make it easier, but they increase in cost the more you build, which increases the grinding, but at least it would be harder to develop carpal tunnel, anyway the Belief is the resource used to build statues, use powers and more.\n\nI don't really want to get into deeper detail since it is in Early Access and a lot of this stuff could be no more than place holders for better stuff that is in its way... at least I hope so, because this is no fun like this and absolutely not worth those $20.

Still nothing improved much, sadly. I had big hopes when I bought this games. This is not really a god game compared to Populus or Black and White etc...\nIts more a very primitve kind of sim city or civilization...\nLet me share some thoughts:\n\nThe people in the game are doing nothing on there own. Despite of wandering around and get lost or homeless. Why are there always these a annoying hints that follows got lost? What should I do with them?\nFurther more, when I unlock a new better building, people don't upgrade it on there own. I have to destroy the house with Finger of god to get it replaced.\nThese card collecting issue didn't improved at all. It even got more boring. You have to collect a lot of cards to unlock a single feature. After severall hours of gameplay, I still couldn't unlock the improved landscaping features (I have unlocked all Shrines of Expansions).  And it gets worse when you advance in the timeline. Your people should harvest the needed materials to let you advance in technology.\nThe technology tree fells stricktly linear. There is a choice what you will unlock first but at the current state there are not enough cards to develop what are you interested in.\nSettlements are confusing. The infulence range increase, but what does it do? It does not collect more believe in a greater area, nor are more houses integrated... strange...\n\nLets talk about the GUI:\nIt seems to be developed for a tablet. I've bought a game for a PC, so I want to take all advantages of it.  All this linear scrolling with cards and advancements are very confusing. A technology tree would be more convenient.\nA small world map on the top right would be nice for fast navigating. A greater zoom range would help, too. Rotating the map is missing. It is still a lot of clicking and dragging, as I can not unlock the improved landscaping features...\n\nState of the game:\nIts really buggy. It crashes all the time. Noumerous contradictory statements of cards description ... It feels as if the developers where rushed to realse anything, as fast as possible - too sad.\n\nAt the end some good points\n- I like The Discovery Journeys\n- The leashe feature is nice for collecting believe and sending around your people\n\nIn my opinion, the developers should start rebuilding the core gameplane engine to a god game and stop sticking on the "old" game.\n\nSo far, I hope it helps.","March 15, 2014","false","165.5"," 142 of 165 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","142","165","0","2"

"Godus blends the power, growth and scope of Populous with the detailed construction and multiplayer excitement of Dungeon Keeper and the intuitive interface and technical innovation of Black & White."\n\nThe game would "take seven to nine months to complete" and offer single player, multiplayer battles, "a deep social and competitive feature" and be available on Windows, Mac, Linux and mobile devices.\n\nTwo years on and the game now has more in common with an over-monetised mobile game than it does a reimagination of the god game genre.  Peter Molyneux has since talked about new projects and it's rapidly looking like Godus will be abandonware.\n\nGames of this complexity will not happen overnight, but the community is tired of the lack of updates, the lack of communication, the obvious bias to mobile monetisation (at the expense of real game play) and now the cannibalisation of the Godus team so Peter can move on to his next project.\n\nIf you can get it cheap (as in $2-3) you may get 5 to 10 hours entertainment from it... but remember it was Kickstarted two years ago and has been on Steam Early Access for nearly a year, so expecting a fully fledged game at the end of it may be wishful thinking now.\n","February 2, 2015","false","315.9"," 93 of 101 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","93","101","0","0"

I played the crap out of Populous and Populous II as a kid (and syndicate wars, magic carpet and pretty much every other game he had a hand in in the late 80s and early 90s).  and I loved most of them.  Not all of them, but most of them.  So I'm not of the "It's Molyneux!  Get him!" mindset.\n\nAnd I know that this game is very, very much in the early stages.  It's understood that thre's not going to be a great deal of content, and that a lot of the cool stuff they want to put in won't be there for a while.\n\nFine.\n\nBut with all that, I cannot in good conscience recommend Godus.  Not just in its current Early Access form, but at all.  Not because it's Molyneux.  Not because it's not ready.  But because I have a real problem with the design choice that clicking a few thousand times to move landscape into a more efficient configuration.  It's mind numbing.  It's repetitive.  It's physically uncomfortable after any length of time.  And that process - the slowly dragging tiny bits of land so that settlers can be coaxed into building more or bigger settlements?  That's the main mechnic of the game.\n\nI got some brief enjoyment collecting belief as fast as I could to try and play the tune the belief bubbles make before it reset, but very brief.  After about 10 minutes I realized that I was experiencing all the joy of a Skinner box.\n\nThe folks at 22 cans are working to make their game more fun.  They really are.  But until such time as they remove this bizarre fixation of social-media gameplay, I can't see a single reason to recommend this.  The god game genre really does need a new contender, but unless something fundemental changes, this isn't it.  I don't feel like some powerful (or even innefective) deity sheperding (or brutalizing) my believers.  I feel like an under appreciated road worker who is tasked with levelling the land through mouseclicks alone.\n\nMaybe this game will get the changes it deserves.  Maybe something that's fun to play ratehr than just think about will come out of it.  And if it doesn't, I'll vry happily eat my words.  I'd really LIKE to eat my words.\n\n","August 8, 2014","false","28.2"," 131 of 155 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","131","155","0","0"

A god that can sculpt the landscape, direct your people to build things, mine resources, breed, erect great temples and use your godly powers to sent great balls of fire and brimstone upon your enemies.\n\nSounds awesome right?

Save your cash and avoid at all costs because you will not get a refund, the ingame timers make sure that you try to play it for longer then 2 hours as you hope that the game improves after the tutorial. I will never invest or buy anything from 22cans, Peter Molineux or members of their team ever again and I higly suggest you do the same.\n\nTL;DR: R.I.P. godNOTus\n\n\nUpdate: May 19, 2014\n\nStill a fraud and only getting worse, the mobile version has been released and no official word about it as they "can't say anything". Read the forum yourself and check out all the nice mobile screenshots.

I was curious if countless Kickstarter backers being disappointed at this game meant it didn't meet their expectations, or how bad it really was. What I am writing is based on several hours of playing the "beta V2.4" version.\n\nTo recap, 22cans collected lots of Kickstarter money to make a PC version of the game, and 5 months later when it foreseeable they wouldn't get done they contracted a publisher for a mobile version and finished that first.\n\nIf you ever wanted to experience the "fat-finger" feeling you get on mobile on your PC, this game delivers: when I am clicking and dragging to move a mountain "slice", what moves is often not quite where I clicked, and I don't know why. But hey, instead of fixing this, we can prevent people from losing too much by only allowing small changes -- which means that big changes (and you'll need lots of them) have to be executed as a series of small changes. A real PC game would let me make the change and ask for confirmation or, even better, allow undo or reverse time, but we can't have that in a Skinner box, now can we (see below)? There are a few other things that don't quite work right yet (including infrequent game crashes), but the former is part of the core game mechanic, and I'd have expected it to be in the 53% that are allegedly completed.\n\nI don't play much mobile myself (though I recommend LYNE on any touch device), but the rest of Godus's mobile inheritance are characteristics this game shares with monetized "Skinner box[en.wikipedia.org]" games that I have been looking at plenty on Kongregate, The game is structured around annoying you into spending "gems", which in the PC version don't have to be bought, but that doesn't solve the big problems of this approach. To do things in-game you need belief (mana). In a f2p game, that would be your action bar that renews by waiting. Well, you also need more believers to get belief, but still, if you like you could idle this game for hours and collect belief and then be able to "pay" for sculpting the landscape and sending your minions on errands. (Yes, you "pay" for giving orders to the little computer people.) Or you can buy belief (and food, the other in-game currency) with gems. To acquire your godlike skills, you need to progress in the game so you can unlock a skill card that you can only use when you have placed "stickers" on it that you either find in treasure chests or (surprise) buy with games in the form of "booster packs" (another favorite Skinner box staple). Oh, and best hold off on opening too many treasure chests, because there are skill cards that make the treasure in them more valuable.\n\nMuch of the game is automated. "Zoning" for buildings can only be done indirectly by blocking the automatic zoning off unwanted spots with terrain. Unit pathfinding sucks over long distances: toons will tell me several times they're blocked until they finally find their way to the destination. Again, this is a core feature, which should have been working in the mobile version, except people on tablets apparently can't send units as far away as I do. But collecting "belief" is not automated, it's a useless "makework" klickfest that only makes sense as part of a "core loop" on a skinner box.\n\nOh, how you get gems: by either killing your believers (which makes them unhappy, which gives the AI opponent an advantage), by doing a "voyage" which the commentary tells me I can repeat as often as I like, but I made one voyage and now I can't any more, or by finding some in treasure chests, which are limited.\n\nGenerally, the game setting makes me uncomfortable: my job is to flatten large amounts of landscape, combine cottages into housing blocks, consider rocks and trees as detrimental (you get a skill that makes trees positive later), and homeless people beg you to kill them for gems, basically. God is a real estate developer.\n\nI do love the terrain: I love its colors, I love how the shape makes paths and building sites, I love to shape it (when it's not being annoying, see above), but the rest of the gameplay? Forget it. This is what the kickstarter promised: to be god in such a world (and kudos to the artists, they did a good job in creating a world you'd want to be god in), but the gameplay is being an accountant, and on your first playthrough you have incomplete/misleading information to boot.\n\nThe pity is that the terraforming minigame levels show that someone somewhere realized that doing these terrain things is fun. But building a multi-currency klickfest economic waiting game on top of that is just not warranted. They've taken something very fun and tweaked it so that there's barely any fun left - which on a monetized game makes people hope it'll be fun and exciting if they pay, which they do and it is, which makes it as profitable as drug dealing.\n\n"Free-to-play games aren't after everyone for a few dollars -- they're after weak people in vulnerable states for hundreds, if not thousands." (source[www.gamasutra.com]) (more[notalwaysright.com])\nWanna bet this game goes free2play with monetization within a year after its full release?\nShame on you, Mr Molyneux.\n\nOh, what do I recommend? If you want to feel like a god, buy SimCity 2000, Settlers 2 Gold, or any other world-building game that doesn't make you work for your basic game functionality, or feel you have to buy your powers at Gods-R-Us. And if you like Skinner boxes, go look in the f2p flash scene, there are lots of titles, some of which are decent enough if you can overlook the sleazy business model. Or go back to playing farmville.","April 2, 2015","false","7.1"," 78 of 81 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","78","81","5","9"

Godus was packed with a very cool idea and beautiful gameplay and graphics. I fell in love with it the moment I saw it. Since then, the devs have tried everything that they could to make the game as simple as possible. Stupid updates, an annoying micro-transaction system that makes me wanna puke, no feedback from the devs...\n\nSo let's talk about the positives: + the game is beautiful\n+ the gameplay is very relaxing\n+ the game is very easy and gives you the feeling of progression\n... That's about it right now\n\nNow the negatives: - The AI will often work against you as if they want to revolt against the player.\n- The enemy is no challenge. Their 'troops' are almost hilariously easy to defeat.\n- A lot of features appear to be there, just not right now...\n- The biggest part of the game just ends after a while, eventhough you are still expected to go on.\n- There is no clear goal in this game, but there IS a goal.\n-  There should not be any micro-transactions in an UNFINISHED game.\n- A lot of updates just seem to change nothing at all, maybe some bugs, or might even remove features.\n- The game becomes INCREDIBLY repetitive after a while.\n- Features such as sculpting are a bit awkward and don't often work as you'd like em to.\n-   THE GAME WILL NEVER GET OUT OF EARLY ACCESS!!!\n\nI just want to elaborate on that last point, because it seems to be an ongoing trend in the steam early access business. The game has been in early access for a LONG time, but never seems to change in a way that is noticable. When changes do happen, they are hardly ever improvements.\nThe description of this games states:  "GODUS is a unique game that we hope will grow to be truely special."\nI feel like this statement is very important to talk about, since godus IS a very unique and special game, especially for me. However, as time passes by, the game becomes much less special and much less interesting. It's a shame that such a unique and fun game is slowly fading away into the 'unfinished' terrain, where it will likely never see the light of day again.\n\nSo, should you buy godus? I really, REALLY wanted to say yes, but right now, godus is basically a bunch of promises that will never be fulfilled.\nThe answer:  Sadly, no, not right now\n\nMy apologies if the English is not very good, it is not my native language.\nAlso, I still really love this game, but I just think it is not worth it  right now .","November 4, 2015","false","22.3"," 75 of 80 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","75","80","0","0"

Everything else was in english, the menu, the annoying commentary and everything else up to that very moment had been in english, but when the tutorial decided, for whatever reason, to change it's displayed "quest" text to italian, I lost it.\n\nThis so-called "game" started out as something promising, but now it's nothing more than a another example of waht's wrong in the game industry.\nIt once held promise, but since then it's been gutted and abused, and is now forced onto the corner of the street, to make a few bucks from the mobile-device gamers, like some cheap ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nIt has been a while since i felt disgusted, but what happened to this game makes me sick.","February 11, 2015","false","4.0"," 63 of 66 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","63","66","2","0"

There needs to be more random acts in the game other than a stray wolf or two that might come along and eat a follower at the skirts of the civilization.  Instead, for any type of combat, you are carted off to another world to do battle.

He claims that by removing player communication from Curiousity, 22cans learned how to better create a healthy community.\nSource: Molyneux shares his strategy for indie development[www.gamasutra.com]\n\n\nPeter as much as says that he has no intention of listening to his backers and supporters and instead will simply do as he pleases.\n\nHe refers to a messy desk being a sign of his creative process - which can just aswell be seen as a metaphor to the current state of affairs in 22cans.\n\nThis particular article speaks volumes about the current state of affairs for both Godus and 22cans.","March 18, 2014","false","110.6"," 62 of 72 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","62","72","0","0"

You would think that babysitting a group of common grunts with the thinking power of bread mold, they would at least walk around the villages to give you something to look at. But instead they hide away in little huts and throw up little flags when the house is full ( And I learned that by reading a wiki page ) allowing you to bang your godly fist of might on their tiny doors and thrust them out into the world to.... walk around for a short time before collapsing. You're apparently supposed to have them build a house to live in but the instructions are so irritatingly bland that you'd probably have an easier time deciphering a f***ing cave painting.\n\nGodus was originally created to mimic an earlier game with the same concept, to play as a god and build a civilization. But as it turns out, reintroducing a concept from the 80's to the modern age and expecting the exact same reaction is like wrecking your car then dragging it home and offering it to your child as a birthday present. I can understand that the developers wish to try and breath life back into something they cherished long ago. They charge $20 for something that should be considered an indie game then they have the audacity to say that "The content in the game is only 40% of what is to come". Well developers, if I pick this game back up in 8 months, I will be expecting to see godly hands wiping entire continents of the face of the planet. But hashing out $20 for a bunch of old men's backyard project is just insulting. Not to mention the "multiplayer" being poulated by bots who try to to act like living people.

Its a fun little game but lacks depth. I did enjoy playing it for a while but like some commentators say it has a mobile game feel to it. This was in Early Access at least. I do like the blocky art style and terrain and the idea of sculpting terrain with your mouse is awesome. But this game has been in early access for way to long. It seriously needs updates and added content and even some content has been removed since i first played. So its unfair to say until its finished, whenever that will be. I don't recommend buying it until we see progress and a finished and polished game. It is a great idea, but i think this games style is made for tablets and touchscreen more than a pc experience. That includes collecting faith with hundreds of clicks can get pretty old and repetitive, again that will work better on a touch screen.\n\nControversy**\nPeter Molyneux!!! (The Carrot & Stick) They Guy who brought you games like Dungeon Keeper, Black & White, Fable(Note, that is alot to live up to) and his latest entry Godus (The Mobile Game). Beware this game is far from finished(very much still Early Access) and kinda turned into a mobile game at some point. It really is a cool idea yes, i(The Fool) bought it in the first few days it came out on early access, maybe to early, maybe i was to eager. But 22Cans did take that money and put it into a mobile game or at least it feels like it. I would admit it won the "The App Store Best of 2014" award but at the sake of his kickstater support and PC audience.\n\nOne thing Peter dear Peter at least tell us whats up, pull a rabit out of the hat and say Godus Mobile was actually a ruse to get money to build Dungeon Keeper, Black & White, Populous  NEXT LEVEL BUNDLE Ultimate Addition! Ok thats the end of the emotion part coz that is what i personally want from you. I think its a game we didnt ask for but Godus is the game we are given but then again no one asked for Dungeon Keeper, Black & White, Populous. But Godus doesn't fit in that group, for now.\n\nOK If you really care about this game, talking to the community, listen to 22cans youtube videos. They are trying to bring us a decent game, and its a good bunch of people working on it. I really believe 22cans you should add these videos or links to steam game profile to help people understand the situation. What it turns out to be will depend on our feedback to 22cans and their willingness to listen.\n\nI honsestly would have trusted them to build a game by them selves with their history. Communities dont always know what they want and get emotional and that doesnt help the building process with that types of feedback. I still believe in them, and even after all i said before i dont believe they sold out. This is not the forums so i wont put my game changes here but i believe in you 22 cans to blow my mind still. Come on, look what games have you worked on before, we want more of that, plain and simple really, sort of. If you are doing your own thing, thats fine to, just keep us updated in a timely fashion and listen to the communities and i think it will be a gg.

I loved Populous, and I've been vaguely following this for a while. On seeing it available for a mere £3.50 elsewhere, I thought, "This is gonna be a steal."\n\nHow wrong I was. And let me make this clear, a full asking price of £15 is an absolute, utter, complete rip-off.\n\nWhat you are buying is a mobile game. This is not a PC game. Yes, they've TRIED to adapt it to the PC... The gems, which you would clearly pay money for on your mobile device, have alternative ways of being attained, through sacrificing followers, or doing voyages (puzzle missions). But you still have to sit around for hours on end for them to build things, checking frequently to collect items by tapping... Uh, CLICKING on them, forming the core function for why anything gets done.\n\nI guess the premise of the game is cool, and definitely brought me to playing it. You drag land to make it suitable to be built on. Your people can only navigate certain terrain and rely on you to make a clear path.\n\nBut it reeks of mobile game syndrome. Almost every single action costs "belief" (energy), which recharges over real life time. This is only made worse by the fact that although you have an uncapped amount of belief, you still have to collect it from each individual household your people build, which DO have maximum caps, varying on the type of house. That means your early game houses, making maybe 70 belief per hour, max out at 40. You can see the problem here, if you want to make progress whilst doing other things.\n\nAnd otherwise, I don't yet see any real reason to play. All you do is sculpt land to expand and repeat. There doesn't seem to be any real goal. The voyages (missions) are straightforward and irritating, especially when the final idiot villager you needed to reach the checkpoint decides to go back to the start because you were half a second too slow molding the land, meaning you have to wait (a significant amount of time in real life) for those villagers to respawn so you can complete the mission.\n\nI will probably keep playing, for a little while. But honestly, even paying £3.50, this was a rip-off. You might as well just go play Tiny Tower. Or, if you want a really fun PC adapted mobile game, try New Star Soccer! This game has so much work to be done if it's to become a PC game.\n\nEDIT: I've played this more to give it a better shot, and my only additional comment is, the path finding is so ♥♥♥♥ing awful, it makes the voyages (missions) impossible sometimes.","September 17, 2014","false","11.8"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","56","67","0","5"

How does this effect Godus? Well.\n\nBelief - This is where things get off to a rough start, waiting for resources is one thing, we all didnt mind watching our gold being mined and slowly piled in our treasure rooms for Dungeon Keeper, or resources being worked in Black and White 2 but where Godus fails is that it takes SOOOOOOOOOO long to generate enough to actually do something and there is no player feedback as to why you get this resource, we cant see them praying, just a bubble to click when a timer finishes when they feel like acknowledging you, that doesnt make me feel like a god, it makes me feel like im looking at belief cooking in a microwave, im looking at a number on a machine to tell me when i can consume my resource, rather than the excitement of cooking it myself and seeing things change organically infront of my eyes. If you are going to have belief. make it something that gives you visual feedback, let us see our followers in awe of us, give us worshipping tents, campfires or churches that followers can go into and express that to us, MOST IMPORTANTLY have those generate belief without us having to click bubbles, whats wrong with it filling by itself over time without me having to witness and acknowledge each person, if i had to play theme park and literally click all my stores and rides to get money from them i'd stop playing in an instant. I'm a god right? i am omnipresent, im not a small child popping bubbles, i want to feel godlike and not like a god damn factory worker, i aint getting paid, i paid to play this! Let me have more fun and engaging activities and less work! Let me be creative as the creator!\n\nId also like to note how the devloper commentary keeps running along the lines of 'This doesnt seem helpful yet but wait a few hours and you'll see', Peter if i have to wait more than a minute for something to require my direct attention in a game or hell be able to do anything what so ever of my choosing the immersion breaks down, i stop questioning my ingame actions and pull back to question what im doing with my life, if the answer to that is 'waiting a few hours before i can play and progress' you are doing something wrong as a game designer...Pacing, look it up!\n\nSculpting - I know many people would rather have a large paintbrush style scheme to quickly shape the area how they deem fit, but i like the more methodical pace this game has, each little touch feels like a delicate hand of god, each click feels like it has a purpose, it fits themematically with your power as a god slowly getting more powerful and powers later do increase how much you can sculp. It ties with belief fueling the power you have, but then thats the shot to the foot, it would be so much fun to sculp all these layers and make something unique to you, yet because it is funded by belief, you dare not use limited belief to sculp unless it fits in with later game strategie, so you end up with a pretty bland group of flat lands full of abodes, rather than a complex village with different elevations, houses on hills etc. I loved how city building was in Black & White 2, minus the wierd happiness bugs ofcourse, it was the feeling of drawing your roads, plotting out your town, shaping your civilization. Even if you do decide to break form and build on some hills the sculpting layers make it hard to make steps for your villages to climb up, if you dont want to add slants to the layers to make it easier for your follwers to climb then perhaps a power that when selected sculps in a staircase type fasion for hills and such, making it less finicky. Have it so i can sculp without using a resource, make it so i unlock the ability to sculp certain planes but then do so freely once unlocked, i like the feeling of sculpting the world, i just dont like moving a foot of land and wasting what little belief i had.\n\nBuilding - I kind of like how my villages decide where buildings are plotted, i nudge them in the right direction by plotting out a space of land and they decide where to build on it, it makes me feel like ive blessed them with free will, it feels godlike in a way which is the whole point. I dont mind clicking on buildings to send out my builders, even though there is no thematic feedback, such as seeing my builder seem inspired through divine intervention like Noah and the Ark. It starts of alright, not taking much time, seeing your population expand is satisfying.....BUT THEN, the timers get larger, larger and larger, waiting and not playing begins as you wonder what you are doing with your life, oh you could send more builders to help but wait, your belief has run dry so you just wait. If that wasnt bad enough, once you build a farm, NOW all of a sudden your builders refuse to work unless you give them some food...what were they eating before, SAND!?\n\nTime to wrap up, i could go into the voyagages but its bugged and i cant do anymore, they are basically simple puzzle levels that grant stickers to unlock abilities. The sticker system itself being something i again despise, it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off in Mass Effect 3 multiplayer and pisses me off here, it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off when i was a kid filling my sticker books and is just a clever marketing tool to get kids lunch money, im a grown adult Peter, start treating me like one. I basically feel as it stands now ive brought a game on false promises, im fueling the development of a free to play designed mobile made game. Mobile games and their practises in my eyes destroy good game design and just prey on idle hands with engagement levels of popping bubblewrap. If you want this to be a great PC game then start actually designing it as such, seperate it from the mobile money grab, even the sims PC games havent stooped this low yet, infact i'll use that as an analogy for this game.\n\nGodus, its like the sims, if you had to wait for them to pick there noses minutes at a time before moving on to their next alloted task, watch them sleep without time speeding up, plot their houses one wall at a time while you actually wait for the builders to come round and place it together brick by brick AND ONLY IF you give them garden grown and homebaked wholegrain bread :|","October 28, 2014","false","13.0"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","39","41","0","0"

I have absolutly nothing good to say about this game, it does not work.","November 30, 2015","false","31.5"," 54 of 65 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","54","65","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeenz/recommended/232810/","zeenz","zeenz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeenz/","285 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHere is my take on Godus after about 40 hours of game play into the game. Godus is the new god sim from the camp of Peter Molyneux, responsible for the incredible Black & White god game, and the not so incredible Black & White 2 - not to mention popular series Fable and Populous. I put dozens and dozens of hours into the first Black & White game and I still regard it as the best god sim I've ever played, the second was largely a disappointment.\n\nThe Good:\n\nFirst of all, the overall aesthetic of the game is simultaneously simple and striking. I love the way each coloured layer of water, sand, grass and rock comes together to form landscapes, the game just looks amazing.\n\nAs a newly minted God you will be responsible for the health and well being of your people. That will generally include shelter, food and some forms of entertainment manifesting themselves in the form of belief. You can in turn use this belief to sculpt more difficult landscapes (anything not sand), use abilities or spells and control your followers to assist you. This mechanic works fairly well most of the time though you may find yourself spent out on belief often as you venture deeper into the game - past 10 hours or so.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nCards. General abilities will be awarded as you open up major milestones in game play - such as reaching a certain population threshold. They will often allow for huge changes in village building, god skills or overall gameplay. The problem with this is two-fold. The first problem is the ability is not usable when it's 'unlocked', you need to further unlock it by using cards which you can only find in treasure chests or from spending 'gems' (more on gems later). The card unlock method is instantly tired and feels unnecessary. As for the second problem, sometimes the mechanic you unlock makes a jarring change to the game flow. Biggest example of such changes is unlocking the ability to create farms. Farms will produce wheat, ok not a problem there. Problem is up until this point in the game you've been able to create buildings and expand your empire without any resource constraint and then as soon as wheat is available all of a sudden the flow of your expansion is completely paralysed as you will likely be very short on wheat. Eventually your empire will build up enough farms but like so many other issues in the game it feels very unnecessary to use it in this fashion.\n\nEarly on you will unlock the dock, which opens up a side mission which appears to be designed for gods who are waiting on their village to build out and have nothing else to do. By clicking on the dock a side game will open up where you can 'sail' to islands. At each island will be a sort of a Godus style puzzle where when you click begin you will have to guide your followers to the objective as quickly as possible. Get them there fast and you get a higher score, get a higher score and you get better cards. The side missions are a bit bland and boring and you're constrained again by the mobile mechanic of limited resources. I went once, did a couple of islands and quit never to return again. All this area of gameplay is is a time dump. Yawn.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nThere is no disguising it, this game was developed first and foremost as a mobile game. Everything points to it, from the strained resource mechanic requiring time for recharges, to the slightly sloppy controls on PC - which would surely work better on mobile. The most obvious thing is the gem mechanic which is really what I have the most trouble with. It was clearly designed as a pay mechanic to speed up gameplay on the mobile side, but it doesn't translate well into the PC version at all. You don't have to pay for the gems in the PC versions for obvious reasons - you have to pay for the main game. I feel like perhaps the better approach would have been to release this as a free to play game and just keep the gem pay scheme so it doesn't feel as awkward as it does. If you listen to the game developer commentary as you play the game and unlock mechanics, you will hear them harp on about how cool the gem mechanic is and how important it is but honestly most of the time it just felt awkward and out of place in the world. I was often sacrificing nearly all of my  villagers to get gems (the only way currently to do so to my knowledge) just so I could keep playing. Where in Black & White I was looking out for and taking care of my villagers - I find myself just simply murdering all of my people in Godus just so I can keep playing. It's bad, real bad.\n\nUnfortunately about 40 hours in I found myself tired of the issues explored above and also the bugs, which are fine as the game is still currently in beta - these are expected to happen. If you can get the game at a large discount and you're a big fan of god sim genre games then by all means you should pick it up and throw some hours into it. Perhaps it will be improved at that point. For right now, I have to say I would not make the purchase again knowing what I know now.\n\n5/10","December 18, 2014","false","41.7"," 47 of 54 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","47","54","0","3"

Turns out they were too good to be true, oddly enough in true Peter Molyneux fashion.\n\nWe were promised a proper PC god game, and instead what we got was a Freemium mobile game which charged people to test it on PC. Though there are no microtransactions in the "PC version" of the game, the game is a copy/paste job of the Freemium mobile version. This game is designed to prevent you from progressing so as to force mobile players to pay money to progress, and that design philosophy simply doesn't work on PC where people have bought the game outright.\n\nDon't buy into their promises of now being able to fix the PC version with the mobile version out, because they've already said that fundamental changes to the game's systems are no longer possible with the mobile version out; since both games are meant to have interconnected play with each other. This game will not be getting any better than it currently is.\n\nI bought into the hype hook, line, and sinker when this first hit early access, and it taught me the valuable lesson to never buy an early access game again.

Sure, you can technically play those games without spending any money, but you very quickly reach the point where the necessary resources to proceed are few and far between, a sort of soft wall between the freely available content, and the rest of the game.\nAnd that is /exactly/ what it feels like around the point where you become able to unlock the Farming settlements.

Cards are now Stickers, obtained in the same way as before, working the same way as before.\n2. Belief takes horribly long to generate and you can't sculpt land without it.\n3.

Basically all you do is drag around the landscape to make flat land so you're little followers can build cube houses automatically. The novelty of that wears off in about 20 minutes and there's NOTHING to do while they build except get stickers. You just sit there with your thumb up your ♥♥♥ watching a timer count down 3 minutes to build 1 house. What fun.

Even the trailers voice acting is bad. also if you can see the houses you have to build plots, and at a certain point you start running out of sculpting power and you have to wait in order to make more trees or rocks. This game was truly a waste of my money and my hope is that you do not waste your money on this early access game and instead go and buy, I don't know, any other early access game that is actually making  progress. This game is meant to be a mobile game and it isn't even worth the price it would be if it was a mobile game. I wouldn't pay a dollar to get this game and I wouldn't get it for free because there would be a paywall. The paywall comes in ... I don't know 2-3 hours in the game and even then you were waiting for faith. The game starts you off with enough trees and rocks  but it is an illusion to make you think that the game will be that easy from there on out. This game could have been so much better by removing the ENTIRE FAITH MECHANIC. The faith mechanic makes you have to wait and wait and wait until you have enough to make small increments of an amount of sculpting the smallest little path so that you can hurry up and get your followers through. The only good part to faith is that it is a reason to build homes. So let me tell you how I would have made this game if not my own game:\nTHIS IS HOW I WOULD CREATE GODUS THIS IS NOT WHAT GODUS IS LIKE 1. In the beginning you start off on a randomly generated but fair landscape.\n2. You can sculpt the landscape however you want without being limited to breaking down trees and rocks (which makes no sense that you would want to destroy trees and rocks as a "GOD" because, lets be honest, if you were truly to play as a god you wouldn't need to break trees or rocks or wait for a long time to be able to sculpt.)\n3. When villager is created (by you) you can choose what actions you want it to do.\n4. When he builds a house (in the location you want him to not where the game wants you to) he will live in it.\n5. Create other villager and have them make babies in the house (or not).\n6. Create as many villagers as you would like but only some of them with housing will be happy, the others will not be.\n7. Villager becomes mayor and you can now move on to the farming era.\n8. After enough houses are made and enough population is there you can move on to the next era, to the next era, etc.\n9. Whatever you do in between these steps is your choice but these are just the essentials or how to progress from eras.\n10. I would update this game seeing if the reviews were bad or if I see any bugs reported.\n11. Wouldn't lie (and didn't lie) about any of the steps or hide secret things in between the steps that you absolutely HAVE to do.","May 16, 2015","false","7.5"," 48 of 59 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","48","59","0","0"

It's not that he lied and hoodwinked us. We and he participated in a shared delusion.\n\nGodus is bereft of gameplay. It's bereft of everything, really. There's no strategy, no morality for your followers, no sense of power for the player. There's no technological development either. Instead of these things, we have a cheap-♥♥♥ grindgame for tablets in which you monotonically plonk down hut after hut, for no reason or reward. In the course of that, you have to sculpt the land, but that mechanic is as buggy and unsatisfying as the endless hut sprawl which it precedes.\n\nOn the other hand - and it's a very small hand compared to the massive fist of "♥♥♥♥ gameplay" that punches you in the nuts -, the challenges are a bit fun. You take 20-30 of your followers into a pre-made archipelago and have to guide them from A to B on each island, sculpting the terrain to flatten hills, navigate mazes, and avoid giants.

It used to be that when you weren't in the game your houses still built and accumulated belief... now it all stops when you close the game.  Previously when you logged in you had all your houses full of belief for you to harvest and give you a nice boost to play with... not any more... if you are low on belief when you close the game you'll still be low on belief when you start it again.  as a result, the tedium is now much worse.  this could be fixed a bit if sculpting the land weren't so expensive and take hundreds of thousands of belief from you in minutes easily.\n\nAlso, as a "god", you are the most pitiful supreme being ever imagined!  you make spaces for them to build buildings and farms, and eventually mines... then they can't even harvest those things themselves... you have to do that for them.  maybe this was an attempt to keep the player engaged but really, it just makes you the supreme farmhand.  your powers are pretty much useless most of the time, especially since you won't have a lot of belief to spare to actually use them regularly until you are about ready to go to the second world.  new voyages have been "coming soon" for many months now... someone needs to clue them in on what soon means.  the NPC rival tribe is a nuisance more than a threat and just forces you to waste more belief to kill them by using your finger of death or repositioning some archers... both of which cost the same amount of belief.  reaching milestones give you cards that you have to collect stickers to unlock... I unlocked the card with the milestone... why do i have to unlock it again with stickers?  early cards take a few stickers but later ones take far more... and of course the stickers are hard to get without spending gems.  gems are essentially free... you just have to be evil and sacrifice your people to get them easily, otherwise you'll never get enough.  and yes, gems are a setup for microtransactions... but because peter doesn't want a lynchmob on his door the PC version doesn't actually have the microtransactions... i.e. it's all built in to easily be added but there is currently no way to actually pay real money for gems.  that is a good thing in my opinion but we didn't give our moiney to his kickstarter to fund his microtransaction game for mobile phones which is essentially what he's done.  All in all the most fun I have had in the game is ammassing millions of belief until I have enough to rain meteors on my people non stop when I am completely bored of it...","June 10, 2015","false","482.4"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","1"

I believe these 3 articles might be interesting for anyone still convinced Godus is worth any money at all:\n\nhttp://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/02/13/peter-molyneux-interview-godus-reputation-kickstarter/\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/13/peter-molyneux-game-designer-interview-godus\n\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/godus-designer-admits-kickstarter-promises-likely-cant-be-kept/\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI bought Godus around a year ago. Its simple and colourful graphics, the User Interface and the many various features intrigued me. However, as many users said, the game has been on early access for ages and there was more re-designing than actual improvement of the game.\n\nMany features were removed, some were later re-added, glitches regarding savegames occured and forced the user to restart from 0 - when it wasn't an update to mess up with it in the first place. Overall, what disappointed me the most is that 22cans has been playing with its fans for a while, giving an awful support which made me almost hate the game, and abandon it even before I received the (is there a pejorative of late?) reply. And as if that happened once, months after giving up with Godus I decided to get back to it, only to see that unrealistic features that I didn't even want (like the mixed and multiethnic people of a presumably paleolithic society??) were added. I begged for support and gave availability in case it was required to mod the game on my own to restore the caucasic-only population. I even explained my reasons, saying that it was good to add up races but that a player should get to pick which ones he wants and doesn't want - regardless the colour. The response I received (about 2 months later) was a copy&paste, and guess what? The writing was so bogus and automatic that it rang a bell in my head, I went checking the older email from my first ticket and they were identical!\n\nApart from the lacking, dumb, and almost self-generated "support", the game itself is poor as I mentioned above. You can enjoy it maybe for about 20 hours in case you have little experience with God videogames (as the undersigned), then it gets repetitive and pointless. I suggest anyone wishing to play a game of this sort to rely on the comments of god-games enthusiasts/aficionados in order to find a way better (and likely older) one.\n\nTo sum up: It seemed promising, but knowing that this game has been on early access for 16 months with little improvement, buying it at the moment would be a waste of money. DON'T LET THE VIVID COLOURS AND CARTOON-LIKE GRAPHICS TRICK YOU INTO PURCHASING. 22cans has probably hired good graphic artists in order to show off a slideshow of artworks that don't represent their game at all. Get the Maxim game SPORE instead if you really want to experience how it feels to be a God.\n\nRandom features that should have been implemented (in my opinion):\n\n-Aspects allowing the player to personalise and customise his or her followers and their society (morphology or and climate of the starting area, building architecture, followers' clothing and so on)\n-A real objective in the game, whether you like a military, economical or diplomatic society (what is the point of building up a civilisation if there's no bloody warfare? Mind that archers were put in the game only lately and have little value in this sense anyway)\n-Diversification of the planet fauna and flora (they should have implemented animals and plants other than pine-like trees instead of different skin colours for your followers) You can check, for instance, any info regarding wildlife on the game's wiki. All of the issues I detailed above and below can be found here on the respective topics' pages. http://godus.wikia.com/wiki/Wildlife\n-A complex resource system which still doesn't exist at present, There is no hunting, there is no gathering, there is no fishing whatsoever. There aren't different types of metal or rock that you can collect. You may think I'm point out a stupid thing nobody cares about, but if managing multiple resources is just plain boring, why the hell do all the strategic games that I've played so far usually distinguish 4 types of resource the least? (Gems don't really count as a resource, it's a premium-like feat. you find in freemium cheap-♥♥♥ games)\n-I could continue, but the time I spent writing this objective review should cost 22cans the money I spent on their masterpiece, for anyone reading my thoughts on it will refrain from buying, hence reducing the negative popularity of this game and eventually saving the last slice of credibility the developers have left.","January 22, 2015","false","43.5"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","35","41","0","0"

I was very excited when I saw a gameplay video on gamespot with Molyneux playing the game on ipad; looked great and fun.\n\nThis beta is very poor at the moment - it lacks any gameplay element apart from land flattening by clicking; its like a scaled back version of populous with lots of mouse clicking and prettier graphics.\n\nAs you expand your village and field of influence you soon realise that 1. you have to create a flat featureless landscape for villagers to build houses on and 2. the villages are empty of life unless you click the houses for the villagers to come out which they do to build more houses then they wander back in to their houses or sit around for a bit and die. Oh and theres no way to make them go in a house so you just wait for them to die. Though there's no discernable effect for you if they do die.\n\nWeirdly for a god sim, in order to advance you collect cards from chests which act as your resources, when you get enough cards required your civilisation advances. Its a mechanic which removes your villagers from interacting with the land and environment - empty flatness is the result.\n\nEver played a dying MMO with formerly bustling areas empty of activity? Godus quickly feels devoid of life and depressing to play.\n\nMy fault for not waiting for reviews, but I trusted what the trailers seemed to offer; leave alone and play something with a soul and a less painful UI mechanic. I wish I could get a refund as I feel tricked into paying £15 - I'd gladly put this £15 as an extra thank you to the makers of a good indie game Starbound/Faster Than Light/Fez come to mind.\n\nDid I say empty and flat enough?

The issue now seems to be one of...waiting.\n\nI have never seen a game that requires quite this much waiting. You will not notice it so much in the first 10 to 20 minutes of play, but as the hours go on, you will find yourself collecting your belief, sacrificing your followers for gems, sending out builders to contruct new buildings, sculpting a tiny piece of your land, then realizing you have 45-60 minutes (!!!) to wait until you can do anything else, because you need to wait for more followers to spawn, more belief to generate, and for those buildings to finish contruction. Once, the game told me I would have to wait over A DAY for another farmer to spawn.\n\nIn the developer commentary, they say that you should use this time to go "treasure hunting" or on voyages, but there is only one available (very short) voyage right now, and treasure hunting for stickers takes all of 5 minutes...if you have enough Belief to move the land around looking, and if you don't, you have to come back in a couple hours so it can generate.\n\nCompound that with the fact that ore takes five real-time hours to mine, wheat takes one real-time hour to farm, and some buildings take upwards of 20 minutes to contruct, and that is AFTER the speed-build card has been unlocked. I wonder if by the time we reach the space age, the shuttle will take 10 real-time years to build! When it comes to belief, the larger buildings only generate it once every several hours. The smaller buildings make it faster, but they make so little that you end up waiting just as long for it to generate several times so you have enough to actually sculpt something. I often found myself doing everything I could, minimizing the game, then doing something else for an hour or two, just to re-open the game, do my "chores", and minimize it again.\n\nIf the ridiculous wait times were removed, I think Godus would be a lot more fun, but it would still be a very shallow game. It feels skinner box-ish, and there is a real lack of any need for strategic thought. It doesn't really matter where or how you build your settlements, where those wheat fields or mines go, or just how often you sacrifice followers, just as long as you have enough belief to place a swamp in the Astari camp so they all drown when they try to party.\n\nGodus as it stands now is little more than a web-browser game that was obviously designed with a pay-to-not-wait mechanic in mind, not unlike Farmville.

With this new update, the tutorial has been bugged, asking me to "fill in the circle of land" even though the screen showed nothing but blue water. Unfortunately, I couldn't continue the tutorial since I couldn't even see what was going on. I will wait come back to this later to revise my review.\n\nUpdate #1 Review:\n\nWhen I purchased this, I thought it would be something remeniscent of SimCity or a game like that where you have control over a majority of actions.\n\nThat was far from the truth. The only things you do in this game are clicking on trees, rocks, and flags. If you want, you can click on the landscape to change it(albeit very limited in what you can change requiring you to dig from the outside to the inside which is problematic when you find a card chest hidden in the middle of a continent about 5 layers into the ground at some point) but in the wider scope of things, it isn't required. It's still optimized as a mobile game, making everything as simple as possible so that people can play without effort.\n\nIf you have money and time to spare for this game, go right on ahead. Otherwise, I'd recommend waiting until more options are put into the game if ever. Really, all you do is make sure there's land available and it automatically builds for you. I regret my purchase which I could've used for another game.\n\n\n\nEDIT: This is a review for the current Early Access game.

Continuing to sell Godus in Early Access, Valve hurts the Steam brand.\n\n<edited to reflect The Roadmap>\nGodus is a free-to-play mobile game that may -- emphasis on the uncertainty -- someday become a casual PC game that is optimized for tablets.\n\nAs of this review (June 2014), 22Cans has ignored customer and backer feedback for 1.5 years, or nearly nine months longer than they originally expected development to take. I am sure that ~some~ members of the community are happy with Godus. But the majority of feedback on Steam's forums, the vast majority of the reviews on this site, and everything I have heard about the "backer forums" strongly indicates that people thing Godus is going in a bad direction, and in a direction antithetical to the original intent the regenesis of the godgame.\n\nPM has said that the primary goal of a game designer is to make money. One would have thought that the primary goal of a game designer who was crowdfunded would be to deliver the game that people thought they were funding (or to fail in the attempt.)\n\nOver time, the game has incorporated more free to play (f2p) elements, such as gems, and stickers, and wait timers, things that break a person's progression with the game and fundamentally destroy any chance of immersion. After each update, the community gave constructive feedback, suggested different mechanics that would improve our experience, and attempted to engage 22Cans in the promised "participation in game design." 22Cans would go silent for weeks or months at a time, and then make changes like "click and swipe" instead of "clicking" (when the fundamental concern was that this farmville-type mechanic was fundamentally broken and that a Player Deity should not have to concern itself with swiping and that it made no sense in-game.)\n\n22Cans has likely made these decisions at the behest of it's mobile publisher DeNA. A publisher, mind you, that they promised not to take on when they pitched their kickstarter.\n\nWith the release of the Roadmap, 22Cans has confirmed that a) they will continue deceiving customers (they are using a SDK that builds software for multiple platforms concurrently, and there is no difference between the mobile game and the PC game beyond the length of timers and the presence of a gem shop to speed up said timers) b) they have no interest in delivering a game that is not casual in nature, and c) 22Cans will continue to ignore the feedback of the community that backed their vision and funded their company.\n\nFor the past several months, I have enjoyed interacting with other members of the Godus forums as we tried desperately to get 22Cans to deliver the game that they had promised. The Roadmap proves that our attempts were in vain. Don't give Peter more money to make a free to play game.\n</edit>\n\n<edited to reflect 2.01 & GDC comments>\n\nGodus is a F2P mobile "zen-like" game. Think "Sim-Bulldozer" with a lovely ambient soundtrack and you will get a good sense of what to expect. Using a mouse or touchpad to interact with the game may lead to a repetitive stress injury and should be avoided at all costs.\n\nThe good: the artwork & the audio (both highly subjective)\nThe bad: gameplay mechanics (hour long timers to complete actions, collection of "stickers" that break immersion, etc.); strategy (gameplay is functionally on rails, i.e. there is one "correct" way to play the game); feedback from devs (new community manager is doing a good job, but in his GDC talk, P.M. strongly suggested that indie developers should ignore community EVEN WHEN they have explicitly promised community feedback will guide game development)\n</edit>\n\nGodus is not yet what I'd expect for a PC god game. As of 1.4, it plays like a clicking-oriented mobile game where one shapes the land and creates space for automated followers to build structures. The structures are uniform across the first two ages (all that has been released): housing in age one, farms in age 2.\n\nThe real tragedy of the game is that it was advertised as the successor to Black & White and Populous. These earlier games forced the player to choose between competing goals which would differentiate the play moving forward. B&W did a particularly good job incorporating moral alignment into all aspects of the game. Godus, on the other hand, simply requires the player to click - a lot - and create flat land for development.\n\nOn a positive note, the landscape (pre-farm) is pretty and I find the sound appealing.\n\nI will revisit this review once an update causes me to change my opinion.","November 25, 2013","false","17.3"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","34","45","0","0"

It was on that track record that I gave Godus an extra bit of patience.\n\nThe carrot on the stick that kept me coming back were the updates about how this new team that was left to work on this game after Peter moved on to other things. But those quickly turned into vague, nothing posts about nothing that did nothing to convince me that things were on the path to the better.\n\nIn the end, I would love to one day rewrite this review into a postive one about how a game that everyone assumed had died and was forgotten got a fabled miraculous combat patch update and this sceen saver simulator finally becomes something more then a title in my library I hope to one day trade to some innocent gamer who knows nothing about it.

It's developer, Peter Molyneux, has misrepresented Godus. He lied about this "game" and it's content. Godus is nothing more than an app, that costs $20 on Steam. An app that is available on mobile for free. This app was developed with the money Peter Molyneux collected from kickstarters and Steam Early Access sales, all the while making false promises about what he would deliver.\n\nFor Steam, I urge you to give refunds to any person who has bought into this scam called Godus. As none of the information on the store page says this so called game is availavle for free on mobile.\n\nAlso, the advertising on the store page is false. Labeling Godus a God themed game is akin to labeling Farmville a Farming Simulator 2013. Just look at the player reviews posted on Steam, over 99% are negative. People had gone so far as to give this game a "thumbs up" and post a sarcastic review to highlight how ludicrous this app is and their dismay of realizing they were lied to.\n\nI don't blame Steam for this. However, please remember how you treated the community, your customers, when WarZ and Legends of Pegasus turned out to be disastrous games. Neither delivered gameplay as advertised. Steam has pulled those games from it's store and gave out refunds to their customers. I ask Steam to do the same with Godus. Godus does not belong on Steam store as it's a free to download mobile app, sold on Steam for $20. That is a disgrace.\n\n\nThis is a Farmville type game, on PC. The development of this game is funded by PC version sales, mobile version has been released as a free to play game. It's a scam.\n\nThis game is a sham. Google "Peter Molyneux lies" (developer) and read about all the times he had scammed the gaming community in the past.\n\n\nAdded 02-16-14\n\nAlso, the developers and forum admins plain out lied to the community. There used to be a "There is no shop" stickied thread on Godus forum. The thread quoted a promise by Peter Molyneux (owner, developer), not to have an in game shop. Forum moderator banned anyone who said otherwise or those who told of Peter Molyneux's history of lying to the public. They also banned anyone that pointed out all the game mechanics, indicating there would be a shop.\n\nNow that thread "There is no shop" has been deleted, and the shop for in game purchases has been announced by Peter Molyneux. Once again, going back on his word. He lied to the public, those who bought this "game" and the kickstarters.\n\nSo don't believe a word of advertisement on the store page.

So this review may not reflect the finished product but reflects Ver 1.3.1\n\nThe game in it's current state is a click fest of a tablet game that has no depth or fun and not worthy of investment until a product is put forward that reflects the game as originally promised on kickstarter. The graphics are pleasant and has a familiar feel of previous titles from Peter Molyneux, but falls short on imagination and innovation with a population of hermits with no free will or character. If you accidentally click on one of the houses and a follower escapes captivity as I like to call it, they will eventually die if there is no shrine or building to work on, they will not re-house themselves and nor can you do that for them. A couple of hours in to this game, you come to care very little about their peril and and when you hear the famous Wilheim scream from the movies, you just shrug and carry on with your dragging and clicking.\n\nI feel this game has taken a lot from the Curiosity experiment which was a tablet and smartphone app to see how people work together tapping away at a cube for an end result. I can't imagine anything more unfulfilling than clicking away at a screen with no strategy involved or end in sight for that matter. It just keeps going and going.\n\nFor those of use who have already bought in to the beta (and still care) we do hope to have an update which turns this around and gives us the God like feeling we have been hoping for and to have miracles that aren't just land sculpting and clicking houses. For those interested in the game, wait for the finished product or just read up on peoples feedback to each update on the forums.\n\nAt this stage, I really can't recommend this game even if someone has the spare cash and curiosity.","December 28, 2013","false","30.9"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"

Hard-hitting journalists that they are, RPS decided to open the interview by implying that Pete was a "pathological liar". I don't usually read RPS, but a link to that article popped up in my twitter feed that particular morning and being that I was stuck in the middle of a protracted bowel movement, I suffered through it. In retrospect, the article wasn't particularly fair - focusing on Pete's failures and much-maligned promises, while ignoring everything else - but at the time I was very much on board with the sentiment. Having purchased Godus shortly after it's Steam release, I was shocked at the lack of content in the game. I had played a couple of hours and kept waiting for the game to be fun, but that fun never materialized. I got bored with the game very quickly, and never thought about it again until that morning last week where I was stuck on the toilet, reading an article about Peter Molyneux and wondering in the back of my mind if I should see a gastroenterologist. Godus is barely a game. Peter Molyneux, for all his successes, may very well have left his best days behind him as a studio lead. Don't buy this. Don't buy anything Pete has touched.\n\nFYI: A "normal" amount of blood to pass with your stools is NONE, so please call a doctor if you're pooping blood.

Henderson was told he would be named "God of Gods" within 22 Cans' strategy game Godus' multiplayer world. This grand title would come with a royalty check from the game's revenues, starting from the beginning of his reign.\n\nIn the months since then, Henderson has received nothing. Godus' multiplayer component has not even been implemented. The game, which raised $750,000 on Kickstarter, has failed to meet the targets its backers were promised.\n\n22 Cans' forums and Kickstarter page shows hundreds of messages from fans demanding refunds.

This isn't worth microtransactions, Peter thinks his game has more value than what reality dictates)....\n\nFor how long Godus has been developed, it seems VERY unfinished.... There is a LOT missing in order to call it a game... I think Peter bit off more than he is capable of swallowing... No rival AI worth a damn.... It's one sided... It gets old and boring fast without an adequate threat.... Populous was awesome and well designed... This could be like that game, but it's just not at the moment... Random raiding parties to fend off with a couple feeble god powers (more annoying than anything)... The archers (the only other defense) are worthless... There is no enemy rival God trying to raise, protect, and defend his own tribe(s)... The limited sculpting drag length gets annoying and tedious fast... I honestly hate having to manipulate land at all... It would be nice if buildings didn't need totally flat land to build on... Hillside building would be cool...\n\nBuild Build Build for no other reason but to get bigger and Build some more... I'm not ready to absolutely hate it, but if it doesn't go more in the populous direction with rival enemy AI, then this is just going to be garbage\n\nThere is beggining structure for a potentially awesome God Game here, but from what I've read, this company seems barely holding its head above water... i wouldn't evpect this thing resulting in anything great in the end\n\nJUST MAKE A REALLY GREAT POPULOUS!!!!... Make an exact game as the original Populous with modern graphics and a little more added, like multi player, AND IT WOULD ROCK!!!.... Stop trying to get fancy and doing it as horribly as possible!!!!

If, on the off chance, that this game is somehow completed within the next 6 months, it will not be the game that I had spent my $20 on. To top it all off, what do we as the gaming community receive from the devs? "Oops, sorry, we sure ♥♥♥♥ed that up, didn't we? We'll make sure we don't make the same mistakes in our next kickstarter project! Speaking of, please invest in our next kickstarter project. Did we mention we've got a new project on kickstarter?"\n\nDon't spend your money on this. The game is moderately enjoyable for 10-15 minutes at a time, but the lack of compelling gameplay mechanics, story elements, or anything at all to do with being a religious deity seriously limits the desire to continue playing this game.

What I got was nothing close to that. What I got was a game with no menu and no way to quit where I started on a sand island with a hut on it. Then I got a tutorial that said "You gotz to keeps ur peeps growing and use cardz to move land!"\n\nThe "sculpting a world" aspect of the game seemed like it was completely removed. I had to pop these stupid pink bubbles and get these points to use my powers. The bubbles gave me about 0.01 points each, and I could use about 5 seconds of my powers even when I stocked up on the bubbles for 3 days.\n\nThere was no exploration aspect of the game. You would always run out of trees and rocks to get extra points. You got about 2 yards of extra space every time you used all of your resources to expand more. The continuous crashes. The not at all needed mesas, which you had to use all your powers to climb over, and there was nothing at the top except for a new area and then ANOTHER F*CKING MESA.\n\nDo not waste your money on this game.

You click around, and wait for the time to pass. Nothing grows, nothing progresses. Your sims do nothing, and achive nothing. You achive nothing and do nothing but clicking around. After a while you get a spell that enables you to set fire to trees. Guess what you do next?

You're a god, you get to shape and morph the land around you and help an entire population grow and prosper.  However, as it currently stands, there are so many improvements needed, that one might quit playing after an hour of repetitive clicking and expanding, clicking and expanding, clicking, and, you guesed it, trying to expand.\n\nThe card resource system is flawed.  Once you can't find cards, you're out of luck for trying to upgrade any of your next improvements.  The game is currently only 40% unlocked, so I hope this issue is resolved with expansion and more multiplayer battles for cards. Either, or as someone else mentioned, a system in which resources can be mined or harvested.\n\nMy finger goes numb from all the clicking.  Every house your citizens build accumulates more influence, the main source of your power in the game.  After a while, if you want to collect influence, you have to go back and individually click every house that has available influence to give to you.  I really wish there was some sort of "collect all" option, but sadly, there is not.\n\nOverall, This game has some serious flaws that ruin the enjoyability of the game pretty quickly.  I don't know why I put as many hours into it as I did.

Since then, development has focused on making the game 'mobile friendly'.\nThis has unfortunately resulted in the game becoming progressively less like a God game, to the point we are now at, where the game actually has more in common with Farmville than Populous, Black&White or Powermonger.\n\nSome of the more detestable features include, Waiting 40+ minutes for a house to be built and populated, endless sticker collection to try and unlock marginal improvements in the game, Players being forced to farm wheat once they reach a population cap which then all but stops game progress, using expansion shrines instead of an area of influence mechanic, forcing players along a set path instead of allowing them to explore the "open" world, building/repairing shrines (which, as mentioned, you need to do to progress) initially takes only a few minutes but quickly progresses to hours, then days, then weeks, no in game goal (just tend to your people, like Farmville), oh, and a very poorly executed Lemmings-style mini game (which is also devoid of fun).\nAll of these mechanics are obviously in place to slow down the player, so that people playing the mobile version of the game will pay to run down timers and buy stickers using gems from the mobile store. Whilst the mobile store isn't present on PC/Mac, all the Pay-to-Win mechanics are in place, so players have no choice but to wait for hours/days/weeks for timers to run down.\n\nA recent development roadmap has been revealed, stating that the team will shift focus away from making Godus a mobile game and instead make it more acceptable to PC/Mac players, sometime in Q4 2014, if the team remains on schedule.\n","May 30, 2014","false","653.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","1"

Considering that I'm a huge fan of Minecraft, this seemed like a really wonderful game that would offer similar mechanics and a beautiful art style. It also boasted that it wasn't yet complete, and that tons of other features would be added.\n\nThroughout my time playing Godus, i quickly realized that it wasn't what was promised. There are many, many things that are disappointing, frustrating, and down right infuriating. The worst part is that when I redownloaded it recently, I expected that some of these basic things would be improved upon. They haven't been. Based on that, I'm writing this review.\n\nThe worst and most disappointing thing is that this game truly became a mobile 'waiting' game. It works with the same mechanics as Farmville, but the in-game mechanics and balancing of certain features are worse. When I purchased the game initially I thought that it wouldn't be like this at all. It really cheapens the idea of what could have been an amazing game.\n\nMy biggest beef is that within the year that I didn't play it, I came back to the game being more buggy, having worse balance issues, and being more laggy on my system for no reason. I kept having the repeated issue of cards not appearing when I completed an objective, or the finger of god not working properly. The spacing of buildings has obviously been changed from what I remember, it is no longer as intuitive and everything is poorly spaced. Every UI aspect has gotten more and more annoying, like if I have a new card, the pulsating of the top right button is aggrivating. The way that the stickers have been rebalanced seems way, way worse. There is now one, maybe two stickers in every treasure box, whereas a year ago it was more randomized and you could find between 1-5 stickers in a box. They are almost forcing you to used the voyage function, however that hasn't been upgraded or improved since last year either. They've made it increasingly challenging to get stickers and gems in the worst way, because it now feels like sculpting to find treasure boxes isn't worth the belief, and the voyages only yield a small amount of a specific sticker at every goal reached. Honestly that alone was so annoying that I just stopped improving any card that I didn't think was necessary- and in doing that it appeared that new cards weren't appearing anymore when I completed a goal.\n\nMy final, most infuriating issue with this game is the Astari aspect. Nothing is explained well enough, their appearance in the game isn't explained enough, and the way that their mechanic works makes no sense. You basically have to rely on the finger of god power, and once you've done that, there is absolutely no point in creating or pushing for the military settlements. Since the Astari and the reason that they are in the game is never explained, they feel like a giant annoyance that continually pesters you. The fact that the only real option is to wipe them out by saving up belief and then either squishing them during their festival or squishing a tree and then squishing them in rounds of 4-5 feels both annoying and cheap. They also somehow gain happiness at an inhumane level, which makes it incredibly challenging to not eradicate them immediately so that you just don't have to deal with them any more.\n\nApparently the one thing that has been entirely reworked is the fighting mechanics, which I didn't even have a chance to see. Between cards that I remember being there a year ago being removed, the gem system being ridiculously unbalanced (considering that now basically your only option to progess in cards is to gain gems to buy packs, instead of it being about the finding of treasure or even the voyages), and how the sculpting is still the most tedious and uninuitive feature in the game... I'm uninstalling, I'm never reinstalling. I'm thankful that I bought this game on sale for $5, but even that doesn't feel worth the money at this point.\n\nMy advice to the developers? Drop the project. You released this game 2 years ago and have made no improvements for at least a year. Try not to screw up this hard next time.","December 8, 2015","false","52.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","1"

Then realize the entire time you've been playing a glorified mobile time waster game where you wait for your houses to reach a certain time, then click on them to collect 'god power'.

There's some nice graphics, excellent music, interesting mechanics. But no actual game. You can play the starting phase over and over, but you hit the same wall every time.\n\nAt least the concept is good. I was more enthusiastic about Godus than I am about the endless me-too projects we're seeing in Early Access lately.

Maybe this new guy will make it work, but I see no reason anyone should put another nickel into this thing until there's a major sign it's actually going somewhere.\n\nEarly Access is a really cool idea, but it's in dire need of some tough love.

The problem is that there are multiple resources required for building, sculpting landscape, gaining and using skills and powers, and all of these resources are on very long timers.\n\nA slightly different version of Godus is available on iOS, where this Zynga-esque wait-for-resources, pay-to-play type of system is very common. On moble, it's a little more tolerable. Many people don't mind playing in short bursts when they have a few spare minutes in their day. Even there, it's widely regarded as poor design that puts profits over players.\n\nFor a PC game, however, people tend to sit down with the intent to play for a while. Having the game tell you you have to wait 20 minutes for resources, only to burn through those resources in a minute or two, is not good design. The PC version doesn't have the microtransactions, so waiting is the only option, even for the obscenely rich.\n\nIt's unfortunate, because there are some fun elements here. But they're totally overshadowed by the glaring problems. I'd like to think that they'll be addressed as development continues, but I'm not so sure. Neither the built-in developer commentary nor the developer responses on the forums acknowledge these major issues or offer any solutions to address them.","August 9, 2014","false","11.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Unfortunatlly it just isn't any fun.  Everytime an update comes out I get excited and play it for a bit, but always feel dissapointed in the end.    Sculpting in tedious.  You always seem to be waiting for belief which is a huge time sink.  You don't seem to have to make any choices when it comes to cards, you basically just build everytihng.

You click, click, click until your hand gets numb, with little to reward you other than more things to click on.  Everything feels like it is designed not to entertain you, but to keep you busy. There is progression, but only in a sense that things start off tedious, and then you are given tools to make your gameplay slightly less tedious.\n\nYou start off having to click on each individual house to gather belief, with which you can sculpt land. If there was some moderation to this it would be alright, but it literally takes hours to get anywhere and your wrist will start hurting from the hundreds of times per minute you have to click to get a decent patch of land for your villagers to settle on. Then you are given some new tools through which you can do more while clicking less, which does make the game less tedious, but with a focus on the word less - and there still isn't anything that actually entertains. It would help if your villagers seemed to have lives of their own, but even on that front not much seems to happen. They just stay in their houses until you decide they are allowed to come out - then, when there is no place for them to settle, they just die.\n\nI would advice people who are on the fence about this game to first watch some movie reviews before purchasing this game, as there are quite a number of decent reviews out there that pinpoint exactly where this train went off the rails.","December 12, 2013","false","26.7"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

Not even close to the good ole god games everyone has come to know and love, and I am not sure if it ever will even get to that point. From watching the dev videos, reading blogs. This game is aimed more towards casual play, lacking the content, and depth a god game deserves.\n\nAt this point the game is nothing more than sculpting land, and clicking thousands of times on houses to get followers out or to collect the little orbs (faith?) so you can use your powers (which are pointless). Everything in the game right now is pointless. The followers do nothing on their own, have no AI. Man I could go on ranting forever. The updates to this game are extremely slow, and we were promised updates at a lot faster pace. Also the devs don't really come around to often or fill us in with anything worthwhile. The game is surviving on Peters name, and that is it. This is not worthy of a single penny much less the $19 they are asking for now, or whatever the cost is now. Let me make it short and sweet.\n\n- If you like doing mundane tasks, for no reward at all.

The game is overall much less of a chore to play now but it's still based on social game conventions, in other words, most of the gameplay consist of waiting for real world hours to recharge belief, build shrines or refilling a boat embark on voyages (missions that play like a simplified version of Lemmings). The gameplay additions are welcome, but unfortunately the number of bugs and crashes of the game has increased. I would recommend to wait a little more until the game is more complete and polished before spending 18,99€ on it.\n\n-----------\n\nOLD REVIEW:\n\nI know that when you buy an Early Access / in-development game you can't expect it to contain most of the promised features at first, but at least I expect regular communication from the developers (weekly or even monthly updates about its development).

I'm not asking for a big content update patch every week, but at least they should inform us about what they are working on (and I'm referring to what is being worked on for the 1.4 patch for example, not just cryptic "we are working hard on your feedback and have big ideas for the future" kind of videos that just make more far-off promises).

He didn't mention that he wants to make a mobile game about waiting. I honestly hoped this will be the next populus or black and white, but sadly I've got FarmVille like game where you wait for basically everything. It's not that I'm impatient but this is just tedious and frustrating to wait and grind dull voyages. There are still a lot I like about this game, and it would be very promissing, but there's no way they will make a propper game out of this, instead of stupid clicking cow, even though there's almost no clicking now. Waiting simulator in tags, suits this game pretty well. Sitting for hours in waithing for something to finish is no fun at all. Regret backing it back in the day, but shame on me. Truly the god game, that makes you feel really powerless.\n\nTo be fair, I actually like the new village system. It looks cool, and it feels cool, except that obnoxious waiting times. It was the only thing that kept me going.\nBut after you unlock  happines thing, you suddenly discover that your people will leave if they are unhappy. And Peter was saying "GO AHEAD THROW SOME OF THAT FOLLOWERS IN THE PIT OF DOOOOM!", and not actually telling that theres a consicuence for doing so. Great damn idea, they leave in like packs of 50 people and it takes bloody 24 hours to replenish them. TWENTY FOUR FREAKING HOURS OF WAITING BEFORE YOU WILL LOOSE 50 MORE!  Before that I was thinking "Ok I can still play once in an hour for 5 minutes, whatever, theres no way around it", but now I give up, this is just poor iOS game design. Should have told your damn backers that you are making an iOS game, this is no Regenesis of nothing.\n\nHonestly, I don't give a damn about cross play. Do a separate game for phones if you really want that kind of crap, but let the PC gamers have an actuall game... you know... the one you can PLAY. For now I can't recomend this disappointing thing to any sane person. As a matter of fact, they need to make something godly miraculous (haha a pun =_=) for this to be recomendable to anybody ever.\n\n\nP.S. Peter said that we shouldn't freak out about gems, but why shouldn't we, Peter? Yeah, we don't need to pay for 'em but clearly they are in the game only because of smartphones. And the ways to acuire them don't make any difference, since everything is too slow anyway.\n\nI might sound really hursh, but am I? Investing your money, and most importantly your HOPES in people, who clearly don't have your interests in mind, convinsing people that this time Peter will do it right, and actually beliving in that while all the hate ♥♥♥♥ was thrown around. Well, congrats people, you were right, you may laugh now, it can't get more sour that that anyway.","August 10, 2014","false","7.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It‘s another Mobile/F2P cash-grab waiting to happen. I haven‘t seen anything this brash since the Dungeon Keeper Mobile „game“.  As a Kickstarter-Backer I feel betrayed by Molyneux and 22Cans and the only reason I checked the latest update (2.1) was out of morbid curiosity.\nIt just sucks, don‘t buy it! If you are really curious, just wait for professional reviews to tear this thing apart. Or look at all the other negative reviews here. Many of the more realistic people have abandoned this F2P garbage long ago, just search the forums for a bit, or check the Kickstarter comments: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/22cans/project-godus/comments\nHowever: Most reviews are still negative, and with good reason:\n\nMaybe I should start with the only positive thing I have to say about Godus: There are so many timers that I can go off and do pretty much anything else, until they finally run out. I‘m not kidding: I played through the Expendrabros campaign and I still had to wait another 10 minutes until anything happened in this „game“.\n\nEven simple buildings take up to 30 minutes to build, depending on their size. Well, you could say: Isn‘t there an upgrade that accelerates building time by 90%?\nYes, there is, but now you need wheat to build new houses. First of all you need a farming settlement to get farmers, which costs 3000 belief, which, at this point of the game, takes more than one hour to gather.\nNow there are another 30 minutes until you can send out the first farmer, who needs 90 to 120 minutes to give you 2 – 4 wheat, depending on the size of the field.\nThe next building you unlock after gaining the ability to create farms takes 30 minutes again and needs 6 wheat, so yay, even more timers.\nLater on you get mining settlements, which cost 7500 belief, which is not so bad at this point. Just gather the belief you can get right now, shut Godus down, play Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion for a hour or two, check into Godus again, gather belief, and so on. It should only take about 5 hours. Miners now take one hour to spawn und the mines take 6 hours to give you anything.\nOh, and you only get belief after a timer runs out, small buildings take about 20 minutes, settlements about 5 hours.\n(and that‘s also the reason some people have so many hours of Godus on their steam account: it‘s something you just have running in the background. It‘s NOT actual gameplay)\n\nBut there is a solution for this problem: Gems!\nYou can use gems to finish any timer. You can „earn“ some gems by voyages (about 29 in total, which is a joke) or you sacrifice some of your followers. That wouldn‘t be so bad, because the little guys and gals don‘t have any personality whatsoever, if the game wouldn‘t try to make you feel bad about it (which doesn‘t bother me either). And then the „game“ suddenly starts to punish you badly for unhappy followers without warning. Everything else get‘s a unskippable tutorial, except the happiness „system“, so it come‘s really unexpected in an otherwise astonishing linear „game“.\n\nYou see: Followers become unhappy, if you send them to their doom, what you will want to do, so you don‘t have to wait for hours until you are able to do anything again. It doesn‘t have any impact on their behaviour, so nothing is lost here, but there is one problem: There is another tribe, the Astari, who don‘t really do anything, no expanding, nothing (there is no AI to speak of, so far, and I don‘t think there will ever be any). They aren‘t even on the same island as you and all they do at the beginning is mock your people, so they want build so fast. Not really a threat.\nBut: When your people are not as happy as the Astari, they leave you periodically, and you can do nothing to stop them. A lot of people will leave you (the first time this happened to me, I lost 125 of about 400 people). So not only do you have to start the whole process of waiting all over again, you also have to get your people happy.\n\nEither you use some simple miracles and spend a lot of believe (thousends of it), which will take you forever, or you spend some gems on fountains and special trees. It‘s kinda like Fable III: They have no personality, they just react to stuff, which has some consequences and otherwise they only have some idle animations (I checked Fable III out after becoming disappointed about Godus, and I would have never ever backed it, if I had known what a trainwreck Fable turned out to be). They do nothing else: They don‘t build on their own, no exploration. It‘s all micro-managing.\n\nBasicly: Every aspect of this game screams cashshop, like in the free Mobile version. If you ever read Molyneuxs reaction to Dungeon Keeper Mobile, than you might find it funny that you can spend 70$ for gems in the shop.\nRight now you can‘t guy any gems for real money in the „PC version“ and 22Cans keep reassuring us, that this won‘t ever be possible on PC, but frankly, after almost two years of misdirection (just check the Kickstarter page), broken promises (weekly updates) and just straight up lies (for example the FAQ of the Kickstarter page), I see no reasons to trust those people anymore.\nIn my opinion they are designing the whole game to be absolutly tedious without the use of gems, just so they can get in the cashshop with the argument, that we asked for it.\n\nThe controls are awful with mouse and keyboard, the sculpting is imprecise and the graphics are just horrible, especially the animations, when zoomed out just a little bit. They even got worse since the Mobile launch. There isn‘t even a free rotating camera. They have been focusing on Mobile for the last two years, and it shows.\n\nWhile checking through some other Steam reviews I saw one that said „This game comes along nicely“, and I have to disagree! Godus has been in development for almost two years now (December 2012) and for almost one in Early Access (September 2013). In one year, they added the happiness system, and almost nothing else. There have been minor things, like having to grind wheat and ore in addition to the believe, but mostly it‘s only a variation of the stuff there already is. Oh, and there were the voyages, the only thing reminding me of a real game, simply because it‘s a cheap Lemmings knockoff. The „game“ has even lost more features than it gained. There are no multiplayer skirmishes anymore, and there is no „campaign“. While both were awfull, they at least had potential.\n\nApart from that, there really isn‘t much to say about the game itself, because there really isn‘t much. It is awfully linear. You grind three kinds of things (people, farms and mines) to get new abilities and bonuses. It‘s just another Mobile/F2P game.\n\nIn comparison: The majority of the Steam community and the Kickstarter backers told 22Cans that they don‘t want any timers and especially no gems, and just look how that turned out. Molyneux is really great at nullifying the critics: The Steam community doesn‘t matter, because it doesn‘t understand the concept of Early access. The Kickstarter Backers don‘t matter, because basicly he just wanted to get the reinvention of the god game financed, but Kickstarter forced him to write all those promises and stuff. I am really, really sick of it. yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoHG3buq5xM\n\nI really have no hope for this game, whatsoever. Just stay away from it, or wait for some final verdicts by game journalists, if you really have to. Personally, I will never buy anything for 22Cans again and I am looking forward for the inevitable failure of Godus and hopefully of the studio behind it.","August 11, 2014","false","178.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It feels like "Farm Ville" or "The simpsons" Ipad app's.  Clicking to earn belief on every single house so you can use your godly powers is a pain and becomes tedious.  Having buildings that take 5 - 15 min to build is boring.  Searching for treasure underground to unlock resourses and flattening ground... thats all I feel like I'm doing.  You can play some side mini games that are dull and unchallenging.  You get stuck to a tiny little bit of land that you have to work on expanding that takes a lot of time and energy.  You can order your people around to build things, I like that but I hope you dont mind using all your belief ordering a few villagers around.  The cards you earn don't seem like a great achievement/ and or very exciting to unlock.\n\nSummary:\nIf you don't mind a slow iphone game that takes ages to build anything and you have to tap the screen to gather your resources then this is a game for you.  If you don't mind expanding a city full of people that do absolutly nothing unless you tell them to then this is a game for you.  The game has a dull dead feeling to it, you build a city for what?  the people don't move around, they dont gather resources to build new places and have to be told what to do.\nWould not recomment","August 12, 2014","false","17.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I have been simply trolled by Peter Molyneux, who promised a lot during kickstarter campaign, regenesis of genre, jupiter sized world etc... Developers declared they are inspired by games like Populous, Black and White, Dungeon Keeper, Civilisation or Minecraft. Sounds great.\nBut after 2 years of development they delivered us facebook-like clicking "game" (not a PC game) with an aggressive money-grabbing system. There is no strategy in the game. The core of game is based on enormous long timers and collecting of stickers. Unfortunately it is hard to see how Godus lost its potential, because on the other hand there exist a great community around Godus with many experienced players who suggested really cool solutions to developers how to make Godus enjoyable, but they do not listen to feedback.\nGodus is delicious as hell.","August 25, 2014","false","281.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Give it to them, and don't give this developer a dime.\n\nYou want another better game?  How about The Long Dark.  Same price, but much better developed, with survival in the wilds of frozen Canada and wolves trying to tear you to pieces.  It's tough, but at least it's a way better buy.\n\nYou want another one?  What am I, a computer?  Go browse on your own.  You'll probably find more hits on Steam than this thing's cost in pennies.","April 25, 2015","false","1.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

When the first version came out, I played it for a while.  It was very rough around the edges, but it had potential.  Now it's 3 or more major iterations later, and things have actually gotten worse.  Your people are either very stupid, or try to kill themselves on purpose.  The land sculpting was fun in the beginning, but has gotten so epensive now, it's not worth the trouble.\n\nAnd then there is the waiting...  If you like free to play crap where you have to wait 30 minutes for a house to be built (or give us some gems and you get it instantly) then you will LOVE this game.  But it has no place in a PC environment.  PC games tends to sit down for an hour or more gaming session, not a 5 minute "click on everything and queue it all up so you can wait again tomorrow."  And even though the PC version of Godus has no method to buy gems for cash, it still is the same mentality.\n\nI am very disappointed.  The only bright side I can see is that the game is currently 50.5% complete.  Hopefully they can still bring this game back.","August 12, 2014","false","24.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It was novel for a bit, but that wore off quickly once I grew aware of the clicking and the fact that this was just a big ol' "flatten the earth to get villagers and cards to unlock more earth to flatten to get more villagers and cards" game.\n\nNow, with the recent update, there's less clicking (more click+dragging) but it's pretty much the same game, only instead of cards you collect stickers. It's the same mechanic--there's a chest under the ground, you reveal it, click it, get a sticker to apply *to* a card to unlock its bonuses (you unlock cards based on the number of villagers, and they don't get activated unless you apply the correct amount/type of stickers.) It's still pretty much a "flatten the earth for more villagers" fest, so it's easy to realize mid-play that the gameplay is stale and really quite pointless. It plays more like an android game than anything. Definitely not worth 20 bucks (I'd even say not even worth 10. 5 at most.)\n\nOther than that, I love the sound effects and art style. Shaping the land to be asthetically pleasing can be something of an art, but doing so hinders progression. It pushes the player to the mentality "I really want to shape the land to how I want, but I should progress first and do what I want later" which is a huge deterring thought most experienced gamers can become aware of almost instantly.","March 15, 2014","false","4.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Especially when they are needlessly added to a game to artifically extend the total play time of the game. And even more so when the intention is to hook the player so they feel the need to come back to the game after the hour long wait is over. That is a trope used by mobile games since their genesis. I do not find it fun, and Godus is filled to the brim with it.\n\nThere is some potential for a great experience in this however. Unfortunatly it is burried under a mountain of problems:\nwaiting around for things to snowball (if that ever happens).\n\nhorrible pathfinding AI the followers exhibit.\n\nnot being able to destroy old buildings to alow for newer better abodes.\n\npainfully slow progression (i want to be able to get reasonably far in an 2 hour play session).\n\nVoyages are not fun at all for me, i want to manage my homeworld. That's why im playing a god game. I don't want to do silly mini games meant for mobile players to gain the very basic tools to progress in the main game. Also bogged down by the crap pathfinding and clunky inconsistent sculping.\n\nThe gathering rate of belief is to low, almost all my time is spent waiting or grinding in voyages to get belief just so i CAN PLAY THE MAIN GAME THAT I PAYED FOR !\nIf these things are fixed/balanced or removed I believe i would indeed enjoy the game, because watching the followers grow, your towns grow, and your landscape grow, is all extremely cool and fun. For the PC version at least.

I enjoyed the earlier alpha releases, but then subsequent releases removed 90% of what I enjoyed about those releases. When I watched the videos produced for each release by the developer, I got a sense of frustration from Peter Molynieux and felt like he was mostly defesndive. I began to realize something was wrong when I felt like I had been scolded after the videos. It may very well be that this game is not yet half done...but what progress has been made toward "completion" has also taken the game away from what once had me so very excited.\n\nI have enjoyed many good games from Mr. Molynieux, including Populous, which was one of my childhood favorites. I have come to expect great things from games bearing his name. Unfortunately, it isn't just that Godus isn't good...the major problem is that I feel deceived. That will be a long and painful scar that will cause me to doubt all future Early Access purchases--especially those associated with Peter Molynieux.","July 12, 2014","false","21.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

This is not a series of meaningful choices. This is not an immersive experience. This is not a set of practicable skills that build to a goal state. If anything it is basically a proof of concept to a publisher for a possible way to monetize a mobile game - nothing more. To call this a game is a spit in the face to anyone who engages in the art.\n\nThis "game" consists of basically four things. Clicking->dragging to flatten land. Clicking to make followers build things. Dragging to collect belief. Clicking->dragging to make individual followers move somewhere. Your followers have no will of their own and unless you command them to do something will just sit there idly forevermore. When you build a building it takes 8 to 30+ minutes of real time to build! These get shorter as the game progresses but the whole exercise is pointless irregardless. Your rewards just let you repeat the cycle of the above 4 actions more quickly and efficiently but the lack of any real goal or immersion remains. This is a 'game' to teach your 6 year old how to use a mouse. You could emulate this game in Microsoft Paint if you drew a square, copy and pasted it somewhere else, and then waited 18 minutes before being able to do it again.\n\nThe microtransaction portion of this game comes in the form of gems. They try to stress how great gems were in the design process but anyone with half a brain see they serve absolutely no 'gaming' purpose in the game except to annoy and stall. This is a pay to win or pay to play game for mobile. Unless you pay building anything takes hours of real time in which case your paying opponents will have a city 10 times your size and will mop the floor with your face. They try to stress in the PC version that you will never pay for gems because you've paid for the game. True but they will make you grind for the gems with a really bad thing called 'voyages' which are basically really simplified annoying lemmings minigames where you just sculpt land to make your followers follow certain paths before a time limit ends. The voyage games are something out of a first project for an intro class for computer gaming in terms of concept. Tic Tac Toe has more strategic depth than the voyage minigames imo.\n\n--- This is the first game I've played in which I would've preferred doing nothing. --- It is just so pointless and dull and grindy from the very first minute of gameplay. The game's fundamental actions do not change after the first 3 minutes of the game. - Once you've waded thru the first few minutes and built your first house you've played the entirety of what this game has to offer. - The blatant monetizing of this game is sickening as well. In the PC version when you're out of belief or out of stickers to upgrade your abilities an annoying 'booster pack' of offers pops up on the bottom right of your screen and flashes with an annoying "buy me now!" noise. Given the monotony of the PC minigames I almost with there was an option to buy gems - that's how bad they are. The PC minigames were ONLY put in to avoid any sort of litigation stating their PC game is pay to win.\n\nFinal Verdict: Irrecoverable for eternity into anything resembling a game. No patches and design rehashes are going to fix this. The only redemption for this game is if they scrapped it entirely and kickstarted a new project from scratch. Mod's and Steam Workshop won't help this piece of junk either as there is nothing to mod. A Game creation Jam could probably replicate the core concepts of this game in a single 6 hour session. My only hope is this game is Peter's greatest troll ever and after a couple years his team releases the 'secret' game they've been working on all along and this entire project was a grand social experiment into human trolling.\n\nOverall value for the money: This would be a bad buy for 99 cents at the app store when you're waiting for the subway to come in and want something to click and drag for a minute before leaving to queue up another 19 hours worth of tasks for your followers.","September 13, 2014","false","270.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

It reminds me of my mortality and makes me sad that I'm spending my precious time on this earth playing this crap. And I've played it for less than 10 hours since I bought it long ago.\n\nIt takes a certain type of s*** to cause that sort of hatred so quickly. And the worst thing is, that this game could have been sooooooooo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. If not for the crap decisions the developers have made.\n\n\nI'm not just going to ramble on about all the reasons this game is terrible (but it is, don't buy the game). Instead, I'll give you a first hand experience of my thoughts on this game, from the time I bought it till now.\n\nI bought it far before the big 2.0 update (or should I say the entire scrapping and remaking of this game).\nThat's right folks, I was there at the very beginning of this disaster. I bought this game as it mentioned it was inspired by populous, and I thought 'wow, a game inspired by Peter Molyneux's good era of games, before he became an awful game developer, and without any input by him, sounds great!'\n\nSo I bought the game, and was excited at first, it wasn't bad initially, for the first 20 minutes. And then the awful AI multiplayer tutorials came on. Cringeworthy, embarrasing, pathetic. Playing with fake people, all of them tragic and worthy of some form of pity for some reason. One girl seemed to have issues with her dad, one dude was 30 and unemployed, desperate to gain fulfillment in his bleak life by getting more gems in the game.\nAnd they never ended, they went on and on and on, this pathetic illusion of multiplayer. 'Why is the game doing this? Who thought it was a good idea? Why would they make it like this? Is this the only multiplayer in the game? Will it ever end?'\nAnd then the grinding happened, which I should point out has not changed in the updates, it seems even worse now.\n\nIt was at this point that I found out that good old Peter Molyneux IS involved in the game, which explains so much. He was brilliant in his time, and I have huge respect for his older games. Black and White was a masterpiece, simple as. I've loved it for years, still play it occassionally, and I firmly believe that the creature AI is yet to be outdone in a game, including it's not so good sequel.\nBut now, Peter is the worst kind of 'maverick'. His ideas are great, but the way he implements them are terrible, TERRIBLE! And the reason is simple, there is nobody to reign him in. He is a well known figure, who's going to argue with him? They let him do what he likes, and he ♥♥♥♥s ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\nIf they took his great ideas, and then made them fun and enjoyable with some outside help, controlled him a bit, this game would have been fantastic.

It has been for a looooooong time, and the countless updates have done nothing to change that.\n\nThe only thing that could save it would be a complete overhaul of the game, redo it from scratch, remove the grinding, make it fun. But they won't do that, they can't, too much time has been spent on it already.\n\nI'd demand a refund if I felt there was any hope of getting it. But to be honest, it was worth buying it for the multiplayer tutorials in the past. I'm serious, they were so awkward, so awful, it was hilarious, if slightly painful to read. The type of bad that only Peter Molyneux could make.\n\n\nIn short, don't buy this game, it's a great concept, could have been FANTASTIC, but is boring, dull, and tedious.\n\nAnd the worst part is, the developers f***ing know it!

The only constraint you will run into is a risk of carpel tunnel as you slowly expand your influence in a dead world.  While Godus is technically a god game your followers cannot engage in any independent activity and require no food or resources to continue existing, as such there is nothing to do but keep nudging them to expand until a population cap is reached, and no constraint other than time to prevent you from reaching said cap.\n\nIt is also worth noting that while Godus states that followers are your measure of size and scope, followers do not directly create each other.  Followers instead make houses, and upon making a house they enter it and never again exit.  After a certain amount of time passes you can click on a house and get a new follower from it, and thus continue to expand your empire to houses.\n\nGodus also features the ability to reshape the terrain.  While this can be fun, it lacks the visceral feel of performing the same action in a game like Minecraft and uses an interface for this that is less engaging than the one found in the original Magic Carpet.  Rather than using dramatic spells or a slow change from a low level by means of follower activity Godus chooses to have you raise and lower the terrain by means of double clicking.

I would gladly collect belief and look for stickers if it actually meant that it created something spectacular and I could follow individual followers and their struggles to build families etc, to survive and build a civilization in a hostile world.\n\nAs it is all you're doing is creating space for them to build, but no reason for them to build something specific at a specific place. No dangers for them to overcome or strategy in placement or deliberate pacing. No economy except belief which is best acquired by not playing but rather logging out and returning later.\n\nIn Godus I am not a God, I am the creator of flat surfaces.

However, instead, I'm going to review the development narrative behind GODUS. Specifically, I'm going to look at Peter Molyneux's approach to developing games.\n\nMolyneux reminds me of a child who's managed to find himself in a factory full of paint cans and brushes. Every colour is available to him, every possible brush thickness and shape, he wanders through the factory, his mouth open in a permanent expression of amused shock, his fingers delicately stroking the paintbrushes, his eyes full of childlike wonder. His imagination explodes, runs riot, he dreams of wonderful fantastic vistas, much like a child's imagination unchecked is capable of roaming so free and so far. However, like a lot of children, his imagination far exceeds his fine motor skills, so when it comes to taking the brush and applying paint to canvas...\n\n... we get a splotchy mess.\n\nGODUS is a splotchy mess. Fable was a splotchy mess. Most games that Molyneux has been involved in have been to some extent, a splotchy mess. The successes have come about when the rest of the team have been able to refine the splotchy messes and turn them into something that resembles what is actually either going on in Molyneux's head, or a marketable game, or somewhere between the two. It's tricky to figure out where the magic is, when it hits, like Black and White, it opens up whole new ways of looking at games in general, but unfortunately, you wind up seeing a lot of splotchy messes between the rare flashes of inspiration.\n\nNot that it stops him. Now this would be perfectly human and forgivable were it not for the fact that Peter has a ... well, an almost Steve Jobs like "Reality Distortion Field" that he projects. It's as if there are two different worlds in existence at any one time when Peter talks about his games, and when he talks, we're getting a glimpse of the game -he- sees, and not the one -we- see. Case in point would be "Curiosity : What's inside the cube". Peter called it a profoundly lifechanging experience. Pete, mate, IT WAS A GAME WHERE YOU CLICKED CUBES. IT WAS COWCLICKER FOR APPLE DEVICES. THAT IS NOT A LIFECHANGING EXPERIENCE.\n\nOne day someone will tether Pete to the ground, and then we may once again see a return to form like the Bullfrog games of old, until then, we're going to see splotchy messes, infused with occasional strokes of genius, but often way, way oversold and far over marketed by Mr. Molyneux himself. Take anything that comes from him OR his dev team with liberal quantities of salt, and look up information about the game from other sources, then make your own decision if things like GODUS might appeal in the long run.","March 17, 2014","false","8.7"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","20","33","0","0"

Despite being "over 50% done" the game still shows no signs of a solid mechanical core or idea, and the terrible progression systems and heavily gated resources only serve to mask the fact that there's very little to do even when treating it as a zen-sandbox. There's no megastructures or sweeping vistas to build because, almost ironically for a god game, the game only lets you destroy. You can erode, flatten, and homogenize, but never build. The only real avenue of challenge is waiting, and "progressing" through the game only makes this "challenge" worse. Rather than progression being a way to overcome old challenges and open up new challenges, advancing through the tech timeline only adds a new coat of paint to the waiting game, often adding hours, or days, to the time it takes to gather new resources.\n\nAdditionally the game's sparse mechanics are broken with almost insulting ease. Gems, the pay-to-win currency of the mobile version, are so powerful that the "cost" of sacrificing followers to the Pit of Doom is entirely offset by the things bought with the resulting gems.\n\nThe game will not get better because it isn't a game yet.

Godus is similar to Black and White in that the interaction with the world is very different to a standard PC strategy game.  This isn't a bad thing.  The lack of direct control, the interaction with the landscape, even the treasure hunt aspects are all really interesting and work well together.  But the problem lies in the execution.  It is very difficult to play this game for more than 15-20 minutes without running out of things to do.  On a mobile game, that's fine.  For a PC game, it's frustrating.  The reason for this is that everything is based on real world time, so if a beacon is going to take 16 hours to build, you shut the game down and come back in 16 hours.  Again, this is standard for a mobile game, and there are justifications for it in a social game as well I guess, but it means there is a lot of dead time.  Much more dead time than actual fun time.\n\nThe shame is, I enjoy playing the game.  The land sculpting and bringing together settlements is really well done and a lot of fun.  But normally after 5 minutes, just when I'm getting into it, I'm out of belief.  Then there's 5 minutes of hunting chests, maybe go on a voyage, but really there's nothing to do but close the program and wait a couple of hours.\n\nAs I say, the land scuplting aspect, coupled with the lovely minimalist artwork, really is lovely and interesting.  The landscape is beautiful, although it's something of a shame that your main interaction with it is to turn it into a flat parking lot to put houses up.  There is promise here, I will continue playing.  But at the moment I could not recommend this to anyone else.","September 14, 2014","false","21.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Well... I should clarify that. they removed the ability to buy stuff from the pc game but they left all of the stuff in there that is designed to slow down the game so that you buy stuff. very strange.... for example... I'm now waiting a few hours for some stuff to build.\n\nThis is the only game where I am glad to be interrupted while playing it because that means something will be done when I come back to the game.\n\nHopefully they remove all the painful delays from the game when it leaves early access.\n\nUpdate: Ok. I've had some time to play the game and I'm now able to look beyond my overwhelming frustration with the time delay to provide some more feedback. (sort of able to look past it)\n\nPros:\n\n1. I really like the look of the game\n2. I also like how they let you model the land to build stuff on it. I think they got that one down pretty good.\n3. I like how you have to grown your population to unlock stuff\n\nCons:\n1. I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE having to wait 3 days for something to be built. And that is what the timer says. 3 days. it actually takes even longer then that because your workers take naps. So it will probably be 4 or 5 days. I'm going to do a few minor things in the game then I don't expect to ever play it again unless there are some radical changes in the wait time.\n2. I hate all of the stupid, pointless resources. you have belief which lets you build some stuff. Then you have to get wheat to build other stuff and then you have to get ore to build other stuff and then you have to have gems to do other things. So you end up having to create this huge infrastructure of ore to be able to unlock to portals and once they are unlocked they don't do anything.\n3. This game wins for being the most frustrating game I have ever played.\n4. So there is this In-Game game where you have to get your followers to go from one point to another point on a map. It makes me so mad because you can't control your followers and they are idiots. Oh and did I tell you it is timed. So you have to get your followers to go from point a to point b in a very short time frame with no control over them and things are trying to kill them and you have limited resources. Fun... it is not.\n5. Oh yeah. so my theory that they took the free game from the ios and brought it to the pc was confirmed. They forgot to remove a button from the pc version which, when you click on it, tells you to buy gems at the store... except for the pc version doesn't have a store so... yeah...\n\n\nConclusion: If they got rid of the wait times and balanced out the other stuff I think I could recommend this game... right now where the game is there is no way I would ever recommend it.\n\nOh yeah my hours into this game are so big because I just leave it running in the background. It is a easy way to build up resources.\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nOk They just released a new balance option which is AWESOME. It lets you eliminate a majority of the stupid timers so that the game is actually fun. So here is the deal.\n\nI would actually recommend this game if the balance options, which allow you to speed up the timers, stay in the game. However, I'm under the impression that they are going to remove them once the game gets more developed. At that point I think the game will go from being awesome to sucking.\n\nI actually came into this review specifically to update my review to be a recommend when, as I was typing, I realized that they probably are going to remove the balance options and then I'd have to update my review again. I'm just going to leave it as a not recommend until I get more concrete info that the stupid timers are going to stay in seconds rather then days.","September 12, 2014","false","393.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You want the new black and white or populous.\nSadly this game comes nowhere near delivering. This is a tablet game more than anything else.\n\nThe game revolves around faith and population. with more followers, you get more faith, which you then use to shape the world, find treasure chests witch are marked on the map, and most of all make flat land, your followers can build on. Whenever your followers build a house, it'll generate faith, so you can make more flat land and find more treasures\n\nWhenever you reach a certain population, you'll unlock cards, which you then further unlock for "stickers" you find in the chests. These will unlock everything from god powers to new buildings with a linear progression.\n\nThis might all become a good game in time, you might think, but here is the catch. EVERYTHING YOU DO TAKES FOREVER! Building a house, waiting for new faith to spawn for you to pick it up, waiting for your crops to be ready for harvest, all of this takes hours of waiting time. As an example, the tier 3 houses take 4 hours to spawn faith!!\n\nIf you pick up this game with an actual game in mind, where you can have an intense session feeling like a benevolent or cruel god, this is not the game you are looking for. If you are looking for a more god-simulator/doll house feeling this could be a game you might like since there is no real action. It’s a bit like having an aquarium, more than it is a game.\n\nI have it running in the background while doing other stuff, and for that purpose it’s fun. Was it what I wanted? No. why don't i recommend it?

It is SOOOO tedious to reshape the landscape, and it often does not reshape the way you want it to resulting in people getting stuck everywhere.\n\nThe Astari (rival tribe) also gain loads of happiness and beat your tribe whenever you save and leave your PC for more than a few hours, even when their entire kingdom is covered in swamp land and they all die every time they leave their houses.

The original version had 'Commandments', which gave your villagers opinions on cutting down trees or breaking rocks, now, it should be noted that Villagers never actually DID these things, and the Commandments didn't work anyway, but it did imply that resource gathering, or at least interaction of this type was an original goal of this game. That aspect has now vanished.\n\nThe game seems to be veering more and more towards a Mobile sales model, with 'stickers' and 'gems' that give a hefty impression of being buyable resources if you don't want to wait for the timers, indeed, the game will apparently be available free on Mobile devices, which gives a very uncomfortable foreboding of where this is going.\n\nIn essence, this is sadly not the 'Regenesis of the God Game' it was promised to be, and whilst I haven't given up entirely on 22Cans, I cannot in all conscience recommend this game as it stands.\n\nPeter Molyneux attacked Dungeon Keeper Online for features that he now appears to be emulating, and that is a great dissapointment, to quote Mr Molyneux -\n\n"I felt myself turning round saying, 'What?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/turinwing/recommended/232810/","turinwing","Perdix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/turinwing/","148 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR - while an interesting idea, the direction that this game is going in does not look to be a fun one.  The gameplay is repetative and fairly boring, and the mechanics that the game is based on get old very fast.  In this game you will be doing the things you learn in the first 10 minutes over and over, but with new graphics slowly being added to these repetative tasks just to keep you playing.  Cannot recommend until this game evolves beyond putting down lots of buildings that all do the same thing.\n\nThis game is based around three mechanics:\n\n1. Sculpting the landscape\n2. Collecting 'stickers'\n3. Building resource-generators on the landscape.\n\nYou sculpt the landscape in order to clear enough space for the resource-generating buildings to be built, unlock more advanced buildings by collecting stickers from chests in the ground and spending them on the 'timeline', and telling villagers to move onto the site where you'd like the resource building to be built.\n\nSculpting the landscape is done by clicking on the 'layer' of the world you want to manipulate, and dragging it to where you want it to be.  It's restricted by whatever layer is beneath it, though, so you won't be building any overhangs etc; and, once you've played for the first 10minutes or so, it quickly becomes apparent that all you actually need to do is flatten everything to create as much building space as possible.  This makes the world much less exciting to look at, the dragging-world-layers mechanic that was initially interesting gets old very fast, and you'll find yourself often selecting the wrong layer without any clear indication of what layer you're actually moused-over at the time.\n\nBy moving the landscape around, you'll find chests containing 'stickers' - by opening these up you'll get to spend them on buying 'cards' from your 'timeline' - each card is effectively a technology that allows you to interact with your world a little more, and build more advanced resource-generating buildings.  Initially you can only manipulate the sand in your world, and you unlock grass, mountain, and deep-sea terra-moulding through this 'sticker' mechanic.  This isn't at any point enjoyable - you've already been moving the terrain around just to build things, so doing it some more to get a resource you need to progress the game is just a joyless grind.  Other unlocks include manipulating multiple layers at once, generate resources faster, and build your buildings in a 'settlement' instead of just loose in the world.\n\nBuilding these buildings themselves is only partially in your control - once you clear some terrain-space, a 'plot' will appear on the ground.  If you clear a big space, and have the right technology, the plot will get bigger and your villagers will build a bigger house on it.  You have no control over the building's style, rotation or purpose...a house just gets built on it.  You can also put down 'totems' which auto-build and have AoE effects on your villagers such as walking faster etc.  These houses generate 'belief' in a bubble above, which you have to click/drag on to collect, and is spent on manipulating the terrain to build more houses on.\n\nOnce you unlock settlements, they become centralised belief-collection units, and unlock an additional resource - firstly 'wheat' and, later, 'ore' - luckily you don't have to click to collect these, but are auto-collected by villagers and spent on building more...you guessed it...houses.  They also unlock more...errr....houses from the timeline.  You also get the added joys of having to race your in-settlement villagers to any unused building plots, as farmers will build farms on them (to generate wheat) if your builder doesn't get there (to build a house) fast enough.  Considering that there's no 'cancel construction' button and your demolition tool costs belief to use...this gets annoying pretty quickly.\n\nThe gameplay is just too repetative to enjoy at any level other than what you really try and make for yourself- and you do have to try - this game isn't fun; you make it fun.

This game was not originally pitched for mobile users but they developed as if it was. All commands required only one single click and swipes, instead of harnessing both mouse buttons and keyboard. A true waste of input hardware. Collecting belief is an unnecessary an cumbersome task that holds no place, or purpose for that matter, on this game's mechanics. Games from the 90's already had na automatic resource collection but Godus INSISTS, revision after revision, to maintain its boring and laborious swipe/clicking resource collecting system. why?\n\nAfter many complains, they added an automatic belief collector, which is nothing but a Totten with very limited range and high cost that collects belief whenever is available. As you build more of them they become increasingly more expensive, thus ultimately limiting how many you can build. Every new feature has a drawback, every design decision is a double edge sword. I really don't understand why someone with so much experience in god games is unable to simply DELIVER WHAT PEOPLE WANT.\n\nIf you are reading this review, please, consider very carefully before buying this game. You will feel more frustrated with mundane tasks than excited with new discoveries. It is the truth. If this game is meant to be run on PC, it must be re-re-designed from the ground up, entirely, because as it stands, it is a casual mobile god game with an identity problem.\n","December 3, 2014","false","64.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Just wow. It gets worse every time it updates. I personally liked how it ran way back when I first bought it (when it was a game). The next update made both me and my brother stop loading it period (he even uninstalled) because of some stupid decisions the developers made. Now its "playable" (working would be a better term I think)\n\nDon't buy this program. At least not until its out of early access. I bought this program a while back, when they still had conquests (fight to colonize an area between the player and an AI) and The Book (which made it at least FEEL like what you did impacted the development of your followers, since things you did determined what they worshipped or despised). Now there are voyages, which are boring when they work and just annoying when the game tells you they're available (and they're not, so now a good portion of the screen is a button). The recent update made your somewhat interesting (though most are useless) powers more expensive (in terms of game currency), so it takes longer to do anything. The tutorial messages won't seem to go away (they're planning on hiding the tutorials, but right now the dialog box that shows up doesn't work [the mouse bugs out with it too]). The AI is only a little smarter than before, but still not all that bright. And the only competition in the game is easily wiped out (which I think is great, because they are extremely annoying. Any enemy that can wipe out most of your people WHEN THE PROGRAM ISN'T EVEN RUNNING is a horrible idea).\n\nSo if you like waiting for an hour or so to get a small amount of progress (in relation to what I use to do within the first hour of "play"), buy this. If you want a program that markets as a game, but is actually a "sculpting" program with lazy colonization features (if you can call it that...), here you go. But if you want an actual god game, go play Black and White or even Spore (I like Spore, I just don't consider it a god game like B&W). This isn't strategy or god game, in fact its more just simulation or a linear path. Like watching grass grow. Perhaps exactly like watching grass grow...\n\nJust warning you, it is still extremely buggy, which is to be expected of something in Early Access. Also, it will probably get much worse before it gets any better. Personally, I'm done with it, since most of those near 500 hours were spent just letting it sit and do whatever with little to no interaction on my part. That zen part of the description? That's trying to achieve peace after all your followers stream out like cattle from your settlement into a deadly swamp, immediately wiping out your settlement. The incredible power you wield? Thats your ability to click the quit button when the game is lagging to hell and using 8GB of RAM (really 22cans? Please work on your efficiency). Making games is hard for sure (I'm a CS major who makes games, so I get their pain [maybe...]), but this feels like they're running in circles after their own tails to do what they want to do (which is fine, unless what you want is going to extremely limit the player's actions in horrible and ultimately stupid ways) instead of focusing on making the program an actual GAME.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't suggest this to my worst enemy, much less some person I have no grudge with. There's a reason there are so many bad reviews for this. Don't spend money on Godus. Just save yourself the grief. Because unless things REALLY change, Godus will never live up to its tags and developer descriptions.\n\nP.S. You can tell they're being lazy, because they just tinted the skins for the followers (the last update added multi-colored skinned followers so they aren't all just tan, but the Astari [a rival civilization of breeders...?] are all messed up by this, making black Astari with tan heads and other random bits...) to, I guess, make it seem like they're making more progress. Lovely how they focus on new skins for followers instead of maybe making the program run smoother, isn't it?","December 5, 2014","false","498.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Have a moderate amount of free time? This review comes in video form!\n\n-----\n\nAt the moment, Godus is very much a mobile game with the Free-to-Play elements cut out. After an initial ease-in period, most of the game's content is locked behind time gates. Some of these gates are more annoying than others, but it all pushes the game towards a very slow, very stilted pace. Collecting belief and wheat and other reasources has a rather fun, tactile flow to it, but the wait for these payouts is so long that you'll rarely be interested in actually hanging around in-game for them to pop up.\n\nThere are definitely some fun elements to the game, such as the competition between your people and the indigenous, party-loving race that threatens to lure your villagers away with promises of good times. However, every good idea seems to come with some small caveat that hinders full enjoyment of them. In the case of the inter-racial rivalry, the problem is that it continues to simulate even when you aren't playing, meaning you could come back from taking a break from your tribe only to find that everyone got bored of waiting for you and jumped ship, leaving you with scores of empty houses and a tanked happiness rating.\n\nIf you want a game that you'll pop onto for a few minutes to an hour at a time to gather resources and make minimal land gains, or something that you can leave on in the background while you play other games, work, or slack off watching youtube videos about games you may or may not be interested in buying, then this game might be right for you. Otherwise? Give it a while. It's in early access yet, and 22Cans claim to have some incredibly interesting plans for the future. If they can't deliver in the end, then nothing wasted. If they do, (and I really do hope that they can) then you won't have burned yourself out on a lesser version prior to release.\n\nA note: In its current state, as a game, Godus is not worth its $20 asking price. However, if you're interested in following the development process of an ambitious (and probably overly so) title backed by some very passionate people, it might be worth it for you in order to follow the game along. That's a very big, very tentative 'might', however.","October 8, 2014","false","61.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

So of course time passed and I heard bits of info here and there how bad this game got and how bad the development was. Not surprising as I see a lot of early access games to just kind of die. However recently a friend of mine who has been following this game told me something changed.\n\nSo I went back into it.\nAnd I actually like it.\n\nyea I dont love it. But it is still Early Access after all. I started to look things up about the devs and found this out.\n\nMolyneux the man who is hated probably as much as EA stepped down as CEO back in Juneish. Dunno the exact date but most articles are around that time period. So as I was going through the reviews I noticed how people are still complaining about Molyneux ruining this game....\n\nSo here's some positives as to why you should at least keep this game on your wishlist or buy it on a sale.\n\nHeres an article stating Simon Phillips is taking over as CEO.\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-17-meet-the-man-trying-to-fix-22cans\n\nThe devs are active within the forums and on the 22cans twitter (they respond to tweets more than posting their own)\n\nAs you can see in recent updates (Yes im aware the last one was in September) they are working away on a combat update.\n\nAlso if you read the Godus opt in steam section on this page you'll notice that they update the dev build more than the actual early access. This meaning you'll get more content although it will be buggy.\n\ntl;dr\nGame has a new CEO and is becoming active again, Wishlist this and check back every once in a while or buy on sale.\n\nP.S. when reading reviews do your own research to make sure some highly liked review isn't utterly wrong.","January 25","true","15.1"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","19","32","2","0"

The potential of Godus is off the charts. However, you know what they say about potential if it's unrealized. So much work needs to be done, and the lack of patches (as everyone else has noted) leaves me wondering what happened to my twenty bucks. Forty bucks if you count that I bought this for my brother as well.\n\nThe game could be tremendously fun. I've spent plenty of time on it as you can see the number of hours I've spent in game. There is just something unequivocal about throwing a meteor at your enemy's buildings and watching his followers running around, screaming, and on fire. On my more benevolent side, though, developing my civilization, and watching it grow in the peaceful world is fulfilling on it's own. It is a time sink, and the number of times I've clicked my mouse is somewhat preposterous. Like my brother said, you click your mouse more times than in Diablo, which is saying something.\n\nThe real issue is lack of updates. It can be difficult in later stages of the game to accumulate the resource cards neccessary to advance. When storms begin (when you've reached farming) having to click on each and every abode to repair is insane. It takes quite a bit of game time to develop your cliff sculpting ability which makes it somewhat easier to clear areas for abodes and towns.\n\nAnyway, I really would like to recommend this game, but I need to see more work done to improve and complete the game.","January 25, 2014","false","491.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

To do anything in the game requires gems, which can only be gotten by sacrificing your people, but in order to sacrifice your people you need to have enough faith to control them which requires you to purchase faith with gems.  It's either that, or you go and wait 20+ minutes in order to collect faith from the huts.  I would not recomment this game.

Passive.\n\nThe nearest comparison to Godus is, perhaps, Black and White and/or Black and White 2.  The thing is, though, that if you go into this game with that attitude or with that mindset, you will be horribly disappointed.  You control almost nothing.  You don't get to dictate placement of buildings; and even if you did, there's only one kind of ACTUAL building (houses of various "tech level") to create, and you do so by simply clicking and dragging land into as wide a section of flat, open area as you can manage.\n\nThis game is almost entirely clicking and dragging.  There's nearly nothing else to do.  No commands to issue, no challenges to face, no interaction with your followers, nothing to demonstrate your godly powers upon (and even if there were, it would be terribly unsatisfying, like everything else in the game).\n\nThe art style is bland and so minimalistic as to be legitimately unattractive.\nThe user interface is one of the worst I've ever dealt with.\nThe only content in the game is pointless expansion coupled with some insipid, uninspired, unrewarding "challenge" missions where you take on "another player" (read: insultingly obvious pre-scripted "bot" with an avatar that is a photo of someone).\n\nHonestly, I can't warn you away from this game enough.  Look elsewhere.  Maybe Reus or Black and White 2.  There's (probably) nothing for you here; you'd be better off with a Facebook game, because that's exactly what this feels like.","January 9, 2014","false","3.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

The challenge is increase by making the terrain more frustrating (which, IMHO, is more of an annoyance with the tools to work the more complex terrain being earned achievements AND cost features).  The AI  is an oxymoron...it simply isn't.  It is not my desire to be hateful.  The plebs are simply doltish.\n\nThe click to release/collect stuff in the UI is unpleasant.  It works at the micro level, but at the MACRO level it is completely unworkable and the ("town") solutions provided are absolutely untennable from a cost perspective -- that is, balance is beyond crack-smoking wacked.  This is where the suspension-of-disbelief completely breaks down.  A god should not be designating "towns".  BAH HUMBUG.  Villages, communities, towns, etc are emergent!

I mean, yes it was a clickfest and yes it lost its fun after a pretty short period of time. So I put it to the side and decided to come back to it in a few months when there was more stuff to do. I started it up and there was some new graphics and apparently there was farming. So, all sorts of new features! Well I wasn't able to get to them. The game starts off by putting you in a tutorial that is UNSKIPABLE. Which is very obnoxious since I already knew how to play the game. I see a chest out the corner of my eye. I remember that chests gave cards which you could get technology with, so I instictavly clicked it and it gave me the card. The game then said to go click on the chest. Hmm. Perhaps not following the tutorial to every single exact point was not the most prudent idea. So, great, I broke the game. Already. I literally can't do anything. So, I restart the game to see if that helps, and it didn't. So, I deleted all the state files to restart my save file, and instead it starts me at the beganning of the tutorial, and it still tells me to click the chest. Alright, fine. So I had to reinstall the ENTIRE GAME for me to fix it. I sat there, waiting for the game to install, and then I realized something. Wait a tick! I can go play a game that's actually good instead! Of course! I then cancelled the installation and played TF2. True story.\n\nNow that I read up a little on the game, it would seem that this is a money grabbing pile of garbage. The developers are deliberatly holding back features that would make the game better because it wouldn't be feasible on a mobile phone. So bascially its like Plauge Inc Evolved. Except they don't update it and don't plan to expand the game in any way shape or form.\n\nOh, and also if the game still has those god damned "gems" (As soon as I saw the gem thing in the corner I groaned), I am almost postitive that they are going to add the dreaded, micro-transactions. Finding the right cards are a gigantic pain in the ♥♥♥♥, so you can buy them with gems. I don't like the looks of this. I have a bad feeling that they are going to make gems available to be bought with real money. And did I mention that there is literally no way to get gems? Besides of course the tiny strip of gems next to the statue. The last time I played the game I was hugly frustrated with the fact that I could never get the correct stuff from chests. Oh, and of course, the later houses take HOURS to build. And guess what! You can pay gems to have those built instantly! No, no no no no no NO! Damn micro-transactions and everything they stand for! Also I would like to touch upon the fact that this game literally has no goals whatsoever. I mean, I spent a decent amount of time on it, but.. If its still like it was, I have zero interest in coming back to it.\n\nAs a great man once said, "There a few times in my life, when I am cleaning my ear with a q tip, and I go to far in.

I don't want to schedule it on my alarm clock for six days to come back for a block to be chipped".\n\nThat is exactly what Godus is like in its current build (v2.1).You need to wait for everything. Is it six days? No, but you'll still be waiting for 30 minutes to an hour for your followers to generate belief, which is esseentially the in game currency. You'll wait hours upon hours to build the shrine of expansion, which unlocks the next area. And you'll wait an hour just so your farmer can make some wheat, which is required to build more houses, which in and of itself, takes time. Like Dungeon Keeper.\n\nBUT! All of that time can be wiped away by doing one simple thing. Spending gems! Just like in Dungeon Keeper! Need belief? Spend some gems! Need some stickers so you can unlock the next technology/power/building/whathaveyou? Spend some gems! They have a commentary throughout the game with Peter and some other guy explaining concepts, play styles, and cards to you (which I actually like this idea). In this commentary, Peter says you don't need to spend gems to advance n the game, and Peter isn't lying. But what he doesn't say, is that if you don't spend gems, then your progress will be agonizingly slow. Like Dungeon Keeper.\n\nLuckily, since I shelled out $20 for this game, gems don't cost me anymore real world money, I have to find them, by going on an adventure (which is boring as hell, and no longer an option since I finished them all in an hour), finding treasure chests (which cost an insurmountable amount of belief), or sacrificing my followers into the aptly named "Pit of Doom" (which causes unhappiness).\n\nWith unhappiness, comes the Astari, the games version of a competitor. They sit near your boundaries, lauging at you, and hold festivals in their little town. If their happiness is higher than yours when they hold this festival, then you lose followers to them, which isn't that bad of an idea. Except for the fact that it is almost impossible to maintain your happiness at a level higher than them. This game runs even when it's turned off, meaning it runs when I'm asleep, and it runs when I'm at work. I'll wake up and check Godus, and half of my followers will have defected to the red scum. Come back from work, half of my remaining followers will be gone. I'd increase my happiness, but I don't have enough gems to build a gift, or enough belief to kep building trees (whose cost increases every time you use it). Now my game is pretty much all but over.\n\nWhen first started playing Godus, it was fun. It was a God game. A rudimentary one, but a God game none the less. Then, it became Farmville, where all that mattered was how many farming settlements you could make. Now, it's become EAs version of Dugeon Keeper. Might it change for the better in future updates? Possibly. But right now the road ahead looks bleak, and a lot like Dungeon Keeper.","August 11, 2014","false","34.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I think that largely, it's the disappointment that makes me loathe it so.  I was expecting a PC game. What I got instead is some guy taking my $20 and using it to make an iOS game he makes a fortune off of selling premium content for, whilst I am left with a crappy port of said game.  If I can offer one piece of advice, it would be to play the iOS version.  PC games are not something you should wait around for 20+ minutes for something to build in.  It is literally the exact same game, sans the purchasing of premium content.  Instead, you are admonished to destroy your populace (one of the resources) in order to eventually kill enough of them off to purchase something that allows you to sit down and build a hut.

The developers have simply tweaked some values to 'reduce the amount of clicking'.\n\nThese 'changes' (which apparently took 3-4 months to implement) increase the value of in-game currency given for each click, but increase the duration between clicks. This effectively means you spend more time doing nothing instead of clicking; not a very enlightened trade-off.\n\nThe ability to double click to ‘sculpt’ the terrain has also been removed, thus making terrain ‘sculpting’ (flattening) less clicky, having the amazing effect of making it slower and similarly (or perhaps more) RSI inducing.\n\nThe end results of v2.0 update is to make the game slower, and leave the player doing nothing instead of clicking. If I was a cynic, instead of a realist, I might suggest that this would be a good place to insert ‘use gems to speed up <insert verb here>’ mechanic, and the inevitable and corresponding ‘purchase gems for real <insert currency here>’ in the store that ‘doesn’t exist’.\n\nGood times…\n\nDo your body, mind, soul, wallet, and computer hardware a favour, and stay as far away from this cancerous and ultimately unrewarding excuse for a ‘game’ as you are able.\n\nDo not ever pay money for this ‘game’.\n\nDo not accept it as a gift; be offended if someone tries to give it to you.\n\n\nThe horror... the horror...","March 13, 2014","false","8.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I'm struggling to like Godus.\n\nWhile it has elements that are unique and ideas that bring back those feelings of Populus, it just feels like a total miss. I understand that it is currently an Early Access title, but for a God Game, it's way too limiting. I watched many a video and read many a review on this game before buying it, and quite frankly the only thing that did it was the 50% off deal this weekend and the minimalistic visuals which I find quite aesthetically pleasing. Reviews weren't looking good, and even with the complaints I believed that there was still something more to Godus than what most people were saying.\n\nI'm pleased to say that there was, but only for a while. The beginning of the game throws you right in, but that's it, you get right in and there's no where else to go. You click, you wait, you click, you wai- hang on, am I playing some kind of Molyneux Farmville? It certainly feels that way. Your world expands, and I'll admit it's quite a nice feeling to see how much your civilisation has grown but when you get 5 hours in it feels like you're doing it to no avail. What is your goal? Where is this going? Who the hell thought up this grind of a card system? Finding the first few chests was fun but back then I thought they were 'secrets'. Littering the world with floating confetti to show where they are really is quite annoying when I have to double-click my way to victory.\n\nNow of course, when I ask 'What's the point?' the obvious answer is to develop your civilisation, but so far it feels like nothing is happening. Every once in a while you collect enough cards to advance to the next age, and as you do you can build bigger buildings and progress further, dominating the land you live on. I'm just sick of waiting. Once you advance to the point where you can build cottages, you have to wait 23 minutes for it to complete building (45 minutes in-game time for whatever reason).\n\nOkay, the only good point about the game at its current stage is the battles. They are semi-fun in that it shakes things up a bit and you are ACTUALLY FIGHTING for the survival of your people. Completing these battles are an interesting way to advance your civilisation, but even after you acquire an advance card you are required to gather resources to progress, and the only way to do that is rely on RANDOMISED CHESTS.\n\nTL;DR It's a farse, I'll play a bit more to see if it goes anywhere but I strongly recommend you avoid this till it improves (if it does). There are some unique and fun elements that will entertain you for the first hour or two, but after a while it feels like a pointless grind and you feel as though you could make a better use of your time.","January 11, 2014","false","5.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I can't stress the clicking enough, the amount of it in this game is insane and makes me wonder if the developers even tested the game with a mouse. It's so bad that it made my wrists numb. I'd say that playing this game for 20 minutes is as stressful to your wrists as playing CS for hours...\n\nI'll probably try it again in the future if the developers add more depth, but that doesn't seem very likely considering it would require a complete revamp of the core gameplay, and if the clicking issue is resolved.\n\nIt's a joke that this game costs 20 bucks when it's pretty obvious the core gameplay was designed around it being a free to play title. This is the first time I purchase an early access game and feel completely ripped off. I'd totally ask for a refund if it was possible.\n\nMy suggestion?

(A review on the PC version only)\n\nA sad outcome for a premise that promised so much. Goddus has been plauged numerous problems relating to delivering on the vision that was published on Kickstarter.\n\nWithout focusing on the many broken promises, or failure to live up to (what I think are realistic) expectations, Goddus is underwhelming in all aspects. The long promised story mode is a poor text only background story accessed by clicking on chests. The poor execution of gaining power (mana) and the general lack of multiplayer leaves the player without much to do.\n\nThe game as it stands (this long into development) is simply not fun.\n\nThe game's (re)design is substandard, the execution is substandard and the removed features such as multiplayer is incomprehensible.

There's not an advisary civilization called the Ashtari. They first make their appearence and jibbering little men with wooden masks and they taunt your followers. At first it was amusing.\n\nThe commentary int eh game help, but SUPPRISE! Thsoe Ashtari are going to bleed your population dry. If you;re not as happy or happier than the Ashtari, you will bleed population. You know nothing of this mechanic until you quite possibly sarcificed population for gems, which they make sound like it's a good or necessary thing. To me, this new "feature" is WAY imbalanced. Where they can steal a good number of people in an hour, it take any building 30 minutes to repopulate when emptied. Whitch the fact that you can't impove happiness later, you might as well be trying to use a bucket with a damned hole in it. The programmers let you see your happiness meter where it stis quite close to the middle if you didn't sacrifice a single person, but the Ashtari start with a higher happiness, so you're screwed. And if you didn;t buy cards prudently, they you're even more screwed.\n\nVoyages are more defined, but the problem is that if the main game still continues while the voyage continues, you're still apt to lose population to the Ashtari and you can;t do much about it because youlre scarmbling to scrape for gems and stickers.\n\nStill missing in an official reset. You still have to delete gamefiles if you messed up. Also missing is the ability to make multiple saves. The game autosaves for you, but there will be only ONE save.\n\nAdded was the commentary, which I first though was helpful, but then it was just a bloody nightmare. The best thing to do is to play at your own pace. Screw what teh commentary says. Build your population base up and get as many freebies as you can before really expanding. In essence, Turtle harder than the main commentator.\n\nThe game is imporving, but it keeps rtaking steps back. Hopefully after the next update, I will have better things to add?\n\nI know that the game is an early release, but it still feels overwhelmingly stacked against you.\n\nJan 21,2014: While playable on a PC, this game would porbably be better on tablets, or even comuters with tough screens and windows 8.\n\nThe meta-story in the game is somewhat interesting, and if you don't know better, you might think it was an actual chat room.\n\nThe game also has the feel of an older games done by the same guy.

Sadly, this game (while it has promise) was fun and new for a few hours, but it certainly didn't live up to the expectations put forth with the video interviews. This is Peter, so I did go into it with a grain of salt. However, the gameplay aspects were shallow in the extreme, only rewarding flat lands and even the existing gameplay of the "40% completed" being incomplete to a marked degree.\n\nThe detractors have valid points (if poorly stated). This plays more like a FarmVille game than the "re-envisionment of the God game" that was discussed by the developers. There is an abundance of clicking, even after settlements. Most of the gameplay subsisted of creating level land so that your followers could just build more bigger houses, and discovering cards (like "wood" after you've de-leveled several forests). It can be "mindless fun", but then, you are missing out on the whole "God-game" aspect of control and direction which was presented in many interviews/demos before the beta started.\n\nEveryone purchasing should fully understand that this is a beta (actually closer to alpha, as key features have not been included and many key features are being re-designed), and my review was written from that standpoint. I will update it as time goes on.\n\nAs of recently, the total disregard for the community who funded the project, as well as (now going on the fifth month without an update to the game) how they are dealing with the development process is wildly in violation of how Peter stated during both the kickstarter and during the initial Steam greenlight project. Even a complete re-write should see more participation than this from the developers.\n\nTheir behavior is more toward a company who will never provide a product (a la cash grab), even if their intentions are good. Three months since a decent blog post or any sort of communication (besides a tweet of "we are still working on it") - this is a real slap to the face on many decent developers with far fewer resources than 22Cans.\n\nAt this point, I believe the company should be renamed "22Cant's". As a developer myself, I do not condone their lack of communication and development progress after nearly half a year, and most developers with greenlit projects don't follow this mindset, either. All of the vitrol from the players could have been avoided with a decent communication model, and better development standards (","December 2, 2013","false","31.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This would actually be better suited as a phone app because using a cursor gets very tedious at times.  The game itself is not very fun, and I'm failing to see what the big deal is, Peter Molyneux.  I regret spending my money on early access to this thing, and I do not recommend anyone do so.  I don't think it will be a good game, but definetely do not spend money on this thing before it's finished.\n\nUPDATE: I wrote this review 9 months ago, when I had put what ended up being an unfair-to-me amount of time into the game in order to write a decent review.  Now that the game has been updated, I dare not make that mistake again.  I can tell you now that after a large change in format, the game is still essentially the same.  It STILL needs to be a phone app because that is the feel of it.  It's not an RTS because you're forced to wait in real time for things to occur and resources to gather.  In the audio tutorial Molyneux gives in this new updated version, he reminds players to, "build with strategy," and I find that very amusing, considering there is no concievable part of the game I would say involves strategy, other than the miniscule quests to retrieve more stickers for power-ups, and that addition almost seems to have been added with the purpose of giving the player something to take their mind off the fact that they're being forced to wait in real time for their fun to begin.  The game is cruel to the players, in this regard.  Honestly, I don't understand how a team of developers can continue with a title like this, or how it could possibly still be recieving funding.  That is how unfun this thing is.\n\nHonestly, the one thing I was just waiting to hear Molynieux say throughout the entire audio tutorial was, "Now, you may want to get up and go do somrthing else for a bit, because large abodes take up to 20 minutes at time to produce anything usable in-game."\n\nDo not buy this early access.

Finally you click some more and after a while you realize all you do is click, click, click and click some more.\n\nGodus looks and feels like you're playing a mobile game on your pc with an android/ios emulator. Oh well, at least it's a fun game right? Wrong. All you do is click to cut trees, click to build houses and buildings, click to modify the terrain, click to open chests, and when your power is low you click the countless belief bubbles. Than you can go back to click to cut trees, build houses and so on...\n\nAbout the looks... just take a look at the screenshots in the store page. I'm not one of those narrow minded people who think graphics are everything, but tell me those graphics are not something similar to what you see in games made for smartphones, tablets or even facebook.\n\nI can't believe the same guy who made the masterpiece Black & White is responsible for this debacle. Granted, Molineux is not the most consistent game designer out there, but even his bad stuff (Fable series, the movies) were not complete disasters.\n\nAnyone who played and enjoyed Black & White will agree that game gives you that "God" feeling. You are in control of a powerful being that can be worshiped, feared or both.  In Godus, despite the name, you don't feel like you're playing as a God at all. It feels more like a city management game where you are some kind of mayor with some superpowers.\n\nThis game is about what, 60% complete? I doubt it will get any better once it's finished.

The cycle of earning Faith from followers who then expanded my village quickened in pace as I used the faith to raise land for them to build on, until it altogether stopped entirely. I waited for several minutes, saw no timers what-so-ever, and eventually came to realize that I'd either failed the game, or the game had failed me.

The game is in a poor state, and I still give them the benefit of doubt but haven't seen any updates for months.\n\nThe game is horrible at the moment. It is constant click fests, it is ridiculously slow, and it landscape tool is undeniably frustrating to use. The civilization will start building house any chance they want without any creativity or other buildings. Forget about any thought of shaping the landscape, the town, to create a beautiful world. It's impossible\n\nThis game should be on facebook or on a tablet, but even that is an insult to the game developers that design their game specifically on such platform. I enjoy time management games like GameDev Story, Valkyrie Crusade, Adventure Town, etc. Godus is a complete lackbuster in comparison.\n\n---\n\nLike every game, there is always potential for more, I just hope there developer can turn things around after the revamp. Once the new overhaul has rolled out, I will review the game again.","December 1, 2013","false","7.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I loved Black & white as a kid and thought this would be similar, but with more of a challenge which had been stated by the creator early on. I bought it the first day it was available on steam and was extremely disappointed within a few minutes of play. The art is beautiful, other that that I can't think of anything else very positive. The game play is very repetitive tap and drag style. The main mechanics that give you 'points' fill power meters sort of thing are so repetitive you could play one minute out of every 15 and more than maximize any and all needs. The multiplayer is against a robot and once again repetitive. In short it is hugely unappealing. The overall game feels like a free tablet game I paid 9.99 for. The only reason I wrote this was to hopefully save someone the money I spent, the game is pretty but other than that its little more than an interactive screen saver.","December 1, 2013","false","2.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

With gameplay cropped generally to slowly flattening out pieces of land, and digging up cards, and where your villagers do nothing of particular interest, the gameplay that emerges is much too simple.\n\nThough I hope that the future of Godus is a bright one, as of now it is just not worth your £15, or your time for that matter.","November 26, 2013","false","5.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TsungUK/recommended/232810/","TsungUK","Tsung","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TsungUK/","962 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe more I try to play this game the more I hate it, such an ANTI PC game I've ever met. I literaly sign on, collect believe, farm farms, sculpt landscape, quit.. and wait until the next round of believe/farming comes in. The game will take YEARS to play becuase of the crazy time delay and duel money system going on. It's crap, you can sacrife your followers to earn gems, but it makes them unhappy, so you have to spend gems to aquire happy statues it's the pinical of evil. Also sacrifing will cost believe, which is required for everything, but no worries, again, you can buy it with gems.  Round the merry go around you go.\n\nEven the developers commentories say "we think  you're bored with collecting believe by now".. Well NO ♥♥♥♥ SHERLOCK, the whole game is a frustating waste of time..  DO NOT BUY.. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY.. YOU ARE BETTER THAN THAT.. Go buy a goldfish, that is more rewarding and exciting that trying to play this game.\n\n\nUpdate 28/09/2014: New version (2.2.1).. Excellect the tutorials are gone we've been trusted to use a mouse again. The game has had some major changes since previous version. Sadly hand holding is still in, early game you will be slowly pulled throu' the mechanics of playing. Flatten landscape followers build houses, repeat. Gems are back!!, gems are like in game currency you would have to buy on a mobile version, but this PC version the developers are at pains to explain there is no way to buy them. Instead we get a pit of doom to sacrifce our followers which will earn gems. Gems (on pc version) can be earn other ways too (doing missions and finding them in treasure chests).\n\nGems are a Major mechanic in the game becuase lets face it, it's a mobile game. Run out of believe and a little card will be waved in the bottom corner encouraging you to spend 5 gems for 1000 believe. Believe is the currency that you can earn slowly over time and is required to do ANYTHING in the game. So when it runs out, you have a choice.. wait for more to be generated by the houses, or spend gems to get some NOW. Gems can also be used to speed up buildings or capturing of beacons..\n\nThe developer are constantly reminding us there shouldn't be any downtime, aka. time where you are doing nothing just waiting for believe to come in. However, they are so wrong.   If your believe drops to zero you cannot use the leash to move your followers around this creates downtime. You could go do missions, I'll get onto those in a minute, so long as you haven't messed them up previously. If you have messed them up, you either wait for re-enforcements or SPEND GEMS to get them NOW.\n\nThe missions.. Missions are a side game to the main builidng of your colony. Think 3d lemmings and you would be pretty close, your ship will land at an island, and it's up to you to get usually 10 of your people from the ship to the temple on the island. They take the most direct route, like lemmings, regardless of hazards in their way. You need to change the landscape to provide a safe route, using god powers where nessecary. It isn't bad sub game, you get to play with god powers so great except gems raise their ugly head. If you fail the mission you can retry but the lemmings you commited are gone, your ship hold 30 lemmings, you need to get 10 to a temple to win, so you can fail 3 times before being prevented from playing on. Of course spend gems and reinforements arrive, no gems? thats ok, you can wait HOURS for them to arrive.\n\nOh in this version there is another settlement on the island, which is interesting. Sadly the developers commenty is a bit of a spoiler when it comes to the game. It's like going to a movie with someone who's seen the film and keeps going "oh this is a good bit", "watch this", "you may want to cover your eyes".  You unlock a card and they will say "Get this card its VITAL.. or maybe it isn't?. by now you should of done X or Y, if you haven't do it we promise you it's really good".  This next land is already flat for your new houses, so don't change it too much, (or do if you really want to)". "The other tribe appears to be friendly and harmless, or are THEY?" .. You get the idea...\n\nStill I'm going to keep my recommendation to No for now. It's not as bad as the previous versions by a long way but still it's feels like a mobile game. Maybe it's a good game for people who like games such as the Sims, or Farmville? (not critizing them games, just trying to give an idea of what sort of gamers I think might enjoy this game).  Side missions could be fun, lemmings style, but the need for gems to reinforce when you mess up does spoilt it somewhat.\n\n\n(older reviews below)\n\nUpdate 09/08/2014: Godus is so damm boring, it wants to hand hold you every step of the way. The latest beta 2.1 forces you to do the "tutorial" which is at such a SLOW pace it will put you to sleep.\nIf a game needs a tutorial at that pace there is a problem. The developers are DESPERATE for you to CARE about these little followers. Please stop it, stop it, we're all grown up, we're not coming to game from never seing a computer or mouse before.\n\nHonestly, I have no idea who their target audience is?. It's certainly not gamers, I suspect without the tutorial even casual gamers (facebook gamers) could work it out. So why??.. It's like they have nothing so they have slowed the pace down to a crawl.\n\n"We want it to be as relaxing as possible" the game says, well they succeeded, as it's a total snoozefest.\n\n\n\nSeriously don't buy; I've clocked up 22 hours and yet to get to do anything really "fun". It's like a pretty mobile game, constantly teasing you to keep on playing it but the rewards for doing so NEVER arrive. I think the developers want us to care about the little people but really all I want to do is the fun god like things like Volcano's, and Lighting strikes. Still can't do them, after 22hrs!!","October 11, 2013","false","31.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

There are times when I think this is a crap game, why am I playing, its so boring. Then there is something that happens to redeem it and I continue to play.\nHere is the bad: Too clicky...If you like to click, click, click...This is the game for you. You spend a lot of time clicking on houses to collect belief. You need belief to do anything worthwhile.\nYou are basically doing a few basic things\n1: molding the landscape\n2. Collecting belief\n3. Building houses\nThere is no interactiveness with the people in any meaningful way. Sometimes you see them do amusing things, like climb a tree, but there is no sense of any connection with these small people. Eventually I stopped giving a ♥♥♥♥ whether they were in good health or happy or anything and started to sacrifice like crazy to make diamonds.\nIt would be nice to see some animals and give your people direction on caring for animals or other types of crops.\n\nI'd like to see something other than the same look of the buildings. How about little shops. LIttle churches or other kind of shrines they would have to build and worship at. Barnyards with animals. Market towns--they even had those during ancient civilizations.\n\nI hate the voyages component. I don't enjoy having to sculpt that much and it is distracing and I don't find I get any value out of it. I actually kill off my people in order to accumulate enough diamonds to buy stickers. Then I use my "happy" tree and fountain to bounce up my happiness. Developers--don't mess this up for me because I'm not doing any of your stinking and boring voyages!\n\nI hate everytime there is an update, it goes through the same damned tutorial each time. Why can't there be a "skip it" button. It is so annoying.\n\nThis is an early access game--if you don't like bugs (and there are lots and lots of bugs). Don't bother buying.\n\nI have heard some negative things about the IOS/android free game. I think as somebody who bought it for computer, I was mighty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off to pay for a game that is now offered free on mobile devices. All I can say is, the final version of the paid for game better be freaking awesome.\n\nWhat is good?\nWell, there has been some addressing of issues of trying to decrease the amount of repetitive clicks, but they haven't gone far enough.\nvisually the game can be quite appealing to look at, but I think there is also a long way to go to make it more interesting to play.\n\nThere is no excuse not to do a better job with this game.\nBTW, I stopped playing this game until the next big update because I have lost all my buildings in some big error and I can't be bothered to figure out how to fix it.","September 24, 2014","false","95.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A bit challenging with losing followers to the astari and keeping the followers happy. Gems come from sacrificing followers - I need gems to buy gifts to keep the followers happy. So it kinda goes in a loop there. Also, when it rains, the houses kinda lean sideways like the trees, making them look weird. Yes trees sway in the wind but I doubt houses built from stone would.

There are times when I think this is a crap game, why am I playing, its so boring. Then there is something that happens to redeem it and I continue to play.\nHere is the bad: Too clicky...If you like to click, click, click...This is the game for you. You spend a lot of time clicking on houses to collect belief. You need belief to do anything worthwhile.\nYou are basically doing a few basic things\n1: molding the landscape\n2. Collecting belief\n3. Building houses\nThere is no interactiveness with the people in any meaningful way. Sometimes you see them do amusing things, like climb a tree, but there is no sense of any connection with these small people. Eventually I stopped giving a ♥♥♥♥ whether they were in good health or happy or anything and started to sacrifice like crazy to make diamonds.\nIt would be nice to see some animals and give your people direction on caring for animals or other types of crops.\n\nI'd like to see something other than the same look of the buildings. How about little shops. LIttle churches or other kind of shrines they would have to build and worship at. Barnyards with animals. Market towns--they even had those during ancient civilizations.\n\nI hate the voyages component. I don't enjoy having to sculpt that much and it is distracing and I don't find I get any value out of it. I actually kill off my people in order to accumulate enough diamonds to buy stickers. Then I use my "happy" tree and fountain to bounce up my happiness. Developers--don't mess this up for me because I'm not doing any of your stinking and boring voyages!\n\nI hate everytime there is an update, it goes through the same damned tutorial each time. Why can't there be a "skip it" button. It is so annoying.\n\nThis is an early access game--if you don't like bugs (and there are lots and lots of bugs). Don't bother buying.\n\nI have heard some negative things about the IOS/android free game. I think as somebody who bought it for computer, I was mighty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off to pay for a game that is now offered free on mobile devices. All I can say is, the final version of the paid for game better be freaking awesome.\n\nWhat is good?\nWell, there has been some addressing of issues of trying to decrease the amount of repetitive clicks, but they haven't gone far enough.\nvisually the game can be quite appealing to look at, but I think there is also a long way to go to make it more interesting to play.\n\nThere is no excuse not to do a better job with this game.\nBTW, I stopped playing this game until the next big update because I have lost all my buildings in some big error and I can't be bothered to figure out how to fix it.","September 24, 2014","false","95.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That seems confusing but basically, it seems to me like the design was "This mobile game should be tap based, should include cards that give certain abilities or power-ups, should include stickers that also give some sort of ability. Now we should figure out what the game is about." Included is a small game filler of "clean up" where you click away trees and rocks for building placement and such.\n\nCards essentially act as a tech tree. It unlocks buildings or gives the player abilities.\nStickers represent resources.\nFaith represents the 'energy' mechanic from mobile games.\nThe game itself represents an attempt at a timesink.\n\nIn my opinion, this game fails.

Just terrible, and it keeps getting worse. Being a cow clicker wasn't enough. Despite claims that the game is meant to be played in short bursts over long time, they've added Astari, which basically punish the player for not a) murdering horribly or b) checking in obsessively. So, one more thing we loved in Populous and Black and White taken from us-- the ability to shape our own moral choices and play somewhat our own way.\n\nGodus basically convinces me that someone else must have been responsible for the original charm of Black & White. Nothing, not even the sequel, has ever come close to that charm. This "regenesis" of the god game is so far from understanding what made god games great, and seems a tired, hackneyed mobile-milking scheme straight out of the Zynga playbook. It is slow, unwieldy, relies on clicking and collect-and-spend monotony, and it just keeps getting worse. Do not bother trying to get in on the early access to shape the game. The secret of Curiosity is that it revealed Molyneux's new favourite mechanic-- the endless, obsessive clicking-- and he will not be budged from relying on this mechanic. Every time we point out the game's flaws, he punishes us with something even worse. Too much clicking? He slows everything down so we click less frequently. We still click just as much, we just have to wait in order to do it, sometimes for days. Too little features, too much flat land? He makes sculpting at different levels much harder, and then builds it in so we really need to build on the places where it's worst.\n\nGodus is Molyneux playing his own god game with us, and the more we ask for a better game, the more misery he is going to dump on us. That might work in Black & White, dude, but it does not work in the real world. We're not going to come around just because you keep making it worse. We're just going to go off and find better games.

I will cover the basics as of the latest patch.\n\nProgression is achieved by increasing your population. To increase your population, you must manipulate terrain to allow space for buildings to be constructed. Manipulating terrain requires expenditure of Belief, which is generated by your currently existing population. Belief cannot be forcibly generated, that is, you cannot focus your people on generating more Belief for you (in fact, upon unlocking the ability to directly command your people, doing so ALSO costs Belief). You must wait for a timer on every house to tick down to provide you with a set amount of Belief. This causes GODUS to slow to a halt as you are forced to wait for enough resources so you can do menial tasks to slightly increase your resources. The lack of snowball effect is outlandishly detrimental.\n\nThere is also a trading-cards system that represents technological progress. Upon achieving a certain level of population, you gain a Card. You must then scour the land for randomly generated (as far as I can tell) chests that will reward you with Stickers. Attaching enough of the appropriate Stickers to a Card will enable the detailed bonuses of that card. Bonuses can include the ability to give a command to your People, establish different types of Settlements, or improve your effectiveness at manipulating the terrain.\n\nThere was once a multiplayer versus mode, but it has been removed.\n\nBelief and Stickers can also be purchased with Gems. As of the current version, Gems can only be obtained via in-game means.\n\nI. Do. Not. Doubt. That in the future it will be possible to acquire Gems using realworld money, obstenibly turning it into a Pay-to-Play or even Pay-to-Win  game. This is what the future of GODUS looks like to me.

The pace starts out fantastic but slowly devolves into a pointless time sink. You have to wait for your followers to pop up little prayer bubbles that fill up your belief meter..once that's done you can tell the bums to build new houses, farm, mine, etc.. But either your costs to do things are badly balanced or you think people have so much more time than they do to waste waiting and doing nothing. I wouldn't even mind waiting but when I logged off for 30 minutes because I was sitting there for 15 minutes after I finished everything that I could, ran out of belief, ran out of wheat, waiting for the previous game close to wear off (loss of 80...when I closed with super happy followers and crying Astari meter)\n\nI just don't have hours to leave a game running in the background and that seems like a huge waste of my resources anyway. Maybe make it so that I'm not penalized for closing the game and make things cost a little less or give me some damned way to get belief rather than waiting on prayers. Just..so badly balanced for people with no time .. on a game that is already fairly relaxed and chill.

A bit challenging with losing followers to the astari and keeping the followers happy. Gems come from sacrificing followers - I need gems to buy gifts to keep the followers happy.

Better but not something that's worth the money, nor my time. Recommend to stay away from Godus!\n\nI've been putting off writing a review for this game for quite some time, as I wanted to fully analyze all the concepts of Godus before giving an opinion.\n\nGodus is a game that sounds great. You play a God and you help craft a civilization, but in reality, it ranks as one of the worst games I've ever played. While I understand it is an Early Access Game, even then it appears to be going into a direction that upsets me.\n\nWant to build a building? Too bad, not enough mana. Want more mana? Wait 5 hours of real time, OR spend gold *cough* credits *cough* to rush the process. Oh wait, you wanted to build a building, right? Well the game thought you meant destroy the Northern side of your town... Whoops.\n\nBut you may think, wait there's combat, that must be fun! I just clicked on their guys a bunch and killed them all. Ended the battle and went back to waiting 12 hours for enough mana to expand.\n\nBut wait, I can't expand until I find resource cards. How do you find them, you ask? By click around the map until you find little chests with them in it. Something which may sound interesting, gets really old, real quick. Especially while waiting 12 hours for enough mana to find those chests.\n\nOverall, Godus is like being on an Easter Egg hunt where you have to find all the eggs buried under pounds of dog ♥♥♥♥, only to find the eggs themselves are full of ♥♥♥♥. Except I imagine that would be more entertaining than Godus.\n\nIf all else fails, take that extra $20 bucks you would have spent on Godus and rip it into shreds, the small amount of pleasure you get in those mere seconds will be much more than you get out of any hours of this lackluster, pretense of a real game.","February 28, 2014","false","8.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I will cover the basics as of the latest patch.\n\nProgression is achieved by increasing your population. To increase your population, you must manipulate terrain to allow space for buildings to be constructed. Manipulating terrain requires expenditure of Belief, which is generated by your currently existing population. Belief cannot be forcibly generated, that is, you cannot focus your people on generating more Belief for you (in fact, upon unlocking the ability to directly command your people, doing so ALSO costs Belief). You must wait for a timer on every house to tick down to provide you with a set amount of Belief. This causes GODUS to slow to a halt as you are forced to wait for enough resources so you can do menial tasks to slightly increase your resources. The lack of snowball effect is outlandishly detrimental.\n\nThere is also a trading-cards system that represents technological progress. Upon achieving a certain level of population, you gain a Card. You must then scour the land for randomly generated (as far as I can tell) chests that will reward you with Stickers. Attaching enough of the appropriate Stickers to a Card will enable the detailed bonuses of that card. Bonuses can include the ability to give a command to your People, establish different types of Settlements, or improve your effectiveness at manipulating the terrain.\n\nThere was once a multiplayer versus mode, but it has been removed.\n\nBelief and Stickers can also be purchased with Gems. As of the current version, Gems can only be obtained via in-game means.\n\nI. Do. Not. Doubt. That in the future it will be possible to acquire Gems using realworld money, obstenibly turning it into a Pay-to-Play or even Pay-to-Win  game. This is what the future of GODUS looks like to me. I will update this review as GODUS nears completion.","September 22, 2014","false","27.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/axorkun/recommended/232810/","axorkun","axel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/axorkun/","146 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGodus has not lived up to my expectations so far. While not backing it at Kickstarter I purchased this game through Steam Early Access. My decisision to buy the game was mainly influenced by its description on Kickstarter which basically describes it as as combination of Populous, Dungeon Keeper and Black & White. I don't think it lived up to those stadards or will ever do. If you are unsure whether to buy this game I recommend reading the reviews and read through the Steam forum.\n\nIn short: I cannot recommend buying this game. Missing content was expected since it is still a Beta version, but in order to turn into a PC game the game mechanics would need to be redesigned from scratch. Based on how the developers ignored community requests in the past I highly doubt that is going to happen.\n\nOn the good side:\n* The artwork: I really like how it looks and the sound effects are also quite nice.\n* The sculpting (customize your homeworld): the land consists of multiple layers which can be dragged or pushed back in order to extend mountains or to create a giant parking lot. Unfortunately the developers have taken away the ability to raise land. Therefore if you flatten a mountain there is no way to rebuild it afterwards.\n\nOn the bad side:\n* It's no fun: Godus is in my opinion a game for cell phones or tablets. The main resource of the game is belief which is created by your followers. Unfortunately the generated belief is not automatically streaming into a pool but needs to be manually collected. Every 15 minutes or 24 hours (based on the size of the house) a belief "bubble" will pop up over the houses which you need to collect manually by tapping or swiping. Sculpting and the other "wonders" are very expensive and you will usually run out of belief after 5 to 15 minutes of playing and then have to wait some hours for more belief to be generated. This makes perfectly sense for a mobile game which is played every 4 to 6 hours when you have 10 minutes of free time. I ended up letting Godus run in the background while I was playing or doing something else just to check in later if more belief was available (that's also how I got to those 90 hours of playing). To mitigate this problem the developers introduced "The pit of doom" where you can sacrifice followers for "gems" which you can then use to purchase belief. At some point two additional resources, wheat and ore, are introduced which you need to build more houses or unlocking additional areas of the map (the latter can take up to 7 days for certain areas. Real time, not in-game time!). The generation of those resources also takes several hours which leads again to sitting around and doing nothing.\n* Communication with the developers: the community managers of the developers asked some months ago for things the community would like to be changed. The long timers and the missing content were among the most frequently mentioned things, but nothing was changed. There is no updated road map and absolutely no communication regarding what the developers are currebtly working on, nor is there any indication that the game will improve.\n* Outlook: given that the developers recently released this game for iOS which can generate a steady stream of revenue for them I don't believe that the game mechanics will change. Nothing was done regarding community complaints in the past either. Godus will probably be an above average game for the cell phones but should never have been released for PC in its current state.","September 21, 2014","false","88.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game even for an "Early Access" was released way to soon, and with way to many promises from a man who loves to promise the sky then not deliver. I rarely try to pile only bad into reviews for anything, but it was my own fault for trusting this Lead Dev again, oh well. It does appear that development has been quietly abandoned on this project, with no updates in several weeks now. Reddit users on the Godus forum have said they only received canned e-mail respones from 22 cans. Maybe check it out if / when it gets finished, otherwise stay away for now and sink your 20 spot elsewhere.\n\nOne passing thought, on these early access terms, what happens to us if it does get abandoned since we were never delivered the promised product by the developer?","March 5, 2014","false","0.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

More of us showed support by buying into the early access on steam. So many promises, so much potential, so many ideas. It seemed like the game so many of us had waited so long for.\n\nEarly releases were just that, early, flawed, fleshed out, messy. We all had hope they'd listen, polish, an refine Godus into something great. With each passing build, things changed. At first it seemed for the better. The clicking was faint heartidly addressed. Other issues an bugs were talked about. I gave up, when I had a mighty, large civilization that was trapped in endless storms, unable to repair their homes, or do anything else, I moved on to other games. Checking back in after a year away I found something horrible had happened.\n\nThere were whispers and rumors about this being a mobile game early on. Sure the graphics were easily dont on mobiles, but surely not all the physics peter had promised. Weather varience based on terrain etc. Sure enough, Peter is a dirtly theif that promised us a new god game a delivered a game for the throngs of children that have parent supplied iOS devices with mummy an daddies credit cards hooked up to the istore. It's a very low quality mobile game. VERY LOW QUALITY. I abandoned lionhead after they focused only on the horrible craptastic title of Fable.\n\nPeter leaving to start again gave me hope. Followed black an white since I got some random magazine that came with a cd that had a video of peter showing the very biginning of Black an White. The hand, the gestures, the ideas. That game and Black an White 2 turned out pretty good. I had always wanted another black and white god game. Thought this was it. Oh man was I wrong. Don't waste disk space with this trash.

Thats's 10 quid I could have saved for limited theory for example. First off there is no goal to the game, pure sandbox, and that can be fun which Garry's mod proves. But nothing happens in this game, literally just building homes over and over. Don't even get me started on the bugs, game freezes constantly, progress lost and shuts down all the time.\n\nSO when I found out the game had been completely remodeled I was intrigued if it could have improved. Nope, just a faster paced, slightly prettier game. I highly suggest avoiding this game, and to the developers I have watched your update videos and the amount of time you have put into this piece of rubbish is remarkable.

You click the ground, you click trees, you click rocks, you click houses. Click, click, click. I had to install a program to automate clicking in order to even play this game.\n\nWhy do you click? To gain belief the currency in this game. With this currency you can click the ground to move it around or you can use it on one of the many useless god powers such as the ability to slightly change the texture of the ground or send a tiny comet to make a tiny hole in the ground. The very first power you get is Finger of God which lets you, for a limited amount of time, destroy houses your followers have built and slightly push your followers around; not very satisfying. All you do in this is make the ground flat so your followers can build houses there, when there are enough houses the area which you can click increases and you can make more ground flat and so it comes full circle.\n\nYou can also find so called cards buried in the ground. When you dig up enough of these your followers will be able to build new sorts of houses. Does this affect the game? Nope, it's still the same old click click click click the ground.\n\nI bought this game in early access and made it to the point where you could no longer advance in the game, after several months of no updates or any life signs from the devs a new patch was released. A complete overhaul of the game they said, except now it doesn't even work. It glitches out in the tutorial and that's it.\n\nTo summarize, everything you do in this game is pointless. It's the exact same thing from minute one to however long you can bear playing this garbage. Do not buy this game, it will only end in disappointment.","May 6, 2014","false","17.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The developers claim it is approximately 41% complete, so there are still bugs and features that will be fixed or completed.\n\nGodus is a point-and-click game, and there is a lot of clicking. A tedious amount. In fact, the game can be played without the keyboard. The keyboard's purpose in this game is to open the pause menu and control the camera, both of which can opened or maneuvered with the mouse. So, as I said: there is a lot of clicking. The greatest downside to everything revolving around te mouse fdeatures is you may mean to do one thing, and ddo another entirely. As an example: say you were intending on collecting some Belief points from a house. Instead of collecting the belief points, you accidentally reshape land, effectively destroying the house. This happens because both shaping land and collecting Belief is done by clicking.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly slow, but that could be a nice feature for the players. It's dependant on what the player enjoys. As far as I've gotten, there is little challenge. The only real challenge have been accessible by the Mount of the Gods, You click on the temple-like structure, and you are greeted by AI pretending to be a person. There is a fake chat between fake opponents that goes on, and I'm really not sure why the developers at 22 Cans decided to do that. No matter, you have to battle these computers, which I do enjoy. Evenutally, though, you are no longer able to partake in the battles because you must level up you civilisation. That includes a lot of tedious clicking to collect Belief points, (very) slowly shape land, build structures, and so on.\n\nThose are really the only things to do in the game.\n\nWith all that said, I must say I really enjoyed the stylistic approach the design team took. I think it looks wonderful.\n\nSo all in all, I do not recommend the game. It is incomplete, it is tedious, and as a result, it is frustrating to play. There is little to do in the game. Perhaps when the developers implement more features or goals or what have you, it will be much better. For now, though, it is unfortunately not worth $20.00. Not even $10.00, for that matter.","January 28, 2014","false","11.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

More of us showed support by buying into the early access on steam. So many promises, so much potential, so many ideas. It seemed like the game so many of us had waited so long for.\n\nEarly releases were just that, early, flawed, fleshed out, messy. We all had hope they'd listen, polish, an refine Godus into something great. With each passing build, things changed. At first it seemed for the better. The clicking was faint heartidly addressed. Other issues an bugs were talked about. I gave up, when I had a mighty, large civilization that was trapped in endless storms, unable to repair their homes, or do anything else, I moved on to other games. Checking back in after a year away I found something horrible had happened.\n\nThere were whispers and rumors about this being a mobile game early on. Sure the graphics were easily dont on mobiles, but surely not all the physics peter had promised. Weather varience based on terrain etc. Sure enough, Peter is a dirtly theif that promised us a new god game a delivered a game for the throngs of children that have parent supplied iOS devices with mummy an daddies credit cards hooked up to the istore. It's a very low quality mobile game. VERY LOW QUALITY. I abandoned lionhead after they focused only on the horrible craptastic title of Fable.\n\nPeter leaving to start again gave me hope. Followed black an white since I got some random magazine that came with a cd that had a video of peter showing the very biginning of Black an White. The hand, the gestures, the ideas. That game and Black an White 2 turned out pretty good. I had always wanted another black and white god game. Thought this was it. Oh man was I wrong. Don't waste disk space with this trash.

In the time that it's taken other Steam greenlight games to go from start to finish, they've started the game... got "75%" (their own number) done with it... then scrapped everything and started from the ground up.\n\nThere are no options to start a new game or to reset your old one. If you want to start anew, you have to delete some game files and endure the painful tutorial again. The unskippable tutorial that teaches you the VERY basics of the game. Which I have played through four times.\n\nGodus lacks most of what it promises. At this time, the "enemy faction" consists of a village where your villagers go while you're logged off. If your happiness isn't maxed out (hell, even if it is), and you log off for more than a few hours at a time, the Astari will steal more and more of your followers.\n\nBut I digress into specifics.\n\nOverall, this game doesn't have a whole lot of work put into it. The follower pathing is unintelligent, progression turns into a grind VERY quickly, and a lot of the god powers look like they'd be fun, but in reality have almost no real utility in the main game. Furthermore, the late-game belief collection system, as it stands right now, is balanced such that smaller, less expensive buildings will generate more belief per minute than larger, more expensive ones. (Belief is the main resource and is how you shape terrain, order followers and cast god spells.)\n\nThe trade-off comes with the fact that the larger buildings have more capacity. As you progress you gain the ability to build larger and larger buildings that will collect belief more slowly, but can hold more overall. So if you log off and come back 20 minutes later, your little buildings will have their belief maxed out and you can collect it. The large buildings will still be producing belief and you can't collect it. This gets to the point where large buildings and villages can take upwards of 12 hours (real-world hours) to become collectable. While it's less per hour, the large buildings at late tiers in the game allow you to log off for longer periods without wasting belief.\n\nThat's right: The progression in this game does nothing except let you play the game LESS while maintaining the same progression. The grind of this game's progression is SO BAD, it's actually a RELIEF when you get the large buildings, because you don't have to keep logging on to pop belief bubbles.\n\nMaybe by the time this game gets released in its final version it'll be good. But right now, 22Cans isn't listening to its user base. It's designing mechanics that are extremely un-fun. And the game development is CRAWLING. If you're looking at this game and it hasn't been released in its final version, definitely DON'T buy it.

However, it got dull and repetitive in earlier versions. After the 2.0 Update they changed a lot regarding the gameplay and -concept. Unfortunately, most of this changes are not well balanced nor make they any sense for the PC version.\n\nSince it got released on mobile devices, the PC version also got the same "features" from the mobile version like the gem store. On mobile devices, the gem store is the real money place to buy gems which enables you to buy additional stickers (to unlock research cards), explorers for the minigame puzzles, any other ressources to build and grow your civilization, and of course to speed up things. These gems work the same way on PC with the difference that you cannot buy these gems (fortunately) but also almost get no new gems unless you sacrifice your own citizens with an awful impact on happiness. This makes the waiting times for buildings in later stages of the game terribly long (some things need several hours in realtime to build up!). Frankly, for a paid game this is an insult for the customer. Furthermore, the game is still dull and repetitive with one difference; you have to wait even longer to expand and evolve your civilization.\n\nIf you want to play a god game, stick to the good old Black&White (I and II).

However, it got dull and repetitive in earlier versions. After the 2.0 Update they changed a lot regarding the gameplay and -concept. Unfortunately, most of this changes are not well balanced nor make they any sense for the PC version.\n\nSince it got released on mobile devices, the PC version also got the same "features" from the mobile version like the gem store. On mobile devices, the gem store is the real money place to buy gems which enables you to buy additional stickers (to unlock research cards), explorers for the minigame puzzles, any other ressources to build and grow your civilization, and of course to speed up things. These gems work the same way on PC with the difference that you cannot buy these gems (fortunately) but also almost get no new gems unless you sacrifice your own citizens with an awful impact on happiness. This makes the waiting times for buildings in later stages of the game terribly long (some things need several hours in realtime to build up!). Frankly, for a paid game this is an insult for the customer. Furthermore, the game is still dull and repetitive with one difference; you have to wait even longer to expand and evolve your civilization.\n\nIf you want to play a god game, stick to the good old Black&White (I and II). This is barely even the shadow of the old masterpieces.","August 13, 2014","false","15.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Seems that the deveopers want to make money in the store so they push out card in places that are hard and time consuming to get. This is a perfect example off a game developer that adds dull time consuming content to make money on you to not need to play it.\n\nThere are other games that are better god games than this. If you like farmville then maybe it is for you. If they listened to the countless people who have already told them the resource cards are boring and changed it then it might have become something playable.","January 10, 2014","false","7.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I should have known better than to think Peter Molyneux would ever deliver anything ever. Google around. You'll see the game isn't done, probably won't ever be done, and what is here is just a hollow experience that is pretty nice at first until it rolls over and dies in front of you.\n\nYou'll see long wait times... in a PC game you paid for. Why is that? Becuase this isn't a PC game. It's designed as a freemium app for mobile devices. In the early alpha, we saw these elements peaking into the PC version, and I think all feedback said "Don't you do that. You said you wouldn't." So, they removed the ability to buy gems, and instead, you have to sacrifice follows for gems, but you still need them to speed up progress.\n\nThe gameplay is shallow and propped up by timers. If you cheat and get infinite gems, you'll spend thousands of gems just to get something close to what you want to build at the pace you wanted to build it. There are these busy-work side voyages that plays like lemmings without good AI.\n\nOh, if you have issues, 22cans will probably ignore you or ban you if you say anything negative about this game.\n\nJust move on.

For starters...\n\nThe 41% of the game that we are able to play at this moment is very fragmented meaning there are a lot of loose ends that have yet to be completed which is reasonable to a point. This game is in beta I know, but usually more content is released in a beta version.\n\nThe game mechanics are tedious and boring. I have gotten to the farthest point in the game so far (near the end of the bronze age) and not much has changed since the beginning of the game. You drag land to make plots so your villagers can hide out in your house and only come out once you have cleared yet another plot. Furthermore you spend a fat portion of your time clearing rocks and destroying trees.\n\nIt lacks in appealing and detailed aesthetics. Trees and rocks are nice but the game is missing many major elements that could make the landscape much more appealing to look at.\n\nThe card system is very annoying and it takes way too much time to increase population and gather food.\n\nThere aren't enough powers. I know more will be added but for a beta there are not nearly enough.\n\nIn the end this game is still very much a work in progress. What has been released is very boring in fact the only fun part was raining meteorites down on my below average intelligence, house dwelling ♥♥♥♥♥ known as followers.\n\nMy advice to you is buy the game while it is cheap and wait until the full game comes out or make sure your investment is secure and only buy it once you know they haven't abandoned the game and it's fully completed, keep in mind it will be much more expensive at this point if it is any good.","December 18, 2013","false","45.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Even after the promised updates to add complexity and remove frustration from the game, Peter Molyneux has just added to his far reaching repotoir of hyperbole and false promises that have been voiced this past decade. To save wasting my time on writing a full and critical review on this alpha title (I admit, it is still in alpha so there is always the chance for things to change, but the fact that they called their last radicual update a huge change is quite an obnoxious joke and I don't see anything siginifcant changing) I will summarise what the experience amounts to. It is an iOS game through and through that is being developed and playtested on PC. It's overly simplistic interface leaves a lot to be desired by a PC gamer, and clearly is designed with a touch interface in mind.\n\nThe past complaint by players of how the game involved "Too much clicking" has largely been ignored, despite statements to the contrary by 22cans. It seem's as though Peter, or perhaps the lead developers on a whole, have somehow made a design path that has lead them to the same end result of most cow clicker games you can find on your mobile device, that center around town building and what have you. The only difference? Godus has next to no resource management save for Belief, which is frankly retrieved in a horrible manner where one has to wait a full 5 real life minutes for a settler abode to generate a bubble, then you must click the bubble to gather said resource. Sound's harmless? You burn through belief in a manner of seconds just from terraforming the land, and often have to click around 100 houses to gather all your Belief. The problem becomes less of an issue late game, where you have access to Towns that auto collect -some- of the Belief into one giant bubble, but it is still too easily spent and leaves you waiting to anymore work. The amount of waiting you have to do in this game is it's biggest crime. Which add's to my theory that it is designed for mobile devices. You're only supposed to play the game in small snippets, then leave it in the background as your settlers breed and generate Belief. That's unacceptable for a PC game. When you're sat at your desk infront of the monitor, you don't want to be waiting for 80% of your gaming experience.\n\nTL:DR?\nGodus is shaping up to be a cow-clicker that has yet to be monitised, but I can see that being added further down the line as they approach full release. If you're looking for a God game, I highly advise people look elsewhere. As Godus just does not deliver on it's namesake's implications.","April 1, 2014","false","14.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Granted this game is still in development ... but unless its gutted and rebuilt from the ground up it will never amount to anything.\n\n- Resources comprise of "faith" and "gems" ... faith requires you to click each house to gather it ... and you have hundreds of houses ... it is repetitive and boring.  Gems on the other hand wreaks of micro-transactions.\n\n- Upgrade tree is … well … not a upgrade tree.  You do not get to pick which path you take, and advancements are based on these stupid little cards that pop up and cover your screen for way too long.\n\n- Land masses are procedurally generated and look amazing but sculpting the landscape for use of your villagers is tedious and annoying.\n\n- Once you start the game there is no way of going back and restarting.  There is no ability to reset to try things differently.  This sucks alot when you spend a bunch of gems early on just to find out that you need them for something else and have no way of un-doing your previous actions.","December 13, 2013","false","10.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

This and the really weird scripted AI where I genuinely at first was concerned that I was playing with a real girl that subsequently appeared was being abused by her father or something of horrendous sorts.The mechanics of this game remind me of an unflushed toilet... nobody wants to go near them, and the only way it can be fixed is with a pull of the handle and some Febreeze™, (other brands are availible).\nNot so much the "regenesis" of the god game... more an inbred, drooling, six fingered variant screaming "Kill me" in a wavering teary voice. Personally, I feel this game is bitterly disappointing, even in its current development build, (of which I conceed, it is still in development). I can only hope for drastic redesign in many key components of the game if I'll ever reconsider playing it again myself.\n\nThus in my personal opinion, I wouldn't buy this game again, and I implore to seriously consider the long term development "ideas" with a pinch of salt... and blatent realism, before you commit to buying this game.","December 29, 2013","false","5.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Even after the promised updates to add complexity and remove frustration from the game, Peter Molyneux has just added to his far reaching repotoir of hyperbole and false promises that have been voiced this past decade. To save wasting my time on writing a full and critical review on this alpha title (I admit, it is still in alpha so there is always the chance for things to change, but the fact that they called their last radicual update a huge change is quite an obnoxious joke and I don't see anything siginifcant changing) I will summarise what the experience amounts to. It is an iOS game through and through that is being developed and playtested on PC. It's overly simplistic interface leaves a lot to be desired by a PC gamer, and clearly is designed with a touch interface in mind.\n\nThe past complaint by players of how the game involved "Too much clicking" has largely been ignored, despite statements to the contrary by 22cans. It seem's as though Peter, or perhaps the lead developers on a whole, have somehow made a design path that has lead them to the same end result of most cow clicker games you can find on your mobile device, that center around town building and what have you.

I should have known better than to think Peter Molyneux would ever deliver anything ever. Google around. You'll see the game isn't done, probably won't ever be done, and what is here is just a hollow experience that is pretty nice at first until it rolls over and dies in front of you.\n\nYou'll see long wait times... in a PC game you paid for. Why is that? Becuase this isn't a PC game. It's designed as a freemium app for mobile devices. In the early alpha, we saw these elements peaking into the PC version, and I think all feedback said "Don't you do that. You said you wouldn't." So, they removed the ability to buy gems, and instead, you have to sacrifice follows for gems, but you still need them to speed up progress.\n\nThe gameplay is shallow and propped up by timers. If you cheat and get infinite gems, you'll spend thousands of gems just to get something close to what you want to build at the pace you wanted to build it. There are these busy-work side voyages that plays like lemmings without good AI.\n\nOh, if you have issues, 22cans will probably ignore you or ban you if you say anything negative about this game.\n\nJust move on.

Why? Becasue this "game" is so boring. Its a cow clicker, and not in a good way.\n\nThe object of the game is scuplt the land and allow your settlement to grow by providing flat land to expand upon. The only issue is the land scuplting is flawed, the land forming doesn't feel accurate and at times it just doesn't work. You need flat land so any idea of creating a "unique" island is gone as you need to have more followers.\n\nNothing is auto-managed and the village is so unintresting. Life isn't there, everyone looks the same and they don't do anything on their own. You can only get "faith" from clicking on their hovels and begin expanding when they raise their little flags. You also need to wait for some time to get anywhere as theres a timer on everything.\n\nThe way its set up it feels like a free-to-play game that you would play on your iphone or tablet, not something that you would play on steam.\n\nUpdates aren't frequent, and unlike other early acess game which at least give a game with some playablity, godus is right up there with towns in which the game just isn't there.\n\nI say if I could I would love a refund and uninstall this "game".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobertT/recommended/232810/","RobertT","DonRobo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobertT/","399 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI don't know where to begin. There are multiple horrible problems with this game and they are all related:\n\n1. Heritage\nThe game was developed for mobile phones and Windows.\nIt very obviously shows. Not just in the gameplay (I'll come to this later), but also in the UI and the controls which are terribad and only use one mouse button from what I can tell.\n\n2. Controls aka "digging sucks"\nThe game is built around the mechanic of modifying the land your people are living on. This wouldn't be so bad (just look at From Dust) if it was actually fun. But there are a few problems that make it un-fun in every way possible.\nThe main one of which is that it controls just terribly. With the new update they at least made you stronger so you don't have to click a hundred times to move some dirt around.\nBut the other problem is that not only you can only move one "layer" at once (which is bad enough as it is), but it's also extremely hard to know which layer the game will think you want to modify which is doubly frustrating because it costs "belief" (the resource generated by your people, also the only real resource)\n\n3. Gameplay\nThere are no resources like in B&W or other RTS games. You just have to get belief, which is possible to get just by waiting. The game doesn't even have to be running. You just have to check in from time to time to pop the belief bubbles in your village like in Facebook or mobile free to play games.\nThe entire gameplay consists of getting upgrades for your people. This works by unlocking unlock cards by getting more population which you get by flattening land (at this point I want to remind you of point 2) and clicking on icons that pop up over your houses to build more houses. Houses are free, the only cost they have is that they take up time to build (only a few seconds) and some flat land which you have to painstakenly flatten.\nAfter you repeated the above process enough times to get enough houses and followers you finally get an unlock card. But to actually use it you have to spend research resources on them. These are little stickers with themes like technology or socializing. By dragging enough of them on a card you get its advantage/upgrade.\nDoesn't sound half bad, right? Well, actually it sounds half bad, but it's actually full-bad. The reason for that is because of how you get those stickers:\nYou have to get them out of treasure chests burried deep within the terrain around your village. This means you have to expand your village (i.e. flatten more land->build more houses) to get more land to find treasure chests in. Once you found a treasure chest (you can tell where they are by the little floating leafs above the ground) and dug it out you get a random sticker. At this point I want to remind you of point 2 again because this is basically all you'll be doing.\nThat's all there is to the gameplay...\n\n4. Graphics\nIt actually looks quite nice. I like the graphics style. I just wanted to end with something positive.","March 13, 2014","false","4.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

There are no engaging features or any source of meaningful reward for the tedious and repetitive actions the user has to perform.. A huge fail by Peter Molyneux and 22cans.","March 15, 2014","false","313.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It was fun, but now not so much. What once was found, is now sadly lost. In my Opinion there is less to do after the patch, and seriously there is no way they can say this game is almost 50% complete. NO WAY! The Godus team needs to pick a clear direction, get motivated and get back on track.\n\nAt this time, It's just not worth the money.\n\nWill update if they can get it right.\n\nJ.Boog out!","March 27, 2014","false","79.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
