"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zootch/recommended/434250/","Zootch","Karl Pilkington","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zootch/","904 products in account","I don't see the point.\n\nThe developer (who i assume is just one person, it certainly seems that way) greenlit and is now selling a fps multiplayer shooter in 2016 with nothing that wasn't being done in 2005. You get two identical maps, which are very generic, and one brown map that is supposed to resemble a Roman fighting arena with teleport pods because...?  Total of 3 maps, and they all are crap.\n\nMultiplayer will be dead soon, if it isn't already. At this point, it'll be just another amateur hour dead MP only game on the steam store. Of hundreds already.\n\nAll the weapons here are in every other game, only they control and behave worse than usual. The grenades are hilariously awful.\n\nThe sniper rifle is a one shot, one kill so that's basically the only weapon worth using. When enemies die, their rag doll has a massive fit 50 percent of the time, where it twitches or flies all over the place for a few seconds. Weird, nonsense physics. Players can abuse the jump to make themselves harder to hit, but it really isn't that effective. But you can expect to see a lot of people just jumping around with rocket launchers, if you do encounter a match. People aren't matched based on their location, its a free for all with whatever lobby you wish to join.\n\nThis is generic as generic first person multiplayer shooters go.\n\nWhen asked why the game has no volume options, sliders, or mute for certain types, the developer responded with this.\n"I didn't add one, you can open mixer volume from a windows tray icon (lower right of your desktop) while you have the game opened (minimized), and there lower the sound for masked shooters 2"\n\nLazy.\n\nThanks greenlight. This developer is already trying to get more lazy half arsed crap greenlit and probably will because the same people who greenlit this and ultimately forgot all about it, will do the same thing. They never actually buy these games.\n\nDon't get me started on why this is an apparent sequel to a game nobody heard of, or cares about. Its not like you can play the first one, anyway. It was probably an itch.io failed project.","April 16","false","1.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","2"

This was the first time that I saw a game where you have every weapon. For my opinion this isn‚Äôt a problem and makes the game looks cooler, but I‚Äôm sure that there are guys that don‚Äôt like that, this is in every game the same. I enjoyed the game very very much, I called it a long time my FAVORITE GAME! But when you play this a long time without stopping it‚Äôs getting bored, the servers are now alive, but I‚Äôm afraid that the servers are getting dead, but I hope not. The most of the players are rage-quitting when they are losing the whole time, that is the reason cuz everyone is selecting only the RPG, the grenade launcher and the one shot sniper!\nI shall type now the whole loadout:\n1: MP5\n2: Desert Eagle\n3: Grenades\n4: Shotgun\n5: Grenade Launcher\n6: Balastic Knife\n7: RPG\n8: One shot sniper\n9: Light Machinegun\n\nThere is also a Team Deathmatch, and an offline mode with bots. There are 3 maps, but I think everyone is playing only the arena map, where also are teleport points to go to other places in the map, the respawning is very quick and the ragdoll of bodies is very funny. Now I gonna tell how I play this: I spawn in get a RPG and shoot everyone, when they are close, I shoot them whit my grenade launcher and when they try to shotgun me or one shot me, I just select the MP5 and shoot them, or if you want just teleport yourself to the highest place, and then enjoy one shooting people. The bots are a little bit harder to play with, but if you play a few times and you are good at the game, you can defeat them, the graphics are very old, that is a point, the sound is sometimes annoying, but that‚Äôs not a big deal to me, so I have not encountered very much of bad points about this game‚Ä¶\n\nConclusion:It was a very nice experience to play this game, my expectations about this game were normal, but it was very nice, so this game impressed me. It is very easy to learn how to play this. I told in the begin about the app, but I haven‚Äôt tested the app yet, so I can‚Äôt say something about that, now I am on the point to give this game a rating: I‚Äôll give it a rating of 8,5 of 10, that is a high rating because this game was really nice to play and I always enjoyed playing it and I‚Äôm still playing it. Well, this was my review about this great game!

I would ONLY recommend this game if you are good at FPS, which I am not, such as CS GO, and yet I destroyed teh nubs. Wanna know how? SPAMMING RPG!

It is broken and glitchy. Its weapons are imbalanced. It doesn't even have a score screen at the end of a round. It doesn't even give a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in offering more than team deathmatch and deathmatch. Or more than 2 maps. There isn't even fall damge. There isn't even accuracy reduction when running while shooting.\nBut i brought out all my flexibility and adepted on this.  Beeing trapped by fences or flying through the map for no reason is included in the experience.\n\n2 hours later the server was played empty - all achievements were unlocked and I was looking at the steam discussion board and thinking - what did i just witness?\n\nIt was a different kind of gaming evening.
