Well playing it now I think most reviews were....kinda harsh. Everyone was in teh DMC and God of War fan train back there and comparisons will not bring justince to X-Blades. So what is X-Blades?\nIt`s a nice stylish spectacle fighter with a unique aesthetic back in those days, a great soundtrack and tight controls (the thing that most games like this lacked back then). Combos are the backbone of every spectacle fighter and here we have something...unique. Other than switching weapons here you can enchant your weapons with elemental damage so you can`t blame the game for not having 200 swords and another 100 firearms. Chaining attacks is fast and easy and the animations are superbe sincerely and the leves are also detailed and intriguing (even the arena style ones) giving the battles a nice atmosphere.\nI don`t know what to say about the game which was not said back in the original reviews but....it`s a great game actualy. Not as hard as most spectacle fighters but FUN. And that is the key word here: FUN! It`s fun to kill hundreds of demons with twin blades in over the top stylish combat sequnces.","October 17, 2015","true","3.3"," 101 of 120 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","101","120","5","0"

Perhaps the fact that i have missed all those genre defining classics has made me look through the faults of this game because faults it does have: pacing, messy combat (at least in the beginning), Annoying main character with a fake 'i am the best' -attitude. Story is easily forgotten. could not exactly figure it out even when end credits rolled.\n\nBeginning is best described as confusing. Jumping, hacking and slashing and some shooting and then a nasty feeling that surely there is more underneath the combat mechanics hood than this? Combat is early especially bad if you like the flow system from modern Batman games. Well forget that. There will be flow allright but you will reach that level of competence much later by getting upgrades and combining them in combat.\n\nRead that Bestiary when it updates. it really is worth your time as it directly tells what you are up against. Until then keep collecting those fragments and all the soulds you can find hidden in statues and clay pots. You will need them - literally millions of them. Luckily basic moves cost only some thousands that can be collected easily.\n\nGame is often offered in bundles very cheaply - i do recommend checking it out and giving it some time before deciding. It is quite satisfying to be able to easily trash a multitude of different types of enemies. Just be warned that the game really only shines once you start getting a good list of element powers and learn which move/element works on what.","August 15, 2014","true","8.3"," 68 of 75 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","68","75","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/7510/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","I played the demo for Blades of Time, and I thought it was pretty good, so I bought it in a bundle and bought this with a 90% coupon I got for free.  To be honest, my expectations were low--X-Blades has a pretty poor reputation from what I've read, so it couldn't really go anywhere but up.  It took me nine hours to beat the game though I could've cut it down if I wasn't stuck in one portion.\n\nX-Blades is the story of a young woman in a skimpy outfit destroying statues and vases while slaughtering scores of monsters and critters.  I guess I'd classify it as a beat-em-up of sorts, the kind where the game will seal off an exit and you have to deplete a health bar on the bottom of the screen with enough monster death to continue.  Or maybe you have to find these monster generators and destroy all of them AND kill all of the monsters in the area to continue.  Combat is fairly simple, as you attack with your gunblades with slashes or shooting at distant enemies.  There's a Rage meter that rises with damage dealt and taken, which falls with time or when casting spells, as it's kinda like an MP bar in a way.  You gain Souls from enemies you butcher and the things you destroy, which you spend on learning new spells or getting in a quick anytime heal or Rage boost.\n\nBattles are largely repetitive barring the boss battles.  You usually have enemies spawn in over a series of waves and you destroy them, or do the same with the monster generators, and then you get a Level Complete and you're free to explore the stages for artifact pieces to power up your attacks or other goodies.  All while staring at your character's ♥♥♥...I'm sorry, where was I?  There really aren't any puzzles to solve again barring some of the boss fights, and you typically get a bestiary update that tells you pretty much how to beat the foe.  This is the first game I've played where the bestiary updates BEFORE you kill something, but it's a handy hint system kinda thing.\n\nFor things the game did right...there's a pretty big variety of spells to spend your Souls on.  Granted there aren't many effects, but they are at least somewhat different.  Earthquake can't hit foes in the air, Ray of Light works best on darkness-aligned creatures, and Lightning Range is a kickass chain lightning spell.  There are only four quickslots for spells but you can call up the menu and cast a spell there if you have enough Rage, to make use of a few combos or to use something you don't have bound.  The music is a bit repetitive, being pretty heavy on the rock side during battles, but it kinda grew on me to be honest.  Even the title theme sounded bad...at first.  It's tolerable now, though I don't have to listen to it very much.  And the manual is written entirely in-character, which I realize is corny as hell but I kinda liked it.  There's also a results screen at the end of each stage so you can at least see if you missed any artifact pieces or are going for 100% completeness or something.  And you can go right back to the previous stage if you want, but no stage-select feature here, unfortunately.\n\nAs for what I didn't like, some of the controls kinda bothered me.  There was a section I was stuck on that required crossing a chasm or fall to my death, and more than a few times did I accidentally dodge-roll right off a ledge when I meant to jump.  Dying in this game means you start the stage all over.  Did you get a Level Complete and die?  Too bad, start all over!  And this happened to me a few times.  Thankfully that section was optional and this game has no platforming sections like that anywhere else...and you get to keep all of the Souls you had already, so that's some consolation.  Another thing was that the battles were rarely fun and felt like grinding more than anything.  Even when you knew how to kill something, some things just took forever to die, and I hate attrition wars like that.  I did kinda like the game, but at no point did I really tell myself, "boy, this game is fun!" I honestly bought it just to see how bad it was, and it was cheap, so no major loss to me.\n\nSo I'm not recommending this.  I try to be patient with games, even ones that are said to be outright bad.  This one...it's okay, I guess, but I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, or really most people.  It's a rough game, it's trying quite a bit, and while I haven't played the games this gets compared to, it's largely mediocre and probably "a poor man's" version of those games at best.  The game likely will be remembered more for the outfit the protagonist wears than the content of the game, but all in all, it's not a bad game.  Just not one I'd see myself coming back to anytime soon.","December 16, 2013","false","10.4"," 183 of 258 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","183","258","0","3"

What's so wrong in a lightning fast half-naked sexy anime girl slicing hundreds of monsters with 2 deadly blades and overpowered magic attacks? You don't always need a deep and clever story to enjoy a game. Sometimes it's about fun. I fired it up 'just to try' yesterday, not bothering even to get my gamepad from the drawer. An hour later I realized that I need to wake up and get to work in 5 hours. I haven't noticed anything wrong with controls. The simplicity of the gameplay feels pleasingly relaxing, the visuals are very good and the heavy metal soundtrack is just great. Somehow I don't mind that it's repeatitive. Maybe because I remember the days of the original Settlers II when listening to the same MIDI track for hours didn't bother anyone. I bought it with a -90% coupon and I consider it a wonderful bargain. Honestly, I would happily pay a full price for this one.","January 30, 2014","true","14.2"," 156 of 220 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","156","220","0","3"

Slashing and shooting enemies from start to finish.\n-Below average boss fights that aren’t always explained well.\n\nThe good:\n-Gameplay is decently fun, and it feels relatively good.\n-Graphics aren’t overly high-fidelity, but they still have a nice cartoonish look for them and are appealing to the eyes.\n-And yes, the main protagonist’s looks will probably carry this game for a lot of people.\n\nSo taking everything in account, the game is nowhere as bad as people often make it out to be. Is it repetitive? Yes, very. Does it have huge mechanical faults? Yes, and you will notice them immediately if you have played any better games of this type. But if you just want a mediocre hack-and-slash with little variety and can ignore some faults and the absence of a proper story, the gameplay and its protagonist (as well as her behind) might be enough to keep you invested and entertained. If you can’t overlook some of those bigger faults, and solid gameplay and aesthetics aren’t enough to convince you to spend money on it, you might want to give it a pass. Otherwise, this is a solid little time-sinker for fans of the genre which I recommend buying at any sale.","February 24, 2014","true","7.7"," 95 of 128 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","95","128","0","0"

Enemies, environments and actions will all be extremely familiar territory by the end of the adventure. This isn't helped by the fact that the first portion of X-Blades is spent working your way through arenas in the light of day, then turning around working your way back through those arenas in the evening. It's a serious copout on the part of the developers to not create new architecture and instead relight the same areas. A copout that should not go unnoticed.\n\nWhat's Good:\n\n- The game offers a nice challenge\n- Does a great job at encourging a variety of approaches in battle\n- Plenty of upgrades to purchase\n- Rewarding collectibles\n- Good variety gunplay\n- The heavy role magic plays in combat\n\nWhat's Not-So-Good:\n\n- Battles can be repetitive\n- Lack of variety in music\n- Uneven difficulty in boss battles (ridiculously easy final boss)\n- A few visual errors\n\nWhat's Bad:\n\n- Overly sensitive movement controls - ^ Unresponsive aerial movements\n- Very poor storytelling\n- ZERO character development\n- Pointless levels\n- Penatlizing players for buying life refills with very little alternatives\n- Lack of variety in sword combo\n\nIn all, there are certain aspects of X-blades that are well developed while there are many others that are not.

The game brings nothing new to the table, nothing innovative, nothing exciting and different. It's formulaic and is merely competent at the formula. The main attraction seems to be the near nudity of the main character, the clothes go to a level of lunacy most games of this visual style don't, and the weapons are simplistic and uninspired. You get a pair of gunblades and you either slash your way through wave after wave of enemies, or shoot them, or mix it up and do both. You will learn some new abilities by finding artifact pieces which add new skills for shooting things and hitting them with swords. The artifacts are arguably essential, as they unlock combos and more combos are useful, so you'll have to hunt these things down to have an alternative to clicking one of the two mouse buttons repeatedly. As long as you can crank the resolution up on your display, the controls are fine, if amazingly uninspired. If you have to use a lower resolution for performance the mouse becomes unplayably twitchy and fast. My one complaint would be that the entire game is one formula. You enter an area and fight off some sort of boss monster. You fight either a boss, waves of smaller enemies, atatck stationary things until the bar is depleted and things stop spawning; then you kill the remaining ones and get to move onto the next area where you repeat the process. Sometimes you'll have it easier and have to run through an area avoiding arguably simple obstacles with dodge, or running through a puzzle of blades. Those would be a lot easier if the game explained the controls well, but following the game exactly results in dodge and other moves being wildly inconsistent to do. There is nothing inspired or amazing about this game, but it's a hack and slash. If you like just hitting things with swords, it does it just well enough that i can't say I recommend avoiding the game. It's not terribly good, but it can be enjoyable enough if very repetitive. I would not play the game again after completion unless achievements were added or some other incentive, as it is the game is acceptable enough to get a playthrough and then be left alone.","February 20, 2015","true","11.0"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherosh/recommended/7510/","cherosh","Tentacle-Kitty (Level 4)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherosh/","482 products in account","Alright.\n\nWhen I started writing more reviews, I told myself that I should do so after finishing the game. But this here. This game. I... can't wait until I've finished this mess before I write down what exactly I think of X-Blades.\n\nYou see, the game suffers from three big R's. Repetition, Recycling, and Redundancy. How so?\n\n\nRedundancy\n\nFor a start, you'll be spammed - SPAMMED, I tell you - with the same enemy type in one of the mind-numbingly short levels for minutes. You better have a durable thumb (or forefinger, depending on wether you play this with a controller or keyboard and mouse), because you'll have to spam back attacks to control those monster hordes. And it's not really entertaining at all. This will go on for every single level. Even the boss battles. You'll be swarmed by mobs.\n\n\nRepetition\n\nIt's not bad enough that the level design is already redundant with the endless monster hordes. Oh no, it gets worse. Because every single level will be the same. Bit of running around, bit of smashing things, button mashing, next level. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. I last for about 2 or so levels per sitting. I just can't do much more because it's so incredibly badly made.\n\n\nRecycling\n\nOh dear. They did not. - Hell yes, they did.\nSee, it's not bad to use a level again at a later point in time, in maybe slightly altered form, to give the game a nice little looping back. But X-Blades takes it to a sadly very, very lazy extreme. See... you go through the whole dungeon twice. At day and at night. The exact. Same. Rooms. And you do the exact. Same. Thing. Again.\n\n\nFor a game which claims to be of the Hack and Slash genre, X-Blades does a terrible job at introducing something which makes it stand out in the genre. The claims of the reviews that X-Blades is anywhere near as good as DMC is preposterous, even ridiculous. You better check out Metacritic first, and maybe a gameplay video on Youtube. Also, you should probably search for something superior to this.\n\nEven if the game is a bit over 5 years old, this is no excuse at being so utterly terrible. 2009 brought us Overlord II, Dragon Age Origins, and Batman Arkham Asylum.\n\nThink about this.\n\nTHINK ABOUT IT.\n\nAnd keep your hands away from X-Blades.\n\n\n\nOh, in a slightly belated addition: I didn't talk about the gameplay, story, and any of that, did I now? Well. If any of it had been good, I miiiight have forgiven the triple-R offense of the game. But sadly, nothing noteworthy of a story to be found here.\n\nThe gameplay and controls feel stiff and rather ininspired. I played with an X-Box 360 Controller for Windows, and, bad as that is, I sometimes didn't notice the controller had lost power and disconnected from the receiver. It took me several seconds to even bother to check the controller at times, since X-Blades's controls have the tendency to feel a little sticky, at least to me.\n\nNext, I'd like to talk about the music briefly. Sadly, the tracks are repetitive, and the in-game music was much too loud for my taste. I had to reduce it to near silence to be able to enjoy the music even remotely. That being said, it was most of the times highly unfitting for the current mood of the game, or at least what I perceived to actually be the intended mood. A tense moment was completely shot to pieces by much too heavy and fast-paced rock music (double offense for the track being the bad, generic kind), and the rest of the time, the music wasn't really adding anything for me. In fact, it felt more like background noise of the obnoxious kind.\n\nTiny little excourse to the voice-acting - there actually is some in the game! For some reason, even though I selected English as language, the voice-acting was in German... and... meh. MEH. Sorry, but it really, really destroyed the game even more. The voices didn't fit, they sounded uninspired, and the bickering back and forth between Ayumi and the dark wolf boss thingy was painfully childish and immature. Unnecessary, in other words.\n\nOh, right, the story. To be honest, since I don't plan on finishing the game (yeah... there's only so much mind-numbing stupidity I can deal with), I have nooo idea what the story is about. And even as I read up on it, it seems like it is all over the place. Something of an artifact, someone being possessed, getting repossessed, un-possessed... whatever. I have no idea. I really don't.\n\nMaybe I should also add something about the character design. Good? Good. Or rather, bad. See, there are sexy heroines in tight, short outfits, and then there's Ayumi. I actually felt horribly uncomfortable with her. She looks much too young to wear little more than straps passing as an excuse for clothes. I don't view her as sexy. She has some adorable about her, and that makes things really awkward really fast. Add to that the uninspired childish bickering mentioned in the voice-acting paragraph of the review, and it gets really, really, REALLY awkward and weird.\n\n\nSo, with that added to the already terribly done R's... nope. Not looking any good here, X-Blades. I'm going to play Alice: Madness Returns next, to have some really good Hack and Slash.","February 24, 2015","false","2.5"," 53 of 87 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","53","87","5","0"

Then I play it anyway and wonder why I didn't listen to myself.\n\nIf you're really into button mashing, have I got the game for you. This game is all about slamming on the attack button against fodder enemies (combos are for wimps) until your rage (read: mana) meter is filled up enough to use the earthquake ability you unlock during the tutorial to kill them all and then use whatever rage you have left after that to spam whatever other ability the boss you're fighting is weak to. Of course, they have so much health that it'll still take several minutes, but you also have just as much, and they telegraph their attacks so much that it's impossible to die unless you walk away from the computer. The only time that pattern was not repeated before I stopped playing was in an area without a boss, and then it was just button mash to kill lots of enemies without a boss instead.\n\nIt's like they realized they'd made a game that was only 90 minutes long and kind of sucked (yes, other stuff sucks, like the lockon picking the wrong thing most of the time, the camera being a little flaky, every single animation in the air being totally wonky and waaaaaay too slow/floaty, including jumping and the earthquake attack you'll be constantly using, frightening amounts of lens flare/bloom...), so they added an extra zero to the end of the health of everything. There are absolutely much worse games out there, but there aren't a lot of games that feel more tedious.\n\nIf you really want to run around with no pants on, take your pants off right now. You have my permission. No matter where you are and no matter what happens, it'll be more fun than the game.","January 26, 2014","false","11.8"," 66 of 111 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","66","111","5","0"

And then start killing even more monsters and defeating a lots of bosses.\n\nOne thing what I don't like on this game are monsters. You are actually fighting the same monsters over and over again and rarely you will be able to fight a new monster. Yes and this jumping... When game thinks you are stuck, you will start jumping and it always thinks that you are stuck when you need to get out from a corner, but you won't be able because you will start jumping and fireballs will start knocking you down again and again.\n\nHowever bosses that's something else. Some bosses are completely ressistant to some magic element, others spawns annoying monsters over and over again and the last ones uses these monster to make themselves immortal. And that's what makes this game challenging.\n\nYes and there are two ending so do your decisions very carefully if you want to get a good ending.","August 19, 2015","true","9.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

Let's see here.\n\nGameplay: 8/10. I enjoyed the combat a lot, combining a couple of skills together to create awesome results against large hordes of enemies was probably the best aspect of the game. The movement with a mouse and keyboard was very fluid and easy to control for me, but I had to take motion blur off in the graphic settings because that really hurt my head and eyes after a while. The game ran perfectly on my poor laptop, so I guess specs aren't to worry about at all. One more thing; grinding got a little boring later on in the game, but it was nothing I didn't want to do.\n\nMusic: 0/10. Muted.\n\nAesthetics: 8/10. Looked pretty nice, even on lowest graphics, and the player character had hardly any clothes on. Could have done with a few more enemies though, got pretty tired of seeing the same few faces.\n\nStory: 3/10. (Spoiler warning) In short; Ayumi, the main character, heads out to some ruins she'd be searching for for a while. It just throws you straight into that, which takes away a lot of potential for some decent plot. After touching some darkness ball in the ruins, you get a curse. Later, you get rid of the curse from some light ball. The final boss fight is against a possessed version of some dude you meet a few times (5 times isn't a bad estimate) and when you kill him, it plays some dramatic scene where Ayumi cries and says stuff like 'wish I did not have to do this blah blah' and it's laughably bad.\n\nProbably worth playing for a couple of hours.","October 5, 2014","true","2.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Aumi looks out of place. She's a tomb raider straight out of a Japanese anime with a clueless bubblegum personality that its difficult to get behind. Which is a funny thing to say considering its her ♥♥♥ you'll be looking at for 99% of the game. Its just out there... always.\n\nThe core of this game is combat with bad controls. You have your typical run, jump, guns, slash and magic to combat hordes of enemies. You get a rage meter that fills up so you can use magic and you get a lock on system that has difficulty locking on. The camera is pretty poor cumbersome and I'd prefer if it followed you instead of being required to swing it around everywhere you go. The protagonist Aumi can run at incredible speeds, but when she jumps she virtually stops and just jumps straight up. But there is a nifty double jump that seems useless when coupled with the poor camera.\n\nThe enemies are excessive, the boss fights are just hordes of enemies with no end in sight. Each boss has an energy bar made of steel. The game really boils down to slash until you're surrounded by enemies. You've done so much slashing that its time to use earthquake to kill everything around you. Rinse and repeat. Sure there are some enemies that require specific magic or skills to kill, but its just not enough compared to enemy swarms.\n\nThe game feels rushed, but I think the game devs know that you've done this all before with better games, so they flood you with it. Please skip this game, there are better games out there like Devil May Cry. Hopefully they'll perfect the combat and controls and come back with a better game.","July 30, 2013","false","1.5"," 46 of 81 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","46","81","0","2"

I love the sword/pistol weapons and how you can switch between them on the go.\nOnly negative thing I would have to say about this game is some times the enemies glitch and you cannot target them. However, after a few seconds, it seems fine. I have had no problems with this game.\nSummaryGot this for free, would pay $8 for it and gladly $0.99.\n8/10 Very fun game","October 20, 2015","true","4.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LATABOM/recommended/7510/","LATABOM","LandoCalrisian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LATABOM/","838 products in account","This is a poorly designed, shallow game.\n\nThere is a "good" and "bad" ending, but the deciding point happens about 6 minutes into the game and is never explained. If you learn "dark" magic - which is introduced early on, requires very few xp, and is NOT introduced next to "light" magic, you are locked into the "bad" ending which is basically a game over screen after you finish the game, even if you never actually use said magic. Really really really stupid design.\n\nThe fighting is pure button mashing. Enemies have zero AI, they just run at you, stop and attack. Certain enemies can only be killed by certain magic, but nothing requires any sort of skill or strategy. Once you get rapid fire pistols and an AOE spell, all combat is stupidly easy and mindless.\n\nAll fights are extremely long and boring, either due to bosses with extremely long health bars or because each wave of enemies involves killing literally hundreds of them, over and over.\n\nGraphics are reasonably good, but environments are very repetitive.\n\nVoice acting is repetitive.\n\nThe main character is a very unlikeable, snide ♥♥♥♥♥ and the 2 other voiced characters have no discernable personalities.\n\nThe only memorable thing about this game is that the main character is wearing a thong.","June 2, 2014","false","8.7"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dark-Darker-Yet-Darker/recommended/7510/","Dark-Darker-Yet-Darker","Mr. Binch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dark-Darker-Yet-Darker/","226 products in account","Oh my god. Where do I even begin.\n\nA brief explanation of the plot/overview of this game, I guess (might be inaccurate since I gave up less than an hour after playing):\n\nThis is a hack-and-slash game where a greedy lone wolf treasure hunter ignores the advice of an ancient temple guardian, touches a magic object (that she was directly informed by said guardian that the power within the object is completely fatal to humans; by the way, she is, in fact, a human, so she is no exclusion to this reality), and gets the ♥♥♥♥ cursed out of her.\n\nAlright, onto the specifics.\n\nThis game tries to be fast-paced and cool with a sexy heroine main character to keep people interested (i.e. the half-dressed protagonist that has jello for breasts that will dramatically move around even if you are just walking, and whose ♥♥♥ is always hanging out in hopes that you stay focused on that as often as possible; I was able to ignore both things and focus on the absolute terror that was the gameplay since I have no interest in either of those subjects [laughs in aseuxal]), but in reality, this game is just a wildly unpleasant experience all around.\n\nThe movement controls are disorienting as ♥♥♥♥. Your default movement speed is "a desperate sprint for your life." If you jump too close to a ledge, Ayumi will abruptly roll forward instead of doing the logical thing and jumping up. The double jumping is also commonly unresponsive.\n\nThe melee combat is standard at best. It controls like a hack-and-slash game. Run up to common enemies, and spam a button at everyone until they stop moving. That much is at least correct.\n\nThe gun combat is honestly funny as ♥♥♥♥. If you are locked onto an enemy, Ayumi will not miss a single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shot, even if they are all the way across the area from you. In the second level, I was practically in tears when I became a sentry gun and skipped enemies across the beach with my guns like a rock getting skipped over water. Ayumi being a sentient aimbot program is fairly useful, I guess.\n\nThe magic combat is okay. In order to use magic, you need to build up "rage" by either attacking enemies until you have enough rage to use a spell, or by holding down the key/button that your spell is bound to until her rage is charged up enough to use the attack. Since this game likes to fling large hordes of enemies in your direction at once, you typically have enough rage to last you the whole fight.\n\nThe combat interface as a whole is rather confusing. Nine times out of ten, I did not even know that I was getting hurt. Usually, in games with a health/damage feature, you know when you are getting attacked since your character will typically make a noise or flinch or something when harmed, or maybe the screen will flash red for a second or whatever. Ayumi does nothing if it is not a big enough attack to stagger her. I kept looking up at her health and getting surprised at how much I had lost without noticing anything.\n\nAyumi as a character made me want to stop playing before the opening cinematic for the first level even ended. She sounds like the "mean girl in high school," and she talks as if she is above everyone else. For example, in her very first sentence, she outright states that she is "the best treasure hunter ever." That opinion is open to a staggering amount of debate, have some ♥♥♥♥ing humility. Later on, when the aforementioned temple guardian warns her that the object that she is trying to steal will straight-up kill her and tells her to leave while she still can (without trying to harm her, by the way; he was literally going to just let her turn around and walk out of the temple unharmed and without a fight), her reaction was to flip her hair, roll her eyes, adamantly state "yeah right," try to steal the object anyway while the guardian was not looking at her, and then get cursed like a dumbass since she thought that grabbing an object that is "fatal to humans" was a bright idea. For the "best treasure hunter in the world," she sure does make some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thoughtless decisions. I am almost completely certain that all of her previous heists up to that point were from children that were holding a coin that they found on the ground.\n\nOn a related note to Ayumi, the physics in this game are abysmal. I am not talking about her earthquake jello breasts again, either. I am talking about her three ponytails. I have never seen hair move that erratically in my whole life. In every cutscene or moment of gameplay where she was moving around too fast, her ponytails went ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They looked like the tentacles of the Kraken emerging from the waters and searching for a ship full of sailors to pull into the depths of the sea. This was a game for the Xbox 360 and PS3, too. Those consoles had pretty good graphic capabilities for their time. I am not forgiving this one. If her hair was that unstable, they should have changed it to something more usable.\n\nThis game, at the time of writing this review, is on sale for $10. That is the normal retail price. But, from what I have experienced, this game certainly is not even remotely worth that much money. If you seriously want to buy the game that badly, please wait for the price to drop hard first.\n\n((I got this game for free from Bundle Stars as a Christmas "gift." I am almost completely certain that they no longer want me to be a customer of theirs.))","December 25, 2015","false","0.6"," 29 of 52 people (56%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","56","29","52","14","1"

Aside from the characters and the objects the game’s graphics are stellar. For example, the environmental and water effects, the light hitting your weapons from the sunshine, etc. This makes the game very eye catching.\n\nMy introduction to the game didn’t start well because it seems that the developers were very concerned about security and selling their products which means that you have to input a security key when you first start the game and register. This is a little unnecessary for a single player game.\n\nThe game does support ten languages which I was not expecting. There isn’t much that you can tweak in the video settings. You are given the preset settings. However, you can play in windowed mode but not borderless.\n\nThe game is full of RPG elements, there are hidden items to collect and soul drops from the AI to help you power up your character with a number of different types of abilities.\n\nPROS:Graphics – (they are definitely eye catching which makes the game more enjoyable)\n\nVariety – (there is a lot of variety where the player can power up their character, spells, elements and more)\n\nMusic – (the game has a sizeable soundtrack which sometimes fits the themes and makes the gameplay feel more atmospheric and tense)\n\nGamepad support – (the game is built and meant to be played with a controller even in the options you can see that it actually uses all of the controller definitions)\n\nCharacter – (the main character you are playing is a scantily clad woman so some of you may find this to be advantageous)\nCONS:Hitbox – (sometimes even if you can clearly see the weapon slice through an enemy the hit might not register)\n\nAuto-target – (the game automatically suggests enemies and directs you towards them. You may find this helpful but most of the time it targets someone who is not in your line of sight and most of the time is behind a wall or almost at the end of a map)\n\nBoss fights – (long and tedious with super-sized health bars for no reason. The battle doesn’t shift in difficulty and the strategy is repetitive)\n\nCutscenes – (The cutscenes are terrible quality and don’t match the quality of the graphics throughout the gameplay)\n\nNo indicators – (you cannot see how much damage you do with your attacks or spells and you cannot see how much damage you get hit for)\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified[www.steamified.com] Community Reviews.

Battle does not seem to shift in difficulty, you just keep repeating the same strategy.\n- No motivation to complete the story objective. Even the game turned the "artifact" into ♥♥♥♥ as soon as I grabbed it, literaly.\n- Cutscenes appear immeditaly when you complete an objective, meaning if you were bashing buttons on enemies or a boss then you will definitaly skip it by mistake.\n- Jumping is stiff and landing or colliding is glitchy.\n- Her backside did not attract me enough to sit throught the second level.\n\nVerdictThis is a below the average game in term of story and production value. I made it into the 3rd level I suppose (the one after the 1st boss battle) and I was kept attacking endless spawn of 2 enemy types; a crab-like creature and big bugs. It was really boring because crab creatures were un-hit-able with my sword since they were smaller than me. Then when I killed all the crabs, the big bugs were spawinging each time I kill one, making it really a long tiresome task. Then my character died because I had no idea the bugs were able to hit me (it didnt seem I was being hit nor any indicator on screen flashed to let me know I was being hit). I closed the game because I did not want to repeat that process AGAIN. I probably won't finish this game ever.","January 28","false","0.9"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

Shesh, what did I expect for $1.99? (on sale)  This is a standard hack and slash game.  If you want to mash buttons like mad, cast explosive spells, and senselessly slaughter stuff, then buy it, unless you got kids who will be damaged by semi-nude, thong wearing, nigh-invulnerable heroines (I'm surprised programmers didn't give her kick ♥♥♥ high heels too).  Note, you will need to refer to walk-through, there are many instances where I forgot what type of damage was needed to kill a mob (Bestiary in game was good too, but walk-though mentioned artifact positions, or which mob I needed to focus on to make the encounter meter proceed).  You can seriously spend an hour doing a battle, only to find you just needed to cast a spell 4 times on a mob that was teleporting away instead of dying like I presumed it was.  A spell that you did not learn/purchase yet.  At least you grind for souls to purchase spells, and indeed by end you are getting a couple million or so per battle.  Also if you miss an important artifact you can always go back and do the same battle again, while searching the area for what you missed.\n\nAll in all, this game was another pleasant surprise.

The game apparently has a 3rd-party DRM, so there's a good chance that you may end up running out of activations sometime in the future & find the game completely useless unless you repurchase the game (on Steam, I assume that would mean having to make a new Steam account). Had I have known that, I probably wouldn't have gotten it. When it does come to the point that I am no longer able to play it because of the DRM, I am going to contact the publishers to see if something can be done about it. If it turns out that they are unwilling to do anything about it, then I will effectively boycott their company & anything they release in the future.

What I loved so much in Blades of time was the gloriously fun and intuitive combat but this game has rubbish, awkward combat with clunky fighting animations and difficult button sequences for special moves. The level design is disappointing, in each area then have to kill waves of enemies till it unlocks the door to the next area. To make some boss fights more difficult they are invulnerable to all but one arbitrary colour of magic. Of the reviews I have seen this game is heavily slated but it is not that bad. Don't get me wrong this is not a good game but it isn't as terrible as most of the reviews suggest, there is still some fun to be had here. If you are contemplating this game I'd get advocate getting Blades of Time instead it is massively better than this.

The combat is very simple, you just smash that attack button, and things die. And just because it wouldn't be fun to just slash everything down, the game throws literally a hundred flying creatures at you, that you simply have to "shoot" with your miserable guns, while strafing and browsing reddit on your second monitor or something.\nOh and each time you use a proper spell, everything stops and you get to watch the same freaking cutscene, boss fights at best are 50% of watching the same spell cutscene, 40% hacking stuff up for rage to use it, 10% getting hit by something and waiting for your great agile heroine to recover from the nudge.\n\nThe combat is so bad that it makes me want to cry, there's no story to speak of, the voice acting is horrible imo, and plaftorming/puzzles = jumping over spikes in a small room that just go around in the same pattern for 5 minutes.

The character's main combo is not really a combo, she just waves the same two moves over and over with no movement penalties, the guns feel like peashooters and the enemies simply swarm far past the point of where the battles could be considered entertaining.\n\nIn a market where the Devil May Cry series and more modern games like Metal Gear Rising exist, this is a rather hollow and bland experience.

Doing simple platforming feels like a chore.\nI felt like I was constantly mashing the attack button with no real diversity.\nThere are special abilities but are only useful when being mobbed.\nTransition to a new area, button mashing, transition to another area, button mashing.\nRinse and repeat for pretty much the entire game.\n\nI would give this title 2.5/5 stars\nNot terrible, but not great\n\nI bought it on sale.

The main character is a unlikeable ♥♥♥♥ing prick, willing to let all of earth die because "she can handle herself" and then procides to ♥♥♥♥ everything up. Her voice will get to you, causing you to either mute the game or turn it off. Now the controls are simple, smash the left mouse button and maybe press E on a boss, the guns are completely useless unless you want to spend 13 years shooting the smallest thing. boss fights are the worst ive seen in a while, its you fighting waves of the same people from the game you have already fought before, while you run and try to hit them with a fireball. the bosses are simple and not worth the effort. The only redeeming part about this game is it makes for decent porn when you have nothing else as all the female has to were is a g-string, bra, and assless/crotchless pants. Even when running this game at low (and i can run it on max) there are framerate issues, and graphical bugs, randomly becoming invisible or falling through the floor, once you look past all the glaring problems with this game you find just a mess as well, its a undercooked, copy paste version of devil may cry except devil may cry is actually fun! There are some small positives with this game, such as the porn thats bundled when you take awkward creepshots with the camera angle, the music at first was not bad, and i like the level design, but every problem i see with these games just throws those positives out the window. ♥♥♥♥ you green man gaming for giving me a discount on this game.","May 30","false","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

That's the level. No explanation, just, fight stuff. Yay.\n-Special attacks can be activated using a rage meter that builds up, flying and tiny enemies cannot be hurt by your sword, which means you cannot generate precious rage, which means you have to stand and shoot them for uncomfortable amount of time with nothing really exciting happening, just begging for those enemies to die already.\n\nI want to add some more - on top of what I said, there is no combo system, the combat is dull and boring, unlockables seem like copies of eachother with no unique aspect to them, and the sound is also lacking and unsatisfying.\n\nDid I mention the protagonist is bland as toilet paper fan service?\n\nIn short, I feel ripped-off, and the sad thing is, I got this game for free.

The combat is some of the most light feeling and generic that I have ever seen.\n“As a fan of the Devil May Cry series, you will love X-Blades.” 80 – GameRadio. I honestly think they were very, very stoned to have said this. Yea, Devil May Cry games, particularly the newest one, are awesome. This game is so generic and bad that it is a slap in the face to DMC to mention it in the same sentence.\n“X-Blades is an absolutely solid hack 'n slay game that can compete with major titles of the genre.” 84 – NexNow. Again, they must have been really high because everything is way better when you are stoned. To call this a solid game would suggest that whoever wrote that has never played any other game in their life because this game is very, very generic, bland and boring and just not well made at all. All you do is mash the attack button and use the same couple skills over and over again. To say that it competes with major titles in the genre, well it made me laugh. What it should say is “X-Blades is an absolutely HORRIBLE hack 'n slay game that can compete with major titles of the genre when hell freezes over.”\n\nAll you do is spam the same skills over and over and over again and mash the attack button four thousand times a minute. The graphics are really bad but oddly enough the art direction of cutscenes is good. I stuck it out for as long as I could which was about one and a half hours. I thought the combat couldn't get any more generic but on the boss fights the only way to dmg them is with skills. Boss fights last an incredibly long time because you just have to spam your skills which do barely any dmg to a boss until he dies. This game is so generic it feels like some college kids got together and made it for a school project. F--k this crappy, mind-blowingly generic game.\n\n3/10. If you think this deserves over a 4/10 you should be hung.

It just lacks polish...\n\nThe main character is an idiot. The storyline so far is literally (and this is in the first few minutes, so it's no a spoiler, per se):\nShe's a treasure hunter. She wants a special treasure.\nShe finds it, and is told by the guardian of the treasure... Do NOT touch it, it's deadly and dangerous.\nShe tells him that she can handle herself and grabs it anyway, causing whatever type of mayhem that I haven't really seen yet.\n\nThe levels are fairly large and have hidden items to find in them... after you defeat your enemies, because during the fight you really have to focus.\nUnfortunately, the levels are poorly designed and the only benefit of a large level is that they can hide items. The battles usually take place in a very small space where button mashing is your best bet.\n\nThe fighting system itself has nice controls (using an Xbox controller) but the fights themselves are spamming attack until you can use a skill or if you're in one of the bullcrap fights. Shooting your guns (which offers no "Rage" [used for skills]) which means you have to take damage in order to use your skills. The alternative is to use the very underpowered guns and try to kill everything.\n\nThe boss battles aren't challenging and just drag on. Luckily, when I saw the giant crab-like boss, I was curious. So, I opened my bestiary.\nIt gives details about his weaknesses and strengths. But no where does the game tell you to look at it, or offer a tip stating that the bestiary can help. Even with knowing his weaknesses, the battle still dragged on to become tedious instead of fun.\n\n----\n\nSo, overall... tedious battles with poorly designed levels and a main character that I want to punch in the face.\nidk if the story is good yet... being that the rest of the design is poor, I doubt the story gets any better.","October 18, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/link68759/recommended/7510/","link68759","Link Satonaka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/link68759/","429 products in account","Pretty bad through and through.\n\nX-Blades starts looking bad right from the cover art - a near naked girl with what looks like a metal thong resting in an incredibly peculiar way on her buns. But hey, Blades of Time (the sequel which I played before this) had the same problem, yet surprised me with some really good ideas, so I gave X-Blades the benefit of the doubt and played all the way through. Spoiler: there's _nothing_ redeeming about this game.\n\nI've never heard more laughable voice acting, but chances are you won't have to hear it because voices generally couldn't be heard over the game's other sounds. Complete subtitle de-synchronization is the cherry on top. It's for the best really because the "banter" is cringe-worthy and you'd probably rather just have it on mute. Luckily, they don't repeat lines very often.\n\n-Story-\nThe story... watch the second opening cut-scene and just listen to Ayumi's monolog. Now imagine 9 hours more of that intensity of bad. It never gets as high as mediocre- it stays firmly at that concentration of terrible. They try to give Ayumi a character arc- she's a no nonsense self reliant gal and she don't need no ones help! Oh no, she fell into a basic trap! Luckily there's a man nearby to save her. Then.... I just finished the game and I don't remember exactly how the plot unfolds- it's really a mess. He runs off after saving her, they both meet up two other times by coincidence to fight another guy. Worth noting that no one has any given motivation whatsoever. Ayumi wants some treasure but that didn't work out by the third cut-scene, so what follows is Ayumi wandering around aimlessly until the three characters meet up and fight, apparently for lack of anything better to do. Blah blah blah the guy who saved Ayumi from the trap (with whom she has spent a total of 5 minutes with) is possessed by evil powers and she is forced to fight him. You'd think he was her long lost lover by the way she acts when confronting him. The whole plot is really disjointed and Ayumi's character arc advances abruptly and with apparent reason, creating a really confusing and inconsistent personality.\n\n-Game play-\nFor the first few hours of the game you basically have only three powers, and they're "dark". Dark is bad and Ayumi trades them for light powers at some point in an incredibly confusing cutscene. There are two endings in the game, and you get the "evil" end if you've upgraded any of the dark powers. So... if you ever used the upgrade system at any point 4 hours into the game, you'll be getting the evil end. And there was no indication of this. OK, I'm not actually opposed to the idea of this mechanic, but I'm not replaying the 9 hours it took me to finish this game just for an equally terrible "good" ending (which I looked up on YouTube). Spoiler alert- in the evil end you're unable to kill the guy without killing him for real and Ayumi is very very sad about this as evidenced by a cut-scene showing her being very sad. Yay character development. It's a fitting end for her character arc.\n\nSo you don't care about story and just want to watch the boob jiggle physics while killing things? This game almost delivers on that. Almost. I'm of the opinion that the fact it is a crappy console port kicks it out of "meh time-killer" to "don't waste your time".\nBrief overview; initially the combat is repetitive, but you gain powers and abilities as the game goes on. I played the hardest difficulty, which required a modest amount of grinding, nothing to complain about. I actually wanted to grind to unlock more powers, because they were somewhat interesting and alleviated the repetitiveness and could be chained together in ways indicative of some intelligent game design. Occasionally you could not proceed without a particular power, so you'll have to run to previous rooms, fighting re-spawned enemies to collect enough souls to purchase a power. You'll never know which power you'll need though as winning these rooms is part puzzle, part trial and error, so if you don't like grinding, guess correctly when purchasing. There was also a system by which you get a multiplier for long combos, which provided some artificial difficulty and much needed mental stimulation for me.\n\nSounds decent so far, right? A large set of powers, incentive to buy and use them, some puzzles that require stringing a few of these powers together, and a multiplier system for self imposed challenges when the game gets a bit too easy. However, it just isn't fun for one reason: crappy console port. There are something like 25 unlock-able powers, and you can only use 4 at a time. Picture this: clicking through mouse driven menus three levels deep in order to shuffle 25 powers around the 4 slots. Any flow this game might have had is just -lost-. You map powers to what would be the d-pad. If they had just let PC users map each power to say, any given key on the keyboard, or had some sort of quick switch menu, this game could have been decent on game play alone. I suspect the people who are giving this game mildly good reviews also enjoy using some ancient version of MS excel- these menus are mouse driven only, no keyboard shortcuts. I considered automating the switching of powers with macros (program a key to automatically click around the menu as fast as they appear), but I never got around to it before reaching the end of the game.\n\n-tl;dr-\nThere's nothing worth experiencing here- but the sequel, Blades of Time (for which I have also written a review) , is vastly improved by comparison. It's just a better version of this game. If you're at all interested in X-Blades for some reason, know that there's nothing to see here- Blades of Time is mechanically similar and isn't a complete waste of time.\nUpdate: The above said, I have the strangest desire to go back to this game. The experience was sub par at the time, but it certainly leaves a good memory.\n\nEdit- I forgot to mention that the combat upgrades are odd. There's a combination of poor instructions, awkward controls / weird timing, and poor visual feedback so that you couldn't tell if you were doing the new unlocked combo at all. In the beginning I would frequently stop and examine Ayumi's attack animations: "Is that different than normal? I think maybe she did something different here..." ... I eventually stopped trying to figure it out. When I could actually, without a doubt, see a move distinctly different from the usual flailing swords, it was always clunky and something you'd never actually want to use in the heat of the moment. Pity too- the dodge/jump thing could have been good. Speaking of that, an example of the how poor the instructions are: I had to minimize the game and look on gamefaqs to learn how to do it, as the game wouldn't let me continue without it. The game literally forced me to jump under falling blades- if I tried using my teleporting power I would appear on the other side of the blade dead. And IIRC dodge/jump never comes up again, so at the end of the day we have a hard to trigger, improperly explained move that is brought up exactly once but you can't continue playing until you've proved you can do it.","April 11, 2014","false","13.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The combat's not very interesting, boss fights are mainly "use this specific blast and only this specific blast" but sometimes throw in a few annoying tasks before you can hurt them.  After you play through the levels, it makes you play through them again with some slight changes.  You can unlock an alternate costume about halfway through the game which looks a ton better than the default at which point the game slightly improves.  The story is weak, the ending doesn't make sense, the main character is annoying, and so is the music.","June 26, 2014","false","6.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

With graphics befitting a 2008 Unity game that even thongs and jiggle physics can't save, and controls worse than a fever dream, X-blades is an entirely unrewarding experience.\n\nYour adversaries are either ripped apart like the tissue paper in a sports bar urinal or take an unneccesary number of swings to kill. Jumping is clunky and aerial combat is near impossible. When faced with numerous mobs, they suffer little to no knockback, meaning that if in your bored tyrade of 'click repeatedly to use sword on mans' you start to take damage, you stagger and your health can be depleted fairly rapidly. There is an illusion of variety in combat, but it ultimately boils down to clicking on everything repeatedly until it stops moving,  and if your blades don't kill it, shoot it or throw fireballs at it until it dies.\n\nX-Blades also opens with cinematics - albeit in an entirely different art style - but then ends abruptly when you are transitioned from stage to stage with no advancing in the "storyline" or any idea what your purpose is for being there.\n\nAlthough not as polished as similar titles like God of War or Devil May Cry, this games spiritual successor "Blades of Time" is all around a better experience.\n\nSave your dollar and buy a Snickers or something.","January 9, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Because of this it takes forever to progess what little story there is.\nAnd lastly the game punishes you for unlocking every ability in the game by locking you out of the good ending.\n\nOverall I'd say it's not worth buying.","November 1, 2015","false","13.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The only variation in the gameplay is that various bosses have different strategies and puzzle-like solutions.  Otherwise, try to imagine a horde mode dynasty warriors.  No objectives to capture, no events, nothing, just endless mooks, and a boss every so often.  That's basically what this game is like, with a little bit of a cheesy story break every so often.\n\nIt shows up in bundles frequently for $1 or less.\n\nI can't recommend the game in good faith, but if you can find it in a bundle, I don't think trying it out for a bit will cause you any harm.  You might like the game.

When using a game pad it's not that bad, but the keyboard/mouse controls are a mess\n\nFINAL THOUGHTThis game makes me wish that Steam would add a neutral button for reviews. It's not a bad game, just poorly executed. I really wanted to like this game a lot, but it's got so many flaws and problems with it that it's very hard for me  to recommend this game to anyone.\n\nIf you really want to play this game and won't take my word for it, then I recommend waiting until this game goes on sale, or if you get a free key for it. You will either enjoy this game, or see it as a boring Devil May Cry wannabe with a scantily clad female protagonist.","January 25","false","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The only variation in the gameplay is that various bosses have different strategies and puzzle-like solutions.  Otherwise, try to imagine a horde mode dynasty warriors.  No objectives to capture, no events, nothing, just endless mooks, and a boss every so often.  That's basically what this game is like, with a little bit of a cheesy story break every so often.\n\nIt shows up in bundles frequently for $1 or less.\n\nI can't recommend the game in good faith, but if you can find it in a bundle, I don't think trying it out for a bit will cause you any harm.  You might like the game.  Opinions and all.\n\nBlades of Time, the Spiritual Successor to this game, is better in every possible way.","December 18, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think it was just under a half hour, but what an impression it made so quickly. The jumping alone was frustrating early on. For some reason, holding space when jumping disabled double jumping, and you apparently can't double jump any time you perform any sort of action. Maybe something just wasn't working right, but that started me off with a frown. Attacking/ shooting while falling and landing in combat felt pretty clunky in general too, and the biggest reason I put a game down immediately is clunky basic controls that will be prominent for the entire game.\n\nHaving played each Devil May Cry, I was excited when this was compared to it. The 2 basic melee attacks with 0 actual combo diversity was a terrible smack in the face really fast. Maybe you unlock them later on, but I'll never know. It didn't feel like I was really hitting enemies either, and the animations made it feel as if I were just flailing my arms in various directions trying to hit whatever is around me. The ground pound ability that I bought had a 2 second wind up every single time which got old fast.\n\ntldr: I didn't enjoy it, and I feel it's a mistake to relate this to Devil May Cry. If you want a good game that did what this wanted to do, go play Darksiders II. Maybe Blades of Time will be good.

The story presented starts as fairly similar to the Kill Bill the movie bar scene, but youre ovewhelm by scenes of pokemon monstrousityes that are inocently discused by an anime style when there trully grotesque.\nThe obvious sexual offencive content it present highlights with the total reveal of the protagonists behind. Even the intelect of the main character is equal to a uneducated girl teenager which suports the above statement of characterization.  The first boss is a hunk of a werewolf, and in litterature's most recent modern critisim even the Red Riding Hood story is revealed to have sexual conotations meaning the wolf in the story devours the girl and the grandma- you know what that devouring is refering to.\nHere in X-Blades the video game you have that element as well where the first boss is presented in the same michevous manner. Only in this case hes guarding a curse which by the  cartoon animation its a obvious ripoff and very similar to prince Ashitaka's curse from the movie Princess Mononoke from Gibly Studios.\nThe cammera control in this game is horible wich makes simple jumping on legdes very dificult, the combat is genderic and requires basic skills to master like spamming the left click for incredible sword twirl atacks being one of them, the shooting guns while in the air is obviously a similarity to Tomb Raider and Devil May Cry. And speakign of the devil as a mythological and religios presentation of evil - one of the characteristics of that character is to collect souls- wich the main protagosnt here also shares, since the curency for unlocking skills is gathering souls of slain enemies. Which futher encompases the goal to demonize women as devils and the above mentioned refferences. Which in my oppionion are insulting, offencive and obvious submessages and should be to anyone. Since women should be treated equal and not be a object of any unfair treatment- especially the treatment as a object wich this game promotes. Theres absolutely nothing inovative about X-Blades exept the level of groutesqueness that it presents on many levels.\n\n;-}\n","October 23, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They will always spawn in the same spots and if you're lucky, they might start spawning different enemies. I often wondered if I was doing something wrong at first because this seemed so tedious but that is the way it's supposed to be.\n\nCome to the first boss I keep hitting him over and over but nothing seems to be happening. Surprise! That bar is now the health bar, and yes it does take 5-10 minutes of doing the same exact thing to kill the boss.\n\nOccasionally, you will enter rooms that contain some form of a "puzzle." For example, there is one room where you are trapped and must avoid spikes that go in a pattern for about five horrible minutes (and again, I thought was doing something wrong BUT NO IT'S JUST THE WAY THE GAME IS).\n\nThere appears to be some barebones of a story but the voice acting and writing is just so awfully cringey that I could not manage to get through more than oen or two of the cutscenes.\n\nThe game looks okay graphically but the design of the main character is frankly just creepy.\n\nThe only saving grace is the soundtrack alone which is AWESOME.","October 24, 2015","false","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story presented starts as fairly similar to the Kill Bill the movie bar scene, but youre ovewhelm by scenes of pokemon monstrousityes that are inocently discused by an anime style when there trully grotesque.\nThe obvious sexual offencive content it present highlights with the total reveal of the protagonists behind. Even the intelect of the main character is equal to a uneducated girl teenager which suports the above statement of characterization.  The first boss is a hunk of a werewolf, and in litterature's most recent modern critisim even the Red Riding Hood story is revealed to have sexual conotations meaning the wolf in the story devours the girl and the grandma- you know what that devouring is refering to.\nHere in X-Blades the video game you have that element as well where the first boss is presented in the same michevous manner. Only in this case hes guarding a curse which by the  cartoon animation its a obvious ripoff and very similar to prince Ashitaka's curse from the movie Princess Mononoke from Gibly Studios.\nThe cammera control in this game is horible wich makes simple jumping on legdes very dificult, the combat is genderic and requires basic skills to master like spamming the left click for incredible sword twirl atacks being one of them, the shooting guns while in the air is obviously a similarity to Tomb Raider and Devil May Cry. And speakign of the devil as a mythological and religios presentation of evil - one of the characteristics of that character is to collect souls- wich the main protagosnt here also shares, since the curency for unlocking skills is gathering souls of slain enemies. Which futher encompases the goal to demonize women as devils and the above mentioned refferences. Which in my oppionion are insulting, offencive and obvious submessages and should be to anyone. Since women should be treated equal and not be a object of any unfair treatment- especially the treatment as a object wich this game promotes. Theres absolutely nothing inovative about X-Blades exept the level of groutesqueness that it presents on many levels.\n\n;-}\n","October 23, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They will always spawn in the same spots and if you're lucky, they might start spawning different enemies. I often wondered if I was doing something wrong at first because this seemed so tedious but that is the way it's supposed to be.\n\nCome to the first boss I keep hitting him over and over but nothing seems to be happening. Surprise! That bar is now the health bar, and yes it does take 5-10 minutes of doing the same exact thing to kill the boss.\n\nOccasionally, you will enter rooms that contain some form of a "puzzle." For example, there is one room where you are trapped and must avoid spikes that go in a pattern for about five horrible minutes (and again, I thought was doing something wrong BUT NO IT'S JUST THE WAY THE GAME IS).\n\nThere appears to be some barebones of a story but the voice acting and writing is just so awfully cringey that I could not manage to get through more than oen or two of the cutscenes.\n\nThe game looks okay graphically but the design of the main character is frankly just creepy.\n\nThe only saving grace is the soundtrack alone which is AWESOME.","October 24, 2015","false","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think it was just under a half hour, but what an impression it made so quickly. The jumping alone was frustrating early on. For some reason, holding space when jumping disabled double jumping, and you apparently can't double jump any time you perform any sort of action. Maybe something just wasn't working right, but that started me off with a frown. Attacking/ shooting while falling and landing in combat felt pretty clunky in general too, and the biggest reason I put a game down immediately is clunky basic controls that will be prominent for the entire game.\n\nHaving played each Devil May Cry, I was excited when this was compared to it. The 2 basic melee attacks with 0 actual combo diversity was a terrible smack in the face really fast. Maybe you unlock them later on, but I'll never know. It didn't feel like I was really hitting enemies either, and the animations made it feel as if I were just flailing my arms in various directions trying to hit whatever is around me. The ground pound ability that I bought had a 2 second wind up every single time which got old fast.\n\ntldr: I didn't enjoy it, and I feel it's a mistake to relate this to Devil May Cry. If you want a good game that did what this wanted to do, go play Darksiders II. Maybe Blades of Time will be good.

It can be floaty, but it actually has a lot of systems that make for it.\n\nFirst, the game is not really expensive, and you can also wait for a sale. This way you'll probably appreciate the game better. And this game is actually pretty nice, it is a hack and slash game with a nice lady as protagonist that really can kick ♥♥♥ (she has some swords and guns, so... you can associate that to some other protagonist). Even so, she actually stands for herself, since you can improve her in a lot of customizable ways as bullets for your guns, and magic powers like a fireball.\n\nThe game looks ok, it has some of those elements that make look nicer than it should, in some older games. The controls are simple and work well in the keyboard, it is not necessary to play with a gamepad.\n\nAs its flaws, the enemies, even the first ones, can look a bit hard to hit and take a bit to kill. The Targeting system works, but sometimes it doesn't, so it can be hard to hit that enemy. As the character has a wide range of attack, it almost serves the purpose of making for the flaws of the target, but it doesn't.\n\nAlso, the magic may take a while to charge, which is not really fun, even though you don't use mana.\n\nWell, you can buy this game, it has some good elements of fun and you can appreciate the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/recommended/7510/","Brogbo","DrBrogbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/","1650 products in account","Score - 48/100\nPersonal rating - Game-starved genre fans only need apply\nHad I played a demo - No purchase\n\n"You can't judge a book by its cover."\n\nFor most things in life, that old adage rings true. First appearances are most often not representative of something's value.\n\nWhen it comes to video games though, there are a decent number of things that can be almost instantly determined, and such was my experience with X-Blades.\n\nThe graphics are a strange dichotomy of fantastic and bad. The 3d modeling is acceptable, the animations are rather clunky, and the texture work and set-piece design are phenomenal enough to make you forget about it all. Until the cutscenes, anyway, which are SO low-resolution and SO compressed that you'll be looking for the Youtube quality button in the corner, trying to switch up from 360P. Thankfully, the game is extremely well-optimized, with my old desktop able to get framerates in low 100s at 1920x1200 with everything maxed (AA on 4x).\n\nSpeaking of graphics, I can't type up a review of this game without mentioning its most advertised asset. I have seen some ridiculous fan service before, and seen main characters in AAA games that I would have hidden from my mother as a kid, but this game's heroine, Ayumi, takes things to an entirely new level.\n\nHer outfit is so ridiculous that she is seemingly naked from more angles than not. Her hair covers more of her body than all her clothes combined. Her boots cover more of her body than the rest of her clothes combined. Hell, even one boot covers more. Her thong literally disappears into her impossibly-tall butt crack, and the camera is far enough back that should you play all the way through this game, you will be treated to a full moon for 8 straight hours. Her bra-esque top is by far the most sensible thing about her outfit, and if that doesn't just highlight the absurdity of it all, I don't know what would.\n\nYou know a game is pushing that envelope when the obligatory softcore-porn fanart pics come across as nothing but redundant. Don't get me wrong, I like a well-sculpted butt more than most, but this is getting ridiculous. I'm not lying when I say her outfit couldn't possibly be any skimpier unless it just consisted of strategically-placed k-tape and pasties.\n\nI am a sucker for good music in a game, and I'm happy to report this game satisfies. The driving soundtrack in this game is pretty great and more than once, I found myself nodding along happily while I slaughtered wave after wave of enemies. I even checked the game's data folder for MP3s so I could keep them (they're there, in .ogg). Even in just my short while with the game, however, I noticed themes being recycled, which is understandable yet unfortunate. In addition, the sounds are cheese-tastic. The voice acting is stretching to be considered B-quality, and all the other sounds are completely forgettable. While that in itself is not a problem, overall the game will not win any bonus points for audio.\n\nThis might all sound pretty decent so far, but the real meat of the matter, the gameplay, is bland at best. There is one attack (the X button), and several unlockable skills. No combos, no strong/heavy attacks, no aerial launches, and no strategy. Just X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, rage attack, X, X, X, X, X. It gets very repetitive very fast. While some people might not mind that kind of repetition, I don't think anyone would deny that a little bit of strategy would make the whole thing a lot more palatable.\n\nThis is especially true since character movement is so disjointed and... clunky, for lack of a better word. Ayumi tears around the levels at full sprint, but doing anything else just breaks her rhythm. Attacking slows her down and leaves her vulnerable just slightly longer than it should, there is no dodge button, and jumping is entirely useless. There are no valuable aerial attacks, and jumping actually slows Ayumi down, so if you're trying to leap out of danger, you will come back down in worse shape than you left. If all you're doing is touching the left analog stick, Ayumi's movement is incredibly smooth and fluid, but as soon as you touch any other button, the action gets choppy and frustrating.\n\nLevel design is rather lame as well. For the most part, each area just drops you in a little self-contained arena, where you will be spamming the X button over and over and over and over and over on little endlessly-respawning waves of weaklings until you earn enough rage (basically mana) to cast the one or two spells that can damage any applicable "boss" creatures. Repeat until he/she is dead, and move on to the next arena.\n\nGames of this genre are at their greatest when they set everything up for frantic high-speed slaughtering. This game introduces so many little quirks, niggles, and idiosyncracies that I just can't recommend it over any other similar game. I would suggest going and playing any of the Devil May Cry games, that new Metal Gear Rising game, or even this game's own spiritual successor Blades of Time (which is supposedly better in every way, and not a direct sequel).\n\nFor the vast majority of things, it is undeniably true that you can't judge a book by its cover, but when fundamental things such as character controls and basic gameplay mechanics frustrate me and nothing other than music impresses me, I'm perfectly confident in my decision to skip this one. Take this review with a grain of salt, of course, as it is always possible that I'm just not the target market at all, and so this game went entirely over my head. I've always found the concept of "fun" to be more or less universal, so I kind of doubt it, but whatever.","May 12, 2014","false","2.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","5"

Here you don't have different weapons to choose or set of move. You relay on two swords and guns which are useless (after upgrading the guns they start to become somewhat useful) and a lot of mashing buttons.\n\nAfter killing an enemy, you collect souls, which are the currency of the game, With them you can buy magic spells. You can equip four at any time. But they are almost the same!!! Lightning on sword, fire on sword, Earthquake or Fire Rage it doesn't matter.\n\nFrom time to time you see new skill is unlocked, you open the menu to check it and where is it? You have buy some of the available spells and then you see what is unlocked. But what if i don't want to? Well there is no choice. The spells are tight with the bosses, not all but still. For example, there is this werewolf looking boss (which i fought 3 times) For 20 min or more i didn't hurt him once, then out of frustration i open you tube. You have to buy a specific skill named Sparkling Sword to beat him. How can I know that?! There is no indication that you need it. This is the same thing for some of the other bosses. And the fights with them are too long.\n\nFor activating spell you need Rage. This is why you use the swords, other than that as i wrote they are useless, so most of the time you count on spell with area of effect, like Fire Rage. Later in the game the skills are quite expensive, so prepare for grinding. The difference between area of effect spells are the animation for each one. They take you out of the action and after that the camera is in weird angle.\n\nGames like this have some sort of move to avoid attacks. Here you can buy one, but it's not that useful and a lot of attacks become hard or impossible to avoid.\n\nGraphics are good, but the cutscenes are bad, they look worse than the in-game graphics. Level design is boring, just ruins and they are basically arenas. To move to the next area you have to kill all enemies on screen.\n\nThe music is okay, rock and metal tracks, probably you won't remember it. Same thing can be said about the story. You play as Ayumi, treasure hunter and she touch something and she is cursed. It's completely forgettable.\n\nI mentioned you don't have different set of moves. This isn't quite true. In the game you collect three types of artifacts. When you find enough, you gain more life or some moves for the swords or new skills for the guns (then they become somewhat useful). Let me buy them, I don't want look around just for upgrading my airstrike, which is useless!!!\n\nI can go on and on with the negativity. There is some pleasure in the mindless action, but it won't last long. I didn't expect AAA game, but me some bad design decisions ruin the potential of X-Blades. It's not the worst game i've ever played It's often on sale if you have some interest, but don't even bother.\n\nPros: nice visuals, okay soundtrack, some mindless action, responsive controls\n\nCons: boring level design, no debt to the combat, repetitive, some skills/spells are directly tight with the bosses and it's not at least hinted what you need to buy for them, annoying heroine, forgettable story","October 24, 2014","false","7.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I knew it had a female protagonist and was hack'n'slash. The gameplay isn't too bad and its fun to just run around and fight loads of enemies... but what really bugged me and took a lot fo the enjoyment out of it is how the main character was designed. She's wearing pretty much nothing and I wish that they had given her armour or clothes just so that you don't have to feel uneasy about how skeevy the actual outfit is.\n\ntl;dr: Aside from the obvious sexism in design, the story is cheesy but decent hack'n'slash. If not for the uneasy feeling I had about the outfit then I'd recommend this game a lot more.","September 17, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","2"

But it doesn't matter; the cons are just insurmountable.\n\nAlso, our little thong-wearing heroine, who has been desperately designed to be compared to the likes of Lara Croft and others, has miserably failed to garner attention, and is another deplorable character, just like her co-stars - Jay, Light, and Dark.\n\nSo, people ...

You smash the X button in hope of hitting anything, but some enemies just run away, can't be hit or are way too small to be hit. Every ♥♥♥♥ing move from bosses will stagger you CONSTANTLY, which is infuriating, specially when they have godlike homming fireballs that chase you even in reverse.\n-Bosses can't be hit by your swords, you'll have to kill them with magic, the problem is that bosses  have WAY TOO MUCH hp, and the only way to regain "mana" is to kill enemies around them, which are more annoying than the boss itself.\n-Dodging is USELESS. Doesn't respond correctly, doesn't do sh*t. You have to get the teleportation skill ASAP.\n-Enemies are dumb and infuriating, specially the small crabs. They make a mosh around you and don't let you move.\n-Character design is stupid. I can't take this game serious. The main character fights using a G-string, for christ sakes.\n-The story? I couldn't give a rat's a*ss to it. Just skipped every cutscene without thinking twice.\n\n... and I could go on.\nI got this game for free, and I shouldn't be complaining, but time is money, and what a waste of my time.\n\nI'll probably try it again in the future. I always give second chances, not that I intend to becoming a fan any time soon.\n\nUPDATE: This is it. This game just broke the record of most annoying enemies in a single game. Enemies that run away from you, are too small to get hit, fly away or fly to high so you can't hit them, enemies with stupid homing attacks that follow you even in reverse, enemies that pop out of nowhere and hit you whitout you even knowing, enemies that hide inside walls, bosses that take way too much damage to die, attacks that stagger you everytime. enemies that surround you and don't let you move.\n\nFor f*ck sakes. Why did I even insist?","January 12","false","4.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","5"

But after playing a couple of level I must say, this game is mostly crap. The Voice Acting is poorly made, the graphics are cartoony in the cutscences but overbright in the actual game (and there is no option to turn it off.) The Main Character is a girl with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clothes. The Story is boring and the Fighting system gets boring overtime too. I would of loved if the game had more to explore such as Tomb Raider or Uncharted. But this game is literally just for brainless fightning and staring at her ♥♥♥ or boobs. Which it seems the developers mainly focused on, instead of the actual gameplay and voice acting. This Game is just repeating the same boring bit over and over and over again. It doesn't even have any achievements! The Only Positive thing I found it has trading cards. I can't recommend this to anybody besides really sad people which love staring at an animes girls boobs / ♥♥♥ for hours and hours.","April 19, 2015","false","2.2"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","16"

I remember when this game came out on xbox360 and didn't really pay it any attention. Now that I have though.. I can safely say even 99 cents is too much for this game.\n\nThere is a hint of potential locked somewhere in this game, the gameplay shows some signs of life after the first few levels, when you can teleport and ground pound. I also found out that you can slow down time when attacking by holding the attack button slightly longer, which is interesting for sure. The gameplay is clunky though, and ultimately shallow. I would have enjoyed it more had they focused soley on making sword play more fun and dropped the guns entirely.\n\nEven if the gameplay has some redeeming values this is a game that shows that bad game design is still a thing. The "Game" part of this tragedy is horrible. It takes ideas from devil may cry and drains out the fun of them. Get ready to spend absurd amounts of time fighting a single enemy that keeps slowly respawning, watching some mystical life bar lower in the bottom right. Why? What does that life bar represent? The health bar of tedium? When it's full you are in for alot of tedium, so I guess it makes sense.\n\nThe animations are pretty bad, its hard to tell what your character is doing, and I could never tell when enemies were actually attacking me, they seem to just fidget around and somehow hurt you. There is no impact to anything you do ever, which again, makes the gameplay (which consists of you fighting endless "hordes" of enemies) even more painful.\n\nThe main character is completely unlikable, even her 'sexy' design is nonsensical, the storyline is useless crap consisting of "The Light" and you have to stop "The Dark", for ♥♥♥♥s sake. It's a cheap tomb raider/pandoras box story that doesn't really catch the players interest at any time.\n\nDon't buy this game, even for a dollar. It's got pretty lighting and okay graphics, but the gameplay is stilted, the characters are lifeless, and the story is barely cohesive.\n\nSave that dollar, buy a donut, you will enjoy that donut waaayyy more.","October 20, 2014","false","2.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Sometimes, your screen becomes totally white because of attacks and other light effects and it's blinding you.\nAnd finally, as I'm french, I tried the french version but the voices are horrible. Don't play this with french voices !\nAfter all that, if you're in to try it then get it on sale.\n\nAnd one last thing, if you're wondering why you have the Demo Version that stops right after the first boss, it's because you need to activate your game on the windows before the game starts.

It's hard to say no to a game for a dollar but normally it sells for a few dollars on steam.\n\nThe Good:  -  This game is not a bad ~concept~.   Cel shaded female anime character wielding two gun swords, who can shoot, slash, and cast spells you unlock with souls.  Character moves quickly like sonic the hedgehog, so think a quick moving sonic the hedgehog hack and slash that collects souls instead of rings... except the souls look like rings?  Not a terrible concept.  With pumped up metal music.\nThe Bad:     -  The graphics are not there.  This can be understandable in low budget first game. They are not downright terrible by any stretch of the imagination but with the high speed it makes me almost nauseus.  Feels like spawn rate is just too high / quick on monsters.\n-  The cut scenes keep going choppy on my computer.\nThe Ugly:    - The way you assign the spells and buy the spells to the menu, the system is just kind of clunky and not easy on the eyes.   I think some improvements here with color scheme, easy UI, would really really help this game.\n-  Why the music does this horrible garbled thing on my end I still fail to understand.  The music is generally fuzzy but it ups the level to a car radio in a tunnel during battles.\n-   Tiny menu button in the corner when you press tab for spell buying is the only way to close the game.  Ctrl-Alt-Delete caused it to just become angry and make it's static loopy metal track go insane on my computer. Do yourself a favor and don't try to kill this program it's one of those that can't be killed and just gets more angry.\n\nAs it stands now I wouldn't recommend it, but unlike some games on steam I wouldn't outright say it's a bad concept either.  The concept of a high paced anime hack and slash is really a great idea.","September 26, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've had enemies drop through the floor becoming invincible and impossible to kill, random deaths that just happen, and even positioning glitches that just up and throw me into the skybox allowing me to get to the exit with ease.

For some people, this may be a con, but not everyone has all the free time to spend as others do.\n\nAnother bit of a con is that her voice is rather annoying when she speaks; it doesn't quite match the character at all.\n\nIn the end though, I enjoyed the game. It's a nice slasher game and the music and visuals aren't half bad either. I would recommend though that you buy it on sale.\n\nSome useful tips though for new players:\n\n- There is a good and a bad ending which is influenced by your "decisions". What is not hinted at all is that there "decisions" are not conversation based choices but rather based on the Spells/Abilities that you choose to learn (broad hint, "bad" spells have a colour/description that is rather obvious in hindsight). So be warned, if you want the good ending, hold off a bit until you have the choice of the "good" magics. You'll know by the name. Try not to end up like me who reached almost halfway before realising this and had to start all over because I wanted the good ending.\n\n- Check your Beastiary often; it can be a huge help when countering some of the harder enemies.\n\n- You have to spend souls on upgrades and whilst you may feel to be cheap in your spending, don't worry, you'll have plenty extra by then end of the game, and those upgrades to Regeneration and Form Duration are well worth the cost.\n\n- And speaking of souls, you can also find them in breakable items, like statues and pots. And the items can also hide valuable upgrade parts/artifacts. So take the time to slash/shoot everything you can.\n\n- There is also an area where you get an outfit upgrade, but, if you like how she looks, you can choose to not take it....because it covers more, lol\n\n- The nice thing with dying is that you'll restart the level with all the enemies respawned but with all the souls and upgrades that you died with.\n\n- There was one item of note, a scroll that halved the cost of any item/upgrade. The bad part, well you don't have a choice of whether to use it or not, it is automatically used on your very next purchase. Lets say you've been saving it for that (otherwise very costly) upgrade/spell, and you're in a fight and need to heal, well guess what, if you buy a heal, then say goodbye scroll. So better to use it before a fight so you can make your best choice.\n\n- There are a few areas that involve jumping around. What can help is after you jump (or double jump) is to start shooting (or slashing). It slows down your descent and can help to extend the distance you cover while "falling". Really useful in some areas to get to hard to reach items or ledges. I recommend shooting over slashing however, as there is the chance that you do a special slash move that makes you move downwards....and maybe plummet to your death.\n\n- In her special forms, her movement and attack speed increases, so make good use of it in those harder levels. I also noticed that her Rage (i.e. mana) may have taken longer to deplete when using abilities.\n","April 9, 2015","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has all the things it needs to be considered a good hack and slash game: good keyboard controls,good progression, fun enemies, and some fun varying combat. Anyone that says this game is button mashy has not used spells spells are effective and fun to use, and like any good hack and slash rpg, will require careful planning on where to use them on the hard difficulty. The protagonist is a funny, overconfident, and arrogent female lead, this maybe a turn of to some but I enjoyed the humor. It is kinda annoying to see an obviously adult character act like a child, but never since Lollipop Chainsaw Massacare have we had a character like this that is so well written, so I don't really car. This game does have it's flaws though to change resolution options you have to reset the game BEFORE you can. This would be more acceptable if the game put it in the options menu and then auto saved and reset, but it doesn't. It makes you quit then start again which dosen't even matter because changing it crashes your game at random intervals. Thats right cant change resolution. Luckily the game runs well so you should have no trouble running it  on 1080. I was recording without an ssd on low graphics on 1080 on what is practiclly half potatoe, and still kept 30. If you hoped on recording this sad news, game will crash randomly at times with most software available. As well the game shows most tool tips with bot controller and keyboard mouse bindings, which dosen't cause issues, but is still really irratating. My Final verdict is that this game is indeed worth ten big ones, but may not be the best for a YouTuber or Twitch Streamer to get, however the games has a great character, fun combat, interesting skills, and a kick ♥♥♥ sound track. If you are a fan of Hack & Slash RPGs, and are at least OK with the anime style, this game is worth the buy.","March 12, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I feel are poor mechanics sour the experience. The devs absolutely learned from the mistakes in X-Blades and made Blades of Time a great game. Get BoT instead.\nEDIT: Art direction is lovely but to say succinctly what I did in a rambling way: Blades of Time is fun. X-Blades really isn't.\n\nI care not for anime sexuality.\nI bought this game.\n*GASP* How can that be?!\n\n\nX-Blades is the predecessor to Blades of Time; Blades of Time is a remake/reimagining of X-Blades. I got BoT in a bundle. I very much enjoyed it. I bought X-Blades in the hopes of encouraging the dev's to include Cards for BoT / Achievements for X-Blades.\n\n\nI did not fully grasp the significance of "reimagining." X-Blades is horrible when compared to Blades of Time. My saying so is unfair, of course, but also truth.\nWith X-Blades, I was hoping to relive the glory days of PS2 platformers (Sly Cooper, Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, Beyond Good & Evil, KyA, Vex, etc. etc.). LOL upon further research, X-Blades was released for the subsequent generation... so my hopes were dashed from the start.\nSeveral reviews compare X-Blades to Devil May Cry; I'm pretty sure I compared BoT to DMC. X-Blades is similar to DMC only superficially: the targeting and combo system, the sword/gun-play, the double-jump, the fact that you fall slower while shooting, and of course the monsters (are vaguely similar). Other than that, X-Blades is a hodgepodge of (bad) mechanics.\n\nYou're a nimble nearly nude female treasure hunting... n-nin... er s-samur... er anime. Yeah.\nYou can swing your blades and shoot the shooty-things with the quickness; you can run (in the classic "back-bent-at-a-45-degree-angle-for-speed-and-style" pose) LIKE a ninja. When it comes to being swarmed by enemies... Ayumi moves like Zero from BoT: heavy and slow, tank-like.\n\nI'm playing with a controller and I don't even know how to dodge; I got the Teleport power, but you can only use it when your feet are planted firmly on the ground. There is no manual lock-on to enemies; moving the camera over enemies does it automatically. This makes targeting the bosses amidst the throngs of grunts a chore. The Store Page doesn't mention controller support; you can play with a controller but there are no options like Right Stick or Vibration Sensitivity (I THINK you can remap buttons but IDK).\n\nSpeaking of mobs, you best get that Teleport power early on and refrain from jumping like you'd figure the agile MILF with a baby's face (yeah...) should be able to. Else, you'll float atop the mobs or, somehow, one of the grunts will end up on top of you, out of reach of your blades.\n\nCombos... I don't even know. I don't even know how the points work, actually.\nYour melee attacks are the only thing that multiply your combo; if you use guns or powers, you get nothing.\nIn BoT, you could run all over the map with the (pretty much useless) points ("souls," I think) following you tirelessly - you were never going to lose any of them. In X-Blades it seems if you get too far from the points, they just disappear.\n\nIf you're working on a mob, of course, the multiplier is multiplied. I think if you get hit once, you lose every bit of those banked points, rather than it just resetting to zero and getting the points you had earned. I like this idea, it is, how you say, "hardcore." When you can't maneuver well enough on your own to preserve that combo, when there isn't a block/parry; other reviews that say "The game is nothing more than spamming LMB" are correct. I hate to admit that, since that could be argued for SEVERAL games, but with X-Blades, it's absolutely true.\n\nThere is a bit of a prologue and you end up being sent to some other... dimension. The beach you spawn on is apparently a hub(?). I cleared the waves upon waves of enemies, went through the door that opened, cleared the boss and those waves, didn't find another door, went back through the first, back on the beach, cleared those waves, didn't find another door, went back through the first door, and had enough.\nI'm certain some sorts of new mechanics / gimmicks will be employed throughout the game but I'm not sure I have the fortitude to deal with the just plain poor combat (which is, no doubt, the entirety of the game); monotony.\n\nGet Blades of Time; it is fantastic (though Ayumi is (")a bit more(") conservative).","March 12, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

She is one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen, and it seems like the only reason she's designed the way she was was to make teenage boys all hot and bothered.\n\nI want to say that for 99 cents, you should consider getting it....but no. Most of the  positive reviews seem to be people who only played an hour or two into. If thats what it takes to finish the game, then it's garbage considering it's not an indie release (I've seen this for sale at walmart). They also might be liars. Fans of Devil May Cry, not really.\n\nI should finish this game, for the sake of clarity. I should finish to see if there is a slight glimmer of hope. But I don't really see this going anywhere.","March 11, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But with the right music, and oh my word a controller, it can be a somewhat enjoyable game. There are several parts in the game where you can just sit in a corner and shoot the enemy until the wave ends which make the game rather trivial at times, especially when the waves can go on for over 10 minutes. Another aspect of the game I disliked was the fact that the level designer got so bored with the game that instead of creating new levels you simply start at the beginning and playthrough the game twice, simply with the monsters being stronger the second time round.\n\nAlso, the last boss is, in my opinion, the easiest part of the game.... what's with that? Simply holding down the Light Burst attack you can defeat him in nearly under a minute.\n\nTLDR: Turn on some Nightcore, Grab a controller, and make sure your mum doesn't look at your monitor, because it's time to play as a 95% naked girl who fights demon spawn in a huge castle with her giant sword/guns, twice.","May 16, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What can I say? While I can recommend this game, I would say to only buy it when on sale. It is simply not worth paying full price for. However, for under $1, you're getting a lot of game. For instance, it looks great; especially the lighting. The cutscenes and animations are relatively smooth and look nice. The voice acting is ok. The combat, while slightly repetative is satisfying and the souls system works well. X-Blades is a fun game over all, even if it is a bit mindless in some places. If you're looking for a beat em' up hack and slash style game, try this one.

While it's not the worst, it is certainly noticable. Cutscenes phase in and out rather abruptly. The combat gets repetitive VERY quickly, even in terms of hack and slash genres. Picking between your melee or ranged attacks have little to no impact and there's not much to discourage just spamming your spells untill everything is dead. However even these flaws are okay in my mind. It's the lack of world depth. This game is suppose to be an RPG, and yet it's almost as if they're trying to remind you it's just a video game.\n\nWanna use that ingame currency? Open up a menue that looks like it was designed with microsoft word art. The animation for picking up a rare treasure is a black screen suddenly popping up and having said rare treasure drunkenly take concentric swoops to the middle of the screen. The GUI is somewhat ornate but lacks a certain clarity, and I judge the man who's executive decision it was to make currency just a number in IMPACT font on the top right corner, with not even a simple icon to mark it.\n\nIt is such a beautiful solid concept of a game, but it needs another look.

Picking between your melee or ranged attacks have little to no impact and there's not much to discourage just spamming your spells untill everything is dead. However even these flaws are okay in my mind. It's the lack of world depth. This game is suppose to be an RPG, and yet it's almost as if they're trying to remind you it's just a video game.\n\nWanna use that ingame currency? Open up a menue that looks like it was designed with microsoft word art. The animation for picking up a rare treasure is a black screen suddenly popping up and having said rare treasure drunkenly take concentric swoops to the middle of the screen. The GUI is somewhat ornate but lacks a certain clarity, and I judge the man who's executive decision it was to make currency just a number in IMPACT font on the top right corner, with not even a simple icon to mark it.\n\nIt is such a beautiful solid concept of a game, but it needs another look. Some polish and redesign will do wonders for it.","March 11","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe the plot COULD be interesting along the game, but at the beginning it didn't look any special.\nAlso, in my opinion, Ayumi isn't that cool, i don't like her :S\nGot this game via giveaway, i'll just collect cards... i don't recommend this game.\n\n[ITA] Indipendentemente dal fatto che il gioco è stato rilasciato nel 2009, lo trovo veramente noioso.

Ho smesso di giocare dopo il secondo boss, tutto è così monotono.\nFORSE la trama sarà interessante durante il gioco, ma all'inizio a me non ha lasciato alcun tipo di interesse.\nInoltre, in mia opinione, Ayumi non è per niente carina, non mi piace :S\nHo ricevuto questo gioco tramite giveaway, collezionerò giusto le carte... non lo consiglierei.","March 5","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/agardosh/recommended/7510/","agardosh","agardosh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/agardosh/","177 products in account","This game prides itself on being Hack and Slash. It should, cause there's nothing, absolutely nothing in this game other than hacking and slashing the same generic enemies for way to long. At one point it popped up a "New Bestiary Entry", and I laughed out loud, cause 1) Where are those new enemies? They look exactly the same to me, and 2) A Bestiary? For real? This game doesn't have a plot and you gave it a Bestiary? Priorities.\nAlso, a female protagonist with a thong? Come on man... We're better than this.\n\nThe game begins with a quick 2 minutes tutorial about what weapons you have, and an elemental effect kind of damage system, which doesn't seem to matter. Jumping seems not to matter, and you can't really jump and hit aerial creatures, which seems like something you'd like to do.\n\nThere was also a plot somewhere. Idk where it wen't off to.\n\nThis game, however, does look pretty, requires absolutely nothing more than a simple run-of-the-mill PC to run it, and if you like the simple, non-changing, generic kind of hack and slash, you'll spend hours re-running stages here. So it has that going for it. Too bad they decided to break that beautiful scenery with awful character design and weird electronic-metal kind of music, and not something more atmospheric.\n\nFor the same price tag, Darksiders/DMC/God of War early installments  are all better choices, by far, with a better setting, better plot, better gameplay.","April 26","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can also search for the artifact pieces throughout your journey to up your various combat skills.\n\nThere is a little bit of a glitch, when you buy the game for some people it has come as a demo...
