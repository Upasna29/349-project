That thought alone makes me feel better about owning it.  This game is crap.  No, it's CRAAAAAAAAAP.  It started showing that trait as soon as it started.  It seemed to be obsessed with the "B" button on my XBOX controller.  It is used to confirm an action rather than cancel it.  Okay.  Anyway, the game itself is just ugly.  BROWN and ugly.  You are racing.  I guess.  And shooting at the other drivers.  I guess.  Navigating the brown roads that are silhouetted by brown buildings and brown sky is a bit tricky and since you are given no hints as to what the controls are, you will have to look them up.  Awesome.  An announcer seems to be shouting out nonsensical remarks about whatever it is you are doing.  "Yeah!"  "Way to go!"  "Snatch!"  WTH?  I was seriously about to quit when the race finished.  I did it so you won't have to.  Steer clear of this.  Get it?  Steer?  Oh well...","February 5, 2015","false","0.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

I can  barely tell a difference betwen Normal and Easy. The highest I can get ON THE FIRST RACE easy is 8th place out of 10; it's like they didn't playtest the game at all)\nenemies have unlimited respawn\n(so even if you destroy them, they just come back. WHY!?)\nAmmo capacity is too low IMO\n(5 mines, 8 missles, and 80 machine gun)\n\nPROS\nexplosions\nfunny voice overs -other drivers' faces pop up on the HUD (CarmaGeddon style) when you do certain things & sometimes they make you laugh (in a 'WTF?' kind of way)\naim with your mouse & shoot -I found the 'skill-shot' aiming to be more fun & engaging than a fixed target in the middle of the screen (using keyboard & mouse, that is)\nI'll just leave it at that. Hopefully you'll find this one of the more informational 'reviews' of this game.\n\nTL;DR= The truth is: the game has/had a lot of potential, but unfortunately the game seems to fight you every step of the way, keeping you from having fun for too long. In fact it's making me quit before I even beat the first level.\nFor $0.99 it MAY be worth it to you if you really like (unfairly) challenging racers, but IMO it's not worth your time.\n\n\n-------------------\n* NOTE: this entire review is based off my experience playing the game in 'modern mode.' There is also a 'classic mode' which features 1 life per vehicle (instead of infinite) and has 2 laps (instead of 3).\n**If someone else tells me otherwise, I'll change that part of the review.","January 5","false","1.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tearlow/recommended/7840/","Tearlow","Mr. Fuckface","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tearlow/","862 products in account","Despite all the issues this game suffers from It isn't really that bad. I see far too many people complaining that using an Xbox controller has a terrible preset and I have to agree. It's downright awful! But with some tweaking you can easily get it to where It should be. But that's part of the problem I suppose- These days people cannot be bothered to do that.\n\nWhat the game really lack is phasing. Simple as that. Even the cutscenes are somewhat slow and confusing! (Though most people should get the idea quickly enough.)\n\nAt the very start of the game you get the feeling your going backwards in time due to the races being so utterly slow but the more you progress the faster it goes. Not to mention the usage of powerups. Even so it will never be as fast as one expects but be thankful for it as the later tracks may prove somewhat difficult.\n\nAlthough the Storyline is extremely short and some obvious issues with the game I'd still recommend it. Though not at full price but around $3.","December 15, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well, in my opinion, this is the game that started the  game mechanic where you race and blow up the environments at the same time.\nIt's the same as all the other arcade racers - it isn't even good, mind you - but it mixes racing with vehicular combat and destructible environments. Somewhat succesful.

Someone in your way? You've got two forward-directed weapons to take care of that. Sprinkle a few mines or spikes behind you to keep others from overtaking you.\n\nThere are a few weapons systems to choose from, and each can have three upgrades. Not quite what the original had, but good enough.\nSeveral cars can be bought - if you win often enough.\n\nTo get more cash blow up stuff - the track is littered with explosives, strategically deposited for maximum carnage. Doing so will also grant you boons - invulnerability, speed boost, etc...\nThe same boons can also be picked up as power-up during the race itself. They'll not wait for you, though - the move about, left to right or up and maybe down.\n\nAll in all its a fun game. Fast racing, lots of explosions, good music. A feature that I personally like very much is the announcer, who comments your driving, for example when you take first position with the rest in hot pursuit, he may comment with an enthusiastic "You're leading the pack!".","March 21, 2015","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
