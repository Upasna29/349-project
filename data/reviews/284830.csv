I have to admit, this developer has changed my opinion on hidden object games in general because their titles consistently manage to combine an engaging story with puzzles that are challenging but not taxing or tedious, quality artwork, and music and voice acting that suit the story well. Clockwork Tales delivers, and is probably one of my favorites in this genre.\n\nI really like the Steampunk aesthetic, personally, so I thought it worked nicely into the format of a hidden object game. The bad guys here are militaristic fanatics with suspiciously German-sounding accents, so it's pretty obvious what imagery they were trying to evoke, but (pseudo-)Nazis blend well with the Steampunk style.  I was amused by the effort to include a bit of a science/geology theme in some of the puzzles and in the story, and I also appreciated that (like several of the other AM games I have played) the protagonist of the story was female.\n\nClockwork Tales is not terribly difficult or long, and the game probably lacks much replay value, It's still pretty entertaining and I enjoyed the few hours I spent playing. The achievements can be won in just a few hours of casual gameplay, so if that's your thing, then this is your game. It's also a family-friendly game as most of the puzzles aren't too difficult and the theme isn't very scary.\n\n","November 7, 2014","true","8.3"," 53 of 55 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","53","55","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/284830/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","I've played a handful of Artifex Mundi's hidden object games, and I think this may be my favorite one yet.  Based on a popular series of Polish children's books, Clockwork Tales is an imaginative, fun, curious and enjoyable title who's emphasis is more on casual adventure than hidden objects. Set in a steampunk version of the 1700's, you play Evangeline Glass, an intelligent young protégé to the brilliant Dr. Ink.  With the help of Ink's clockwork companion, Matthew the bird, you must save Hochwald and the doctor from the machinations of the evil Grand Engineer Barber.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about hidden object games is the beautiful and imaginative artwork many have, and this game is no exception.  Everything, including the characters, have a hand-painted look which gives it a storybook-like quality. Even the characters share the art style, which looks so much better than the oddly rendered/animated 3D models in other games.\n\nThe game play is your standard IHOG/HOPA, adventure game lite with hidden object scenes mixed in. I always play on Expert to give me a bit of challenge and lengthen my game play, but I found Clockwork Tales to be quite easy, even more so than most games in the genre. This isn't a horrible thing, but considering how much I enjoyed the world that was created, I wanted to spend a lot more time there than a mere 3 hours on the hardest difficulty. Even so, the adventure aspect was very fun with nothing jumping out as being crazy illogical, and the many puzzles were moderately challenging despite most being reused from previous games.  One nice touch was being able to utilize Matthew to collect out of reach items and perform certain tasks.  Most of these aren't too hard to figure out, but it's a nice bit of flavor added to a genre that is very "cut and paste" in most gameplay aspects.\n\nThe hidden object scenes are very well done, nicely drawn items without too much clutter, and have a nice range of difficulty, but none of the items were what I would consider unfairly hidden.  Mixed in amongst your standard HOS's are a few FROGs (fragmented object scenes), adding a bit of variety to the gameplay. I noticed, however, that the regular HOS's tend to get more plentiful the further you progress through the game. This wasn't an issue for me as I really like them, but not everyone shares that sentiment.  For those who do not, the number of these scenes are quite low overall compared to other games.\n\nWhile the setting is one of the best parts of the game, the story in the beginning feels a little rushed and can be a bit confusing.  But once things get going and you move out of the village into the castle, the storytelling smooths out quite a bit.  There are no dark, disturbing themes here (unlike so many others in the genre), and the story isn't deep by any means, but that doesn't detract from it's enjoyability.  This is a game that can be enjoyed by anyone but makes a particularly good family game, especially for parents who are looking for less macabre fair to share with their kids.\n\nOne of my biggest issues in previous games from this developer has been the voice acting, but Clockwork Tales is a vast improvement overall, especially with the main characters.  Now I'm not saying these are award winning performances, but they're not jarring nor do they sound out of place given the material, and they don't pull me out of the experience as they would in other games.  Funny enough, the one game in which I find the voice work to be pleasant enough is the one in which we get a toggle for the voiceovers.  The option is still appreciated and I hope we continue seeing it in the future.\n\nThis is the Collector's Edition of the game and comes with the bonus chapter (a short prequel to the main story), replayable puzzles and hidden object scenes, wallpapers, soundtrack and collectible "steambugs" that are sprinkled throughout the game.  I'm usually not big on having to find additional hidden items in these types of games, but the steambugs were a treat.  Aside from their imaginative and adorable designs, they're generally not too hard to spot, although it may take you a couple of play throughs to find a few you missed.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed Clockwork Tales immensely and am only disappointed in it's short length.  But the little time that I spent in the game world was time I completely enjoyed.  I will definitely come back to this one again and again.","April 28, 2014","true","5.3"," 52 of 60 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","52","60","2","3"

I wonder why I haven't played this earlier. I knew I was getting myself a satisfactory HOG when I bought this, but I had no idea that I'll be having this grand a deal in HOG genre!\n\nIn a fictional steampunk version of 1700 Prussia, we take the role of Evangeline Glass; Dr. Ink's protégé and engineer extraordinaire. We hit the road to meet with the good doctor in Hochwald, part of Habsburg Monarchy at the time, on a letter that we receive from him earlier. Dr. Ink has been making a research on the alarmingly raising number of earthquakes that were dominating the area. He claims that he has proof that a corruption in local authority is responsible: General Engineer is abusing a dangerous machine to create these earthquakes and he should be stopped at once!\n\nAt this point, we all know what kind of game that we should be expecting from Artifex Mundi: beautiful artwork, genuine animations, charming setting, and a curious story. Above all our common expectations, Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink covers a narration and a period so dark, yet envelops it with fair music and an atmosphere straight out of fables. The marriage of Austrian culture with Enlightenment science gives birth to this amazing game. As a personal favorite, I couldn't avoid to mention the puzzle of Saints during the bonus chapter, which is a direct example of this marriage. Did I mention the artwork? I know I'm trying my chance, but even the achievements interface itself is an artwork, made of stain glass!\n\nGameplay is ordinary, yet the adventure elements of assembling machines are fairly imaginative. There aren't many HOG scenes, rather FROG - fragmented object game - scenes dominating this particular game. There is little to no backtracking, and a full functioning map. Puzzles are the kind that we are used to by now. As a change, in this particular adventure, we have the luxury of utilizing Matthew, a mechanical crow that we send out to gather items out of our reach, which spices the gameplay a bit up. We are also entitled to enjoy a bonus chapter at the end, to experience Dr. Ink's short adventure before Evangeline's arrival. The game is pretty short, being 5 hours or so with the bonus chapter.\n\nOnce I've completed the bonus chapter, I wholeheartedly wished there would be a series of Clockwork Tales games. I usually prefer downright fantasy or at least mythological elements in storylines, but Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink is an elegant exception that I'll let myself be enthusiastic about. As a side note, I'm in love with the steam machine crow named Matthew!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","September 6, 2015","true","4.9"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","7"

The puzzles are mostly fun, though as stated above they are easy, but some of the find missions (especially at one point towards the end) were a little frustrating, as the picture list at the bottom of the screen for what needs to be found is really too small (unless I missed a way to enlarge them).

If you are looking for a fun little story in an interesting package you might enjoy this.

There are a few manipulation puzzles and some hidden object puzzles, and they're all fairly small and well integrated into the storyline: for example, with the hidden objects, you are always looking for something (or parts to something) that you'll need to progress in the storyline. I especially liked the dollhouse puzzle: 4 puppets in a dollhouse are looking for pairs of objects, and once you find the objects, you see a small animation where the dolls actually use them - very satisfying.\n\nThe storyline has voiceovers, the hints do not: I'd recommend the game for anyone age 6 and up if they can read or have someone who can help them if they get stuck (but with the hint system, that should hardly happen). Also, if you ever wanted your very own steambug collection or find the recipe for the Steam Horse drink ("I'd give up my helmet for a Steam Horse!"), this game might be for you.\n\nThe included bonus prequel is about an hour, with the professor in the village using the bits that you could look at, but not use, in the main game.\n\nSome small gripes like light beams colliding instead of passing through each other or minor inaccuracies in the "evil German" grammar (the German subtitles are very well written!) do not detract from an overall experience that is well crafted, even if it doesn't reach the scope or the immersiveness of a "big" adventure like Machinarium.","April 26, 2014","true","11.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redesignated/recommended/284830/","redesignated","Redesignated","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redesignated/","169 products in account","Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink is a point-and-click puzzle game which pays homage to deceased Polish author Jan Brzechwa's series of stories surrounding Pan Kleks/Mr. Inkblot. Developed by Artifex Mundi, it was originally released in August of 2013, and put onto Steam in April of 2014, with achievements and trading cards. The game itself follows Evangeline Glass as she tries to help her mentor and friend, Dr. Ambrose Ink, investigate a series of increasingly violent tremors rocking the planet and seemingly originating in the nestled burg of Hochwald. After his abduction early on, it falls entirely to Evangeline to not only solve the mystery surrounding the quakes and save Hochwald, but rescue Ink from his captors.\n\nThe premise is interesting, and to its credit, more involved than a lot of hidden object games, but not quite up to snuff for me. The characters are flat and lacking nuance, the plot as a whole is predictable, and while the environment and all the build up hints at a great backstory and lore that could have been explored and exposited, it all remains veiled in mystery. There's no elaboration about the world the characters live in, how its technology works, or even how our main ensemble got to where they are in their lives; everything is left entirely up to our own interpretation. While that can work well when you're at least given breadcrumbs to go off of, we aren't, and I feel the game suffers as a result. I can't really claim that the game is meant to be played with previous knowledge of the Pan Kleks stories, either, seeing as they aren't mentioned anywhere within the game as a source of inspiration — something that I can't dismiss as being a bit of an odd exclusion.\n\nThe goal is outlined fairly early on, and doesn't change at any point thereafter. The ending felt incredibly rushed, and didn't leave me satisfied that things had been finished at all. The dénouement as a whole was fairly lackluster — the final cinematic runs is an expository narrative about how things were all wrapped up off camera after doing the final few clicks, clocking in at less than two minutes long to do so. It came off more as a segue to more story than a resolution, or even a cliffhanger for a sequel.\n\nGameplay is, of course, looking around and clicking things. While primarily presented as a hidden object game, and indeed offering such as its main minigame challenge, the selection of puzzles is surprisingly diverse. Nonograms, jigsaws, sliding blocks, labyrinths, object interactions, trick locks and associated puzzle boxes… More than a few varieties make an appearance, and can pose a decent challenge depending on your familiarity with each. There are, however, skip options for every puzzle, allowing you to bypass them completely by simply idling for a bit.\n\nFinishing the main story will likely only take you a few hours, with the bonus chapter taking much less. Due to the linear progression and lack of variance in how to move forward, the game has fairly little replayability, but the initial experience can be quite fun. Once you finish a mode, you must play through it again entirely if you want to return to a specific point, as each individual zone of the game is walled of from returning to the previous; the downside to this is that having to go through the game again, as in the event that you miss a Steambug, can be more of a chore than anything else. A post-finish stage selection option would have been quite appreciated for this.\n\nVisually, the game has a virtual painterly aesthetic, with fade-between transitions for a majority of background animations. During cut scenes, speaking characters have their facial expressions smudged about to convey emotion and communication, while the rest of the scene remains static or animated using the fade-between method. Although the smudging effect is one of the more high quality examples I have seen, the lack of use on anything other than the characters' primary features can be a bit jarring, primarily at times when their heads should be moving as well. I would have liked to see the effect used on more areas of the game than it was, as it could have added to give the game a bit of individuality.\n\nMusically, the soundtrack is quite enjoyable; I had no complaints. I particularly liked the track that plays during the nonogram puzzles, although it only makes a single appearance toward the end. Unfortunately, the tracks listed in the Extras menu are not the full selection, and checking the installation directory doesn't offer the raw files, forcing one to pursue other venues to listen to everything on the fly.\n\nThe voice work varies between decent and hilariously bad, usually landing somewhere in the middle. A few characters sound absolutely ridiculous, while others are very pleasing to the ears. You can disable voice acting entirely in the options menu, should you so desire.\n\nI encountered no sequence breaking opportunities or unwinnable situations while playing, but I didn't attempt to induce them, either. I did experience a rather annoying issue where the Spy Master achievement didn't go through during my initial Expert run, despite having kept the game set to Expert throughout the entire session.\n\nWhile the difficulty settings speak of some sort of penalty for misclicks in hidden object puzzles, I was still able to click about at random on both Advanced and Expert and not have it affect anything. I'm not entirely sure if I'm unique in that regard, or if it's simply an aspect that was never implemented. If you're hunting for achievements, and with this in mind, I'd set it to Expert right away so you can get the Spy Master achievement on your first playthrough. The game isn't hard enough nor punishing enough to truly make doing so pose much of an issue, especially if you're accustomed to games of this genre or are willing to utilize the skip function.\n\nThe store page is a bit deceptive. You have no control over the glider section, it happens entirely as a cut scene; there's no combat action to the game, as “monster battles” and “defeating mechanical creatures” implies (this action is done entirely via puzzle-solving, and only occurs once); and there are 16 achievements both in-game and on Steam, not 9. The game is very much of the go-at-your-leisure variety, with no timed puzzles or direct fighting involved. These are fairly minor discrepancies, but still a bit misleading as to what one can expect.\n\nAs a whole, I would recommend the game to fans of the genre, and those looking for an introduction to point-and-clicks without too extreme a difficulty. The standard asking prices in several currencies are $7.99 USD and AUD, 6.49€, 5.99£, R$ 13,99, and 189 RUB. By comparison as of August 2014, the game is cheapest in RUB. As is par for the course with Steam games, I would recommend getting it while on sale or in a bundle, unless you're a diehard fan of games like it.","August 3, 2014","true","11.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

That said, I think this was meant to be a more casual game, and so it succeeds in that regard. It's not a game that anybody is really going to get stumped with. It looked nice. The graphics were pretty and well done for the most part. The voice acting was not notable (neither good nor bad), and the story was decent. The Steampunk setting was pretty cool overall.\n\nOverall, I give this game about 6.5 out of 10. not a must play, but the 4 hours or so it will take you to complete it wont be something you regret either.","December 14, 2014","true","8.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It is a little on the easy side so playing on the highest difficulty is best. The story is fine, but it is the polish that really worked for me. The music and graphics are solid and the hidden object puzzles are actually scenes that make sense instead of a random assortment of meaningless objects. That attention to detail is rare.\n\nIn addition, the bonus content for the game is really added playtime. It is not just a rehash of the places and puzzles you have done before.\n\nOverall, a really good game in this genre.","May 7, 2015","true","5.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

The story is quite good (especially for a HOG) and the voice acting is actually good too (only some of the peasants with their single line to say are cringe-inducing).  The graphics are good and the puzzles OK.  My only real complaint about the puzzles is that very few of them are actual HOGs.  Most are Fragmented Object Games (FROGs). It took me about four hours to complete the main game and another hour for the Bonus Chapter.  So, five hours of good gameplay to get 100% Achievements.\n\nI'm definitely recommending this game.  But, I'd suggest waiting for a sale.  If you can find it for around $5, spring for it.","August 29, 2015","true","5.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The game can be completed in under 5 hours, on expert mode, so it's not too demanding where you can't still play it casually. Does that even make sense...?\n\nThe story begins in a small town known as Hochwald - presumably somewhere in Germany. While a once peaceful town, you will quickly find that that is the case no more. Agent Evangelie Glass is summoned by her friend and mentor, Dr. Ink, who is on a mission to uncover the mysterious secrets of the Barber family. Hochwald has, ultimately, been plagued by increasingly powerful tremors, and Dr. Ink has landed himself in trouble by attempting to sabotage "master inventor Barber", the latter of whom does not have the town in his best interest. With the help of a little mechanical bird, named Matthew, do you have what it takes to thwart Barber's evil plans?\n\nPros+  If you're into them, achievements are very easy to obtain\n+  The graphics are easily some of the best that I have seen for a HOG\n+  The way the story is laid out is good. It is paced evenly and nothing was rushed\n+  Voice acting was done extremely well - one of them did make me go, "really?", however\n+  Hopefully you don't find the puzzles too difficult. On average, they probably took me about 3 minutes to do. However... (continued in neutral)\n+  Play with the music and sound on - do as they recommend; it is amazing and you can tell that they really put in a lot of effort to create a good audio experience for the player\n\nNeutral±  ... one of the puzzles was giving me trouble and I couldn't get past it for a good 20 minutes. Lack of instructions wasn't too helpful (no kidding), but I eventually got through it\n\nCon-  The game is extremely short. Even after playing the 2nd half of the game - Ink's Story - I still ended up with a completion time of under 4 hours. So I would recommend only getting this game once it's bundled or under $2.00\n-  I know this is steampunk, but some of the items felt really out of place, especially for the time period. It's like they attempted to fit the 1600s in with some 2010 elements. I can't remember what item I saw (it was during a hidden object scene), but it made me question the time frame; there were actually a few items\n\nWhile on your mission to save Dr. Ink and the whole town from thheir demise, you will uncover a beautifully told story, wonderful adventures,  and stunning graphics. Give it a good go, and Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink will most definitely not disappoint.\n\nOverall:\n8/10","December 15, 2015","true","5.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The fact that I would purchase a game twice should say something all by itself, but I am biased; I happen to very much enjoy Hidden Object/casual games like this one. What intrigued me the most was the steampunk setting and it does a decent job of making you feel you're in a steampunk world the whole time.\n\nAs most HOs, the story is quite short, but what is there is beautiful, fun, and with fun puzzles to solve in your quest to find your mentor and friend, with the help of his mechanical crow, Matthew. First off, Matthew is a sidekick of sorts, chilling out in your inventory and looking awesome, but he's very useful in retrieving items and spying for you where normally you might break your neck if you tried yourself. Matthew is just overall a cool feature, and I wish players got more chances to use him. If you're bored of the crow, there are also hidden robotic bugs in many of the scenes which you can collect for completionist status; a nice little extra challenge, though relatively easy to do. The epilogue chapter helps to add a little more story, gameplay and depth as well. A little more bang for your buck.\n\nOverall, the artwork and scenery in this game is gorgeous, and for once, the voice-acting actually adds to the game rather than takes away from it, even if a few lines are repetitive after asking for Matthews help. The music isn't anything spectacular; it's nothing award-winning but it doesn't make me want to turn it off at any point during the game either.

I'll keep it short and sweet:\n\n+++++     Much like Artifex Mundi's other games, Clockwork Tales is visually pleasing to look at, probably not as pretty as some of their other games, mind.\nThe game has a decent plot, as far as HOGs go!\nAchievements are varied and aren't too punishing to achieve, allowing easy 100% completion for those interested ;)\nFeatures include several supported languages and steam trading cards. There are 6 cards to collect, so it's not too bad a grind to complete a set for the badges.\nFairly decent completion time, doesn't feel overly long.\n-----     A couple of the puzzles may have you tearing your hair out for a while, I was forced to cheat and look at a walkthrough for one of them (although this may because I have the dumb).\nNot enough hidden object parts for my liking but perhaps the game will suit people who prefer puzzle and exploration elements better.\nSome games are purely reskinned versions from other Artifex Mundi games and don't include many puzzles that stand out in the genre - although this is a common feature among a lot of HOGs!\nWhen not on sale I think the price may put some people off for what is essentially a small amount of game time, although established fans of the genre probably won't be deterred by this at all.\nWhat a boring review, I do apologise ;_; Anyhow, not to sound like I'm overly fond of Artifex Mundi or anything but the game is a solid HOG, I've played better but I've also played worse. Clockwork Tales does feel like 'just another HOG' in a way if you play a lot of them, nothing particularly stands out but It's a fun way to spend a few hours, especially if you like games that are easy to 100% or want something that's suitable for all ages (except me at 25 being unable to solve some of the puzzles... ;)).","September 22, 2015","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Clockwork Tales is definitely a good game for those who love the steampunk aesthetic, as well as hidden object games! Albeit a bit short, the game has a certain charm to it that I've yet to see in this genre. But, without further adieu, on to the review!\n\n=Complete Review= (TL:DR version and Conclusion at the bottom)\n\n=The Story: 3/5= The story is a bit interesting. Your old friend, Dr. Ink, has made a discovery correlating to the mysterious earthquakes around the world, and Hochwald, a small mountain town close by to the mysterious castle of the Barber family. You play as Evangeline Glass, and it's up to you to save Ink, and put a stop to the cause of the earthquakes.\n\nWhile not overly groundbreaking of a story, it's still certainly a little treat. The game is sadly a bit short, in comparison to other games I've played from Artifex Mundi. But, fortunately like other games of theirs, Clockwork Tales provides a prequel story for extra play and to learn more about one of your allies.\n\nThere -was- a scene that was a bit... Odd in my opinion, regarding one of the characters having a bit of a unexpected change of heart in it. But, It was just one of those 'come-and-go' moments. Not a reoccuring theme in the game, fortunately.\n\n=The User Interface: 3/5=  With the user interface I was a bit disappointed with the lack of a more in-character journal-keeping function, like the ones in the Enigmatis games. However, having the clockwork bird, Matthew, to aid in puzzles and add a extra bit of actual functionality to the game made up for it.\n\nThe UI is also well designed, and has it's own artistic flair to it, which I've come to expect from the skilled hands of these developers. So while there isn't an abundance of bells and whistles, there certainly is some eye-catching beauty to the interface itself, down to the pointer.\n\n=The Gameplay: 4/5= The gameplay is pretty standard, and as you'd expect from a hidden object game. Artifex Mundi's games are very good about making sure things don't look horribly out of place in scenes, and this is no exception. So while it's not a ground breaker (pun not intended) among their own games, it's still a cut above most the HOGs I've seen and played.\n\nA fair amount of the puzzles in the game I've seen and played before, but that's not necessarily bad. A little lacking in originality, but you know what they say, "Don't fix what isn't broken". And they do have a couple puzzles in here that I've yet to see in the other two games of theirs I've played, which is always a treat.\n\nFor those looking for a little more challenge, or to make things easier, there are three different difficulties. Being Casual, for those who are more interested in the story than gameplay. Advanced, for those who want more challenge, but not too much. And Expert, for the people who don't want things to be all that easy on them. The difficulties mainly affect how easily you can see where to go, and how quick your hints recharge. I myself prefer Expert, as I prefer to do no-hint runs.\n\n=The Graphics: 3/5= While the story isn't too impressive, the graphics make up a bit for it. As stated before, Artifex Mundi is good about making both objects and background work together in harmony. So you don't have to worry about seeing horribly stretched images that look like they were swiped off of google. Everything works well in it's environment, and doesn't stick out horribly.\n\nThe places you get to explore look lively, and nicely drawn. From the snowy outdoors with storms in the distance, to the vibrant warmth of the inside of the tavern with it's patrons sitting down to warm up.\n\nMy only downside, as seems to be common with Artifex' games, would be the talking animations. Which, I'm really hoping they've worked on in their latest games. They did a good job of making sure the person speaking moves their head, as one would do when speaking. But it still looks a little... Odd? Definitely not one of their strong points.\n\n=The Audio: 3/5=  The music is quite charming, and it's enjoyable. Not exactly the kind of thing you'd get addicted to listening to, but it has a elegance to it that is nice on the ears while you concentrate on the game.\nThe sound effects work nicely, and for the most part, match what is 'triggering' the sfx. So that's always nice. I hope I'm not the only one who finds it so annoying when the sound doesn't match what is supposed to be making the sound. So finding out that this game doesn't have that problem is nice.\n\nThe voices were rather well done, and fit the kind of people in the setting pretty well. Some of them weren't exactly.. Well... My cup of tea... But, I won't deny that they at least fit the character speaking. And I'm happy that the game at least has consistant voice acting, rather than some characters being voiced and others not.\n\n=The Atmosphere: 4/5= I personally love the atmosphere of the game. I'm not one of those kinds of people who are in love with the steampunk aesthetic, but I do have to admit it's a pretty cool style and concept. And the game certainly does keep in touch with the aesthetic, with blimps, and clockwork bugs (which you have to find) as well as steampunk inventions abound!\n\nThere aren't really any items that logically would not be in that time period, which I've noticed that this developer is particularly good with. You'd be surprised at how many HOGs can't get that sort of thing down. A cellphone in a middle-aged castle, go figure. Fortunately none of that sort is in this game.\n\nIt's definitely a lighter-hearted steampunk game, so it's not all that gritty. The bright artstyle helps to enforce this. It concentrates mainly on the inventions and the victorian stylistic, which is common with Steampunk. So those who are looking for a darker-and-edgier steampunk esque game would not find such in this game.\n\n=TL;DR/Pros & Cons=\n\nPros\nUI is well crafted, and has a clockwork bird companion (once you fix him).\nLovely Steampunk aesthetic, makes for a nicely styled HOG.\nBackgrounds and Hidden Object scenes are nicely executed.\nThree different difficulty options to allow players to pick their level of play.\nFully voiced dialogue with characters, which is always a plus.\nAchievements! Boy I love me a game with achievements.\nClockwork. Bird. Companion. I think that deserves another mention.\n\nNeutral\nLighter-toned Steampunk Game, not much nitty-gritty here.\nVoice acting! Kinda a "Your mileage may vary" thing.\nStory wasn't all that intense.\n\nCons\nGame felt way too short, which is the major problem with this game.\nNot many puzzles or hidden object scenes. Pretty big downer since that's the point of this genre.\nThe talk animations... Oooh boy... Do they definitely need some work.\nThe very weird and kinda OOC moment in the Prequel story. Still has me scratching my head.\n\n=The Conclusion: 6.5/10= All in all, it's a charming game for sure. However the short-length and lack of more puzzles hits this game's rating real hard. If Steam had a neutral rating, I'd definitely pick that for this game. As there's plenty of good points, but bad points as well. So I'd say this is a lower-end positive rating. If the game's on sale for real cheap, it'd be a good idea to grab. But the bad points make it hard to justify buying it full-price.\n\nI appreciate your time, and thank you for reading this review~.\n","July 20, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've personally cleared every puzzle without any assistance on the hardest difficulty level.  I'm not trying to brag, but rather I'm the same guy who can hardly solve any puzzles in 7th Guest or 11th Hour.  On the flip side, the puzzles aren't too absurd or abstract, so you're never in a position to randomly guess at a solution.  As for the voice acting and the animated transitions, they are welcoming to break up the monotony of solving puzzle after puzzle.  The overall story though is lacking in material.  The game feels like a chunk of a bigger unwritten story.  The prequel story only creates more questions than it answers.  Overall, I had a great time, even if it was pretty short.

Curiously, the story kinda reminded me of the adventure game Syberia (no - this game does not come close to that game at all).\n\nThe game does have one unique feature. Your protagonist has a companion. A companion you have to use occasionally to solve some of the puzzles.\n\nHO games are always good to me for some pleasant gaming, but still requires me to use some brain and observational power.

I was beginning to feel attracted for the genre and decided to try this one out, due to it's reviews. I must say, I was surprised. This title shines in so many ways, from the art, to voice acting, soundtrack and puzzle originality. The art utilized in Clockwork tales is beautiful and lines up perfectly with the steampunk-ish universe where the story is set up. Voice acting is of high quality and never fails to impress.\nAs I mentioned before, this is the first HOG game I've finished, but from the puzzles I completed, I was mostly pleased with their originality, never making gameplay repetitive in any way possible. I was also awed with the animation style and how movement actions are carried out.\nAt your disposal, you have a mechanical bird, Matthew, that can be used to reach objects located in, otherwise, unreachable places. the main characters are interesting but due to the small playtime they aren't deeply explored, which leaves you, the player, to acknowledge only superficial information about them.\nReplayability is encouraged due to the existence of achievements such as: complete the game in expert mode, find all hidden bugs and don't misclick in any HOG segments. The bonus chapter, also a prequel to the title's events, is a nice addition and provides background on Professor Ink.\n\nConclusion: A must have for gamers who enjoy the HOG genre, and an excellent option for some who never played any titles of this nature. Low playtime, but high replayability. Great story, beautiful art and pleasant character design. Interesting steampunk-ish universe, and expanded by a bonus chapter (prequel).

Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.\n\nThat's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.\n\nThey do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.\n\nMy recommendation, because of the "if you've played one you've played them all" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games.","August 12, 2015","false","5.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

In this game you play as Evagiline Glass, a special agent....for what I don't know. Your friend and father figure, Profesor Ink, has been kidnaped by the bad guy, who's name I've already forgoten, and it's up to you (and your mechanical bird friend named matthew) to stop the bad guy and save the...world? Empire? Tinny village? I have no clue.\n\nThis is one of the problems, it's hard to get invested when I have no idea what this place even is! How can I feel a sence of ergency when I don't know why to be ergent.\n\nNext problem: the puzzles.\nI know, I know, that sounds like a major overstament, but hear me out. When you start the game, the puzzles look and feel nice, and each one is unique....untill the next segment when you do most of them again, with one or  two being unique, but never seen again. By the end, I was spaming the hint button for all its worth, because I had to to SIX HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLES! (Except fot I Spy, I hate these kind of piuzzles and many friends of mine agree, so bare with if you like them.)\n\nOh wait, did I say six? I ment 12, because you have to each one twice! TWICE!!!\n\nAnd the other puzzles are jsut so DULL! Again, by the end I got to know the hint buton very well. But that just made the game worse, as I relized that the puzzles just artificaly added time. I played on casual and the game only lasted FOUR HOURS!\n\nOh, but when you beat the game a first time, you can play the game again, except as Ink....yay....\n\nAlso, the voice acting was very distracting when it came to the bad guy and his minnions. They all had this forced, indeed comical, German accent that made them hard to take seriosly. I felt like I was listening to an early 30's radio show.\n\nAnd did I mention the colectible hunting? There's colectible hunting. And what do they get you? Jack Diddly!\n\nOverall, I felt cheeted. This game felt unfleshed out and underwleming, and by the end I was jus skping all of the puzzles, just to get to the end. (Btw, it sucks)\n\nI give it a 3/10\nUnless this kind of game is your abolute favorite, skip it.","May 30, 2014","false","2.9"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

Mostly because it's beautifully drawn, and while there are holes the atmosphere is immersive and enjoyable.

They toss in a handful of FROG (fractured object) puzzles, and they give you a "find a bug in each location" challenge, but for the most part this is an extremely casual point and click adventure that happens to have a few hidden object puzzles contained in the mix of mini-games.  (This is not necessarily a bad thing, however I expected something a bit different after playing several of Artifex Mundi's other titles.)\n\nSpeaking of the mini-games, I noticed at least three of them were directly copied from "Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden."  I understand that a company needs to meet deadlines, but ripping off your own past work to flesh out your current game is a pretty disappointing tactic.\n\nDue to the sparsity of HOG's, there was no alternate puzzle solution option for this game (such as dominoes or mahjong).  While this is a significantly more simplified level of gameplay than I have come to expect from this studio, it does allow the player to complete all of the achievements in one playthrough.  They also did not include any time challenges for this game.\n\nAside from the puzzles, the adventure game elements were fairly intuitive, there wasn't too much backtracking, the story was decent enough, the art was good, the character designs and voice acting were well done, and there was even a bit of humour thrown into the dialogue.  I also liked the inclusion of an animal companion who doubles as a special use item (something that seems to be a bit of a trend with this studio's more recent titles).  However, the game is not entirely immersive, and many of the challenges feel like a means to an end, rather than a fun progression of the plot.\n\nOverall I would have to give this game a 6/10.   If you are expecting a HOG, you will be disappointed, but if you are just looking for a casual steampunk adventure game, it fits the bill well enough.","December 2, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is different from other similiar games in that it is heavy on the puzzles, light on the hidden object scenes, which could be a good or a bad thing depending on which you prefer. I also found it to be much easier and less complex than other HOGs I have played. If you are familiar with Artifex Mundi, you will also notice that some puzzles were taken directly from other games they've made (or perhaps the other way around...).\n\nAnother issue, which I've found to be true with other such games, is that sometimes in the hidden object scenes, you will be directed to find, for example, a "hook," and there will be like 5 hooks in the scene, and you just have to keep guessing until you find the one they are referring to. An annoying oversight on the part of the game makers.\n\nIn general the artwork and voice acting are both above average, and the story is super basic but acceptable. But you don't play these games for the story, you play them because you're bored, procrastinating on your work, or you don't feel like playing a "real game." It passes the time... not much else to say.","December 20, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They toss in a handful of FROG (fractured object) puzzles, and they give you a "find a bug in each location" challenge, but for the most part this is an extremely casual point and click adventure that happens to have a few hidden object puzzles contained in the mix of mini-games.  (This is not necessarily a bad thing, however I expected something a bit different after playing several of Artifex Mundi's other titles.)\n\nSpeaking of the mini-games, I noticed at least three of them were directly copied from "Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden."  I understand that a company needs to meet deadlines, but ripping off your own past work to flesh out your current game is a pretty disappointing tactic.\n\nDue to the sparsity of HOG's, there was no alternate puzzle solution option for this game (such as dominoes or mahjong).  While this is a significantly more simplified level of gameplay than I have come to expect from this studio, it does allow the player to complete all of the achievements in one playthrough.  They also did not include any time challenges for this game.\n\nAside from the puzzles, the adventure game elements were fairly intuitive, there wasn't too much backtracking, the story was decent enough, the art was good, the character designs and voice acting were well done, and there was even a bit of humour thrown into the dialogue.  I also liked the inclusion of an animal companion who doubles as a special use item (something that seems to be a bit of a trend with this studio's more recent titles).  However, the game is not entirely immersive, and many of the challenges feel like a means to an end, rather than a fun progression of the plot.\n\nOverall I would have to give this game a 6/10.   If you are expecting a HOG, you will be disappointed, but if you are just looking for a casual steampunk adventure game, it fits the bill well enough.","December 2, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This does not get boring and was completed in one sitting.\n\nThe gameplay is great and the main reason it's one of the best hidden object games, the animation is consistent all the way through (Some HO games tend to have 3D cutscenes making it look all cool and then boom, 2D generic HO scene) as well as it's got a bigger variety of puzzles then most HO games. In fact it probably shouldn't be refferred to as a HO game. I'll stop referring to it now.\n\nThis is a great puzzle game.","December 14, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Best of all, care was taken so that HO scenes reflect your last search the next time you need them; it's a personal pet peeve when they're just randomly generated every time.

The villain is a ridiculously shallow stereotype and there's no real character development.\n\nBut, I still recommend it. Mostly because it's beautifully drawn, and while there are holes the atmosphere is immersive and enjoyable. With hidden object games like this, the visuals count for more than anything else in my view, and that's where the game succeeds best.\n\nThere's a hard mode for people who are REALLY good at these things (I played through it before trying hard mode and still couldn't get through one of the puzzles) but also a nice and simple casual mode that lets you skip puzzles that just aren't your thing. I'm big into that being important in games like this where I hate being stuck because of one single puzzle.\n\nI liked the voice acting, it's not perfectly timed, but it wasn't awful.\n\nPros\n+ Beautiful art\n+ Diverse puzzles\n+ Different level settings\n+ Atmospheric\n\nCons\n- Shallow story\n- Flat characters\n- Hard mode is ridiculous","February 4, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some nice collectibles in the form of mechanical insects as you progress through.

There isn't enough time to see exactly where we are, there isn't much sense behind the puzzles and the hidden object minigames, and the story itself makes little to no sense at all.\n\nThe ending, moreover, is particularly abrupt, and disappointing, which -in the case of these kind of games- is extremely bad.

All of them except for one particular peasant in one particular (and very brief) scene, anyway.\n\n- nice animations, in particular those of people speaking. Nicely done.\n\n- music... i can't remember it, which means it didn't get on my nerves. That counts as a plus.\n\n- i appreciate the "collectibles" (the Steambugs), though i am not OCD enough to lose any sleep if i happen to miss any of them.\n\n- _One_ complaint (again... i feel like a broken record...): ambiguous terms in HO scenes are a real drag. In the kitchen, you've got to find a "pot." There are _four_ of them in the HO scene. Four pots. At least (i stopped counting at four). There's also an ambiguous "ring" in one scene (with 3 rings in it: one keyring and two finger rings). Come on, devs! Use Google Images to double-check!!!\n\n- So far well within a tolerable "what the HELL just happened?" ratio (specifically, the owl and the snowball is the only one which comes to mind).
