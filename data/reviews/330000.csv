YES. It is a solid, honest YES.\n\nYou have access to virtually all cards, but only in theory. In reality it would take the player months if not years to actually collect enough cards for a competitive decks. Once again we have the Energy-Bar, a fake, useless currency that you get tiny amounts of and the real currency, which of you get even less.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nGold: 1 Hero costs 70.000 Gold. One Booster with old cards 5.000. One booster with newer cards 20.000. Newest booster are gem only. Each booster contains 6 Common, 3 Uncommon, 1 Rare (and a tiny chance for an Epic or Legendary). A deck consists out of ~40 cards.\nParticipating in a tournament costs 5 "credits" and 10 credits cost 35.000 gold\n\nNow, you will ask, how much gold do i get per battle? Well, 100. You get about 400 in total after completing one of the nodes on the map and it take 4 battles to complete it. In other words - if you want a new hero, you will have to finish 700 battles just for that.\n\nThere is also almost no way to earn gems and by that i mean, that you i.e. earn 5 after logging in 50 times and 40 for collecting all cards from one of the collections. One booster costs btw 20 and you can buy 1100 for 100$.\n\nThis game is a facebook scam.\n\n","January 31, 2015","false","7.0"," 50 of 66 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","50","66","0","2"

OMG this game seems so inoffensive and simple with its 3 slots for creatures concept, but is in reality pretty AWESOME, and geniously balanced. I've played it for a year now. It can be played very fast or for hours a day. Heros can changes all the meaning of a deck. The "tombstones" system is also well exploited as you'll see after some time. Thre is PVP, limited or standard tournements, drafts and the best: Guilds Wars :o! Yeah.. guild wars in a card game ;)\n\nAll 3 first editions packs and all heros are buyable in gold and you'll get a truck load of it; especially in daily arena and Guild Wars ;) Gems are more precious but are still given away for free, but at a much slower rate.. You still get 20 of those and an Epic card each month thought.. plus easily 90 more gems/month playing. There is already a loyal community and the new devs are very actives! They makes numerous updates and releases each months..\n\nThe guild wars  system has this particularity: you and your team each make a "defensive" deck that will be played by the AI.. that means you won't control them. But you also make an "offensive" deck that you will control to attack the ennemy guilds. You can battle anytime cause you will face the AI controling their "defensive" decks :o! The guilds with the most wins get the victory. Your guild will rage against 3 wars each 36 hours. The guilds that won the most wars each seasons will have the apportunity to go up in ranks. Do not hesitatate to ask your guildmates about further hints cause there is! Copper to gold ranking makes it accessible to every type of players and collections and are free to play. Your team get a fair amount of gold and honor to buy even more packs and cards. There is also the "Epic" guild.. the biggest challenge in ther, exept for the usual types of tournaments and PVP of course..\n\nMany went from newbies to veterans without spending any real money, but you can spend some specially for 5$ starters. The dragon bundle can be great to unlock too.. and for the starters they are all of great value but one is BEST and will remane.. i let you guess wich one :P\n\nFinally, i play two great CCG games right now: HEARTHSTONE and KINGDOMS! Earthstone is more humoristique and have better sounds. Kingdoms has the best playability.. it can be played longer, offers much more formats and is less restricted to heros. I also recomend to turn off the sound effects in Kingdoms until they get fixed.. they are pretty noisy and metallized as it is, unless you like them. For me, music alone is better.. not as great as Hearthstone but the game is much more complexe.. don't let you be impressed by the 3 creature slots system.. and good luck XD :P!","January 26, 2015","true","15.4"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","24","41","2","0"

It is simple to learn and a good deal of fun, but a good strategy will take time to develop (or you could just youtube it) and the right cards to pull off. This is where a lot of players might be iffy on the game, as getting those cards freely isn't easy. The game has a huge campaign (huge for trading card games) that has daily and hourly rewards, gives lots of nice cards, and is very challenging towards the end. By the time you finish it you should have a decent core deck and be working on the expansions. The expansion cards themselves are not more powerful than the core cards, they simply open up more and different strategies, so the power creep isn't as bad here as it is in other TCG games and new players will only be behind in terms of the options they will have immediately availble to them (a still considerable amount in my opinion)\n\nAlot of the negative reveiws for this game stem from the P2W argument and the FB Game style energy requirement. As for the P2W argument, I simply don't understand where its coming from, and I've played a lot of actual P2W games. The latest expansions do require premium currency (diamonds) instead of gold, but premium currencty can be aquried each day through daily events. As with most F2P games, almost every card in the library (and there are a lot) can be aquried with time, patience, and a bit of grinding. If you don't like grinding (understandable) there are also free tournaments and guild play, both of which have coin rewards and the tournaments reward free tickets, which allow you access into the tournaments that give cards and diamonds for rewards. As for the cards that can't be aquired this way, they are usually event and tournament rewards. There is VIP system in place if you do wish to spend money, but none of the cards they give are more "instant game winners" than many of the combinations and cards you can easily set up and aquire for free.\n\nAs for the energy issue, upon writing this the devs have already stated it will be removed for campaign progression. It is also not neccessary AT ALL for arena, tournaments, and guild based play. The only place it will still be required is picking up the freebies and crafting items that reset daily on the campaign map and for griding old campaign nodes if you don't want to play for gold in guilds or the arena.\n\nThus far the development team has been very active, and the prospects look fairly bright for a 2yr old card game. Should anything change drastically I will update this review, but if you like TCG and have some time to kill, this game is definitly worth taking a look at.\n\nEDIT: After half a year things have only gotten MUCH BETTER for this game. Those marking it down arn't really giving it a chance at all. Many of the old arena and guild systems that caused some issue are being revamped. GANZ has released 2 new, game changing sets (with a third on it's way shortly). Older cards have actually been rebalanced to make them either playable, or to reign in some of the OP nonsense that pushed many newer players away. And deck building is going to be revamped to encourage more balanced and tactically based decks, dealing with the no.1 complaint of some competitive decks being nothing but a mash up of the highest curved cards. Some issues remain from the time ANTIC ran this game, but everything is looking up and it should definitely be given a fair chance.","February 18, 2015","true","461.5"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","16","26","0","1"

The gameplay is extremely easy and lacks strategy considering that the entire "evil" catagory as well as many other cards from other catagories are dedicated to random effects.

Game usually ends within 7 turns. The objective is the same as any other Collectible Card Game. You can see a lot of similarities with Hearthstone.\n\n1. Reduce your opponent's life points to zero before you do.\n2. Cast Spells/Summon creatures with mana, creature have damage and hit points\n3. Attack or defend\n4. Add a Rune Word, Gear\n4. Rinse, repeat\n\nI'll recommend it because you ought to see what they have created. It's a good effort but the buying of expansion booster packs with cash isn't something I want to do. It will be extremely hard to make me want to come back and play repeatedly.\n\nPROS\n1. Heroes\nThe hero art is amazing. Unlike Hearthstone, each hero is unique. Their health points, mana gain and abilities are different. 14-16 health points, 1-3 mana gain per turn and up to 3 abilities. These abilities don't cost mana but use charges.\n\nSomething similar to the heroes from World of Warcraft The Card Game, the card game that died.\n\n2. Campaign\nThe map is intriguing, You feel like you are exploring.\n\n3. Rune Words\nThey work like Global Enchantments. Both players are affected by it but they expire after X number of turns. Interesting concept but there are similar ideas in Might and Magic : Duel of Champions.\n\n4. Gear\nYou attach them to your hero and they have an effect. They are permanent and are pretty good to use. E.g. Longsword. Deal 1 damage to enemy hero per turn.\n\nCONS\n1. Creature Slots\nLimited to 3 (1 top, 1 mid, 1 bottom)\n\n2. Art\nThe map looks like a kid drew it but it is somewhat interesting. Especially when you reach the capital city. You will feel like you are exploring some thing interesting.\n\n3. Repetition\nIt's the same few boring matchups. You see the same cards over and over again. E.g. Beggar/Vagrant, Traitor.\n\n4. Crafting\nDoesn't seem exciting at all. You put a core, sprinkle some essence (up to the hundreds of essence, you start with 10) and you "gachapon" a potential rare card.\n\n5. Pay-To-Win\nYou can get 1 booster card pack for 5000 Gold in the game but in order to get expansion packs, you need crystals. If they had sold expansion booster packs for Gold, it would still be bad, but at least someone without money could theoretically grind like crazy and get all cards.\n\n6. Energy\nYou need Energy to go campaign questing. This is very silly. You're in a middle of a quest, you want to see what the developers have done.\n\nSuddenly, you reach a point on the map where you don't have enough Energy and "5 Crystal to refill everything or 5000+5000*(no of times you used gold) to refill energy and we'll give you an additional 5 more Energy" .\n\nSome things you should never bring over from Facebook.\n\n7.

If you're a fan of card games, the campaign and sealed tournaments will provide some entertainment value.\n\nUnfortunately the player population is low due to a combination of factors.\n\n1. Price to complete a deck is insanely high, I almost have 2-4x of every rare in a set, opening what feels like 50-60 packs, and I still have 0 of the "epic" rarity card I'm chasing. Crafting system is undeveloped and the resulting cards are based on RNG. Consecutive patches have increased the price of packs and removed gold rewards for time spent playing the game. A cautionary sign of a company trying to milk the last drops of money from a game.\n\n2. Game balance is a joke. The ways to kill or invalidate creatures have become so mana efficient, that there are only three deck types left playable. Gear (enchantment) decks, rush decks, or control decks that only have overpowered creatures in it (Either a 2 mana creature that comes into play and tutors a specific card in your deck, that typically generates more mana, and also returns 2 mana on death, Or a 3 mana creature that in the equivalent of MTG would be a 3 mana 0/3 that comes into play and gives something three -1 atk counters and gives itself three +1 atk counters, and also happens to resist burn dmg. EDIT: They just released a hero that can morph all creatures that cost 3 mana or more into 1/1 peasants. A hero ability. It costs 0 mana. But it's balanced because you're probably gonna need to spend money to unlock it as the patch also reduces your gold gained from playing the game.\n\n3. The majority of the vocal population in the game have played for 2-3 years, and numbers somewhere between 40-100 players from what I can tell. These people all resist change zealously and are blinded by fear of their overpowered cards getting nerfed and becoming unable to trash new players with a blindfold on.\n\n4. Very little player-to-player interaction in the game. There are no "events" and the daily quest is always the same, start 10 matches vs an AI opponent, go to menu, and select surrender. Yep, that's right. The daily quest every 18 hours, is always the same, and involves selecting surrender 10 times in a row to earn 20 cents. Guild battles are done entirely through AI. When you attack a guild, the AI takes control of the defenders deck. The AI algorithm also cheats as it selects the best play based on simulations of every possible play, meaning all guild defense decks rely on cards with RNG as it is predicted by the AI.\n\nIf you're used to a game like Hearthstone giving you cards everyday like candy, this game tries its hardest to screw over new players and prevent you from getting cards. If you are going to spend money, it's highly recommended to use the real money currency to buy singles, as the packs are all a trap. In fact, some of the cards are only obtainable with the real money currency (Tribes 2 set).\n\nOverall the vibe I'm getting from the developers is one of indifference, they seem to have given up on drawing in new players. I do recommend CCG fans give it a try at least though, as the game is fun for the first 5-10 hours and it's free.","March 8, 2015","false","368.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","6"

You have energy only in campaign, not in the pvp. Progressing through campaign is optional as it gives you free cards. Besides, energy regenerates pretty fast and there is no need to spend any money here.\nDon't let my number of hours played of Steam fool you, I have played this game well over 2 years, and seen some pretty drastic changes. This game had it's ups and downs, changed developers but also had a devoted community that stayed with the game the entire time.\n\nAnd for a good a good reason. Kingdoms is one of the best CCG out there with very strategic combat despite it's apparent simplistic board.\n\nPros\n\nLot's of cards and lots of potential for different strategies\n\nThe combat is fun\n\nYou can buy most of the specific cards for gold in the singles market, no need for booster packs to get that specific card (gold is the in-game currency)\n\nYou can get their real money currency (gems) for free from completing daily quests, daily chests and campaign. You can use those gems to get cards faster or get some exclusive cards\n\nNot pay to win. Although it takes a decent amount of time, you can play competitively without spending any real money. Need proof? I'm in the top 50 with no money spent EVER.\n\n\nCons\n\nBooster packs just rose up in gold price, making it tougher for newer players to catch up to old players. A recent decision from the new devs, that's been harshly criticized from the community. We have to wait and see if they will revoke the change.\n\nThere get no rewards after from pvp after you complete all the daily quest and run out of energy in the campaign. You will have to wait tomorrow for the quests to reset. It's not too bad as it you will get to this point only after several hours.\n\nThere are some VIP cards that you can get only with real money invested in the game. Still, it's not p2w since the cards are interesting but not that often seen in the competitive scene.\n\nThere are guilds, but the guild system is not very exciting as you play against AI controlled, player constructed decks.","January 23, 2015","true","0.5"," 25 of 48 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","25","48","0","0"

That said, there are many glaring flaws. The interface is wonky. Card abilities are often explained poorly, or not at all (why don't the cards that make an enemy "Weak" tell me what that means?). Each hero has several abilities, but the game refuses to tell you what they do until they're ready to use. In the tutorials, you can only read the details of the cards that you've been ordered to play next. There's an energy system, and I haven't played long enough to know how much it gets in the way, but there are areas in the campaign that require you to wait two real world hours to activate again and those are VERY annoying.\n\n(edit: I got a card that boosts all "Light Alliance" creatures, but I didn't seem to have any L.A. creatures... turns out that L.A. refers to three "good guy" factions, which they could have just easily written out on the card.

I'd go so far as to say is Kingdoms is the best online only CCG I've ever played. I've played the other ones on here, Solforge, Infinity Wars, Might And Magic, Bloodrealm Battlegrounds. And after awhile it just feels like your just banging cards together and playing a slightly more advanced variation of war. Kingdoms has so much more variety with what you could do with your decks. Aggro, control, mid-range, burn, tons of combo decks that play totally differently. The "Heroes" you can choose to play your deck with are really diverse, each one feels really different and has a huge effect on the game. The creatures, gears and spells you can play can do so much interesting stuff.\n\nMore so than any other online CCG, I'd say that this game is closer to the complexity and diversity of Magic: The Gathering. And if you've played M:TG, you'll be able to pick this up in like 5 minutes. It's got the same basic concept of mana, things cost mana, kill your opponent by attacking with guys and using spells. And It's nice that mana isn't some randomly inserted cards in your deck that you might not draw and have to lose a game for kind of a stupid reason. You just always get 2 mana a turn unless something is changing that.\n\nThere's a decent amount of different formats and different ways you can play. A format for players with more stuff that has almost no restrictions on what you can run. A format with limitations on how many of the rares cards you can use that's more quickly accessible to new players. You can play against AI if you're not ready to play real players and still earn the in game currency. There's a guild system that really helps you to earn gold and get a better idea about deck building with tiers that range from people just starting to top level competitive stuff. And there's a really active chat right on the side of the game and people are generally pretty chill and willing to help with questions and the best stuff to do when you're getting started.\n\nThis is the CCG I've stuck with for 2 and a half years (on a different site, not Steam. Hence the not having a lot of time on the game here) and still actively play. No other online CCG ever kept my interest like that.","January 30, 2015","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"

If you manage to overcome the confusing layout and navigation you'd discover the amazing depth this game has to offer.\n\nTake it slow and don't fret because you can't get all the cards right away ;P\n\nEdit: While i still agree with my previous statement that this game has potential, the current developers have failed in improving the game in the right ways, which is why i'm changing my review.\nEven with the latest update: "New Player improvement" It's impossible for new players to get a decent deck, that'll pair up with others in arena, trough campaign rewards.\n\nThe game should quickly let people get "good" at the game, but then make it a grind to become masters.","February 20, 2015","false","64.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mainly because it tried to combine and add loads of content, back with the old developers, without thinking it trough.\nHowever, when i compare this CCG to Hearthstone i see more potential and strategic deckbuilding here and that's why i'd recommend this game to all CCG fans. If you manage to overcome the confusing layout and navigation you'd discover the amazing depth this game has to offer.\n\nTake it slow and don't fret because you can't get all the cards right away ;P\n\nEdit: While i still agree with my previous statement that this game has potential, the current developers have failed in improving the game in the right ways, which is why i'm changing my review.\nEven with the latest update: "New Player improvement" It's impossible for new players to get a decent deck, that'll pair up with others in arena, trough campaign rewards.\n\nThe game should quickly let people get "good" at the game, but then make it a grind to become masters.","February 20, 2015","false","64.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
