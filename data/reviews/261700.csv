Your melon-shaped protein and steroids were stolen so now you're gonna unleash the roid-rage at every living and non living unlucky enough to cross you. You'll die hundreds of times but it won't matter, nothing can stop you when you're this pent up. You're so strung out that death phases you for a mere brief repose before you continue tearing a trench through every inch of terrain in between you and the promise of giant burly muscles contained in your melon.\n\n10/10, would laugh at death a hundred more times in order to get big.","November 2, 2014","true","7.3"," 101 of 114 people (89%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","89","101","114","31","0"

Because, that's just not what Eryi's Action is all about.\n\nBefore you buy / play this game, you should know what you're getting into.\n\nThis is a troll puzzle / platformer.  It will kill you as most traps you don't see coming until they're sprung on you, and then you need to figure out a way past them.  Most of the time, this is easy.  Sometimes, the solutions could stomp you for a while - I ended up using a walkthrough to get past a few traps.\n\nThat said, I found this game quite fun, and the traps funny the first time they killed me.  Afterwards, I'd laugh at myself for falling for the same traps over and over after forgetting they're there, while I'd hurry from the checkpoint to the latest revealed trap.\n\nMy favorite traps are the multistage ones, where you think you have a way past them, but that just springs another trap :)\n\nP.S.  This game is *not* one of those "tough as nails platformers."  Some parts are moderately hard, yes, but nothing close to what's required in the likes of Super Meat Boy, They Bleed Pixels, Electronic Super Joy, or Gianna Sisters.","November 26, 2013","true","1.6"," 123 of 146 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","123","146","2","1"

It seems to sense when you let your guard down or have come to expect something and then laughs as it springs another clever trap to take yet another life away.\n\nI have no doubt that there is a devious form of artificial intelligence built into every single copy and programmed with the sole motivation of crushing you.  It is clearly rewarded with every successful trap as there is no doubt that this game, this evil force, this new form of life(?), is gaining great delight at your every failure and soul crushing death.\n\nI used to think platformers were the one thing I understood.

Well...\n\nWhat can I say about Eryi's Action that hasn't been said already? No idea, but I can tell you that this game will likely make you hate everyone around you. Go on.\n\nPlay it.\n\nPlay it for an hour. Play it for one hour and try to stop playing. You can't. You'll keep playing because this innate arrogance inside you will not let you give it. It will not let you believe that you are a creature that exists in this world that is incapable of surpassing the agonizingly cruel traps and hazards within this sickeningly adorable game. You will continue to play. You will play past your limitations.\n\nYou will play, and you will die, and you will die and die and die. And you will keep playing.\n\nTry to stop though, and look around yourself briefly. You might not notice it at first but your reality has changed. Nothing is how it once was. Birds no longer chirp, the sun has lost some of it's glow, your walls seem to sweat with a dreadful dew, and the faces of those around you seem to sag with a pulpy gloom, like bubble wrap. You want to pop every single bubble wrap face you see, except the bubbles are filled with habanero sauce, that spits into your eyes as you pop them so it only enrages you more.\n\nYou will hate everyone you ever met and will meet because of this game. And yet you will find it within you somehow to continue to play this hellborn game.\n\nSo do I recommend this game?\n\nYes.\n\nYes I do.

Once on Desura and again on Steam, but if you think that makes it so good I’d buy it twice, no its so awful I’d buy it twice just to warn you all what a terrible 2D side scrolling torture platformer it is. Now for starters, I love 2D platformers and side scrollers. I love Mario, Super Meat Boy and I’ve even played hardcore platformers like “I wanna be the Guy.”\n\nEryi’s Action is a painful sort of difficult. Its a game based on memorization instead of skill. Each level forces you to remember where every obscure death trap is located. Its as if the developers read documents on how not to make a Mario level and used it to make this game. If an area looks like typical grass, you might think its safe to jump on, but that just means there could be spikes that jump out. Climb a ladder? Well that triggers spikes to fall on you. Try to hop on an enemy that 30 other enemies that look exactly the same…. it will hop into you, causing you to die. Think that platform is a platform? Nope you can’t walk on it and you go straight through.\n\nIts all about remembering where the traps are and avoiding them. Its not fun. Deaths are constant, too constant to enjoy the game. The music is bad and repetitive, the death sound is like a cheese-grater on your nerves. You’ll die so much that the life counter will go into the negatives. That’s part of the joke. You don’t have lives, you have negative lives. It just keeps going. I think the real fun people are having is recommending it to unsuspecting shoppers.\n\nLooking at Steam’s achievement page, its odd that so many people can love this game and review it so favorably when a mere 60% of people score the first achievement. You can tell how tough a game is by the drop off in achievement percentages. If you endure, you’ll memorize a level enough to get plenty of achievements in less than thirty minutes, but most people can’t even do that. Thirty percent of players have made it to the first goal flag. That should be staked as a warning for anyone that dares buy this game.\n\nI didn’t find joy in Eryi’s Action on Desura and I couldn’t find any fun in it on Steam. This game tests your endurance. How much can you endure before you quit? I didn’t feel any sense of happiness or joy that I had finished a level. In fact completing a level means there are more traps even after you think you’re safe. When you complete a level you have no control over your character and no way to prevent falling into a death trap.\n\nIf you’re into memorization platformers, this game is for you, but I strongly recommend everyone avoid it. Even at a paltry $5, the risk is still to great that you won’t enjoy it.

By the type I mean the tough as nails and brutal sort which repeatedly hits you again and again and yet, somehow still has you coming back for more punishment. In this game everything is trying to kill you from the obvious (Spikes, Enemies, Lava) to the non obvious such as windmills falling apart as you walk under them, blocks that throw spikes out without warning, traps to stop you from finishing the level unless you play smart.\n\nAnd thats the key thing here, smarts. Yes, some trial and error is involved but that is the reason you are given unlimited lives yes? The way through is simple and thats this. Dont think this as a platformer game. Thats only going to keep you angry, fustrated and at times totally unable to move along. Instead think of this as a PUZZLE title as soon certain things keep appearing, certain areas become noticeable as you go along and on reaching new areas, you already have a good idea on what to do and not to do.\n\nThinking this as a puzzle title also helps when the game gets to its most brutal ways and can have you thinking of alternate solutions, ideas and 'experiements' Does this go here? What would happen if I made this do this and so on. It works brilliantly and I find it so much more fun thinking of it this way!\n\nThe controls are fine, nothing to comment on. Precise enough when you get the hang of them and usually if you fall into an open pit (one that hasnt just appeared out of nowhere that is), its your own fault, not the game. The graphics too are bright, colourful and pretty to look at. Okay though... some of the backgrounds are a bit dull but thats about it.\n\nEssentially: Not a Platformer - Its a Puzzle. Think that way. Go in too with a 'Screw you game! You cant beat me!' attitude along with a never give up one and you are definetly going to have a good time.","November 25, 2013","true","1.0"," 32 of 48 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","32","48","0","0"

It's entire foundation exists merely to frustrate and aggravate you as quickly and cheaply as possible. That ordinary looking patch of grass? Spikes. Those previously stable boxes? They disappear now. That completely empty piece of space right where you need to jump? There's actually a box there to bump into. You can't even select a level without an enemy jumping out to kill you, or pass the end flag without a spike dropping on your head.\n\nThis isn't clever, and this isn't fun; it's cheap and annoying trial and error with no explanation or point at all. Everything unfolds like a bad Loonytoons sketch, where Eryi dying is the butt of every joke, and nobody is laughing. Sending the sinking ship into the abyss is the poor presentation, consisting of simply drawn barely animated sprites, blurry backgrounds, and abysmal music. Controls are stiff and your character floaty as if she's constantly trying to walk on ice, which only adds to the ridiculous difficulty imposed on you.\n\nIf the developers sole intention was to make a game that was an unforgiving lesson in frustrating, well they absolutely succeeded. I somehow made it through three levels before realizing that there was no way I hated myself enough to finish it. This is hot trash which wouldn't cut it as a free flash game, but as something released on Steam you are expected to pay for it is simply insulting and you should stay far, far away. If only Nyu Media had done the same.\n\n*FOLLOW UP THOUGHTS*\nAfter reading several other reviews, as well as various posts on the forums, I will admit that maybe I expected something different than I should have from this game. While I stand by what I originally said, and still believe this to be cheap and annoying, clearly there is an audience that enjoys this style and I simply am not part of it. If you are amongst those that liked I Want To Be The Guy (and it's sequel IWTBTG Gaiden), then you will likely find this to be similarly entertaining. For everyone else, there is a good chance you will find Eryi's Action to be just as unpleasant as I did.","November 25, 2013","false","2.8"," 143 of 262 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","143","262","0","21"

This game plays out like slapstick comedy in videogame form.\n\nThe stages all feature various amusing traps that play with your expectations.  There are even bonus traps that you have to go out of your way to find -- they will humiliate you in even more creative, amusing, and memorable ways.\n\nThe game's not just silly traps, though.  The end of each stage usually features some sort of stage end trap, that you need to defuse or circumvent before being able to finish the stage properly.  These become little puzzles -- not too hard to figure out once you realize they're supposed to be puzzles, though.\n\nBoss stages are all rather unique, and may involve more puzzle-solving and also some unexpected genre changes.\n\nYou're given an unlimited number of tries to complete the game, though.  You start with two lives, and you will probably end up with negative several hundred when you finish the first time.\n\nUnlockables include a playable bonus stage, as well as an extra mode where you have to complete the game with limited lives -- and some changes to the stages, too!\n\n(Disclosure: I acquired this game as part of the Groupees Build a Greenlight Bundle.)","May 2","true","7.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

This game reminded me of that custom Mario level where the guy screamed and cried during the experience. The levels are riddled with bottomless pits, hidden blocks, etc. and the guy mentally broke down (exaggerated). The same experience can be found in Eryi. The game tosses traps at you and counts how many lives you lost. You need memorization of the levels in order to clear them. You will cheaply die a lot, memorize the traps, clear a section, rinse and then repeat. Though it's cute to see I got -50 lives, it felt like I didn't truly earn the deaths because the game keeps poking fun at it.\n\nI gave up early in this game because I'm too lazy to memorize each trap per level. For those who seek unfair platforming and get rewarded by exercising your brain, then this game is for you. Otherwise it's sadism that keeps you going.

Eryi controls like a bar of soap mounted on springs. She's floaty and slippery and jumps too high or too low, and while I eventually got the hang of her it just wasn't fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moodudu/recommended/261700/","moodudu","QP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moodudu/","411 products in account","Before you play Eryi's Action, you should go buy a melon. Preferably a honeydew, but I would suggest picking your favorite melon, whether that be cantaloupe, watermelon, or even the rare and delectable canary melon. No matter how tempted you are to eat the melon immediately upon getting it home, fight the urge, and play Eryi's Action instead.\n\nI am a sucker for games where you get to play as a cute, yet innocently brainless, heroine on a quest to accomplish something that seems utterly pointless. In this case, Eryi's treasured melon has been stolen by a rival fairy-troll named Farta. Not being the type to forgive such transgressions, or to get another likely easily-obtainable melon, our diminutive champion embarks on a trial-filled crusade against all odds to retrieve her hallowed memento. She gets as far as the front door, where a metal washing pan falls from the ceiling, crushes her skull, and kills her.\n\nOh, dear.\n\nNo worries! Through green-haired plant fairy magic (I guess), Eryi is able to regrow herself. Wise now, she evades the falling pan that led to her premature demise, and makes it to the first stage...only to be stripped by clothes-eating plants, mauled by something in a bear costume, knocked off the edge of the world by a chicken, abducted by a hot-springs loving alien frog, blown up by a bomb, and had her tender bottom pierced by spike traps. Eryi is determined though, and after honing her skills and memorizing the path through the minefield of traps, she finally makes it to the flag at the end of the level. And then she's bonked in the head by a falling spike-boulder on her way out.\n\nSuch is life in Eryi's world, ten levels of death-filled 2D platforming and puzzle solving that will test both your mental prowess and the quickness of your reflexes. There is a fantastic mix of each in the game. Once you finally figure out exactly where to put that mushroom to bounce over that huge wall, you're immediately mashing buttons in a panic trying to avoid the monsters on the other side. Just when you think you've got it figured out, the game throws you a curve ball, where you suddenly have an intense boss fight with a dragon or a race with a flying robot. It is great pacing, where I never got bored of doing one task, and it always seemed like something new was right around the corner.\n\nWell, it seemed that way. Most of the time, it was death that was right around the corner. But even that was something new: it was hilarious to see exactly how many ways Eryi could kick the bucket. I found myself hesitating while standing on each teleporting pot. I knew it was a trap. I knew it would lead to my death. But I still found myself hitting that down arrow instead of running toward that save flag, just to see what Farta's dastardly trap was that time.\n\nThat's part of the appealing magic this game has. Eventually, you are seeing traps everywhere, and you think you are wise to the tricks and ploys, only to find the game expects you to be wise to its tricks and ploys, so it kicks it up one more notch. A perfect example of this came about halfway through the game, where I saw a jump to a platform that was obviously a trap. I inched toward the edge, making sure no frog would suddenly jump out of the background, and jumped. Straight up, of course, never ever jump at an angle first. AHA! My head bonked against an invisible box, one that would have certainly led to my death if I had not been so astute. Hopping atop that box, and knowing there was still plenty of room on the screen for another hidden box, I leapt again. And sure enough, there was another hidden box revealed. I was sure I saw the trap then: I was expected to take a leap of faith right over the platform ahead, from atop the uppermost box. I chuckled. I wasn't even going to lose a life on this part. And then a spikeball fell on me when I jumped on the top box. I was laughing so hard that I died six more times before I was able to get to the platform, which didn't have a single trap on it. ...well, if you don't count the sudden plant out of nowhere that almost killed me a few seconds later.\n\nA lot of people seem to misunderstand this type of game concept, thinking it is some kind of test to find a holy player of legend who is so skilled that they will make it through the game on the first try without losing a single life, and then becoming very upset when that legendary player isn't them, and they watch their death toll rise to triple-digits on the first stage alone. This game isn't a test like that at all. Instead, it is a test of perseverance and the ability to learn. Then, after a few playthroughs and a couple thousand deaths, you can amaze your friends as they watch you play it, and you fool them into thinking you're that legendary player.\n\nThe final boss is also amazingly difficult. I really felt like I had accomplished something when she finally went down. I had that “YES, I did it,” moment that, as gamers, we all chase.\n\nSome of the funniest moments I had in the game were when my steam friends instant messaged me or started playing games of their own, and that little steam window popped up in the lower right corner to alert me. Except, in this game, because of the resolution, it isn't so little...it is huge. So huge it often covers up what's going on and leads to your death. As if the game couldn't troll me enough, it had to call in steam to do it too. I was able to laugh it off, and laugh it off quite heartily, but if you have lots of friends and are annoyed by such things, make sure you turn your steam alerts off before playing.\n\nI did play with a controller. I would highly suggest one for this game, as playing with a keyboard seemed clunky and awkward to me. The movement was liquid smooth with the controller though.\n\nI paid $2.49 for it, during the holiday sale, and I feel reasonably compensated. It is a bit short, but it also isn't a game you can sink your teeth into. It is just a charming little three hour distraction. For me, there is little replay value. I could collect hard-to-reach crystals, and I probably will, to unlock a hard mode, which I probably won't play. The final boss really pushed me to my limits, I couldn't even imagine what a hard mode of that would be like with only 30 lives. Still, a real hardcore gamer might find a true challenge there, and might enjoy those pursuits. It'd certainly make a good youtube video.\n\nBy the end of the game, I was wondering which Eryi would be the one lucky enough to survive. For me, it was Eryi Number 646 that finally defeated Farta and avenged her 645 fallen comrades.\n\nWhen you reach that point, when you have your surviving Eryi, the forces of evil are defeated, and the quest completed, go and get your melon. Cut yourself off a big slice of it, and dig in. It'll be the best melon you've ever tasted.","December 30, 2013","true","5.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It has nice cute retro graphics. Standard platform game mechanics. But it's deliberately difficult. Not even necessarily difficult as frustrating. You basically just memorize the traps. The problem is that there are too many traps. You get stuck repeating the same checkpoint area over and over and over. Nothing is predictable. You even get hit on the head by a giant metal pan like your first two steps into the game. And it made me laugh. It's even a Steam achievement. And I did laugh at some of the traps.

Eryi moves slow unless you hold the run button. The monsters move really slow too, which I think is meant to intentionally drive the player crazy.

I'd give this more of a sideways thumb if that were available.  Controls aren't particularly tight, nor is the game particularly enjoyable to look at, but it does do one thing right for this type of game, and that's be forgiving.  You have unlimited lives, with the game poking fun and counting your deaths with negative lives.  Levels have a number of checkpoints so any type of substantial progress will be rewarded and you're not forced to reply long stretches of levels.\n\nAll that said, this is more a gag game than a hard platformer.  There are going to be things like the stage select map ambushing you and killing you with a falling rock or whatever as you select stages simply because you're not prepared for it.  Level design is much the same, with a lot of parts where you just have to die a few times to learn the trick and how to exploit it.  If the game wasn't so forgiving, this would be quite annoying and I wouldn't have finished it, but lost progression isn't too much of a problem and the game is short enough that it doesn't outstay its welcome.\n\nAn okay game at sale price or if bought with a bundle, worth an install to see some of its tricks.

It was wonderful at first but I wanted to get past the first section of the level without dying for the 50th time; it literally says "-49" lives for me right now. The game trolls you by baiting you into traps you'd never expect, plummeting you against odds that are impossible to get through without dying. Lucky for me, I got it for a few cents so not a huge loss. Maybe I'll try to get through it when I'm bored because I want the poor girl to live but I feel like I'd never see it to the end. Plus, constantly sending a little girl to her death under the guise of a rogue game isn't really something I can find much entertainment in; romanticizing a woman's death is gross and overdone.

In the legacy of I Wanna Be The Guy, Cat Mario etc. You know what you're getting into when you look at it. Eryi's Action has this cute animelike thing with some nice sense of humor and hooks going on. And that's pretty much about the good things.\n\nGameplay/controls are extremely slippery, sometimes unresponsive at least for me, no apparent reason behind it. Enemy hitboxes are kind of wonky and sometimes you get killed just because you jumped in few frames wrong. Traps are sometimes genuine, but most the time they beg to be more clever than they try to be. Most of the time its about trial and error, memorizing every single thing in the level. Someone may call it challenging, I call it unreasonably repetitive. Sure its typical for the genre, but it can be done right.\nGames that most likely inspired this one were flash games. This game also feels like an flash game. Like something that could evolve into a proper game. That didn't happen. This is it.\n\nNow, there's all sorts of opinions, some people like stuff because they have it etc, people can forgive about lots of flaws. Lets put those aspects aside for a second. This game has its moments, but those moments aren't saving much. I'm sorry and all that.\n\nIt is relatively cheap tho so you can get it and try it out. But I wouldn't recommend it to hardcore platformer fans who are looking for challenge. Maybe you enjoy the humor for what it is but be prepare to be frustated for all the wrong reasons.","December 22, 2013","false","2.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Thus comes the question: "Would I recommend it?" The short answer is "maybe, if you like stupid hard games." But, please, allow me to try to explain my reasoning.\n\nLet's begin thinking about Eryi's Action in terms not as a piece of merchandise you (likely) have to hand over a specified amount of money to get your hands on, but as something that was made to entertain its users, or, in other words, let's think about it as "art", if you will, for a little bit. Around the internet (YouTube and Reddit, mostly) I've found people slamming this game because they think that the level design is flawed, not because it's hard as all ♥♥♥♥, but because it's difficulty usually stems from that which very easily feels like cheating: Spikes that come out of  the ground without previous warning that there might be such a thing in that area, those same spikes that jump at you if you initially evade them but stand there for a little too long, blocks that you can get stuck on and shot at or disintegrate when you try to stand on them, masses of solid ground that move so you fall into a pit... Compared to other games like Super Meat Boy or the Binding of Isaac, where you can see the level and are aware of mostly everything before venturing on (enemies and/or traps), and if you die it's entirely your fault and not because the game tricked you, it's clear that Eryi's Action doesn't follow the conventions games with similar difficulty level share. In this one, if you don't already know what's ahead, you will die. And you need to die in order to learn what you have to do to advance. It's a lot of trial and error.\n\nIt's true that sometimes it feels like it pulls cheap tricks to kill you, but does that make it "a bad game"?, or, changing the question a little, is it "flawed"? As I see it, no. At least not in terms of level design. The creators did exactly what they wanted in order to make the player fail numerous times in different ways. It feels like they created fairly standard levels that you'd find in the initial stages of old Mario games, then went back and proceeded to rig them with traps of all kinds. It's made to play with your expectations of what a level should do and to make you doubt of what you see or can't see. But once you have the knowledge to pass that part, it depends on your skills.\n\nThis isn't a game that's hard only for the sake of being hard. Every time you die you can tell what killed you and why, the puzzles you encounter are never random. Pure chance doesn't have a place in this game. To beat this you need skill, patience and simple abilities to memorize traps. If you don't finish this game it's not because it's an irredeemable cheating sack of ♥♥♥♥, it's because you quit... or forgot you have it.\n\nSome have called it a "deconstruction" or a "parody" of the genre, and to that I say: There are movements in the world of arts that go contrary to each other, and if videogames can truly be considered "art", then I fail to see a reason for that to not apply to videogames as well. In other words, I agree.\n\nNow, back to the real world, videogames are made by an industry that feeds off of money, and in this case it's your money. At the end of the day, as much as you want to call a game "art," it's a product usually made to produce money for whoever developed it, and to do that it has to be entertaining. That brings us to the question: Is the amount of entertainment enough for your dough? I honestly don't know.\n\nI did not buy this game, it was a gift. Someone I follow on Twitter posted "Who wants Eryi's Action?", I replied with "I don't know what that is, but I do" and now it's in my library. But no matter how I got it, this game is not free, it cost someone 5 USD, and down here in México that's enough to take the bus and get a cheap meal. I've already said that I enjoyed this game, even if I found it frustrating at times, but it's really short. With 7 levels and 4 bosses you can finish it in one lazy afternoon when you have nothing to do. The cute graphics, although they helped make my frustration a lot bearable (in my case), are not of uniform quality. Having some sprites (like Eryi's) being well animated but all of the bosses having very few animations is weird and jarring. Some of the common enemies suffer from that too, like the flames that have no animation at all. Overall it looks pretty but at the same time rushed and unpolished.\n\nPeople have mentioned that this is a game that should be free, but I don't think I can agree. For one thing the developers need to eat; they made a game that I consider short, but at the same time it's packed with a lot of stuff and is fun to play. And on the topic of length, I still don't know if it's a detriment or something that helps it succeed because it doesn't overstay it's welcome.\n\nA big reason why I don't think it'd be good for this game to be free, is because when something has a price attached to it people tend to start paying attention and taking it seriously. As good and awesome as some free games are, if I was told "there's this super hard game that you can download for free over there", I likely would've replied with "eh, I'll check it out later, maybe", then probably proceed to completely forget all about it. But if I was told that there was a really hard platformer that's on the store, and seemed fun in videos, then I would've been interested. It's basic gut feeling, not purely logic, that makes you care about something when your money is potentially involved, even if it's not a lot.*\n\nThat's why I can't give it a strong recommendation. Even though I consider it a fun unconventional game, it lacks stuff that could make it feel like a complete game. I'd love to see Eryi's Action 2 with better graphics and slightly longer story mode, but at the same time I don't know if that'd be a smart move for the company.\n\nI hope this review helped some of you decide whether to buy it or not. Thank you for reading.\n\n\n*This is a conclusion I reached after discussing it with a few friends. Hopefully I'm not making a gross and mistaken generalization.","March 27, 2014","true","6.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Be aware, that you will not be able to beat the game within one playhthrough; be prepared to die even more often than you would in Dark Souls. This game is much more polished than Syobon Action and less difficult and unfair, I think; it doesn't feel unfair at all, if you know, what's expecting you in this game.\nFor now I made it to the next-to-last level, and 'til now all the levels were absolutely beatable. For me, it was never frustrating to die even 20 times in a row because of one single enemy, and I'm at about -300 lives yet. The graphics are simple, cute and lovely, although the game just supports a low resolution; but for me, it's fine.\nThe achievements also are not too difficult to get, and they motivate you to play the game again, even after you've finished the story.\n\nSo, if you like tricky Jump'n Runs, if you like retrying levels often, and if you have no problem with dying about 50 times per level, this game is just for you. Do not buy this if you want a Sonic-like Jump'n Run where you can rush through the levels like  you have to get to the toilet immediately; but if you like, what you're reading, just give it a shot.\n\nAnd it seems like I'm the only one, who's okay with the controls.","May 12, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To you I suggest this:\n\n- Turn off your computer screen as it emmits radiation that could endanger you.\n- Stay away from other radiation sources like WiFi and microwaves.\n- Turn off all the power in your house as you never know when a spark could burn down you and all you own.\n- Seal all windows and doors with bolts to the point where it's airtight.\n- Drink lots and lots of fluids and sleep alot.\n\nWe sure live in a dangerous world.","January 9, 2015","true","6.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

There's fans of this type of game and unless you're the kind that enjoys endless mindless memorization combined with trial and error and very very loose controls then avoid. There is a noticable and most likely deliberate lag in the controls regardless of what method you choose. So sloppy controls combined with pixel perfect gameplay and non-sensical rule on what is and is not safe makes for a rather bland dull game. Oh, and the music, you'll end up turning it off immediately. It loops and repeats forever over every death and never changes. And to add to all this, the deaths take forever to respawn. First you die, then you bounce, then other things bounce, then you have to wait for all that to fall off the screen AND the musical WAHWAAAAAAAH to finish, and god help you if you trigger another trap at the same time.","November 29, 2013","false","0.3"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

It's essentially built around trolling the player, and with the horrible movement and controls, you can't even try to have fun doing that.\n\nStay away.","September 21, 2015","false","1.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

Not only is it hard, but you need timing, precision, reflexes, good thinking and alot of patience. I would class this game as one of the hardest I have ever played, being really frustating and even funny sometimes. It's a weird game, if you're looking for a very hard game to complete, it's only 5$, buy it...

EA casts the player as Eryi; a cute anime girl with cute pantsu and a stolen melon. To track down the dastardly melon thief and recover her tasty treat Eryi must transverse 10 levels of incredibly hard but also charming action.\n\nEyri is a truly sadistic game. Under its cute exterior and charming presentation lurks a game that will kill you over and over. spikes will suddenly fall on poor Eryi's head, enemies will pop[ out of nowhere and blocks will appear to completely ruin any jumps you might have attempted. This is more fun than frustrating howsoever. Traps can be avoided with memory and practice and the game is always amusing with its aggressively cute presentation and tendency to still catch you in  traps by simply catching you another way after your;e sure you've avoided them. Dying hundreds of times is par for the course.\n\nEA looks and sounds great. the game is very colorful and eyecatching and Eryi herself is super cute,. enemies are also cute creatures and cute girls who don't look threatening at all. The sound is also well done and the music is very catchy.\n\nEryi's Action is a very enjoyable game for patient gamers and those who want a serious challenge.

Basicly a stereotypical platformer, the challenge here are the countless inhumanly diabolic placed traps that you'll encounter. A lot.\nCute graphics give a nice contrast to the actual difficulty and might fool you once in a while. Save Points are set well, dividing the course into short parts. It is a lot more relaxing to repeat only a part of the course rather than the whole thing. I addition to that, you can't go GAME OVER. After wasting all of your TWO (!!!) lives the game continues with zero, then -1 ,-2, -3 and so on, giving you a nice, sometimes depressing impression of how you are doing.\n\nI got this game in a bundle though, but I surely don't regret the purchase.

Challenging implies a degree of fairness and a possibility of winning, fun implies you’ll actually enjoy the experience and additively doesn’t even make sense in that sentence.\nEryi’s action is cheap.  Right now it’s selling for 4 bucks.  If you get the right trading cards and sell them in the market for the right price, you can almost get the game for free (not really free, but if someone is willing to pay 75 cents for an imaginary trading card they deserve to be buying other people games. )\nIt’s also cheap, as in grossly unfair.  The only clue to help you find the traps is being killed by them.  Unlike the memory game from Robot Chicken, there is enough randomness to keep you from learning from your mistakes.  SPOILER ALERT!! The traps also kill you in places and ways that have always been sacred in platformers.  Giant pans fall from the ceiling in your house (that does technically meet building code in China).  Spike balls that you could easily jump over land in your path after you raised the level complete flag and no longer control you character as she walks to the end of the level.  Monsters even kill you on the stage selection world map.  They might as well kill you just for pressing start.\nIn conclusion (yes, again,) if someone asks you what your safe word is and you have to think about it, don’t buy this game.  If on the other hand, life isn’t unfair enough or you just hate yourself, then pick it up.  Don’t say I didn’t warn you.","November 27, 2013","false","1.4"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","8","18","2","1"

I was wrong.\n\nIt turned out to be something of those crazy hacked Mario type of games, but was more polished. Everything in the game looks and feels nice, until you strated your journey and learned that it wouldn't be a smooth ride. The game tried to counter the behaviors imprinted into gamers for decades, it targeted our trained reations and tuanted at us like those a-holes in school (but smaters)\n\nPlaying this game, I felt frustrations, but in a good way... because instead of doing things I've been doing for all these years before finishing the game and move on to another one, I got to think hard about how to proceed each of my steps because I know the game would always throw some nasty things on my plate along the way.","November 30, 2013","true","6.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Sending the sinking ship into the abyss is the poor presentation, consisting of simply drawn barely animated sprites, blurry backgrounds, and abysmal music. Controls are stiff and your character floaty as if she's constantly trying to walk on ice, which only adds to the ridiculous difficulty imposed on you.\n\nIf the developers sole intention was to make a game that was an unforgiving lesson in frustrating, well they absolutely succeeded. I made it through one level before realizing that there was no way I hated myself enough to finish it.

What I got was a Mario-esqe platformer that made me curse like a sailor.\n\nEverything about this game, from the controls, to the cutesy graphics, and such, is just fine. I really can't say anything about them other than they work well.The game runs smoothly enough and there is your standard challenge present in platformers. That is, until you find out that box happens to be a bomb, or you run back to a platform to escape an enemy only for it to pull back on you.\n\nThis game is pure, unadultrated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but in a fun way. The challenge doesn't come from needing your reflexes to save you or for you to speed through enemies. The challenge comes from within; you end up second guessing yourself way more than you should. It isn't a bad thing though; unlike other games where puzzles and trials are often vague and misused, in this game that is the intention, which is to troll the living hell out of the player.\n\nThe genre needed a shake-up for some time and a game like this does it in a fun way. It twists normal platforming conventions on their head and takes advantage of our familiarity with it to do so.

Everything, from you to the enemies you get constantly murdered by (which will happen on average every 1.5 seconds) is a kawaii-uguu, rainbow-puking, flower-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ taking part in the extremely sadistic Moeshit Apocalypse of You Dying A Lot Except Also Kawaii or Something.\n\nOn multiple occasions you will get completely brickwalled by seemingly impassable hazards and roadblocks that you have to work around, often inventively and in unexpectedly hilarious ways. Every time you start up the game you begin in Eryi's house and have to evade being bonked to death by falling pans that will virtually always outsmart your movements and send your negative lives remaining count that much closer to infinity. You can even get killed while on the world map, because even the background props have murderous intent: there is pretty much nothing in this game that can't or won't deliberately kill you in some bizarre way.\n\nSo on the one hand there's you screeching and raging at the absurd difficulty of this game as a more or less perfectly programmed torture simulator, but on the other hand the outright unpredictable ways in which the game communicates to you just how much it hates you are literally nothing short of hilarious. This is a game about dying literally thousands and thousands of times, and you're more likely to get into a plane crash and be abducted by aliens at the exact same time than you are to clear this game without dying even once. You can't pull off a perfect no-miss run in this game because you were never meant to: nobody was. Otherwise you wouldn't have infinite lives and a counter that's always more than willing to rub in your face the number of times you've died. The object of the game is not preventing your death count from continuously rising, but solving platform puzzles which can be bypassed only via methods comparable to the unintentional exploits that let you fling yourself outside of the world map in the N64 version of Zelda OoT, except this time they're both deliberate and lying in wait to be discovered to hilarious effect.\n\nI don't think this is a kind of game you can just rate out of 10, so I won't. I just think it's positively hilarious and enjoyable unless you're literally some tryhard ♥♥♥♥♥ who thinks platformers are SRS BSNS or some ♥♥♥♥.","May 20, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I really enjoyed were the boss fights; it contained different STyles in defeating them (traditional hp fight, racing). The most work you'll putt in for a digital watermelon 10/10.","August 26, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This wouldn't be so bad if the whole of Eryi was what you were considering when you were making the jump. But the hitbox does not incorporate part of her feet and (during the final boss) the very top of her head, which makes figuring out where she'll collide with enemies, projectiles, and the ground itself, iffy to say the least.\n\nIt's a fun little rage platformer if you're into that. But be prepared to break the connection in your head to her body and her hitbox. Keep this in mind during the last boss fight especially and don't be afraid to let her toes touch the fireballs that the boss shoots.

However, this assumption is horribly... HORRIBLY WRONG. While guiding Eryi through 10 stages filled with peril to reclaim her stolen melon (Yes... a melon), you will encounter enough booby traps to make your hair fall out from pulling it so hard. That's right, it's THAT type of game. You know the kind. It's one of those games where you're all like "I'm gonna jump on this block over here." and the game's like "NOPE! YOU JUST GOT EATEN! YOU LOSE!" that just stomp at any tiny bit of sanity you had left before you started.\n\nWhile saying that, this game is still addicting and fun with tight controls and colorful visuals. Most of the traps have very specific trigger patterns and you'll eventually memorize these and be able to advance. While most of the ways you die in this game are indeed traps that you don't see coming, most of them are comical enough to where you'll get a chuckle out of each one. For example, a spinning windmill falls on your head the first time you walk by. "Hmm... maybe I'll try jumping over it." No sooner than a second after you jump over it, it detaches and comes after you.\n\nEryi's Action certainly isn't a game for everyone. However, those of us that find joy in memorizing patterns and failing hundreds of times (I died 550 times over the course of the game. Thank you infinite lives!) will fall in love with this charming little game from indie developer XTAL Sword.","February 25, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But that's not all, thinking logically also means thinking outside of the box. In this game you WILL die a lot, get stuck on some parts for quite a bit, but the feelings of completion is flawless, so if you think you're patience enough, get this game!\n\nLong version:\nDo you like brain-taxing, logical thinking game? If yes, get this game.\nDo you like funny and unexpected surprises? If yes, get this game.\nDo you like boss fights that are unique? If yes..... maybe consider the two points above first.\nSimilar to so-called "Cat Mario", this game takes "trolling" the player to skyscraper, but each stage is unique to their own, making all deaths seemingly funny but... er... you'll die a lot. I died a total of 789 times through the game (finished it),\nWhat will make the game appealing? First, it makes you think every stage, think outside the box, that is. Second, not only it lets you unleash your brainiac power, but it will also make you make use of your reflex, coordinations and timing. Third.... make sure you don't wreck your computer or keyboard, you may rage with this game.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? If you have the patience and mind and hands to play this game! Then go for it! It's not easy, but it's not hard, either! It's just.... brain-hurting sometimes!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XavierCrow/recommended/261700/","XavierCrow","FissionChip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XavierCrow/","213 products in account","***A MOSTLY SPOILER-FREE REVIEW***\n\nEryi’s Action is a game as funny as it is fun, which is to say - very both.\n\nA satirical take on plat-forming, reminiscent of games like “I Wanna Be the Guy”, Eryi’s Action is an indie title with surprisingly high production quality and a great deal of humour. Developers Xtal Sword have created something really solid here and if you like a particularly challenging pick-up-and-play platformer (with a little extra genre here and there) then you could do much worse than this.\n\nFirstly, all the assets in this game are great. The animation is really smooth, the sounds fit well without being distracting and the art is a top-notch stylistic nod to the games of yesteryear without being overly retro (think Super Mario World meets the Gameboy Advance). The characters and world design are very likeable, and hint at a much bigger universe behind the slice you see. It’s hard not to get a little sucked in by it all.\n\nThe music is particularly enjoyable, but annoyingly, it restarts every few seconds when you meet yet another grizzly end. The result is that you’ll never hear a full track unless you pause the game. I suppose if you were perfect at the game you might get the bonus of hearing each track uninterrupted and in full, but I very much doubt that this was an intentional feature so much as a happy accident. Having said that, I imagine the game would be less of a parody if the music were to continue oblivious to your untimely demise, so I can live with pausing every now and then if I want to take in the tunes.\n\nWhat stands out the most (or rather, not at all) are the controls. They’re pretty much perfect and never really get in the way. If you make a mistake, it feels like your mistake - not the controls, and that’s incredibly important for any game (and something so many get wrong!). There’s only a couple of questionable things about them. The first was in the very beginning - I somehow missed that there was a run button, and checking online it appears others have missed it too. I think it’s likely due to the slow acceleration, but once you know about it, it stops being an issue. The second problem is that there's a slight inability to jump when landing on descending platforms, as if you get glued to them, so you have to wait a second before jumping. I suppose that could be just another part of the challenge, but it feels a bit clunky given how polished and reactive the rest of the platforming is.\n\nThe game is not without its other minor problems either; most notably the difficulty curve which is a bit naught-to-ninety. Eryi’s Action has you thinking outside the box, and while that’s a fantastic thing for a plat-former to achieve, I can’t help but think it will drive a lot of players away by demanding too-much-too-soon.  I admit that I had to consult a walkthrough on a couple of occasions, one of which was at the end of the very first level. It wasn’t even a case of ‘obvious when you see it’; it was just a bizarre solution that wasn’t really hinted at. They really could have left that challenge to a later level and given the player the knowhow to clear one first. Another chink in the armour is the first boss you face. I definitely had a good chuckle when I figured it out, but it really appears to be impossible at first and I could definitely see people rage-quitting here. This is thinking outside the box stuff, and I love it, but I fear it was implemented a little too early. (edit: since this review I realised there's an achievement related to this which gives a clue, but I don't know anyone who would think to check there for help)\n\nGet through that much of the game however and you’ll be wise to its various trickeries, so it’s (mostly) clear sailing after that… at least as clear sailing as repeatedly dying can be! The game becomes a battle of wits to guess what the developer is thinking and counter it, and it results in hilarity almost every time you are killed in another unexpected way. This game really made me laugh a lot, and that in itself was worth the money paid and then some.\n\nWhat gets me about Eryi’s Action is this: with all the fantastic music, sound, art, controls, character design, level design, etc… why did Xtal Sword choose to make the game like this? A game designed to be so hard it will stop many people being able to enjoy it. A niche game that misses out on a potentially huge audience. It’s immediately clear that a lot of effort when into getting it just right, so why not make it a full-on plat-former and keep the over-the-top traps as a B-Type game for hardcore players who want a greater challenge? I suppose time and effort are limited and in the end this was a good solution, but I for one would love to see a return of Eryi in a more forgiving world, if only so more people could enjoy it.","April 27, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyway, onto the review. This simple game for 5 bucks is, for the most part, fun. It feels like a Kaizo or I wanna be the guy but more fair, in a sense. The levels are much shorter, with about three checkpoints per stage. Though there is a lot of memorization of patterns to get past sections, if you fail, there is little to re-do. The controls fall a little flat, Eryi not being able to jump immediately after you land on something, sometimes. The story, as well, falls a bit flat but I really wasn't expecting one really. Overall, the game is a mindnumbing experience. Frustration may, and probably will, come over you but, after spending 5 dollars, it's a nice frustration which some games find a difficulty to find.","May 2, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, this assumption is horribly... HORRIBLY WRONG. While guiding Eryi through 10 stages filled with peril to reclaim her stolen melon (Yes... a melon), you will encounter enough booby traps to make your hair fall out from pulling it so hard. That's right, it's THAT type of game. You know the kind. It's one of those games where you're all like "I'm gonna jump on this block over here." and the game's like "NOPE! YOU JUST GOT EATEN! YOU LOSE!" that just stomp at any tiny bit of sanity you had left before you started.\n\nWhile saying that, this game is still addicting and fun with tight controls and colorful visuals. Most of the traps have very specific trigger patterns and you'll eventually memorize these and be able to advance. While most of the ways you die in this game are indeed traps that you don't see coming, most of them are comical enough to where you'll get a chuckle out of each one. For example, a spinning windmill falls on your head the first time you walk by. "Hmm... maybe I'll try jumping over it." No sooner than a second after you jump over it, it detaches and comes after you.\n\nEryi's Action certainly isn't a game for everyone. However, those of us that find joy in memorizing patterns and failing hundreds of times (I died 550 times over the course of the game. Thank you infinite lives!) will fall in love with this charming little game from indie developer XTAL Sword.","February 25, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, it shouldn't be compared to Unfair Mario. I actually found Unfair Mario really annoying, yet I still enjoyed Eryi's Action. If you really want a good idea about what this game is like, look up a free browser game called Syoban Action (also known as Cat Mario). Eryi's Action was produced by the same guy who made Syoban Action (hence the similar names), and as such Eryi's action could be considered a spiritual successor; if you like Syoban Action, there's a good chance you'll like Eryi's Action.","March 1, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This would feel sloppy if it were on Newgrounds! The animation is choppy, the controls are slippery and the fact that they are asking for five bucks for this is just insane. This game offers very little new to the sea of platformers, with the only thing worth mentioning is its absurd, mind numbing, keyboard breaking difficulty. Let me provide an example: I tried to leap onto a platformer to get a diamond and a wall suddenly appeared in front of me and blocked my path, which resulted in spikes appearing above me and killed me. Or how about this example: I tried walking out of my house and a sea of pie pans fell from the sky and killed me. Or this: The game told me to jump into a vase to teleport somewhere and I was teleported into a spike filled pit and died on the spot! You know how people are always saying that games like Five Nights at Freddy's are only bait for people that makes walkthrough of them getting scared? Well this game is bait for people who make walkthroughs of them rage quiting! There is no logic, reason, strategy, thought, or effort but into the difficulty. Its noting more then a trial and error simulator where you have to memorize where all the traps are. I died over 40 before I was half way through the first level. 80% were not my fault because a bed of spikes or killer plants suddenly appeared beneath me or a the ground fell out from under me, or the game straight up LEADING ME INTO A DEATH TRAP. None of this is the slightest bit fun and is only VERY annoying for lack of better (and four lettered) words. This game was an absolute waste of money and utterly unenjoyable.

I find the game boring and a test of my patience more then my skill. Which I do not like in my games. I have better things to do and I know that you do too even without meeting you because I know that you value your time (except for the 2 or 3 people that have nothing better to do then waste their time. To those people I say. Go ahead and waste your time. I hope you have a long and fullfilling life). That's how unsatifying playing this game is. Don't waste your money. You aren't missing anything. This game is bad game design at it's worst. This type of difficulty is only designed to falsely extend the length of the game just like a lot of the classics. But this game is nothing like the classics I grew up with. It lacks any kind of creativity or nuance to the way it traps you into unavoidable deaths. Play Bloodborne instead. You can even tell people you beat/platinumed it without feeling enbarrassed. It's more challenging and it is based on your skill playing the game not trial and error. If you are observant you will see the traps (a switch on the floor with a hole in the wall. I wonder what that does?) before you die to them because it is not cheap and unavoidable. It's trying to test your skill not your patience and how much free time you have to keep dying to cheap  deaths only to get nothing for it. You learn absolutly nothing from your deaths in Eryi's Action and a lot of the time you won't even know why you died.\n\n\nThis game is disgusting. It has a little girl that is probably no older then 6 that, if you stand still, will jump up and down so her panties will show. WTF? I didn't realize this at first but was greeted to this animation after a bathroom break. If you have too much money and time to waste or external validation for beating a game like this then it might just be the game for you. Just don't expect any actual reward for beating it. The game has no ingame rewards. The exact opposite of other 'challenging' games. No rewards for playing or any hints to pay attention to too avoid death. So yes no skill needed either. Just see the death once then avoid it next time. This game tests your patience, nothing more. The "difficulty" comes from cheap deaths. This game would be equally fun and a lot more rewarding/worthwhile to play if they added hints of where traps are. That way observant players could avoid them and feel rewarded. Instead of having the entire game based around trial, error, and the amount of patience I have.\n\nNope. Nope. Nope. Not recommended. There are 0 reasons to play this game. There are no positives. It is just not a rewarding game to play. Since there are no indications of where traps are placed there is no skill involved in beating a level. It instead is about patience. No reflex or observation skills needed like the games it is trying to emulate (Mario). There is no sense of reward after beating a level as a result of this. Only a mixed feeling of elation and regret. Regret at the time you wasted and elation at the fact that you will never have play the previous level again. For this I can not recommend it. Even if you beat this game because you want to prove how good you are at poorly made, frustrating games, who will care? There isn't a single reason to play this game. Beyond making easy rage videos on Youtube with it. The only people that will enjoy this game are people that are trying to prove they are "Otaku" (but are they really enjoying it if they are just trying to prove something?) by showing they have too much money and time to have the sense to know what to do with either of them by beating this game. If you find a valid reason to play this game let me know because I have no idea why anyone would play it. Let alone truly enjoy beyond the easy rage views they will get from Youtube videos.\n\nYou will frequently die because the hit detection isn't accurate. You will die to things that didn't actually hit you. You will also die when jumping on killable enemies only to be killed by them because of spotty hit detection. In a game where you jump on enemies to kill them this is inexcusable. The pickup and jump buttons don't even work half the time either. The game even crashes when you exit. It's a mess. If you just want a difficult game to play there are better examples on steam and some even have multiplayer so you might even make a friend while enduring the trials the game presents. Not so with Eryi's Action.","August 18, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Not too easy, not too hard, and a good mixture of puzzles and humor.\n\nFull Review:\n\nEryi's Action is great die-hardish platformer. Even though it may classify as an unfair platformer, I never once felt cheated or angry about dying. Plus, the death animations can be pretty funny and creative. This game is an almost perfect mix between hardcore platforming but fun and engaging gameplay. Hard, yes; but short and sweet. My first playthrough lasted about 2 hours, but there are a few more achievements and collectables (the gems) within the game that I went back for.\n\nAs you progress through the game, you learn that certain items can be used and manipulated in more than one way. Sometimes there is more than one way to beat a level or overcome an obstacle. Not every jump or movement has to be "pixel perfect" and allows for the player to have some freedom and enjoyment while still feeling very accomplished after completing hard sections.\n\nThis is one of the better platformers I've played and thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it. I definitely recommend this game to any of those who enjoy a good, hard but fair platformer.","April 7, 2014","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also extremely fun the whole way through, unlike IWBTG.\n\nControls: Simple and responsive. May take a bit of getting used to, as Eryi isn't the swiftest of platforming ladies. I highly recommend playing with a controller over keyboard. The grabbing timing is something that also takes a lot of getting used to.\nControl Score: 8.5/10\n\nSound: Very well-done. I've found myself humming along with the music several times. The sound effects are good and sound like what they're conveying. I really do enjoy the soundtrack quite a bit and will likely buy it soon.\nSound Score: 8/10\n\nGraphics: Super-cute and perfectly fit the game. Everything that should stick out, sticks out. Everything is very well-conveyed, too. It reminds me of the NIS RPGs in terms of tone in that regard.\nGraphics Score: 8.5/10\n\nGameplay: Hardcore platforming action. It does rely quite a bit on memorization from what I've seen, but not so much that it becomes unfun. You can circumvent several deaths with good enough reflexes and forethought. Some deaths are almost completely unavoidable the first time, though. That said, it's still fun, even after dying ten times from the same enemy/trap.\nGameplay Score: 7.5/10\n\nFun Factor: It's a cutesy 2D platformer starring an adorable main character in which you are likely to die about as much as the average roguelike. You can pick up enemies and use them to help you solve platforming puzzles and the like. As someone that loves puzzle platformers, this is wonderful. If you're someone that is easily frustrated, then "Eryi's Action" likely isn't for you. You're going to die and it's going to happen a lot. And that's just fine.\nFun Factor Score: 9/10\n\nFinal Thoughts: This type of game is like the first time you try BDSM. Popular culture portrays it as super-rough, all the time, and unfair. In truth, it's rough, but always manageable, and always safe. When practiced right. "Eryi's Action" is one such correct practice.\nFinal Score: 8.5/10\n\nt;'dr Cute chibi Druid has an adventure, deadly shenanigans ensue. 8.5/10","July 7, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

NEVER!! In my life have I played a platformer that consistently challenges the player to this degree. If you think you are going to jump back on that platform without it being swept under your feet, you are dead wrong. If you think you can reach that diamond without falling into a trap, you are wrong.  This game is just as beautiful as it is challenging.The vivaciously colorful animations makes one feel they are playing out a cartoon rather than playing a video game. The enemy characters and bosses look devistating and cute, though they should not be taken lightly. The scenery and backgrounds are all well constructed and makes one feel they are immersed in this deathtrap animated series. I find the music to be very pleasent and euphonious. It has a very cheerful sound that either helps cheer me up after dying on a level 100 times or torments me to the point of hearing the music in my sleep. If this game is on sale, I would recommend picking it up if you are a masochist.  8 death defying leaps out of 10","November 26, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoyed other comedically evil games such as Syobon Action or I Wanna be the Guy, you will definitely enjoy this game. On the other hand, if you can’t stand those types of games, you will probably not like this game.\n\nIn my opinion, the most appealing part of Eryi’s Action is the numerous ways Eryi gets defeated in this game. The defeats are accompanied by a cartoonish sprite of Eryi being defeated corresponding to Eryi’s unique method being defeated all-the-while giving a hilarious reaction to being defeated on her face. Other than the graphics, the game does not have too many things different from the standard comedically evil game. The puzzles are fun to figure out and some of the traps the game pulls on you are very funny and clever.\n\nIf you are the type of person who is looking for a real platformer, you will definitely not find it here.

Despite what everyone says, this game is not difficult at all. Like Syobon Action, if you know all the traps, you will not die as much since this game does not take that much skill to complete.\n\nOverall, I really like this game since I came in expecting hilarious and evil game.

It's basically I Wanna Be The Guy or Syobon Action except not really focusing on any actual platforming, just killing you with traps for the lolz. And as a joke game? Generally fine. The weakest moments are when it tries to be an actual game, with a few tricky platforming bits and the first and last boss are just very straightforward and out of place. The distance between checkpoints is always short so it just becomes a matter of learning each section until you can clear it then moving on to the next, and there's no real lives system so no game overs and no frustration. There were a few moments of weirdly glitchy stuff apparently being the intended solution, which I don't really like, but beyond that the traps and puzzles are decently clever. Not the best game ever or anything, and certainly not worth any more than the $5 it sells for, but if you want some laughs at your own expense then sure, go for it.","March 9","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People played it out of curiousity - why is this game so hard, why people are calling it "hardest" game ever? Trying to make even a little progress was something amazing in this game. Because of number of traps and how clever those were made, many players were sure that this game CANNOT be finished. I'm not sure but never heard of any other, maybe because those weren't really popular, games like that until...\n\nYes, until I got my hand on Eryi's Action. I mean, it's the same - but you play no longer as cute white cat but as cute girl. Game looks rather friendy but don't be mistaken, there are traps waiting everywhere. Remembering every move you make and where the traps are, is key to beating this game. Levels are rather short, there are few which aren't platformer but still, it's a great feast for people who enjoys "trapformer" (I really like this word) games.","February 12","true","30.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After dying countless times on the first few screens, I sent the kids away and continued playing it by myself. As other reviewers point out, this game is cruel and hard as hell until you manage to memorize all the traps in the levels. It still manages to be a lot of fun... somehow. Had a blast finishing it (mixed with a lot of frustration). I recommend it, only for masochists though.","January 5","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
