I don't mean you know what to expect, I'm saying this is THE EXACT SAME F*CKING GAME!\n\nWyatt Derp is the next storm in the sh*t storm coming from the kings of sh*tty developers, Digital Homicide Studios/Digital Homicide Studios LLC. or whatever the f*ck you want to be called now.\n\nI know for a fact that this review is going to mirror my Withering Kingdom review, because they're both the same game FFS.\n\nThe controls are slippery, just like Krog Wars, just like WIthering Kingdom, when you press a key then let go, you bet that it will do it fr another second longer.\n\nThe gameplay is full of bugs that it makes the game ridiculously easy and boring.\n\nHowever, one problem Wyatt Derp has that Withering Kingdom didn't is the animations. The animations that the main character do have no logic or sense attached to them eg: when you roll, the rolling animation is meant for when someone rolls forward, but Derp decides to live up to his name and roll sideways instead.\n\nThis game is c*cking b*llocks sh*t and is one of the worst DH did because they literraly didn't put any effort into this. They copy, pasted the code of either this or Withering Kingdom and put it onto the other and swapped the assets and improved f*ck all.\n\nPros\n+ The quote "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" has a whole new meaning to me now\n\nCons\n- THE SAME GAME = THE SAME CONS\n- Bad animations\n\nFinal verdict: 1/10\n\nP.S. yes this is my Wyatt Derp review copy and pasted but all Digital Homicide have done in Wyatt Derp 2 is change the camera angle of Wyatt Derp, so if Digital Homicide can release a game with just a simple camera change, I can add this little message in and call it a different review\n\nMy Steam Curator Group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","May 27","false","1.0"," 123 of 131 people (94%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","94","123","131","16","10"

As shwon in my video, this is one of multiple instances of Digital Homicide's re-skinning video games and re-selling them as new titles. Wyatt Derp and Wyatt Derp 2 are the exact same game with a camera angle change. It is also a reskin of Withering Kingdom and Withering Kingdom 2, along with Krog Wars. The conveyor belt of crap continues as they don't even bother to flip different assets. Why bother when you can simply slap another skin on it and sell it as a new game!\n\nSeriously. Avoid this crap at all costs.\n\nIf you are interested in seeing what I'm talking about, see my report here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h532IZSEQA","May 27","false","1.1"," 82 of 86 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","82","86","3","0"

Heck, I might just copy-paste my previous review:\n\n"Ever dreamed of playing a game set in the Far West? If yes, then forget about Wyatt Derp and play Outlaws and Call of Juarez as Digital Homicide's latest abomination is nothing but a reskin of Krog Wars. I'm dead serious!\n\nNow that I think about it, Steam Greenlight is mostly the Far West of the gaming industry since it allows such atrocity to exist!"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVIO2W-YCLU\n\nRating :\n1.0","June 2","false","1.7"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"
