You can choose between a few playable microorganisms.\nThe whole Game is played with 2 buttons. With one button you send Collector, Mine, Fighter, Nuke Units (depending on how long you press the button) and with the other one you can call them back so they bring back the „food“ they collected in the meantime. This will make you grow and win the Game. But watch out if your Units are killed by a virus you will have a really bad time.\nAll in all it‘s a very colourful Game which has really nice graphics and very simple but fun game mechanics. But to master this Game you will need some time and strategies. Perfect Game if you only got a few minutes to play!\nI would recommend you to buy this Game during a Sale for around $1\n\nRating:\n6.5/10\n\nPros:  Well-made Game\nNice Game mechanics\nSimple Controls\nA lot of different tactics can be discovered\nWorks also on older devices\nWell-chosen music\nAchievements + Trading Cards\nLocal Multiplayer\nCons:   Game could get boring if you play without a friend\nHardware Information\n\nHardware   Type     Monitor   BENQ 24 inch 1ms    Headphones   Apple Earpods    Keyboard   Dell Basic Keyboard/ Integrated Alienware Keyboard     Controller   Xbox 360    Mouse   Zelotes T-90    Microphone   Integrated Laptop Micro    OS   Windows 7","March 20","true","2.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Strategic and fun with every match lasting lesss than 10 minutes. This game though in early access has a lot of room for improvement, getting the core mechanics in with a great soundtrack. Beautiful art design and great physics. You get your bang out of your buck.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HWJBJmNosjk","March 28","true","0.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The aim of the game is to win from the Virus, this as Bacteria or Nanobots atm.\n\nGameplay\nYou have your collectors, mines and fighters (and you can shoot these torpedoes). These all you can spawn with one single button Z, while holding down the Z button you can see the different units and select them like this. So your collectors collect and grow bigger and on some point you might want to recall them using the X button before they get wiped out by the enemy fighters. You also have mines that circle around your "base" for defensive purposes mostly.  Then you have fighters, these attack enemies anywhere in the playing field by bumping in them (this eventually kills them as well). As the last unit you can use there is the torpedo, well looks like a kamikazerun.. but anyway you can use this to directly attack the virus. Depending on the size of you main body the units you have can be smaller or larger too.\n\nUpdates\nLooks like we will get updates quite frequently.. Last update changed the fighters and mines behaviour. Mines play more friendly as in letting you collectors through to be reabsorbed by your main body. The fighters gotten smarter, which makes winning a bit more challenging.\n\nVerdict\nI'll be keeping my eye on this game, as I've played it for a few hours now and it was fun to do so (only won twice). I'll be looking forward to things like maybe: being able to change difficulty settings, sound options, opponents, able to be the virus instead of a bacteria. For now I recommend this game, the price is right and it's fun to play.","March 27","true","2.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

A a fast paced chess game, you must think quick to plan your attack against the oppsing AI to win.\nPlaying as microorganisms you must strategically take out the other microorganism.\n\nThis game also has local mulitplayer and it is definetly more fun playing against a friend as you can have a laugh. It would be really good if there was an online multiplayer adding that extra challenge of playing an unknown player and trying to work out their strategy.\n\nYou can check out our play through here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e90cSQnvWIw","May 7","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is actually pretty fun (specially when you play with someone else) the controls are simple and easy to use (though the control instructions for player 2 are actually backwards haha). For $2 you can't go wrong here, specially since it is early access and should only get better.\n\nWatch our full review here:\nhttps://youtu.be/6kyw6oOkPtM","April 2","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/recommended/436480/","apochweiss","ApochsDotNet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/","1846 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nQUICK THOUGHTS: Take Agar.io or Mitos.is, make it stationary 1v1, and you get Soup. The game itself isn't bad, but bare bones definitely sums it up. You have four "attacks", one of which collects more bacteria or nanobots to increase your bacteria or nanobot's health (whichever you chose to fight as). Use "minefield" attacks as defense, "hunters" for a reason I'm still not sure on (I believe gathering at greater distances), as well as torpedo attacks to hurt your foe.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, though the lack of a tutorial or instructions beyond three explanations on the title screen, leave you scratching your head a it. However, I leaned hitting the x button will also push out surrounding ally bateria or drones to defend against attacks. Even after fifteen minutes, I wished there was a simple/quick tutorial to understand how the game mechanics worked exactly.\n\nThere's also no options menu that I could find, which also would have been nice to help with the music (which is pretty catchy, admittedly), as well as screen size and graphics quality. It's something small, but it would help. Hopefully some future on-line multiplayer would be interesting. Also would love some more playable bacteria or bots, as well as enemies. Fighting the same virus over and over got boring real quick. Even the ability to play as the virus itself would be nice.\n\nAs it stands, competent, though could be a lot better. It's a promising title, don't get me wrong. But that doesn't mean it's the most enjoyable, especially on a single player level. It's a bare bones experience at the time of writing this down, snd needs more room to grow before being something really worth your time, even from a casual point of view.","March 19","false","0.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"
