"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995992757/recommended/32140/","76561197995992757","Derp Derp Kill Kill","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995992757/","1433 products in account","ENG (wersja polska niżej)\n\nThis game is a clear case of a brain plug and like every other plug, it should be used to block something: in this particular situation: your brain. Let me explain: one should play a game like this whenever there is too much to think late at night or after work, finding item after item is monotonous and repetitive like digging with a shovel and that’s exactly how I like my hidden object games. And hey! It’s Edgar Allan Poe – it goes great with the whiskey.\n\nIt might be surprising that – while the game is only about 300 megs of data – the art is more than solid. The gameplay is exactly what you should expect from a game like that: solve a puzzle here, talk with a lost soul there, find a pickaxe, a cucumber, 2 ribbons, 3 nails and a chinchilla elsewhere. And don’t expect that the story will progress without that chinchilla. Yes, there is a story good enough not to skip (although such option is provided) – or maybe, I was looking for the Poe references?\n\nWhile it is a solid game, I believe the price tag is set to high. I recommend getting it 75% off and in a pack with the 3 remaining installments of the series which, I must say, are more polished and the adventure – hidden object aspects of these games are better balanced. Edgar Allan’s Mystery is also pretty short – about 3 hours. Is there any reason to return to it later? “Nevermore.”\n\nPL\n\nSeria “Midnight Mysteries” sprawdza się idealnie jako zapychacz mózgu. Dokładnie tak: odnajdowanie konkretnego przedmiotu, potem jeszcze jednego, następnego i tak zapętlone w kółko działa jak przerzucanie ziemi szpadlem – totalnie wyłącza myślenie, i tego właśnie oczękuję od hidden objectów w które gram. Świetne kiedy późno w nocy ma się za dużo rzeczy o których nie ma się ochoty myśleć, albo po paskudnym dniu w pracy. Poza tym to Edgar Allan Poe co automatycznie sprawia że gra świetnie wchodzi z whisky.\n\nCiekawe że  zajmując niecałe 300mb Tajemnica Edgara Allana Poe wygląda naprawdę nieźle. Gra się w to dokładnie tak jak należało by się spodziewać: tu rozwalasz jakąś zagadkę, tam rozmawiasz z duchem, gdzieś indziej odnajdujesz szpadel, ogórek, trzy spinki, dwie kokardki i szynszyla. I nie oczekuj, że historia gry ruszy dalej bez tego szynszyla. A co do historii – jest, nawet na tyle dobra żeby nie przeklikiwać (jest opcja przeskakiwania scenek) większości tekstu. A może tylko szukałem nawiązań do twórczości Poego ?\n\nPodsumowując: Pierwsza odsłona serii jest całkiem solidna – choć 9 euro to jednak za dużo. Najlepiej kupić za -75% w paczce z pozostałymi 3 częściami które, trzeba powiedzieć, są lepiej dopracowane i zbalansowane. Tajemnica Edgara Allana jest też krótka – 3 godziny i po wszystkim. Czy jest po co wracać do gry po ukończeniu wątku fabularnego ? "Nevermore!", zakracze Kruk.","August 11, 2014","true","3.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

The result is an old-school game of hidden object scenes, but one with a hefty amount of plot going with it.\n\nSaid plot is about the spirit of Edgar Allen Poe contacting a struggling writer to unravel the mysteries of his murder, which coincidentally requires the solving of two other ancient crimes, both based on a short story by Poe himself: ‘The Mystery of Marie Rogêt’ and ‘The Gold-Bug’. (Both were significantly altered for the sake of gameplay, naturally.)\nStorytelling is quite simplistic– cut-out characters and text balloons– but its fits Poe: it is dark, mysterious, and engaging. I imagine many would expect a lot more in terms of gameplay nowadays, but this story is still good enough to make this old HOG enjoyable for today’s audience.","February 28","true","4.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I would not consider it to be worth the price with the short playing time, unless you really love the genre, but having gotten it in a bundle myself I definitely paid less than it was worth, so I can't complain about my cost. In any case, keep an eye out for a sale if you're interested.\n\nAs to the gameplay itself, it really is rather straightforward and not terribly challenging. There were only a handful of times when I had trouble finding something or solving a puzzle, only to find that the answer was basically right in front of my face, of course. Fortunately, if you do get stuck there is a hint system you can use to show you where an item is or the next step in a puzzle, so there's no reason for a relaxing game to become at all frustrating. Unfortunately, the ravens that you collect in order to add to your hint total are a little bit too plentiful, so that even using the hints whenever I was getting at all annoyed with the time spent searching, I still finished with ten or so remaining. Also, I would end up using a hint for kind of lame reasons, like not lining the next item in the puzzle up exactly right. In other words, it's a little bit touchy at times. Just remember, what you think is the solution probably is. You just may need to adjust your positioning slightly.\n\nAll of this being said, it is rather fun as far as hidden object games go, and that has never been a preferred genre of mine. As an Edgar Allan Poe fan, I found the concept of building the game around the mystery of his death to be intriguing, the overall story quite well done, and the gane performance flawless. I run Windows 8 and had absolutely no issues. So, this is definitely a nice way to have a few relaxing hours of casual gameplay with no time limits or losing or anything, when you're in the mood for that kind of thing.","May 8, 2014","true","3.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is a more or less search and find game with a minimal addition of other puzzles.\n\nAfter 3 hours of completing this game I can recommend it, but there is much space left for improvements (which were done in the follow-ups). There is a plot and it is more or less okay, much more fun if one knows a little bit of Poe's stories. Also the sound is even great, atmospheric and fitting. And then there are tons of hidden objects screens - not always easy, but Poe's crow is helping you out, whenever you are stuck. Finally the others games are way too easy.\n\nWell, in conclusion I have to admit that this game is worth to give a try if you like Poe and hidden object games, but it was a hard fight to get the thumps in the upper direction.","September 2, 2014","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I am currently playing through the second game (Salem Witch Trials), and I've gotten stuck several times.  Perhaps that means this game is too easy, but I enjoyed it because I also really enjoyed seeing how the various stories played out and how the different items actually became real clues to the mystery or integrated into the plot.

In one hidden object search, an item was so buried that i still could not see it even after i had the raven point it out.

Unlike most of the HO/adventure games released in the past couple years, this doesn't have the same complex inventory management and adventure/mystery-solving focus (think Artifex Mundi games).  If you're the person who skips over the HO parts of Artifex Mundi games because you can't stand them, you'll hate this.\n\nAs such, the plot is imperfect and is just a chain to link one hidden object scene to the next.  There are some mini-game style puzzles but very few.  There is some very simple inventory management but really nothing requiring much thought (it will be very obvious what needs to be used where and when).\n\nHO scene objects are sometimes hard to distinguish due to the resolution but overall they aren't terribly bad.\n\nMusic/sound is nothing that stands out; there is no voice-acting throughout.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this ON SALE to people who like the HO aspect of these casual games.    I recommend getting it on sale because the $9.99 price tag seems a little much for an older game without any frills, especially with a very average three-hour playtime.

It is reported that many who looked into Poe's eyes never lived to tell the tale of his unquenchable bloodlust to prey upon the innocent.  His books explored his fascination with the murder of innocent people which many literary scholars believe were based on crimes committed by Poe while he was still alive.  It has been said by some that upon his death police raided his posh living quarters where upon pulling up the flooorboards discovered Poe's secret stash of still beating human hearts with one of them having a bite out of it.  Even to this day, around campfires at Halloween children still spin yarns of the nefarious Poe, who during every full moon stalks his victims in the shadows feasting upon their still beating hearts, only to once again vanish into darkness.\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  7.99","October 24, 2013","true","8.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It has a terrific story that ties together adventures in Poe's literature.  The clues and hidden objects actually seem to have meaning to the game as a whole.  The cleverness of using some of the found objects to reveal other found objects harkens back to adventure gaming.  You could call it a HOG Hybrid.

These are the more typical hybrid type games, that have some adventure elements (puzzles, moving between locations, talking to people) as opposed to the find-objects-only style.\n\nMidnight Mysteries are interesting in that they are based on real historical events, then add some fictional what-ifs to fill in blanks or give alternate explanations for known events.  As a result, not only are the fun as a game but they spark some interest in reading about the real events on Wikipedia.\n\nThey also tend to have a slightly creepy vibe.  MM1, about Edgar Allen Poe, is one of the creepier ones with a bit of mystery to it.","July 12, 2014","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They liked helping me find stuff, and there is nothing too graphic for them to unexpectedly see.  The music was calm and often put my Autistic daughter to sleep, the story wasn't great, but it was on par with maybe a Goosebumps book.\n\nI don't really recommend this for adult play, but for kids, it is a decent package of games.

The puzzles are too easy, the objects are sometimes hard to find. To think that in MumboJumbo collection, you can find the excellent Samantha Swift... The artwork is nice though.\n\nIn reality, Midnight Mysteries is a good series. I mean, you're dealing with ghosts of famous people, apparently not resting in peace. Here, it's Edgar Allan Poe that wants you to find what happened to him. For that, you'll need to dive into novels he wrote before finding the real culprit as they were based on real stories. But when I say real culprit, it's more finding the ghost of them and make them arrested by a ghost of a policeman. That's why I said that I was lost quickly in the plot.\n\nThe rest is correct, though I preferred Samantha Swift from the same publisher. Anyway, the Edgar Allan Poe Conspiracy is setting the mechanics of the series: hidden objects scenes with more hidden objects and ravens to collect as they're hints.\n\nLike I've said, the artwork is very nice. You can see clearly the difference between the novel and the reality... well, if there is any apart your room.\n\nIt's not my favorite HOG. It's not my favorite series. But it's still a good series. You can go for it.","April 22, 2013","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
