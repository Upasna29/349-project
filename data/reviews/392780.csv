There are 3 different game modes (Endless, Gem Hunt, Arcade) to switch things up, as well as 4 difficulty settings, and 3 speeds.\n\nAnd the options don't end there. Instead of just swatting the ball around and picking up buffs/debuffs as they drop into a vertical path you spin in a circle and try to collect 'gems' as they break free from the shapes you destroy. But don't forget to keep an eye on your ball or it might be game over.\n\nSo many choices.\nThe gems are used to buy different things to reduce or add to the challenge and many visual styles to keep your retinas interested.\nThere are 9 wall shapes/frames and 6 different rotations to pick up. Some of the frames rotate and drop multiple walls instead of the typical fixed bottom so it can become quite a bit more challenging than the standard breakout game.\n\n3 paddles, 2 ball types and 4 powerups. If you think it as simple as letting the ball bounce around inside the frame, the Breakerball, while it will plow through the whole board, will implode if your paddle doesn't make contact after its destroyed x amount of bricks/shapes.\n\n12 different brick/shape patterns to be loaded at random with 11 color choices for those shapes. And then 9 artistic backgrounds. And in the end, don't worry if you are bad. Every 5 minutes you can click on the Facebook & Twitter button on the main screen to get 50 free gems. So even the worst player can eventually get some additional goodies.\n\n\nDeveloper propsThe developer has also been very responsive, active and listens to the feedback from the players. After an update that resulted in broken achievements he worked at pushing several hot fixes trying to get it working correctly as quick as possible.","June 3","true","98.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"

It seems like something I will be able to play in short bursts when I have time to game and it's seemingly got the potential to have a decent difficulty in later stages.\n\n7/10\n\nPros:\nFun\nEasy to learn\nCan play in quick bursts\n\nCons:\nThe only complaint I currently have is I can't navigate the main menu with a Steam Controller, though to be honest, I probably need to launch with a different controller template. Will touch back again on this later once the Steam Controller is available commercially.","September 21, 2015","true","0.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","1"

It's gameplay is very bland, even with the skins over it.\n2. You don't have a whole game when you buy it, you must unlock it, how?  By playing.  this and other various practices make me feel this is more of a mobile free to play game with ads, not something that's valued at $6.99\n3.  There's not much here.  The video options are pretty clean due to pre rendered 2d assets, but some antialiasing even for 2d could help a little with the jagged edges I see everywhere in the game.  And the game itself just reskins it slightly and doesn't do much overtime.\n4.  "Mondrian - Abstraction in Beauty is a full-circle block-breaking game about video game art history."  I couldn't agree more, its  a ♥♥♥♥ing game that took brick break and just made it round, which LIMITS the game further, to where there's less screen space for the bricks, therefore less bricks always in the center making in uninteresting even more so than a regular brick break app I can just download on my phone, both are time wasters but at least one has more contents such as powerups like sticky paddle and the tons of balls or the one that doesnt bounce off a brick after it destroys it, so in more ways than one a free app I got on google play has more content than this game.  And I learned really nothing in this relating to video games as a art form really.\n\nP.S. Look at the Achievements images, they're ugly basic shapes with gradients applied to them!","December 22, 2015","false","1.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JellyJellyFru/recommended/392780/","JellyJellyFru","Dr. Professor ShootBang","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JellyJellyFru/","648 products in account","A game built to show off the art history of games that surprises you as you unlock more generation elements (color palettes, arena shapes, ball types, block configurations, etc.). Each unlock has the potential to work together in really neat and logical ways, and accompanies the solid, chill, evolving gameplay.\n\nI interviewed the developer, and it turns out there's some even cooler stuff beneath the surface as well, with an emphasis on honoring the work of Piet Mondrian and other indies!

But I like the quotes about modern art and the music. Using mousebuttons to control the paddle is pad design, using mouse would be better.
