A new Carbine Rifle (G36C).  And lots of bug fixes!\n\nI should also point out there are currently 5 people working on this game.\n\n\nA lot of potential here, the actual graphics of the game are pretty nice IMO. Although I can't say I'm a huge fan of the cutscenes comic book style.  I'll take gameplay over graphics anyday!\n\nPros\nNice artstyle graphics\nRuns flawlessly\nPlan & Execute Menu (Needs a lot of work in my opinion, feels a little clustered/unorganized, but it's a nice tribute to the old R6 games)\nMore in depth customization than Takedown (Hope to see more)\nMore Squad options (Actual keybinds for commands)\nVariety of visions - Thermal/Night etc\nYou can leave glowsticks behind to know which rooms you've cleared. I quite like this!\nDevs are really active in forums\nYou can arrest/secure enemies! Not sure which other way it works but If I shoot them once in the leg/arm/torso etc they will lay down their weapon and raise their hands.\nIn the Map section, you can look through cameras around the compound to tag enemies\n\n\nCons\nUI needs some work\nMovement feels extremely fast - Especially with FOV turned all the way up.\nAI (Enemy and Friendly)  is very bare bones\nBreaching doors feels kinda cheap\nStory cutscenes are really awkward (Not really a fan of the comic book stuff)\nQuite the number of bugs\n\n\nOverall, it is 8 dollars with two maps at the moment, One Campaign Mission, and a Terrorist Hunt type mission both on the same maps. There are two types of ARs and recently they added an automatic Shotgun along with a new SMG! The AR is an FAL with 2 other variants, with red dot sight and suppressor attachements at the moment as well as a G36C  with much more weapons to come as you can see in the loadout screen.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=528130218\n\nI will keep updating this review as I play. So far I am really impressed at how the game looks and plays. And it is in PRE ALPHA so much more to come for this game. I can really tell this is what Serellan wanted to deliver with Takedown.  I am hoping for the best for Serellan and look forward to see where this game goes.\n\n\n\nTLDR This game has tons of potential to be the next great tactical shooter! For $8 right now, you will get every other update free of course. So now is the time to buy if you are interested.","October 1, 2015","true","7.0"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","41","45","2","0"

I'm not one for words and don't think I've left a review on a Steam Store Page so far but I want to show my support for this title.\n\nI know some of you will have come here maybe to bash on the game since Takedown has Mostly Negative reviews but anyone who kept track the Dev Team got stuck in a bad situation with support from the Publisher dropping out soon after the game launched, The team still managed to put out updates to fix issues with the game despite the lack of money but it wasn't quite enough to save the game and with the publisher owning the title they had to stop working on it.\n\nEnough about Takedown, just wanted to bring it up to talk about Serellan themselves, they are very active within the community taking feedback to heart and replying daily to users, I'm sure the team didn't want to leave Takedown but had no other choice, now with them being indie they don't have to worry about all that red tape that comes with a Publisher.\n\nSure, Epsilon has its problems but the moment you boot up the game you can already see how many things have been fixed with each build and within the same day the game had come out feedback was already being put into the game ready for the next build, you can't ask for more then that from a team of 5 devs.\n\nSome of you have come looking at this title for the next SWAT/Rainbow Six game and while the game does have those elements with the Planning Map, Commanding Squads and such you have to remember its been 10 years since we had those games, nostalgia is a b***h and its easy to be more forgiving of say AI from then, then it is now.\n\nEpsilon has to work on being unique while at the same time trying to cater to what the fans want, sure some are not big on the near future Sci-Fi stuff but you need to think about it, we have so many games that are already trying to cover the now, we don't need the market over saturated like with World War 2 games at one point in time.\n\nI feel like I've already spent my fair share of time with the 1 mission, 7 weapons, 2 gamemodes and I can safely say this is already a solid foundation for the future of what Hardcore Tactical Gamers want and you should be keeping an eye on it! you can choose to jump on the Early Access bandwagon and give the team feedback and help shape the game while getting it at a low price before the bigger features hit like co-op/pvp and it starts costing more or you can wait and see how it goes.\n\nDon't forget, Steam has a refund program, jump in now give the game a shot see if you see the same potential others are and keep playing with each new update, not happy? take the refund and with any luck come back in the future when it has had more time to grow.\n\n... Feel like I didn't really talk about the games features itself but you can find others reviews for that and hit up the Videos section on the Community Hub if you want to see some gameplay.\n\nTL;DR: I can recommend this game to anyone who wants to see the Hardcore Tactical Genre make a come back, sure it has its issues but you will get some fun out of it and remember its in PRE-ALPHA, just the fact Serellan is still around after the failure of Takedown? I enjoyed it... anyway, they deserve the chance to make the game they want and hopefully the game you want.\n\nMainly wrote this to give my Thumbs Up...","October 3, 2015","true","54.7"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

However it is currently quite lackluster and many things need to be improved (hence the game being in early access and in pre-alpha). I trust that this will be a MASSIVE improvement on Takedown: Red Sabre.","October 1, 2015","true","1.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

I'll most likely update the review as time goes on.\n\nBut it has a solid base on it. There's lots that needs done, but that's obvious. This game is the earliest of early access.\n\nI know these guys can pull this off, and the first great step they made was to make this an early access title in the first place.\n\nPros, in a nutshell\n\n+ Nice graphics. Not the best on earth, but they're nice and smooth.\n\n+ Ability to detain hostiles, instead of being forced to gun them down.\n\n+ The AI already is performing better than Red Saber.\n\n+ Very light customization right now, but in-menu features listed "Future Content" shows that it will be improved upon.\n\n+ Ability to give commands to your team. A bit choppy right now, but that's to be expected.\n\n+ The ability to slide open doors inch by inch. This is a small, but very important feature in my book.\n\n\nCons, in a nutshell\n\n- No walk button... yeah....\n\n- Base movement speed is way too fast, especially feels like it with the FOV turned up.\n\n- The only way to slow your movement is by crouching, but since it's slower than a walk,(which it should be) There's not really any good medium for doing things such as cautiously breaching doors.\n\n- Co-op isn't yet in the game, but it's obviously being worked on.\n\n- The weapon stability/accuracy needs some work. It feels as if there might be a spread system instead of stability out of the barrel. But, I'm not sure. So I guess don't take my word for this one.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe game will be a decent grab now to pick up for cheap if you like playing games like this. It's good to get it now for cheap instead of waiting for more features later, and paying more for it.

As far as Early Access games go, this one is pretty solid. I also own Takedown: Red Sabre. Epsilon has very well kept some of the best qualities of Takedown and removed the worst qualities.\n\nI like the futuristic setting and design work for Epsilon, it's just a bit futuristic but not to the point that you're using rayguns and fighting martians. It works really well with the new Unreal Engine 4 graphics, which look great, as always.\n\nEpsilon has working squad commands! Your squad feels much more useful in Epsilon than in Takedown because of it. Enemy AI seems to be improved, as I haven't seen the glaring pathing issues that you would sometimes see in Takedown. The sniper and the planning phase mechanics are really fun!\n\nOverall: Good replay value, nice graphics, plenty challenging.\n\nI definitely recommend picking this one up! It's currently got 2 completed maps, no co-op yet, ragdolls, squad commands, It's worth the 8 bucks they're asking for now, and the price will only go up as they keep adding content. But yeah, it's a very fun pre-alpha that on its own, is already better than Takedown minus less maps currently available.","February 11","true","4.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

It looks like Serellan learned from their mistakes with Takedown: Red Sabre and have made a legit, OG Rainbow Six-esque tactical shooter, complete with pre-mission planning and squad commands, which is all stuff they should've put in Red Sabre imo. BE WARNED, the game itself is a bit glitchy; they are really stressing the fact that it's still early access and only about 30% done according to the front page, but this game has great promise.

There are a bunch of parts, but all of them are rough (early access, but read on) and none of them fit well together\n\nBecause therein lies the big issue: The devs just don't seem to care. They looked at a checklist of what people have been complaining about since R6 Vegas and they add it:\n\n- Optiwand to mirror under doors? Check, but it moves incredibly slowly and has awkward controls (you move the camera with WASD...). Also, this will switch you back to your primary instantly\n- Useful secondary equipment and not just pistols? Sort of. There is a grenade launcher of some form that seems to fire high explosive rounds... that make the terrorists surrender.\n- Modern military weapons: Sort of. It looks like they found a generic asset pack of a few FN guns and added that in... which is strange when this is set in a cyber-future land... full of what look like Fidel Castro's dopplegangers\n- Squad commands: Surprisingly yes, but it depends on a circular menu (think powers in Mass Effect, but clunkier). And becuase this is an attempt at emulating the games of olde, it involves multiple levels, none of which flows well together.\n- Open doors with mousewheel: I have been missing this for years, but it is pointless as two rapid swipes of my wheel opened the door about halfway. So unless I am peaking (which is what the optiwand is for), I don't know why this is here\n\nAnd that is the thing. Yes, this is early access and most of this can be fixed (better controls and new asset packs). But why is this here in the first place? Why is there a fundamentally flawed command menu? Why would things that worked, and what are clearly inspirations, be changed to not work? There is a fundamental difference between pushing an incomplete game (awkward animations, lack of content, funky AI, all the sound issues I neglected to mention) and pushing one where the mechanics just don't work. Even basic playtesting should have revealed most of those.\n\nA huge step up from this studio's previous (abandoned) game, but still a long way to go.\n\nIf you want the gunplay of olde, look into Insurgency. If you want the spirit, consider one of the more recent Rainbow Sixes (Vegas lacks tactics but definitely has the spirit of an R6 game). And if what you miss is the planning, consider Doorkickers or Breach and Clear... or just buy one of the first three Rainbow Sixes.","November 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","12","21","2","0"

Vertical Movements, like rapelling and such.\n2. Futuristic guns\n3. More special equipment, like a remote controlled camera, sledgehammer, ie.\n4. Better animations and more animations (animations for things like breaching and opening locked doors)\n5. Customization.\n\n\nIt's too early to make a clear yes/no recommendation, if you think it looks cool, you should buy it, it's only $7 and has a mass amount of potential, if not, keep your eye on it, and see how things develop. This could potentially be a great return to form for the tactical genre.","February 20","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","13"

It's Takedown all over again T.T:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/300760/discussions/0/364040961437907349/\n\nUpdate: 12.04.16:\nLet's be honest: the game has been in early access for over half a year (!) now and I could not say that they have updated the game in any significant way. If it still was in (pre-)alpha, then we should have been seeing major changes happening by now!\n\nThe last updates were just some minor bug squishes 2 months ago and you know what they say, you can't polish a turd...\n\nI'm sorry for everyone involved in developing the game and I'm sure you are doing your best, but it seems it isn't working out.\n\nUpdate: 06.03.16:\nAnother month gone by with just some small fixes to show for...\n\nUpdate: 05.02.16:\nThey've recently updated the game, but it's just minor things: They've added a new weapon, partial controller support, bug fixes etc. 4 months since release and the big update that will overhaul the AI and some major gameplay elements is not in sight.\n\nSo I've started the game again to see what they've changed, made some waypoints through the first level for my AI partners and just consecutively pressed "Move out". The three ducklings ran through the entire level shooting every enemy in a heartbeat, without taking any damage! Great...Alt+F4\n\nUpdate 20.01.16:\nNo updates in two months. I have a bad feeling about this...\n\nUpdate 25.11.15:\nNearly two months later all the critical points stay valid, they just added a map, achievements (of all things...) and some other minor changes\n\nOriginal Review:\nPros:\n+ Nice, simple but functional graphics\n+ Planing phase\n+ Comic-style mission introduction\n\nCons:\n- Very poor A.I., reminded me very much of Takedown. Could solo rambo through, leaving my team behind and kill 10 enemies without a problem. Enemies don't take cover, they either patrol or stand still. Friendly AI walks in single file, not taking cover or anything, like ducklings behind the mother duck (you)\nAlso the enemies don't care if there is gunfire in the nearby rooms, they'll walk chilled as ever.\n- Animation quality is very basic at best\n- Ugly character models\n- No object physics, no breakable windows, etc.\n- Visus not moving when running/walking, just the hands. It doesnt feel like running/walking\n- Weapons got no punsh behind them\n- etc.\n\nI am well aware that this is a pre-alpha version, but I want people to know that there is no enjoyment to be had here, YET and the framework is not the best to build upon.\n\n- will change the review according to the games progress.","October 5, 2015","false","0.8"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","17","32","0","2"

The game is in a fairly barebones state at present but with a decent foundation already in place; this could potentially grow into a very impressive game down the line. At such a generous pricepoint too; it is most definitely worth a punt even now.\n\nFirstly; the game looks absolutely remarkable, with a unique visual style of colours, outstanding lighting effects and stunning reflections. This aspect alone is very encouraging and makes this one of the most visually impressive early access titles to date. If each environment maintains this standard; Epsilon could stand against many top-end AAA games in graphical terms.\n\nThis being in the very early stages though; many aspects are yet to be completed or are even absent at present. The developers have listed a wealth of features and improvements on the horizon which demonstrates they have a clear understanding of their product moving forward. The core of Epsilon is still very playable so far as you get to grips with the concept and mechanics. There are a few bugs and some rough parts but overall; it's a solid platform for the developers to build upon.\n\nThe developers Serellan have certainly come under fire previously after the somewhat mediocre Takedown: Red Sabre but this title houses enormous potential and with lessons hopefully learned; I hope they don't make the same mistakes again. With 30% completed and another 12 months projected until the game is ready for a full release; it is certainly one to watch. There is still a considerable amount of work to be done in regards to developing and improving but with such a strong foundation already in place; this could be a very exciting title to follow.\n","October 14, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"
