"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jedimaster80/recommended/47410/","jedimaster80","Fon Master Ion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jedimaster80/","932 products in account","I played this game for awhile on multiple worlds, and while it was sort of fun while it lasted, in the end the game isn't worth it.\n\nThe game is nothing but a "Pay to Win" game.\nWhether it's buying more cards or buying Premium Tokens, both give very big unfair advantages.\n\nTo even keep up with many other players in the worlds, you will need to spend bunch of actual money to progress, otherwise you will lose fast.\n\nDespite my game time, i give this a "Not Reccomended" to save you the 100's upon 1000's of hours you would waste on it, only for some pay to win person to raze or capture all your villages, thus making you start all over.\n\nI should have said this before, but this is basically a Facebook Game, on Steam.\nMany people are correct for saying that too.\n\n---------------------------------\nReview Update:\n---------------------------------\nAlso, i'd like to add unless you join a brand new world the moment it's active, it will be extremely hard to get far on it.\n\nYou can use cards you aquired from other worlds in the new world, which is 1 way people stock up to get very far in new worlds.\nAnd, usually within the first 48 to 72 hours, people will be already Rank 14 to 16 (or higher), and start taking over major parts of the world, making factions, join big houses, and conquer large areas.\n\nThen if they move to your area, some may bully you to give up your Parish(es), or may even capture/raze your villages, just to clear you out so you don't vote for somebody else.\n(The above happened to me a few times on multiple worlds.)\n\nAlso, the game has an "Inactive" system. Info below (Copied from wiki)\n\nA village will be automatically abandoned when a player hasn't played or is dormant for a specific period of time; this time is dependant upon which rank they have reached.\nThe higher the rank, the longer it takes for the village to become abandoned.\nIf a premium token is in play at the time of going inactive, the player's account (and therefore, their village) will remain active until the premium token runs out.\n\nMore Info on days here: http://help.strongholdkingdoms.com/index.php/FAQ:Your_village#What_happens_with_inactive_players.3F\n\nSo basically, depending on your rank, if you don't sign on  after xx many of days (whether you forget, internet is down, computer is broken, etc.), ALL VILLAGES you have in that world will be deleted.\nNow, you will keep your same rank along with all you researched, but you will have to start over with only 1 village.\n\nAnd even if you restart, there is a low chance you can be placed in the same area you were previously located.\n\nAnd people that downvote this Review, are most likely the "Pay to Win" or "Bully" people I mentioned.\nDon't let them sucker you into thinking it's not pay to win.\n\nThey most likely want more people to attack, so they can gain honour faster as well as maybe get free villages that you did the work setting up, but they take the rest.\n\n\n---------------------------------\nReview Update 2:\n---------------------------------\nTo the people that either "question" why I played over 1,800+ hours in a game to not recommend it, ask yourself this:\n\n"Do you count all the hours you play of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥me you play?"\nThe answer most likely is no.\n\nPlaying one of those, can also EASILY add 100's upon 1000's of hours too.\nKeep in mind, the gametime spans across about 1½ years.\n\nThis game has MANY different worlds.\nI originally started in World 5 where I met people and joined a guild, we tried to also start in new worlds as they opened.\n\nTo keep it short, in World 6 when it opened up, there were many trolls, House members (H10 and H16) took over the area, capturing villages including mine, without warning.\n\nMe along with alot of other people gave up on that world, as there was not really any way to keep progressing.\nMany of them go far due to they gained rank fast with saved up cards.\n\nWe tried it again when World 7 was introduced, but it didn't go any better.\n\nWithin 48 to 72 hours the Leaders of the House, had already been Rank 19+ .\nI think they had like 6+ villages by then.\nThis was a combindation of "Pay to Win" and they were beta world 7 players, whose rank didn't get reset.\n\nBy the time World 8 started, i didn't even bother to try for it, since i knew the outcome would be the same as World 6 and 7.\n\nWorld 5 was fine for awhile, but then House 1 went for World Wide Domination (which they succeeded).\nAgain they bullied everybody to vote for them so they could take our Country and County.\nMost of the house leaders was in the Top 100, insanely high rank/stats/villages/troops/production/etc.\n\nEven after the World got sent to the "2nd Age", it didn't make a different.\nThey just regrouped (under a new house i think) and took over the world again.\n\nI didn't even stick around to find out what happened next.\nI heard in "3rd Age" it happened again.\n\nIt was like "what's the point of playing anymore?"\nNo matter what you try, you can't win when the enemy guilds have like 3x the villages you have (and that's PER Guild Member).\nThey most likely have dozens upon 100's of Vasseled Armies.\nEach Vasseled Army = 500 Troops.\n\nAs quoting the computer Joshua from WarGames, "The only winning move is not to play" which is sadly very true.\n\nDon't waste the time and frustration i did trying to play this game.\n\nAnd, for those trolls STILL Questioning on gametime, just shut up and stop.\nHad i played like 10 hours, people would ♥♥♥♥♥ because i didn't play long enough.\nBut I have over 1800 and now that's considered "too much"?\n\n---------------------------------------\nReasons it's Pay to Win\n---------------------------------------\nSource Info: http://help.strongholdkingdoms.com/index.php/FAQ:Premium_Account\n\nYou can spend money to buy Premium Tokens and Card Packs in the game.\nCard Packs (depending on what pack it is) will give you 5 random cards per pack.\n\nPremium Tokens let you do things that you can't do unless you buy one.\n(The following are for when online)\nFirst is Building Queue. This lets you in EACH village set it up to add 4 more buildings to a queue to be built next. Default it's only 1 building at a time, so you will have to be on to place the next building without a token.\nIn the beginning it's not that big of deal, but later in the game when buildings take hours upon hours, it GREATLY helps.\n\nMove Builds - This is by far the 2nd biggest reason. The ability to MOVE your buildings you place anytime you want. By default you can't move then. If you place a building in the wrong spot, tough.\nYou have to delete it, wait like 5 to ?? minutes (depends if you are deleting other buildings also) just to build it again, wasting resources.\n\nResearch Queue - This is the biggest reason. In the beginning it won't that big of deal, but later in game when you're higher rank, research time takes longer and longer.\nPrince Rank, it took me up to 18 HOURS+ for each research.\nBy default, you can only research 1 thing, no queue. This adds 4 more to the queue to auto research.\nResearch plays a key role in the game, so that's why it's important.\n(Troop health, what units you unlock, what you can build for castle, food, etc.)\n\nVillage Overview - Honestly i never used it. It's just more of a convenience to see each village production/stats.\n\n(The followingwill activate once every two (2) to four (4) hours when you're not logged in.)\nAuto Trading - Game will auto trade food to your parish, depending on the % you set it to.\nAuto Scouting - Auto Sends out scouts to stashes for you.\nAuto Attack - Auto Attack targets (Wolves, Bandit Camps, AI, etc).\nAuto Recruiting - Lets you recruit troops automatically (assuming you have gold and enough weapons).\n\nCrowns (In-Game Currency, costs actual money)\nhttp://help.strongholdkingdoms.com/index.php/Firefly_Crowns\n\nYou can read about crowns in the above link.

I have fired myself.\n\nStronghold is like a lot of pay2win/free2play games built on the shoulders of a franchise that used to be great.\nThe original games were about you building a castle while surviving all sorts of nasty things trying to rip your castle down and harm your villagers.\n\nKingdoms takes that concept to the next level! Now you have to defend against other humans trying to attack you and you get to attack them too! It's great fun. Yeah that's right, I said fun.\nWhere it falls apart is that as is the norm for games of these types everything takes a very long time to build or  do...Unless you are willing to pay cash money.\nPaying gives you an insane advantage over your fellow human players...At first! You see these games are played out in 'seasons' and seasons are about 4 months so if you don't join the choo-choo train immediately at the start of the season then the boundries have been drawn, alliances between players made and attacking anybody will get your castle DESTROYED!\n\nSo the thing you want to do in a PvP game, which is participate in PvP, you can't do because when your castle is destroyed it can take you either lots of months and the season will be over or cost you lots of real life cash so pick your poison.\nOutside of the PvP you get to build your kingdom. That's, fun? I guess? You get to pick where a garden goes? And you get to plant some quarries? Yay? Yeah the city building is shallow and boring but you will spend most of your time doing that firstly because you need too since you need the resources to actually build your castle and secondly because you very rarely get to attack players due to them all banding together to rub out anyone who opposes their rulership.\n\nWhile that is true to history there are plenty of better games that are historically accurate and FUN. The PvP gimmick is fun when you get to partake in it but the rest of the experience is boring or financially costly.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","May 21, 2015","false","397.0"," 279 of 306 people (91%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","91","279","306","49","0"

I hate it and love it at the same time.\n\nCommunity is friendly towards new players, especially when you find someone from your country. They are willing to help, by giving you resources, tips on how to defend, what troops to use etc. Gameplay is good, a bit slow at start, but good.\n\nBut, I still cannot recommend it, because it is P2W game. People who buy cards and tokens will absolutely destroy all others. Freeroamers can survive for some time if they work together, but eventually they'll crack. I was in an really good and friendly faction where no one was buying cards, and we held for some time. Then we declared war on p2w guys. We had sent about 50 timed attacks on one village and we lost, because he was using cards to defend. After that they just devastated our faction.\n\nApart from that, game is really addictive and fun, but P2W aspect ruined it. Yes I am still playing it, and I can't tell you why, because I don't know myself.\n\nDon't let this game to eat your soul, you will lose it forever.","July 7, 2015","false","962.2"," 152 of 159 people (96%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","96","152","159","31","1"

My total gameplay time must be over 1k+ hours, I played in 3 ingame-worlds and I was level 22 (Prince). Yes, i am retired.\n\nThis game had awesome mechanics, probably the best mechanics you could see in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥me. I played it for months without getting bored, it was really fun-- killing, upgrading, capturing, scouting, expanding, producing, destroying, gathering, researching... You can multiple the fun if you are playing with your friends! Organizing, Raidcalls, supporting gets more meaning with coop-like multiplayer. You may spend your time in joy.\n\nThis went very well until I witnessed something, I discovered later something in game...\nThere is "cards system" (yeah, it is obvious) and the cards are making this game PVP-unplayable if you don't buy them.*\n\nRating: Free to Play 3/10\nRating: Pay to Play 4/10*\nRating: Pay to Win 6/10\n\n\n* Paying is not balanced also.

They spend a bunch of money and put one of their people in, in pretty much every area... and you will never be accepted into their group, its not as inclusive as something like Evony was years ago when I played that, the leadership communicate outside the game and they use the in game system to exclude everyone else.\n\nSo you will never be of any consequence unless you spend a ton of money for recognition from other players.. and even then, its a total waste... youl join a group, that group will be made just for people like you.. to exclude you from leadership or any decision making, you wont even hear this stuff talked about, it takes a long time and several games before you realize that every group you join dies off by outside forces you were told to keep your nose out of and that even if you see a massive problem thats about to destroy the whole group of hundreds of people, no one will listen and they will turn on you if you try to help them... the other thing is, you begin to realize that every single group at its head is composed of disgusting people, they are terribly selfish and arrogant, intolerable as company or companions.

FireFly is apathetic to its drawbacks.\n- Plan to play with family? Don't. You'll need to spend significant amounts of money to interact in-game, aside from joining the same faction and/or engaging in chain messages.\n- FireFly doesn't screen for alt accounts. As long as they get their money, players are essentially free to do whatever they please, which leads to an awful lot of treachery and deception (in turn offering unfair advantages).\n- Bans and suspensions are extremely infrequent. One player, reported by me, spammed several parish message boards with profanity, hate speech, and other vulgar material. He hasn't missed a day since.\n- This game takes an inane amount of time to progress and is far too reliant on cash investment or alliances for sustainability.\n- Speaking of alliances, players will find themselves thrust into the middle of warring factions or houses early on, unless they are fortunate enough to align themselves with well-off, high-ranking neutral players (who are far and few between).\n- Politics can be fun, but it ultimately leads to drama and senseless wasting of time. You think Facebook is dramatic? Try SHK on for size.\n- As each World progresses into a new Age, those worlds waste away into agonizing oblivion, later to be controlled by players who were previously shunned or spent far too long on the bottom rung and now desire to be worshipped.\n\nAfter investing over 3,600 hours into this game, I feel qualified enough to offer a resounding "No" to the question of whether or not I would recommend this game. While I cannot deny the amount of fun I've had, in SHK, the bad most assuredly outweighs the good. If you have ample cash to spend, time to invest, and love persistent drama, this is the game for you. Otherwise, grab yourself a copy of Stronghold Crusader and put together a LAN party with some friends.\n\n\n\n* Edit(s) for typos.","February 6, 2015","false","763.9"," 115 of 124 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","115","124","9","5"

But is it also a good game, that I would recommend to my friends and such? We will see.\n\nWhen starting as a new player you will mostly be excited about all the cool researches that you can unlock, about the ranking up and village polishing, that will keep you busy and entertained at the same time. The game does quite well at that, and manages to introduce you into all the different aspects one after another, which keeps you motivated without overdemanding you. However, it can be said that the longer you play, that these things become less and less important. Researching and ranking up will become slower and slower and less interesting, and you will most likely start to see the computer generated castles and attacks more as an annoyance, than as a welcome gameplay element. And then once you kinda got over that "PvE" content of the game, you will see that the "PvP" is all that matters.\n\nAnd there we go allready: despite some short noob protection time, that covers up your villages for 3-5 days right after spawn/purchase, you are ALLWAYS in PvP mode, so to say. And there is basically no way to disable it. You build your villages on a wide, open map, protect it with some simple castle structures within a fairly limited area, but no matter if you are currently taking part in a fight and staring at your screen like a maniac, or instead sleeping/busy with school, work, whatever/or simply not ONLINE (how dare you!?), you can be attacked from everyone, at any time, and from every place on the map! This game never stops, it just goes on and on, no matter if you like it or not. Combine that with the extremely fast army speeds, and you get a really really bad mixture allready. While playing within a medieval setting, the game doesn't let armies march somewhere, instead it sends them "flying" across the map, with the speed of a jet plane. You aren't online between the few minutes/hours of attack launch and arrival? Then say "bye bye" to your village. Stronghold Kingdoms in that matter can be an extremely fast and unforgiving game, and will play a lot like a RTS game, where units get moved around quickly to strike at enemy weak spots, or simply roll them over with some more armies, in case the defence is good. That could be a fun thing then, but as said this game is pretty UNIQUE, and so the outcome is pretty weird: fights slow down or stop completely, when both sides are online and aware. Like it normally is the case with any other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. But they can heat up up until total annihilation, when it turns out that one side is NOT online, and the enemy finds out about that.\n\nEven that, you could say, is no problem since you then just have to take it as bad luck, get yourself together and move on, in case you were on the receiving end. Building new villages, gathering forces, then strike back. But at this exact point, the game turns out to be terribly broken, and  this aspect then is the thing that seriously ruins the "PvP" experience in a whole. Because if you think rebuilding is as fast and easy as attacking, then you are wrong. It's not.\n\nBuilding or rebuilding a village in Stronghold Kingdoms is slow. Very slow. It takes around one month(!) to build up a full castle from scratch (with full research!), and even longer to do the same with the village part, that belongs to each castle. While placing buildings at first is easy and fast (in case you manage to supply the new village with ressources), the building speed becomes slower and slower the more buildings you placed allready. A mechanics that you normally just find in browser games. The castle building time as such means allready that you will be without proper defence for at least some weeks, but the village building speed basically tops that all and guarantees for a really slow recovering after successfull enemy attacks. Get razed within seconds, then build up again for months. Well, bad luck there, I guess you better should have stayed awake that night. :)\n\nBasically you are an idiot, for building up on your own, that's what the game tells you. But seeing that the attack option where villages get deleted completely is the most widely used variant, you might want to agree that at least someone has to do it at some point. Those people will then get insulted as "farmers", but truth is that they are the only ones that keep fighting gameplay alive, since they are the ones that supply the material on which wars can get fought on.\n\nSo overall this can be said about Stronghold Kingdoms: It's a slowly starting, and even in later gameplay mostly also slowly playing medieval-styled game, that sadly counters this  slow and repetitive build-up part with a very fast and unforgiving wreck-down part, and therefor fails to balance out these two important core gameplay mechanics. The only thing that may keep you going at the end are the various friends and allies that you meet over time...putting the gameplay itself aside, the game offers you a lot of pretty well made communication possibilities then, with ingame forums, a private message system, and (sadly rarely used) ingame live chatrooms. You can then moan together with your friends about the plonker that just destroyed your good, fully built village over night for no good reason within 5 minutes, and maybe gather together for a just as merciless counterattack. But that, seriously, isn't half as entertaining as it may sound like. ;) So go and try out the game (it's free, after all...), have some fun with it, but watch out for the possibly unbalanced and unfair end-game part, that will mostly either bore you to death, stomp you into the ground completely, or offer you an uncertain thing inbetween those 2 options.","July 14, 2014","false","706.8"," 111 of 121 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","111","121","0","11"

This is pay2win in it's full glory. Spending enough money you can have instant resources, buildings and castles completed (all instant), research? Yep, instant too. You can literally dump 1000's of $$$ in it and you won't even notice be4 it's too late (provided you have that kind of money).\nAnd if you play without paying you progress so slow that it's plain boring and people who invest money will always be able to beat you, even when you've lvled up to some decent ranks.\nI'm fine with pay2win in general, but the main trick in this particular game is the card system. You can't just go and buy best cards for fixed price - you buy only decks, that give you a chance to get those cards. You can buy lots of regular and some rare cards, but the best stuff is this "chance", in other words - prepare your wallet.\nOther than that game is simply too addictive in a bad way - if you want to be someone in it, you HAVE to stay online, to check on your stuff all the time, to send troops, scouts, trade, attack enemies, defend your villages, it's all very time consuming.\nIn conclusion, you can compare it to Travian, if you know what I mean..\nLook at my time played and think for a moment - I know what I'm talking about.\n\n\nWell first 100 hours of gameplay were "I hope it's worth it", game promotes you to pay for cards from the start. There's even a "quest" to do that in order to be able to get 1 random free card each 24 hours (not much, but better than nothing too).\nAnyway, why I spent so much time? Because, after you dump some cash on the game you'd probably feel stupid to just leave it, you know? Trying to give it a chance.. but it sucks money like a vacuum cleaner. And I've seen players that spend so much on it it's crazy - for example, saw a guy that was under attack, his village were to be destroyed, but he didn't want it so bad he rebuilt everything with cards all the time, while armies were still marching towards him - all got destroyed except for the last timed attack when he either gave up or money enened, I bet on the last.\nWith cards you can get instant troops, instant resources, instant buildings, even instant towers and walls in your castle, but you have to spend tons of cash. Even if you don't - there are people out there who do, and they totally own the place and dictate you their rules and you won't be able to do much.","December 6, 2013","false","350.5"," 135 of 167 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","135","167","0","13"

(*You cannot use vacation mode unless you pay to use it -vacation mode is temporary, so you must have an active Coin to use it, and Coins cost RL cash.)\n\nEach new age brings with it changes which further break and increase the damage that can be caused by the game breaking exploits, making it easier and easier for players to lose all spent cash in an instant to any one player using the exploits.  Every building, resource, and almost all actions take time, and all of these can be lost from the heavily unbalanced system of pvp.\n\nThere is zero positive admin activity and the fact that you can lose all work overnight with zero recourse, I would not recommend spending time, or money, on this game.\n\nIt's a pay to win, lose everything instantly (including the money you spent on the game) while you sleep, soulless game that if you spend any length of time on, can be lost within an hour.  There is next to zero game balance and all ingame work is destructible.\n\nIt is World of Tanks Gold ammo but FAR worse.  Card packs are temporary, and buffs are even more so, next to none lasting more than 23 hours.  The towns or armies they are used on can be taken out of the game, and there is no lasting aspect of the game except technology, gold, and honor, which leads to only one long-term plan for pvp, which is griefing using the aforementioned broken and easily exploitable ingame mechanics.\n\nIf the game was re-balanced to provide permanent cards you bought, but used cool-downs instead of just disappearing, then this game might be worth TRYING.\n\nI do not recommend this game.\n\n\nIf you like this game, or want to like this game, I would recommend Clash of Clans app.  It's easily more fun than any one of the seconds in the over 2000 hours I've played Stronghold Kingdoms, and hasn't cost me anything.","March 19, 2014","false","559.5"," 80 of 94 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","80","94","0","4"

Therefore I can say that this game is a massive waste of your time.\n\nI see innovation here - a lot of it. I see opportunities to play stronghold like never before, with an MMO idea all taking place on a large map where cooperation and diplomacy are key to victory in the world of thousands of players all with their own individual strongholds they too are building. The game still has all the customization that stronghold offered you as well, placing the walls, towers, gatehouses, moats, spikes, and more all wherever you want to. It also gives you the freedom to train and manually deploy your own troops both defensively in your castle and/or offensively to siege another. In fact, at the time I began testing this game and for some time afterwards, it was unbelievably fun. But since then it's been squashed into a payment-heavy hunk of crap.\n\n"Cards" in the game are used to boost what you can do with no limit to how many you can use, as long as you can afford to spend real world money to get them. On top of that, you require to buy premium subscriptions just to play the game properly, or you'll be logging in every hour to do something when nothing queues up properly. Cards can be earned for free, yes, but they take a long time and are fully randomized. You can earn more for free per week, but that is locked behind not one, but TWO paywalls of buying subscriptions to the game. You must buy TWO subscription tokens in order to unlock the full range of cards. On top of that, cards can still be bought with REAL WORLD MONEY after you ALREADY had to spend REAL WORLD MONEY on buying a PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION just to play the game properly. This is massively unbalanced and, as is common among MOBILE COW CLICKERS, can take you from the bottom of the pack to #1 on the leaderboard in a matter of minutes should you pay enough money. Nobody will, but the fact that it is a possibility means the game is massively unbalanced. Any game that makes it possible to advance from bottom to top within minutes cannot be considered free to play.\n\nOutside of that, the game itself is barebones. Your castle management becomes minimal, as the tiny map areas and massively limited resources for each "village" means you will not be able to customize the village to look as you please, it's going to have to run for maximum efficiency, followed by waiting through timers and resource walls as you wait for enough resources or an open queue slot to continue. This game also has an issue of expansion, due to the extreme number of players - castles/villages can only be built on predetermined slots, and the number of people in the game makes it very difficult to expand peacefully without spending an absolute fortune of gold and leaving your new towns well outside your support range. Production lines are also removed now, with the only actual production being from wood/iron -> weapons. That's it. All other production chains, no matter how simple, have been ditched. To help slow you down, each time you build something, it raises its own construction cost and also increases the time required to build the next structure. So, don't go too fast - buy our ♥♥♥♥ instead!\n\nThis game offers so much room for innovation in the stronghold series. It makes me want to see a stronghold game taking place on a large meta-map managing multiple castles against various AI opponents or players doing similar things, but not in this fashion. I want to see it in a microtransaction-free, upfront paid game with no multi-day timers or subsctipitions or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that. This franchise NEEDS innovation, and the ideas behind stronghold kingdoms if applied to a paid game could provide it. But this just isn't it. All it does is makes you want to go play another stronghold game instead.\n\nAvoid this.","November 30, 2014","false","43.3"," 58 of 66 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","58","66","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkPhoton5/recommended/47410/","DarkPhoton5","Hungry Hound","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkPhoton5/","23 products in account","Stronghold Kingdoms is a possibly one of the most P2W games I have EVER played almost to the point that it becomes  hilarious. Let me explain.\n\nI played the game across 4 game worlds have hundred of hours and spent the £6 it takes to get the 2 free cards a day. I feel this isn't too unreasonable for what is effectively a glorified browser game(that runs through it's own launcher). However I couldn't be more wrong.\n\nIt seems in each world in SHK there are literally a handful of hyper elitist, epeen obsessed, ego ♥♥♥♥♥s that have paid hundreds if not thousands of actual currency to roflstomp everyone who hasn't bowed down instantly to them. You can't defend against this level of P2W you just accept 'oh my village and castle i took a month to create will be gone in 1 second and have to start over'.\n\nBut don't just take my word for it, download the game and look in most of the worlds you will see about 85% of them are totally dead ruled by above described players. Firefly gets around this by creating a new world every now and then so the p2w can continue.\n\nThe carding P2W system allows you to for example: get to top rank of a new world in roughly 30 minutes (this takes months if you are 100% F2P), repeatedly raise a maximum sized army instantly, boost speed across the map to ridiculous levels, oh and gain totally unrestricted amount of in-game resources.\n\nThe Devs don't appear to care about the level of p2w as, as I understand the game is run by a small team. At the end of the day, why actually put any effort into creating a  fair game when you can sit back and let a few whales pay your salaries right SHK devs?\n\nOn a plus side the game still has the unique art style that made the early Strongholds great, but then this isn't surprising as most of this game has been ripped straight out of those early titles.\n\nTo summaries I haven't written this review in a moment of rage, more of sadness that yet another once great game studio that brought us great titles back in the day such as Stronghold 1, Crusades and Stronghold 2 has descended into the excrement of the F2P P2W market. I'd say the devs should take a good long look at themselves, as Firefly does have the history and potential to make good old school (almost indie?) games.\n\nEdit: 23.04.2016\n\nJust to update this review, I decided to try this game again to see if anything had changed and if my review was still relevant. Needless to say it has got even worse.\n\nI played a totally peaceful role helping players where I could and not getting involved in any of the faction dramas that generally happen at the start of a new world.\n\nBy day 10 I have been deleted from the game world with no warning by a player that has paid a lot of money to get to almost top rank already  (only day 10 remember).\n\nOn asking him why he did this I was greeted by a torrent of offensive language and general elitism about "he can because he paid" and how anyone who hasn't spent the amount of money he has in the game is garbage. I believe in psychological fields this is a classic case of a real world inferiority complex manifesting in an online environment.\n\nAs I said in my original review the devs seem fine with this level of pay to win, which in turn encorages these types of nasty individuals to group together.\n\nSo I still do not reccommend anyone try this game. Unless of course you like to make up for failings in your life by spending ludicras amounts of money in online games for self gratification no one else is willing to give you in the real world.","November 4, 2015","false","553.7"," 58 of 67 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","58","67","6","5"

This cash-shop gives a significative advantage: 1.- Premium token (you can move buildings, auto trade, auto scout, auto attack IA, auto recruit, give resources, troops or monks to a player that shares your IP, a global view of your villages) & 2.- Card packs (militarly, production, with different lvls with differents cost). With premium token you can have a proper manage of everything (I use premium only for buildings, auto recruit and global view of villages) but I don't spend money at card-pack because are expensive.\n\nCard-Packs are used to make insta-armies, insta villages, insta resources, insta everything (even castle defences, reserachs, rank,...) When a player takes a lot of time to reach Crown Prince, there is a heavy carder that ranks to crown prince with full villages full armies full research and everything in a few days. I can talk more about this theme but there is a better choice than keep reading me: Go to stronghold kingdoms and enjoy reading all types of cards.\n\nSo, there is nothing more to add about pay-theme. However, there is a topic that a lot of people don't like: How Staff manages the multi-accounting/sharing IP (not the same as multi-accounting)/etc. I have met a lot of friends in real life that got banned just because they shared IP a few times (House-LAN-party, for example) so FireFly starts to follow you. In case you get again the conflict of IP-Sharing, they start to ban you (24, 48h, 72h,...until it reachs to perma-ban). In my opinion, there is no way (at least have 100% prove) that one player has multi-accounted. And not all multi-accounting players are banned because one friend got bored from this game and he create intentionally 5 accounts to farm FP and makes a mess in different servers. He claimed that he was multi-accounting and ask FireFly to ban him, however, he did not got ban (at least perma ban).\n\nIn my opinion, that is all about what I dislike of FireFly. There are other things as the number of worlds, or how FireFly organizes different stuff...but I don't think that is relevant. About the positive stuff I can clearly say that there is a big bunch of them:\n\nWe can start with the experience of every MMO: It's a massive game online where you share experiences with other players & compete each other in order to be at first place and satisfy your Ego (normally, there are players that have different objectives). This game doesn't make you play only for the main goal (win era), you can make your own objectives (of course, with no monetary prize) like being the most farmer, most fighter, most diplomatic, most roler (I have found different groups that roled in SHK: Extremist religious people, pacifist people who like to feed players, ...).\n\nIn addition, SHK have plenty tones of features as research tree (It gives you a lot of strategies and different ways to grow), castle design (is the only game about strategy and mmo that let's you design your own castle), armies design (mix the number of troops and how to send them), village layouts, strategy to produce, divide work & be better than others, etc...\n\n\nIn conclusion, I don't recommend this game because his creepy-staff & high use of Cash-shop to finance his project and disbalance the game. They have improved a lot since Alpha but they have to improve a lot more if they want to increase their population. I want to keep clear that this profile only have 10 hrs because I use the stand-alone version of SHK.\n\nMy nickname in game is Usurf Pieschafados.","June 30, 2015","false","10.0"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","37","44","2","0"

It is a strategic castle/village building game, with combat, trading, gathering ressources, monks, etc, in a real-time large world to play on. You have to wait for your buildings to be completed and your army takes a long time to get to other castles to attack so expect a less action-filled gameplay!\n\nMy steam time is inacurate, i've only played the game downloaded directly from the website, I was rank 20 on 2 worlds. While it was fun and entertaining for a month, it quickly became tedious and well... Keep reading.\n\nNot only that, but it is one of the most P2W game ever created in my opinion. If you pay alot of money, you can get an unlimited amount of cards that can repair your castles, spawn troops, make your troops 3-6x faster, almost everything is possible with those cards. If you want to get them without paying, it takes a lot of time and to get a steady amount of cards you need to have purchased Crowns ( Real money currency. ).\n\nYou can simply win a war by ''Carding'', yes, it actually is a term! Credit Carding pretty much. Otherwise, the game could have been fun longterm, leading your House to victory via economy, war, diplomacy or monks!","February 23, 2014","false","1.3"," 43 of 55 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","43","55","0","0"

But you get tired of fighting the Ai, and want a challenge against another human. And, if it was free, and had alot of PvP to it, you'd have your dream computer game. But you doubt it'd be free. Then, Stronghold Kingdoms is shown on your Steam search. Bullyseye. Money on the nose. Congrats on finding your dream game, complete with PvP, castle, knights, real world maps, strategy, and excitement.\n\nWrong. Your a "bully" for wanting to battle different players and get involved in House wars, and any war for that  matter, House or no House. And if you do attack a player, unknowing about the "bully" rules or not, you end up reset unless of course you have dozens of vassal armies, and tons of cards. Whats the point of having a PvP world, 24/7 at that, if you can never use the PvP? Mind you, the players, the ones who DESPISE you attacking another player, will gladly attack you cause they were bored, or just simply needed the supplies or wanted a new town and captured yours. But your not allowed to attack back, or else you'll be the bully, and will need to be reset! This is pathetic and an injustice to the defender. But thats not all the community has decided:\n\nThe soldier recruiting. Its very limited. Your given six options to choose from: peasant, archer, pikemen, swordsmen, catapaults, and captains. Peasants are near useless, but cheap to make and handy for quick battles. Archers are vital to the game, and it would be near impossible to play the game without them. Pikemen are somewhat cheap to recruit, and are effective in battle. Swordsmen are, by far, the coolest soldier on the battlefield. Its probably the most medieval looking thing on the entire game! The catapaults are useless unless attacking. Captains look like dismounted knights, but with a cape, like a king, and wields an axe. Expensive, and best for attacking. So, with these options in mind, you can customize your army! Wrong! The community has decided archers and pikemen are the only soldiers you really need. Swordsmen are "to aggressive" so you hardly see them and they highly discourage you even recruiting them. And they'll expect 375+ archers on your castle walls for defense to keep out invaders. Oh and unit space. After some research, your able to have 500 units. Units include scouts, merchants, monks, and soldiers. However, 1 monk=25 spots out of your 500! Safe to say, by the time you get 8 scouts(max allowed) 10 merchants(carries enough supplies worth the time) and save enough room for even 2 monks(50 spots taken with those alone) you'll get somewhere 319-342 soldiers. How are you able to get 375 archers out of that!? Its rather a nusiance and it would be much handier if every unit cost 1 spot. Next, the castles. To save time, basically put, they'll force you to build your castle THE same way everytime in every town, in every House, on every server. They will raze your town if you dont. To prevent invaders, is there wimpy excuse. Or make fun of you, if you dont build by there own standards. And still this one style the community has picked, gets razed in every war. So shouldn't you get creative instead of this grind of castle building the same thing over and over? I mean its not like it proves indestructible. They'll launch 5+ parish armies at it, timed attacks to take out your archers, and other defenses.\n\nCards is, pretty much, the legal way to "cheat" on here. Basically, within 2 hours you could have a near fully built town, high rank, lots of researchs done. And your neighbor has a tiny, barely built town, low rank and little to no research done, because he is not carding. In wars, the winning side is NOT who was the best fighter, or had better tactics. Its whoever was online the most to buy cards to use. Say I was in a battle, one-on-one, and my enemy used cards and I didn't. It'll take me four hours to recruit a full army. And then, it'll take two hours for them to reach his town. My enemy uses cards and voila! He has full army in 30 minutes, and another card and his army is reaching my town in 45 minutes, which was really 2 hours away. Cards also limit castle damage so, basically, use cards or just wait, slowly, to do ANYTHING!\n\nFinally, the players. First off, Ive met some really nice fellows on here. The rest, are so mean, its enough to make you quit this game altogether. I have been called names, as if I was being bullied on a schoolyard playground. And these were mostly in battles, and one was from another player who, thinks Im a "bully" for wanting to try out the battles, so he bullies me, name calls me, makes fun of me, tells others Im trouble. But he isn't a bully, according to him. Ive been threatenend to be r*ped over scouting someone. Murder threats also happen in wars. Thankfully, Ive never seen any,  my allies are the ones who told me. It caused multiple players to actually quit one server, out of fear, because they AND there familes were threatened with murder. And, so far, it seems  FireFly aint the least bit concerned over any of this. Oh and the Ai is a problem. The Wolf castles spawn WAY to fast and then, literally, destroy your castle, makes it harder to bring in peasants to build an army to destroy it, forces you to lower your taxs, and usually, no one destroys it, due to needing supplies for wars, that they discourage you from being in, until your town is in complete shambles. Cutting Wolf castle spawn rates would make this game even slightly more fun.\n\nOverall, not a good game. If they could give you an option to avoid human player attacks or not, then maybe we could have a little more of the PvP, without the innocent getting destroyed in the process. Towns defense upgrades would also be a welcome boost. Catapaults(cats, in-game) shoot so fast, that even if you manage to defend, your castle is destroyed big-time. Makes your victory feel bittersweet. But you gotta defend off 200 some archers, 150+ pikemen, and 100 or so cats, along with the captain(s) with, at max 400 possible soldiers. 500 possible attackers versus 400 possible defenders. Perhaps thats why the discourage the PvP, is because its way to unbalanced, and the defenders odd's of winning is slightly better than winning the Lottery.\n\nAt the end of the day, with PvP dubbed as "bullying" all you have left is a building game, and watching numbers go up game. It sounds more like a math game, and who wants to spend there free time doing math related stuff, such as watching numbers go up, numbers go down(addition and subtraction) and waiting for the one building to finish so you can place another?\n\nI'd highly recommend Age of Empires 2 HD or Medieval Kingdoms 2: Total War over this game. I know you cant beat free, but the money spent on those games are worth there money.

I was accellerating quite well in the game for the first week. Then you get to a point where things start to take time and a little more strategy of what to build and upgrade based on a focus you want to persue. This I was happy with because it makes sense, you can't just major in everything and expect to go far sooner. So I went into military while prepping for religeous expansion. Once again, I was progressing along very nicely.\n\nProbably a couple of months went by of dedicated play time (logging every day). I was making smart attacks, gaining honor, rebuilding my troops to always maintain 200 defending troops in my castle, and another 200-300 attacking AI for honor. My castle had a moat around the whole area, traps set, and maxed balista towers as well as turret towers, along side my 200 archers. I had two sets of walls that circled my village for enemies to get through, the walls were 3 layers thick, and I had large/grand towers all around as well. Also started to build into religion as I was able to max out my military.\n\n2 months of work that built me up to this, and one day I get on to find out I was attacked for the first time. What was I attacked with? 2 captains who were obviously maxed out, and I think 20 pikes. None of them died because the captains apparently can heal them as well as make them go incredibly fast, as well as boost their dmg so they basically ran through the moat (which usually takes about 3-5 seconds for an enemy to fill), took down both sets of walls in a matter of 3 seconds, ran over my few pikes in my village and won the fight and looted my village. The entire attack took about 5-6 seconds after I spent about a month building my bloody castle.\n\nSo what's the point of spending all of that time building when all someone has to do is max their captains upgrades (only a few upgrades to do), go in and take down a fully constructed castle in a matter of seconds? The only thing that protected me from being attacked again was an ally sending a monk to my castle and giving me protection for 24 hours or something. All that work put into protecting my village, and someone sends in 22 guys that just destroys me. That doesn't make any sense. Thus, I deleted the game.\n\nThat's my rant/review of this game. Choose to support it if you will, or force them to smarten up their mechanics and balancing system. Because in reality, this is a GREAT strategy game. But I will not play it again with crap like that happening.","August 31, 2014","false","290.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","2"

Building your own mini empire across several settlements, setting up trade routes between them, sending out hordes of units to assault other people's castles are all fun, and getting big enough to be tipped into a faction and start politicking is also fun. People are on 24/7, building and plotting each other's demise, and it inspires an incredible sense of dedication to checking in over the course of the day and making it a part of your life. Things happen slowly, but the decisions you make are always interesting.\n\nThat said, the game has two hard currencies: time and money. The more you're on, and the more your allies are on, the more you can strategize and wage a 24/7 war against whoever. There is a way to build an efficient and collaborative war machine, and doing things besides playing this game are not it. Even if you do dedicate your waking existence to the game--and there are definitely enough people who do so that it matters--you can still be outspent by people with really deep pockets that are filled with real world currency, who spend it on thigns that give them free resources, production boosts, and movement boosts. I don't think it's possible for a faction that is 100% dedicated but doesn't spend a dime to overcome a faction that is 100% dedicated and has a few people spending $10. If anyone reading this knows otherwise, I'd love to hear about it.\n\nSo I'm split. The game is great fun, but only until you run into a group of players who have more time and real world money than you. Once that happens, they crush the ♥♥♥♥ out of you and take your settlement and all of the buildings and resources you accumulated. Once you lose all settlements, it's back to square one. You're given a fresh hamlet to build up and inevitably have raided, and it becomes clear that all you're doing is producing a series of feeder farms for the upper echelons. And that's cool and all, but I get enough of this kind of ♥♥♥♥ in the real world.","April 8","false","296.5"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","19","22","6","0"

Teamwork is huge, and you'll find large houses (aka "guilds") battling over terroity, it can get you hooked for a while, but overall I'd not recommend it, for various reasons:\n\nGreat concept, but lacking mechanicsThis another bugger. The game gets very repitive very fast. You'll find yourself doing the same thing over and over and over, and it gets very tedius. Place the same buildings, send out traders evertime you login, scout resources, clearing some AIs.\nThe only variation you really get in this game is when going at war with other factions, it's pretty much the one thing that can really give excitement, and it's one of the strong points and while the mechanics are awefully similar, you still need to think about what you do in a war situation instead of just mindlessly sending attacks. If you play smart in war,  you will survive.\n\nOverall the concept is really nice, but after seeing how little was done with it, it's a bit say, it could have been a much better game.\n\nPay 2 WinIt's massively pay 2 win. Premium is cheap, and gives quite the advantage, you can do without, but it also means you don't have to babysit 24/7 just so you can get the next research or building.\nThis would also be bearable, but the real problem here are cards - while there are ingame systems to obtain cards, such as free cards every 12h (but ONLY after you paid TWICE), and some quests or raids on special AI castles that give you a chance at you card packs, people who just spent TONS of money can buy justwhatever they want.\nThe more people spend and use cards, the more massive their advantage become; if you bother to look at the maginitude of cards, you can see clearly how advantageous is this - 10x the production, 2x stronger defenses each, lots of instant troops, even instantly building castle defenes.\n\nA good example of this how the most recent world 2 europe just started, and people reached rank 14 within an hour with the use of spamming cards, and the avarage player (even with some cards AND premium), can make it to rank 4 or 5 in the same time; the righer ranks take exceptionally longer to achieve, so the first few are easy, and it would usually take a few days to get to 14.\n\nPoor DevelopersAs I said I've been returning to this game. It was fun for a while, but after 3 years it was shocking to see how little was done to the game. What has changed in such a long time period? They added quests which give you a one time bonus, ears which are mostly just restarting a world with some slight modificiations and 2 new AI castle types.\nOh right, and don't forget that they existed even more pay to win cards. That's the most important part, they added tons and tons of even stronger cards, you can only recieve when you *BUY* card packs (or get really lucky when you find a card pack in game), the weaker card can be bought for card points, but the really strong ones only found.\n\nIt shows they only care about the p2w and money aspect of the game.\n\nOn the other hand, did anything in the gameplay evolve to make it fairer or improve it? Nope, nothing. Actually, the one change they made it made even worse, i.e. like captains (an extremly expensive unit) that now disappears after attacking other players.\n\n\n","December 11, 2014","false","138.8"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","1"

While it does have some Stronghold flair, it suffers from too many MMO/Browser game limitations.","June 18, 2015","false","160.6"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

It is both a time consumer, and involves a lot of politics.  For most people, this is okay; for the casual gamer who likes to spend a few minutes every day managing a castle and speaking with people in your parish and your house when you get higher up it works out alright.  It can have its fun moments, and equally its pretty jerkish moments with other players, as regardless of what you're doing or how you are playing there are still many other players out there on your world that are playing at the exact same time as you are, and some take this game hardcore.\n\nThis game...is too slow.  Way too slow.  I can see why; it's meant to keep players engaged in a game about castles with other people.  I can appreciate a game being slow for the sake of realism.  But if I'm going to be gathering resources, building a city, constructing a castle, or making soldiers I would like the luxury of designing everything in the glory of realtime thanks to technology.  I'm used to playing games like Age of Empires, Starcraft, Supreme Commander and the like, where playing too slow gets you booted, so when I'm forced to go immensely slow just to see my fifth or sixth pig farm get built to feed my many cities, I got a bit batsh-erhem...I go a bit wonky.\n\nI got as far as Prince before I gave up on this game.  My house was unlucky enough to be one of the lesser houses on the winning side, and knowing my luck another house would not pick up me or my faction due to the low priority of both my parish and my region.  So, I bade my party farewell and offed my castles, and have lived the better for it.  Too bad I'm not going to be getting all those hours back I should have spent studying for college.","October 14, 2014","false","378.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Not only I have spent over 800 hours on Steam launcher, but I also have atleast 1000 hours on launcher that I downloaded from SHK's site.

This game has given me some nice experiences, but most of time I've spent has gone wasted with losing all hard work, destroyed by the ones who pay loads of cash.\n\nSo I've listed some Pros and Cons, here we go...\n\n-Pros-\n\n+ Four tech trees that give some variety, though most likely your forced to pick Military sooner or later...\n\n+ Graphics are made in that old Stronghold style, I personally like it.\n\n-Cons-\n\n- P2W... Hardest carders spend thousands of euros on new servers.\n\n-You can't place village buildings wherever you want if you want them to be effective.\n\n-Spend hours building something, just to find it captured or razed by some carder, while you were sleeping. The reasons are often random.\n\n-Kinda same as previous one. Theres no way to just farm alone... Neutrals are often captured or forced to join a side, OR BE RAZED.\n\nDon't play this game, just dont... Too much time and money wasted on this... This would be perfect without the cards etc...

I soon learned that to the north, a man had spent THOUSANDS of dollars buying himself an amazing set of cities with good defenses. This is a pay to win game. I spent 90% of my time on this game for the next few weeks, and never got to the level that the man was at on Day 1.

You can buy strategy cards which can boost your production, or instantly replenish your army, or instantly let you finish your research, or instantly lets you place buildings, etc. Paying players can rank up in minutes what non paying members would take months. The top players have spend thousands of dollars on this game. You will see these players in multiple servers, all joining together and taking the fun out of this game. SHK would be more fun and equal if it wasn't for these strategy cards. The devs needs to release a server without them.\n\nYes, I have played this game for months, why? Because I also had fun. You start peasant, with 1 town and no research, almost no gold and you rank up to crown prince with 15+ cities, a huge army and millions in gold. You can become a farmer and build and sell a huge amount of supplies, become a fighter and attack enemy players, or become a monker and use the power of faith to take out your enemies. You can all do it in this game.\n\nAs you rank you rank up you get to research new types of food, weapons, merchants, new unit types, buildings, or increase speed/capacity of existing units/production facilities. Your villages (and later villages) will start to grow, allowing you to sell more stuff and get richer. You will start by attacking and scouting wolf lairs, and as you grow stronger, with more advanced and stronger unit types, you can attack enemy castles.\n\nCastle attacking is very basic. Just place your army and send the attack. It will then take several minuts to hours (depending on the distance) for your army to arrive. Battles are automatic and you will only see a battle report after the battle is finished. AI pathfinding can be a bit weird.\n\nPlayers can play together and form factions. Several factions can join a house. Houses can form alliances and fight for control over the map. Sounds fun, but in most servers super alliances are quickly formed and then everyone farms, there is no fighting for control of the map. New players should join a new server, because older servers are pretty much dead and AI is too difficult to attack.","April 15","false","819.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I will say that if you put time into it, this can be a fun game.\n\nHowever, the game is a pay to win game that demands a lot of time, and punishes heavily for ignoring it, typically requiring even more money to recover from mistakes. Even if you do everything right, you will need money.\n\nThe communication required to successfully coordinate is staggering. I met people who literally backstabbed each  other, and showed so much distrust that they refused to play with each other anymore over a game. If you ever wanted to study how people act when a game has serious stakes, this is probably one of the games to do it.\n\nIf that sounds like a game for you, then go for it. However be aware that this game will require money, coodination skills (far beyond what MMO guilds demand),likely a voice chat server, and over a 100 people you can rely on.\n\nEven if you do not plan to win the leaderboards, be aware that if someone wants, they can and will take over your villages. Even if you have nothing to do with a war, you will likely be taken over if you did not properly build your castle.\n\n\nIn Short: If you want a demanding pay to win game that is more about making friends, coordinating, and keeping people from wanting to kill each other, then this game is for you.

This is a 24/7 game. You cannot just leave the game and come back to it days later and expect things to be as you left them.\n\nWhat I like best:  The social interaction. You meet people from all over the world and of different age groups. Enjoy leading a faction and/or being a house marshal, build villages, or work on leaderboard scores and quests. Trying to get your faction or house to be number one is very fun. If you are very social and enjoy spending a lot of time playing on the computer, you will love this game.\n\nWhat I like least:  It is a "pay to win" game and the customer support department doesn't really care about issues with the game function. The more crowns and cards you have, the better you can do in the game. If you don't play a premium token you won't do as well in the game. The Firefly support attitude comes across as, "I don't care." You cannot have other members of your household play the game (your account will be banned). When I argued a point with them, politely and with no swearing, after a temporary ban, they permanently banned my son's account. When I experienced what I thought was a bug in the game and sent in the report and explained what I did to resolve it, they sent me a generic message asking me to explain the issue more and explain what I did to resolve it. I had to remessage and explain I already did that (meaning ... they didn't even bother to read the first message).\n\nUpdate: I had another "bug" issue to contact support about. I received a generic reply and they said they could "discern no error," even after I submitted screen shots of the reports and pointed out what happened. All they did was politely tell me, "Oh well," and didn't do anything to resolve the problem.

You need to pay to use vacation mode? Seriously? If I am going on holiday in a place with no internet access and no access to my computer and I don't pay you sons of ♥♥♥♥♥es money then all my stuff will get raided?

Great job. Way to take 90% of the challenge out of the game for rich people - oh wait, rich people only have a 10% challenge all of the time anyway\n-Everyone I have met is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ toxic\n-They need to crack down on hackers more\n\nHowever, there are some good points.\n\n-As far as I am aware, this is the fist game of its kind, so it has originality on its side\n-Nice constantly evolving entirely player-made politics and economies\n-Uhhh.... um... crap. Nothing else.\n\nNow some suggestions:\n-If they just made it so you pay for the base game rather than pay to win, it would be amazing. I would happily pay like £10 for this game and play it if they removed all the P2W features\n-If they added in actual control to sieges like in the original Stronghold, it would be amazing\n-If two hostile armies crossed each other then there should be a battle\n-It should take less time to build things\n-Don't make the terrain of villages selectable, it should be static depending on the village's location - so only coastal villages can have salt, etc.\n-Add in ports, which are valuable trade places and armies need to pass through them before crossing seas. If a hostile player owns the port, you cannot use it and need to capture it first.

It's alot of fun but it is a PAY TO WIN game, and I've tried playing with and without paying in this game.\n\nStronghold Kingdoms took the Original Stronghold idea and made it into an online game,it is divided into five main areas:\n\nYour Villages : Where you build up your economy, you make your population happy or angry by increasing the tax levels, the ammount of food they will receive and the ale they are allowed to the drink.These 4 factors will give you honor, which is used to conquer, pillage raze or plunder other player's villages. You can get more honor by making banquets.\n\nYour Castles: Castles have always been a huge part of Stronghold games. Using the resources you get from improving your village you will be able to build huge castles to protect your economy and productivity. These castles can then be garrisoned by the troops you create, Either pikemen, archers, swordsmen or catapults.\n\nThe People Around you/ Houses: Having alot of players in the same game just pillaging each other until the last man standing wouldn't be much fun all the time, So the developers decided to create Houses, these are like Factions you join there are 20 houses in the game, Each house has a marshall that decides what the house should do next.\nThese houses devide into factions in the House which are controlled by high ranking members.\n\nThe best invasion I have ever seen was the Invasion of England which was controlled by House 1 in the Europe World, France(House 11), Spain(House 9) and Portugal(House 9) all decided to go against H1, in 1 day it was in shatters most of the players had been eliminated or just deserted they're House. It was truly an impressive feet.\n\nArmies and Vassals: As you grow in the game you can decide to have liege lords ( Someone who will protect you from other people, send you resources and armies to defend yourself) and have vassals, in which case you do the same thing to the people you decide, Each vassal allows a maximum of 500 troops to be garrisoned in the village allowing the liege lord to have thousands upon thousands of men ready for an attack.\n\nAnd Research: Research is a major factor in Stronghold Kingdoms because it allows the player to get a step ahead on other people, either in farming, military or industry.\n\nIt takes alot of time and efford to become powerful in stronghold kingdoms without Paying money.Took me about 100 days to become powerfull and that's going to stronghold every day to check up on what's going on.\n\nAnd what made me angry as hell was seeing that in 5 days Using loads of money a player got to The max rank! 5 DAYS man!! What in the ♥♥♥♥!!\nIt just made all my effords seem meaningless. Therefore I do not recommend this game, it is a time waster Do not play this unless you want to spend large ammounts of your time and money.","April 23, 2013","false","521.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

(Why hurt cheaters as long as they pay?)\n\nNo matter how you try to start the game, no matter how you choose your playstyle, someone destroys you with the help of his alt accounts (which is illegal according to the game rules, but who cares about cheating as long as they buy crowns?)\n\nBest case scenario, you start totally neutral in a newly opened server, you try to be nice to other people, you're not behind, everything is ok for now, you help other players, join the faction that is stronger, communicate with others.\nSome guy makes an alt account, spawns in your parish, starts to build up and after 5 days he starts ransacking you (which means with each attack you lose atleast 1 building), You're probably thinking "so what? defend!! build a castle", now here's the problem, after only 10 days of play, without paying hundrends of dollars you can't be that strong to build a great castle and rank up fast at the same time,\nyou either choose to play the honour path which leaves your castle vulnerable, or you play turtle, which again leaves you with a small amount of resources which is not exactly enough to build a castle that can defend agianst a troll who attacks with 80 peasants, his 80 peasants just need to destroy your wall and stay in the white line for 5 seconds, Nothing at that level of play can prevent upgraded peasants from entering the white area of your castle. and you're done, atleast one of your buildings is destroyed, now imagine losing a building every hour, 24 buildings per day, you're absolutely done. You lose all your buildings and you don't even know what to do except to start over. The funny thing is the honour cost to attack trolls is so high that neither you nor your allies can attack them without losing 90% of your honour (obviously no one helps you because of the honour cost). And even if you attack! he will just wait a day or two and then starts attacking again, even if you raze and destroy him, he will just respwan again and starts building and attacking once again. And meanwhile his main account is dominating and you're wondering if it's better to move to another parish or continue here!!\n\nPeople use alt accounts to attack, trade, to vote, any form of cheat you can imagine,\nand after all this you realize you've wasted your time over a game that kicks you back to day 1 every time you feel great about yourself... And they still need your money! otherwise you're back to square one...\n\nNo!

I spent my days gaining resources and slowly beefing up my stronghold and donating extra resources to my local parish capitol.\n\nDays of doing this was quite relaxing, and the occasional Ai attack spiced things up. Seeing how well my newly made fortifications held up against 30, then 60, then 100, then 130 enemies was quite fun.\n\nI also thought it was very cool getting to view battles between my parish and our enemy Ai, Pig. Large scale battles taking place every day while we fuel the parish with resources was amazing.\n\nThen Rise of The Wolf happened.\n\nAll at once we had an enemy Siege camp, wolf dens, bandit camps, Pig and its castle of doom, and all of the associated negative morale. Pig for what ever reason appears to target my town exclusively, on top of daily sieges and bandit raids.\n\nWithin 3 days my forces had been reduced to 3 archers and 2 morale resulting in a single peasant every 12 hours, my food consumption was set to max to boost morale with very little effect and my taxes were already starting to drain what little gold reserve I had. Then I realize that no one is attacking Pig, the siege camp, or the bandits.. and it appears most of their aggression is focused towards me. Our parish apparently had been innactive for several days prior so help from them was a long ways off.\n\nAfter speaking out in global chat, I found out that I am not the only one facing this scenario. The competent players are away or ignoring the enemies, while the weak and defenceless are destroyed by the new enemy spawn rate.\n\n\nSo, unless you know a strong player and can get cozy with them and their army, stay away until Rise of The Wolf is put to rest.","March 14, 2015","false","33.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Shortly after my "mostly good" review of SHK was posted here, my (and my borther's) accounts were both banned without any explanation. I created several tickets trying to find out why but this same terrible Customer Service rep("Lord Efficient") kept pasting canned responses about not being able to respond to individual requests, and closing the ticket.\nApparently, they can take the time to ban individual acocunts for whatever they feel like is a good reason but they are FAR TOO BUSY to tell the accused what they are being accused of, much less actually using the Ban Appeals section of the system for...you know... ban appeals (Id setlle for a coherent explanation). But, I guess f you never bother to tell someone what they are banned for, you dont have to worry about them attempting to appeal. Way to stay classy, Firefly.\n\nSo at this point my account, which I have spend a couple hundred dollars on over the course of a couple of years, is banned with no explanation and (what appears to be ) their only support rep has no skills beyond copy/paste and close ticket. And this was in the BAN APPEALS section of their ticketing system. I have emailed the Firefly Head of PR about how their customers are being treated, with no response, so I suppose the disregard for their customer's happiness appears to have infected the majority of Firefly employees. I am now taking steps to get my preorder (through STEAM) of Stronghold Crusader 2 refunded as Firefly is even worse than EA in their treatement of, or regard for their customers. I, personally, do not want another one of my dollars to benefit Firefly IN ANY WAY. I play many ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes and have never been treated like this. Even when I was accused of a TOS violation (later proven not true), I was told what I was being accused of and give a chance to answer the accusations. You will not get this courtesy out of StrongholdKingdoms support.\n\nSo If you do decide to play this game, PLEASE do not pay them for premium as you will likely, at some point, regret every dollar spent (just as I do now).

If you've got the real-life money to support the in-game upgrades, then you're fine and you'll really enjoy the game, without, you're kinda ♥♥♥♥ed. For a 'free' game, it's not so free.\nThe whole game is in real-time, and that's ok. However, with every building you place, and every thing you research, it bumps up the time. No matter the type of building, or research option. Just adds minutes to the time. And that's not so bad, until it hits over 30 minutes and you haven't got the tokens to have a building and research queue.\nSo with this, it takes a long time to build up a decent, protected base with enough peasants to train a competent army to defend your stronghold. Problem with that is, you're a new player, and this is an online world. A lot of players will ignore rule 7 - don't be a ♥♥♥♥, and just attack you for the sake of attacking. For me, who is a slow learner, that just makes the game even harder and unfair. the 2 days worth of protection at the beginning is great, but I think that needs to be a week. In a week you an have a decent wooden defence line and a good-ish sized army (depending on how happy you keep the peasants) to protect your stronghold after the timer goes out.\n\nOther than that, the user friendly-ness of the game is great, and I love the option that you get to keep the tutorial pages near by, in case you forget anything, then you an just turn it off when you're ready, and that's awesome. The graphics are alright, but since they're really simple, it doesn't lag your computer, which is a bonus if you run off wireless all the time like me.\nI also like having the different tabs at the top, keeping everything seperated out and neat really helps you get to grips with the game.\nSo overall, I like the game and won't stop playing it, but I wouldn't recommend it. I'm just stubborn and miss being able to play the old Stronghold games.(Saving the money up for the complete pack though)\n\n","September 15, 2014","false","16.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's a type of game that you leave on when you're browsing. I have played this game since early 2012 to late 2014. I really like the card system In Stronghold Kingdoms. The artwork is very nice, I really like it. Most of the content is reused from old Stronghold games but I still like it. The people I've met are very nice and friendly.\n\nHowever, It was very fun when I played the game at first, I played it every day, it was very addicting and I spent a lot of hours in this game before I downloaded the Steam version. I downloaded the steam version more than a year later. I started playing on World 4 when the server was still 30 days old. The game just gets boring after a some hundred days where everyone has a high rank and the world becomes dull. I tried to like it in my last few hundred days playing but it just didn't work. Then I stopped playing at about day 800. People say this game is pay to win, I kinda agree. Things like premium token will give you progress faster in the game.\n\nI have mixed feelings about this game. I like the Stronghold series. But I don't recommend this game. Because in long term playability, it kinda sucks. Stronghold Kingdoms might be enjoyable and fun at first, but in a year or several months, the World(server) will become dull. You'll need to play it every day or else you could lose all your progress, because if you have an enemy, they will try to wipe you out.","August 24, 2015","false","348.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Time, more than anything, will be your "make or break" factor here.  No, you don't have to be on 24/7.

The scouts take about half an hour (real time) to reach an item and return when it is not that far away from your kingdom or village.\n\nUntil about 10 minutes ago (from when I'm writing this), I was queueing things up like buildings and research items so I could leave the game to work for me. Now, I have to get premium coins to queue things.

There are many people that throw that phrase around, but this game is serious pay to win. Unashamed and unappoligetic.  If you can afford a constant stream of cards, like 200 dollars a month, you can stand up to any guild in the game and become almost invicible. Oh I logged off and you took a village of mine.  I just instantly took one of yours with a village that i had in protection and now i will instantly build the entire village and castle within seconds.  Worst case i lose everything and then drop in a bunch of charters and now I has free invulnerable time to take my time and build.   If you dont have those resources, your losses are catastrophic and final. Loosing a city for me is nothing, but  a few minutes while your loss was a month of painstacking grinding.\n\nI will say that this game is very addicting, but not in a good way.  You become beholden to sitting in front of your computer and watching icons constantly moving across the map and trying to deciper if some bad icon will be coming your way soon or if you can help someone thats about to get killed.  I dont mind this, but you almost dont want to sleep as people will learn your ofline play time and jump you when you log out.  Also, if your opponents have more real money than you, they will almost always win.  I have been in massive guilds with 100s of people attacking a base and still not being able to take the castle because he can completely rebuild it within seconds. Even if you time all your attacks there is usually a few seconds that might cause the last attack to fail.  It is fun to play for a while, but like i said you will develop a nervous desperation to constantly be logged in and not want to do anything else.  Its not enjoyable either as you are constantly on the defensive or having to manage things.  Huge time sink.\n\nDo not buy! Yes you can get cards by Trickling them in 1 a day and you can sell to buy better cards, but the shear amount of cards that your opponents will have and the amount of cards he can use within seconds makes the game completely unbalanced between the haves and the have nots.","April 20, 2014","false","870.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So much potential, wasted because it's completely P2W. The community was great. Everyone was very friendly and helpful and I enjoyed chatting with them all, but the tedious pace of the gameplay eventually wears you down. Eventually you actually start considering buying cards.....just about the time your sanity snaps back and you delete the game instead of wasting your hard earned cash.\n\nIf you like idle games, this may be fun for you. But you will never be able to keep up with people who pay for cards in this game, and the extremely slow pace will drive you nuts. Everything takes forever to happen in the game.  Cards are the only way to advance at more than a glacial pace, and they really are not worth it.","May 27, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's not fun. The most fun  I  had was the initial few hours of gameplay and now I play out of nothing more than habit. This is not a game. This is a thinly disuised money maker for the developer. That is okay in a sense so long as its fun but it stopped being a game along time ago. If you have a couple hundred dollars you are willing to burn there are better games to throw cash at.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/razinghel/recommended/47410/","razinghel","Dekay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/razinghel/","734 products in account","Stronghold Kingdoms is as much a game of politics as it is a game of Medieval warfare or simulation. The articulate politician will find himself advancing far more quicker than the warrior and it is not at all uncommon to find House Marshalls who have only razed a handful of players.\n\nFirst I'd like to address the two foremost complaints about Stronghold kingdoms; Pay to Win and Multi Accounters\n\nMulits - Players controlling 2 or more accounts per game world.\n\nThe problem here is twofold and blame falls equally on both the players and Firefly. All too often I see a user on the forums calling for heads to roll after he reports a player suspected of cheating and nothing happens. The paranoid player would do well to remember that suspicious does not equal guilty and that Firefly will not disclose the outcome of any investigation to the player who filed the report.\n\nIf it appears nothing has been done it's likely because the investigation turned up nothing illicit and remember the more information you include in your report the more likely the accusation is to be investigated.\n\nThe other half of blame sits squarely upon Firefly's shoulders in my opinion due to the sheer ambiguity of the game rules. Time and time again I've had players coming to me with multiple accounts firm in their insistence that they weren't breaking any rules because they "had premium tokens in play on both accounts".\n\nDespite what anyone might say to convince you otherwise the above allegation is flat out untrue. Regardless of premium tokens, players are only allotted one account per game world. All Firefly here has to do is update the game rules page to be less ambiguous in regards to the IP restrictions and premium players clause but they will not and this apathy towards one of the top complaints about Stronghold Kingdoms promotes the continued perpetuation of the myth that Firefly doesn't care and that they don't investigate informed allegations against suspected cheaters.\n\n\nPay To Win - The belief that to succeed at any level in Stronghold Kingdoms the player must spend liberal amounts of money to obtain their own virtual crown.\n\nPay to Win (or P2W) is a hotly debated topic in many 'Free to play' games and the same applies to Stronghold Kingdoms and there is no doubt that in this case it's a grey area for sure. But to answer whether or not the game is p2w one must first define what winning means to them and what winning means to Firefly.\n\nFor many players 'to win' is to beat another player in a one on one mano a mano fight. Providing both players are of the same skill level and neither receive any outside help there is no doubt that whichever of the two players spends more on the game will ultimately be the winner. There are just too many cards in the Stronghold Kingdoms deck that artificially boost combat stats such as army speed or the strength of castle structures and Firefly doesn't help the matter by continuing to introduce more powerful combat cards all the time.\n\nSure, the only players who use those aces are probably the top 0.5% but in worlds with dwindling playerbases those players hold the entire server at their collective whim.\n\nIn contrast, many experienced players realize that winning is actually more than a one on one fight and that loosing one battle doesn't mean the war is lost and that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of players participating on both sides of the conflict, carder and non carder alike. This means that while you are going up against a house with spending players your house will likely have spending players of it's own which levels the playing field.\n\nFirefly's definition is similar to the above, Houses compete against one another to gain glory, ultimately eliminating all others houses to be the last one standing. That final House is considered the winner of that age and inducted into the hall of fame while their members all share in on the spoils of the victory which mostly consists of a few quest wheel spins, card packs, and new charges for their coat of arms.\n\nThis means that to 'win' Stronghold Kingdoms all one has to actually do is be a member of whichever house is left standing when the dust settles.\n\nAs you can now see the definition of winning in stronghold Kingdoms is actually quite subjective and by paying attention to ongoing house politics virtually anyone can achieve victory regardless of their financial status.\n\n## Now that that's cleared up.... ##\n\nAlthough my Steam time doesn't show it, I have played Stronghold Kingdoms via the Standalone client for almost 3 years now and in that time I have been active in many roles. I'm currently on a sort of hiatus with Stronghold Crusader 2 gearing up for release.\n\nAnyways, here's what I liked:\n\n+ First and foremost is the community, a game that pretty much coerces you into logging in every day lends itself to the establishment of long distance relationships that can become something like a second family to you.\n\n+ 2D graphics invoke a nostalgic feeling in fans who have been with the Stronghold franchise from it's inception.\n\n+ Freedom to design my castle as I please, there is no generic 'castle' building that is placed with one click. You have to determine where each wall segment and Stone Tower will be built.\n\n+ Village building can be as simple or as intricate as you want, village buildings fit together much like a puzzle and those who take the time to optimize their village layout will enjoy increased production.\n\nWhat I felt could be improved on:\n\n- Battles aren't fought in real time, you play puzzle games by setting up your troops and letting the AI resolve it. The AI is quite predictable and stupid at times.\n\n- The ingame chat system is so unintuitive it actually drives players away from the game.\n\n- The entire card system requires too much micromanagement. For a game that requires more and more of your time as you grow having to juggle cards daily to stay competitive gets pretty old pretty quick.\n\n- The formula used to generate AI castles needs to take the number of players in that parish into account, not only the rank of the players. It's a real kick in the head to get the strongest wolf castle in your parish every week when the only 3 villages there are yours.\n\nWhat I'd like to see added in the future:\n\n> Castles and villages merged into one design, this would mean that defensively strong players would have weaker economies and the inverse for economically strong players. This would encourage greater diversity in playstyle.\n\n> Actual RTS battles that allow direct player control of the attacking armies and the defending garrison if the player so wished.\n\n> More units, especially siege units. Even the original Stronghold had twice as many units as there are currently in Stronghold Kingdoms.\n\nIn short, yes, I strongly recommend this game. It's probably the best free to play RTS on Steam at this moment, and while the graphics hail from a previous decade they still retain the charm of the original Stronghold.\n\n- IGN DavidSpy","September 14, 2014","true","170.4"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","18","33","0","7"

You rank up by gaining "Honor" which is in essence "Experience" in MMORPGs. Honor can be collected in noumerous ways: Be it warefare, economy or pollitics.\n- The core of the game is building and developing yours villages castles, of course as being built villages can also be conquered.\n\nEconomy:\n-Resources are gathered from natural deposits and are used to build buildings or craft weapons (wood, stone, pitch and iron).\n-Food is used to feed your population (apples, cheese, meat, bread, vegetables, fish and ale)\n-Goods are used to hold banquets increasing your honor (meat, clothes, metalwork, furniture, wine, spices, silk and salt)\n-Weapons are used to arm your people (Bows, Pikes, Swords, Catapults)\n- Every resource can be created, traded or foraged.\n- Everything is wraped under a large research tree.\n\nWarefare:\n- Scouts are used to gather reports about enemy castles.\n- Armies are used to both defend your villages and attack your enemies villages.\n\nPolitics:\n- There is a beautiful fuedal system in place, lower ranks answer to their lieges in the following system: Village < Perish < County < Province < Country. The higher position you hold the more glory you bring to your house. Political positions are acquired through voting but of course can be pressured using warefare or religeon influence.\n- Lords fight under a banner of a faction (equivalent to guild in MMORPGs), and factions fight under a banner of a house.\n- At end game houses struggle over the map domination.\n\nCosts:\n- How much does this cost?\nSadly a freemium bussiness model is in place which means that you can invest as much as you want.\nIn my opinion in order to stay competitive an investment of a few euros per month will be necessary.\n- Will a player that invests more money that you have certain advantages? Yes, he will develop and progress faster. Is this a deal breaker? Absolutly not, some people play longer and some people pay longer... Up to each one.\n\nN.B:\n- Some people are unhappy about being razed, conquered and loosing all their hard worked on villages. I would like to say a few words about that:\nIt is true that "Stronghold Kingdoms" is not for the weak hearted... Yes you may loose all your villages in a war but you will get a new village and will still keep your fuedal rank, your research, your gold, faith and honor. So rebuilding is not a big deal and it is faster every time, like in real life... Sometimes we fall, but the whole point is to raise up again, this time even stronger.\n\nTo summerize:\nA brilliant massive online strategy game that allows one to play as he wants. You may concentrate on warefare, farming, pollitics, religeon or whatever suits your intrests best.\n\nLook me up on Europa 3 ;)","March 2","true","339.6"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","0"

Without spending real cash you cannot be competitive. Look at my hours played. Not all of them were actively playing the game but being logged in because if people KNOW you are offline, you'll be attacked if you are a powerful player. I was a powerful player at one point and a "wallet warrior" as I spent a lot more money on this game than I should have (I cringe now when I look at the spreadsheet I made to track my purchases of in-game currency).\n\nTo be a powerhouse, you are forced to spend lots of money (as in hundreds if not thousands of dollars) to buy premium tokens and card packs (which usually contain garbage). You can earn cards without cash, but it's not easy or a productive use of time. The price of "booster packs" are insane, especially their Ultimate Packs (which cost almost 5 bucks a pop!). I've opened them and gotten nothing but common cards which is a complete rip-off.\n\nThere are a lot of people who cheat at this game by account-sharing, using 3rd party programs, etc. You cannot win against these people. You can't catch them unawares and they just keep coming back like herpes to attack you when you are offline and are unable to effectively defend yourself. Reporting them does nothing. If they spend money in the game, the developer will let them get away with almost anything.\n\nAlso, servers quickly become stagnant once one group of whales and their tag-alongs achieve world domination. Once this happens, most people just leave the server and go to a new one, which is why they keep opening new servers all the time. This stagnation is probably deliberate as the very start of a server is when the developer makes all their money due to the whales blowing cash to try to race to the top first.\n\nAvoid this game like the plague unless you want no life and like spending your way to the top.","March 24","false","835.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It downloaded fast and was able to play in seconds. It was fun, exciting and good to play while doing something else. The beginning was rough, it seemed like impossible to get to an acceptable rank. Luckily I was invited to join a group of other nearby lords who later in the game invited me to the House. When I was first invited the game went smoothly because of all the support my allies gave me. Soon after I was a target for an enemy House. Of course this House member payed to get insane amount of cards, tokens and etc., and then I got destroied. I didn't pay into this game, but now I see I should. There is such a huge advantage against people who pay-to-win. I seriously don't agree with ZAM, stating "it is not a pay-to-win". It is.\n\nAgain I tried playing again later down the year and of course the same thing happened on a different server. I thought this was ridiculous and a joke.

To keep it short, SHK is a game somewhat like trivian or tribal-wars which are real-time based (Build your kingdom type)strategy games. Of cause SHK is much more complex and beautifully complicated than any other MMO out there. Just know that these kind of games will suck in all of your time and all the beautifully built villages that you have put so much time and effort can easily be taken away over night. Yes that's right, over night! But that is not so much of a bad thing because thats what makes the game very interesting and complex. Yes you can lose your villages but the honor, gold, faith points and rank will remain the same even if you lose all your villages. Keep in mind these such points are the important part of the game, not villages, so that is a good thing that you dont lose your progress.\n\nGameplay / Graphics As for the gameplay, this is a straight forward build your kingdom and expend it at all costs. It can be time consuming, very very much so. I had played this for over 3 years on and off and I can never get on top of the leaderboards yet. Also, there are groups(factions and houses) where you join and fight for that particullar group. These houses either ally themselves with one another or declare war on each other because the main goal of the game is to win the glory race. The gloary race can be won if a house can eliminate all other houses thus the last house is ultimately the winner of the race. You get big rewards if you win the race that can be used to give some perks on the world you are playing and on every other worlds.\n\nGraphics on this game is taken almost 100% taken out of the original "Stronghold Crusader" game that came out over a decade ago but thats not a bad thing either since that was one of the best games ever created, ever. They did improve on the quality of the game though so its really well done. This is a stretegy game not a 4K graphic driven game so graphics doesn't really matter.\n\nP2W(Pay 2 Win? Well, many of the reviews here are stating that it is a P2W game and I won't try to argue it because to an extent you can progress much faster with the cards in the game but it will only get you so far as to how much you are willing to spend on a free game and hornestly you really don't get much advantage over other. It is totally possible to get to the top without spending a single dime on this game. Just need a lot of hard work.\n--- I would say this is 10% P2W and 90% hardwork.\n\nFinal Verdict: Yeah I would totally recommend trying to game out especailly if you are a big RTS-MMO fan and even if you are not its just fun to grow your village and take over other people and fight for glory. Just try to out, don't let these stupid one sentence "BAD!" "P2W" BS of a review get in your way of a great game.\n\nMy score of this game is 7.5 or 8 out of 10.","February 6","true","693.8"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","19","36","5","0"

They suck\n2. They seem to all be based of the "Farmvile Forumla"\n\nDo not get me wrong, there are plenty of Free to Play games that do not do that, like Tribes Ascend, Star Trek Online after the F2P conversion, and a few others that operate on the concept of "Pay because you're having fun and want to support it." not "Pay because you have to." Those games are fine. Hell, I enjoy playing STO still, even after the F2P change.\n\nStronghold Kingdoms, on the other hand..is a medival reincarnation of Farmvile, but even more hands off! I came into the game expecting a cut-down version of Stronghold, but what I got out of it was pretty much like the fabled "Age of Empires Online".\n\nWhen you're put into the game, you're given a basic tutorial, and some things to help. Sadly, it's not much (unless you preordered Crusader 2, or bought the starter pack for some reason), and even if you manage to make do, it's only a matter of time before you run into some barrier, like lack of resources or even not having enough gold. When that happens, you either have to bug your friends, making them hate your guts forevermore, or get your credit card and pay up, which, again, seem very much like the Facebook games we're all spammed with.\n\nSo then, would I reccomend this game?

The staff that support this game are crooks all the way up to the producers.

People seem to support and follow these people yet a lot of these people are not even good at the game or are very nice people or even have any kind of good leadership qualities.  Yet people follow them and they run the show like a cult. And if you are not in it forget ever winning. After years of play you really end up with a bad experiance in the end.

If you want rule because you earned it... Good luck. I find this a failed attempt, I play this game quite a bit, but that's only because Mobile is on the way. I feel if firefly gave this another try with natural geological formations instead of a flat boring same as everyone else's land, and if they didn't use these gimmicky cards, I believe this game would do way better, just slap a 15.00$ tag. Trust me, you'd make way more money off of sales in units compared to 3.00$ card sets... All in all, it sounds food on paper, executed poorly.\n\nBut, it is free, and the game actually does have a cool diplomacy system, and castle building is a waiting game but it's really pleasing watching your castle develop.\n\nThere is a wait time in building though, something used in cash cow money grubbing Clash of Clans mobile games, that's probably what killed this, it doesn't work because Firefly has a relatively small fanbase, being a "AA" company as said by the head of the marketing department , Nick.\n\n[{6/10}]\nI hope Firefly makes another Castle MMO and doesn't make it so harsh on new players, and Firefly, whatever you do, DO NOT make the next one a free to play, and completely scrap the use of cards, this isn't yu-gi-oh.

The in game system for buying cards means that while it might not be a complete trade off for time put in the huge advantage of paying makes it a bad game to play. Cards can be used for army units, resources (including ones that help you level up and gain access to more technology and such), faster movement and more. Add on to that the fact if you get special tokens (using real money) you get building queues, tech queues and auto scouting / attacks.\nOverall it isn't a bad game but the pay to win aspect does make it bad if you are not willing to invest loads for every advantage. Generally one of those games about long term however long term for me doesn't include having to constantly pay to be on par with other players.\nGenerally speaking knowledge and such will only go so far when everything is lacking compared to a heavily paying user.\n\nEDIT:\nAlmost 2 years later tried to access game only to find out my account is locked out and I had to contact customer support. It seems customer support is "investigating" issues with payments in the past so either they can't do anything in almost 2 years or they are just banning me for paying them and having issue with the service.

At first it seems like a cool game and fun.  But after you get into it you cannot really do anything worth while unless you have no life and can play 24/7 and if you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars if not thousands on buying cards.  The staff that support this game are crooks all the way up to the producers.  They will do things with your account and say too bad so sad we messed you up it is our fault but too bad you can suffer no matter how much they messed you up or how much money you spent or time on the game.\n\nTo even be in the top houses which seem to be all be run by the most arrogant ignorant gang like thugs.  People seem to support and follow these people yet a lot of these people are not even good at the game or are very nice people or even have any kind of good leadership qualities.  Yet people follow them and they run the show like a cult. And if you are not in it forget ever winning. After years of play you really end up with a bad experiance in the end.  Takes a year just to finish the first glory round even if you do make it and the map is dominated.  Maps usualy become totaly dominated by one group of people and thats it.  Do not expect fair play from players or the staff.\n\nDo Not Buy this game and waste your time and money.

Don't listen too much to the "it's pay to win!" crowd, yes the cards are a HUGE help but you can accumilate a few even without paying, teamwork and cunning beats money without.\n\nThe game is almost entirely PVP based with factions vying to be part of a great house (or stay sometimes to stay independant) and the great houses competing for over counties and crowns for points to win the round.\nYou can stay independant and if you play the diplomacy and politics metagame you can even get a bit of power for yourself, however it means you probably wont have much backup if someone decides they want your land.  It's not too bad however since higher ranked players will have to pay a higher cost to do any real damage to you.\n\nThe pvp in this game reminds me of EVE more than anything else, so if you that sort of high stakes blend of pvp and politics then this game is for you.\n\n\nShout out to the old Gladiatōrēs faction from H16 World-6","January 30, 2015","true","63.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Firefly is the worst gaming company on the planet.  They refuse to enforce their own policy for account abuse, this game is overrun by players that use multiple accounts and as long and they are willing to spend money on premium tokens Firefly turns a blind eye.  Their servers are controlled by user groups that deploy alt accounts all over the map which makes it impossible to defend and control a territory unless you are willing to waste a lot of time and money as well.  This is not a good MMO because of the level of cheating allowed by Firefly because they see it as a revenue generator to allow cheating.  Find another game to spend your money on please; you will be much happier you did.  I can’t put it anymore simply, this is a terrible game, don’t waste your money on it and don’t allow yourself to get pulled in, the Firefly admins play favorites to those that spend the most money and are willing to ban players that have any skills that threaten the status quo.

They are only motivated in creating more and more opportunity to fill their pocket by tempting players with agressive promotions.\n\nEven if it requires to create new servers with different gameplay and close others that they find no worthy enough to keep alive knowing that people haver invested themselves a lot and still play on it. We've come to a point where they have lost control of the essential basis of that game which is teamwork.\n\nBy throwing at their members continuously new ways to start all over on a better server the team spirit is slowly fading out while people who have gone so far together just quit completely bored by way Firefly Studio threat their members. I'm one of them and I wish that this company can assume a bad comment about their game and that they wont delete it the second I post it.\n\nOthers leave the game only because the game at all mostly bases on PvP as become more annoying than fun.

It's till stronghold for the most part but it's completely online. Sounds like cool fun right? How about no. This is strictly one of those broswer based Facebook style games in every sense of the word and has no business on steam. It's "P2W" and timer based like every other free-to-play RTS out there.\n\nNothing ruins a game more than getting neck deep into it just to find out you HAVE to quit for 6 hours because there's nothing left to do. Seriously, it's going to take that long for some of your buildings to complete construction. If you like these kinds of games and find the majority of your free time syphoned by similar games on Facebook, go for it. If you're a serious Stronghold fan however, avoid this monstrosity at all costs.","November 25, 2014","false","2.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The best aspects of the game are the politcs: joining a guild, interacting with your allies and using your combined numbers to accomplish something.  Whether it be getting a certain person elected head of a county or conquering all the villages belonging to a certain House in a region its the politics where the game is interesting.\n\nBut the actual game mechanics themselves are boring; often extremely boring.  Most of the time I spent playing I was actually surfing the internet and only occasionally checking in on what was happening.  Things can move very slowly.  Wars can be frustrating as well since the game lets you spend money to protect your castles from attack.  You'll often find yourself logging on after work or school to find half your villages have been conquered and they are immune to attack for several days so you have no way of getting them back.  And these are villages you've spent months building up only to have it all thrown away when you weren't even playing.","October 9, 2015","false","153.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You only have to look at the number of hours I have played this game to see I enjoy it (I have probably played just as many hours in the stand alone client as on steam!)\n\nHowever it is also evidence of the downside to this game, it has a tendency to take a hold of players that get very involved in the game. It can be hard to leave the game alone and you will find yourself thinking about the game when you perhaps should be focused on something more productive. This is only exacerbated by the persistent nature of the game and, for the most part, the awesome community that support this game.\n\nThere is also a pay to win aspect to this game, as you might have noticed by the other reviews.  Some benefits are only available to those who invest not only time but money into the game., But you have to remember the game has to be supported and without money the developers can’t do this. Hiding features behind a paywall though is never popular and it is something I can not defend. Automated trading and having a requirement to put money into the game in order to unlock more than a measly number of free in game stratagy cards are two of such features I would point out.\n\nHowever as long as you know this going into the game you shouldn’t be disappointed. It may take you longer to achieve your goals in Stronghold Kingdoms if you play it entirely Free To Play, you may also have a hard time going up against people who play it Pay To Win (and know what they’re doing) but there’s no reason why you still can’t have a lot of fun playing this game and meat a lot of cool and interesting people along the way.","December 26, 2015","true","901.7"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","2"

The other people in this game are so helpful and kind if you ever find yourself stuck all you need to do is message one and odds are they will do their best to help in anyway\n\n3. although it takes time to get past the slight learning curve this game is extremely rewarding! from collecting resources to managing scouting missions to building a castle like no other it has great return value making you keep coming back just for one more hour.\n\nOver all i would reccomend this game to both new and veteran people to this genre of game","July 20, 2015","true","11.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

The only time you will get randomly attacked is either by a bandit, and the other people around you will help take them down, and usually they never attack you before they are taken out. 2nd reason is you are in war with them, and that makes perfect sense. So why does it matter if other people are buying everything, if it does not affect you? Be glad you have patience, to wait for everything and a wallet. Game can take quite a while to get into/back into but once you get your army up and get into wars it can be quite fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daschaund333/recommended/47410/","daschaund333","[GORON] SCOOT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daschaund333/","37 products in account","Stronghold kingdoms is a difficult game to explain at the outset, so I'll just go over the basics without going past a few paragraphs. It's a good game, though it requires a lot of patience, for reasons you can read below if you want. In sum, it's for a patient, deliberate type of gamer, and is certainly a rewarding experience. Onto the real meat:\n\nYou'll see pretty much every negative review on this game say it's "pay to win", which shows that they took one look at the game, saw that they had to pay, and then quit. It's essentially a subscription-based model, where you pay for premium either by the week or the month, which makes progressing through the game much faster than if you were a free player. It rounds out to about $8 a month, plus some spare change left over to buy card packs. At the cost of a Netflix subscription (or a large case of soda), it's worth the money to spend just for the benefits that you get as a premium member. The only way for money to become a serious problem is if you're spending thousands of dollars on the game to progress at ludicrously fast speeds, at which point the player is a bigger problem that the game can handle.\n\nSo now onto the review. The game is a medieval, strategy-based, simulation MMO where you build a kingdom, interact with other kingdoms, and do your best to balance the two without going overboard. It doesn't sum up the tense and thoughtful experience that you get with the game, nor will most of the promotional materials. It's a game about tactics, waiting, thinking, and looking into the future to see what you best actions will be a day or two from now. It's an accurate simulation of the politics and world-building of the middle ages all bottled up into a deliberately paced experience, one that's definitely worth trying out just to feel the experience.\n\nNaturally, time is an important factor in this game. To get anything done, you need to produce raw materials with your buildings. This includes resources, weapons, and gold - all of which you have to wait a while to get in large amounts. By "a while", it's more like hours until you have the opportunity to expand on a larger scale - waiting for your village to populate, your buildings to produce, and your merchants to trade with others. Much like an idle game, it's best to wait a long time between play sessions to get the most out of your game. Otherwise you'll be checking it all the time, obsessed over when you have the opportunity to start developing. Unlike an idle game, it's not just a matter of upgrading the most expensive thing you can afford and waiting for another day. Indeed, you spend a long time looking over all the options you have at your disposal until you realise you don't have anything left to do at the time.\n\nThere is a level of depth and strategy in this game that is completely unique from most games that I've played. The game is simply about optimisation - you have to optimise your buildings, your research, your village placement, your military, and the production of materials to create all these. You also have to optimise the timeframe of when you create these events. This means you have to decide what to create, when to create it, how it will affect your village, your military, and your production, and you have to know if it'll create any difference in the short term to realise your long-term plans. It is a deep experience to go into, with the possibilities rolling in your mind the entire time you're looking at your village statistics. It's like upgrading your character in an RPG, feeling the same amount of pride you do in yourself as you do with your kingdom.\n\nAlso, you don't need to worry too much about the community. Pretty much all of the players are friendly, looking out for their best interests instead of trying to ruin your day. Most battles are petty, with a small-time raider taking the resources of another village far away - even then only if they're an incredibly weak and defenseless target. If you're at the point where you can let anybody walk in and take your resources, then you let that happen to yourself. The only way for a decent player to have all their villages destroyed is to ♥♥♥♥ off a large vassal without making any diplomacy, which is how all my villages were destroyed two years ago.\n\nIn essence, it's a good game, whether or not you can pay the subscription fee. It gets much better and much faster if you can pay for it, and it is an investment I recommend. It isn't at all a distilled experience like you get with almost every other kingdom-building game on the market, and is a worthy video game in it's own right. It's a unique and engrossing game for sure, and it's one you can download in a few minutes and try out. You do get a two-day subscription to see if you like it, which is a nice feature, if a bit like bait. I really do like this game, even if all my playtime is off the Steam client.\n\nP.S. if you're curious, my handle is "Enthers". Please don't raid my apple farms.","June 28, 2015","true","273.1"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","17","35","4","2"

I then noticed 3 icons moving towards my villages, and four over to my friends. He destroyed everything. We tried to send our troops to attack his villages in a pathetic attempt attempt to save ourselves. Or at least take a bit of him with us. Our troops were slaughtered in a tower grid of a village.

I feel that it is a rip off of stronghold (The Original) just with the delayed wait times of a facebook game. There is no real strategy to it and is like every other war/simulation/town building game. After finding a game that me and my friends could all play due to our varying computer specs and social lives, to find out that this is just a horrible, horrific waste of space is just, Disgusting. I have had The original stronghold right up until Stronghold 3. If you want my advice, avoid this game because you will sink many hours of gameplay in it for little or no reward. Buy Stronghold 1 if you like the concept and the rather "Low" Graphical credentials, Otherwise stick to Number 2, The best stronghold game i have ever played and i have owned that game for around 7 years.\nHow could a game like this get on steam? it is beyond me.","December 11, 2013","false","0.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

But i havent even spent the crowns i bought, just a few(i still have 1k crowns sitting around), not even all of the ones i got for free from amazon, and I was one of the strongest players in world 4 two years ago.\n\nSo I dont think it´s pay to win, you need premium tokens ofc, but not all the time and you get many from quests and if amazon is still giving crowns you can get like a year of premium with those, unless you want to be the king, I assume then you would need to spend some cash, but I managed to run 8 parishes at once and became the governor of the province, started a faction, which i named 'The Night's whatch', and it got really strong, the house i belonged ruled over 2 of the 4 countries, I had like 50 vassals, all of that without spending crowns or barely spending. it´s a lot to handle.\n\nObs. i noticed now people have way more villages than it was possible when i played, so the numbers above may seem insignificant, but 2 years ago you could hardly get any more powerful than that.\n\nIn short, great game, but be careful, cocaine may seem great at first too","February 5","true","630.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Thier are also wolf lairs, bandit camps which you attack for quests or just honor. the game is based on an honor system u advace by gaining honor. THe game icorperates a research system you can do very little without researching to do it first from building diferent buildings to troop types and even religion. There is an extensive religious system where you use monks to do things like heal deseases and protect ur villages and things of that nature. The maps r devided into parishes, counties, statesand countries. these parishes require a person (called a steward) this person takes charge and builds builds in the parish that help the others who live in the parish this can range from use troops there to take out the AIs to building guilds which when upgraded give benifits to all citizens within that parish. You can join with other players in your area to form factions and house these factions and house go through what is known as a glory race in which they r trying to be the only one left at the end of the race winning house of this race at the end of an age get fabulous in game prizes. There are four ages each with it's own unique set of rules. There are also cards that allow u to do things in the game like make your troops faster, make free troops,  help production of goods, all kinds of diferent things. As I hope u can see from just vthis breif discription of the game that it has alot to offer you many hours of great enjoyable play time. I would very highly recomened this game to all stratagy city building game lovers even if you have never played a game like this I would encourage anyone who likes online gaming to give it  a try.\n\nSpitfireSam","September 8, 2014","true","260.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You'll start out with "Oh 15 sec to build a house, not bad" to "WTF 1 day 19 hours to build a house!" Which will keep increasing in the amount of time to build anything the more you build.\n\n2. The game is completely Pay to Win! You can buy cards that give you Troops,Builds,Special Perks. (So basically someone could drop $100 on the game and completed distory your well built villages and castles that will take you months to get fully built up.)\n\n3. The Castle building options suck and the area they give you to build is extremely limited. (So is the villiage building)\n\n4. When you attack someone you can lose (Honor) which you use to level up so that game punishes you for attacking players.\n\n5. When you join the game you'll be tax to death by parish leaders building armys which will make your life a living nightmare epically with AI Castles blowing up your ♥♥♥♥ that took days to fix up cause your low level.\n\nOk,\n\nThink of this do you want to play a game where it takes months upon months to get anything real and when you reach that awesome point where you can finally do something have someone walk in with there house and stomp all your hard work in the dirt? If so welcome to stronghold kingdoms... a truely boring experience.","May 27, 2014","false","8.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","5"

It was terrible ♥♥♥♥ing addiction that I'm glad I got over. I got the starter pack free with Stronghold HD and this rubbish has been stuck in my library ever since.\n\nThe fact that they recycled a lot of the assets(graphics, music, sounds, etc.) in this game from the first Stronghold means I can never enjoy that amazing game again without being reminded of this.\n\nThe gameplay is the typical "strategy" pay 2 win, wait-fest ♥♥♥♥ you'd expect from a browser F2P. The combat is composed of you throwing hundreds of units against your enemy's walls, with the only real control you have over your units being over their spawn location. And then you have to wait for them to casually stroll across the landscape/Irish Sea(the latter of takes literal days without paying for speed boosts) before the attack you planned finally comes to fruition. Even then, you have to send multiple simultaneous attacks in order to actually capture or completely destroy a village, because they can repair all the damage you dealt and protect their village from being attacked in the time it takes for you to send your next attack.\n\nLater on the wait times for villages can take entire weeks if you don't pay. Literal real time weeks. And castles(the defense portion of your village) will take an entire month to be fully built. I can not stress this enough: the one line of defence preventing other players from freely raiding and burning down your village whenever they feel like it takes an entire month to be built. And this is a game where you can lose all of that in the blink of an eye due to multiple attacks hitting your castle within the span of a few seconds.\n\nThis is a game that requires you to be awake and playing the game for as much time as you possibly can. If you aren't online 24/7, then you are at serious risk of losing villages to attacks during the night.\n\nThe "community" in this game is the worst. I'd imagine the only reason it hasn't accumulated as much infamy as most MOBAs or other notably toxic games is because it isn't nearly as popular as those games (thank god). The game technically has 'rules,' but everyone ignores them because the mods rarely do anything about the cheaters. People in my old faction(don't know or care what those are actually called) even bragged about having dozens of alt accounts! You know a game is screwed up when people are bragging about cheating.\n\nEven the mods are cheating! Some of them even abuse their mod status on top of the cheating. I've seen screenshots of conversations between mods and other players where the mods try and bait the other players into insulting them or raging, just so they have an excuse for a ban.\n\nThe meta-game revolves around helping your house take huge tracts of land and keeping hold of them for a long-♥♥♥ time. Your house earns points for this and the first house to recieve the goal number of points wins a prize. And after months of work, if your house wins, each member gets a bunch of comparatively meager prizes. The winning house also gets a post in the news section on the the world select screen declaring their victory which will get buried shortly afterwards by other houses' victories on other worlds.\n\nI am not sure why I found that ♥♥♥♥ even remotely fun.","May 16, 2015","false","011.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I am approaching the 5,000 hours, so I have been around. And this is a game to pay to win, some people say? Not true. It's possible to buy cards that give advantages. But spending many hours online does get you free cards as well as a bonus. And when fighting a player, using cards does not give an overwhelming advantage. Attacking skills do, and building strong castles helps too.\n\nLastly, some commentator says starting players are being attacked for they are very weak. Yes, starting players are weak, but for an experienced player to attack a starting player, there is a severe penalty for the experienced player. So starting players are not going to be attacked by the stronger players.\n\nSo does paying help? A bit. But it can be countered by staying online a lot like I do. In fact to be online a lot has a greater effect than to pay your way. Paying players will receive some small advantages, but not enough to change the odds when they are stacked against them. Please, if you want to give your opinion, stay with the game long enough to give a good advice.\n\n","November 16, 2015","true","696.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

I am approaching the 5,000 hours, so I have been around. And this is a game to pay to win, some people say? Not true. It's possible to buy cards that give advantages. But spending many hours online does get you free cards as well as a bonus. And when fighting a player, using cards does not give an overwhelming advantage. Attacking skills do, and building strong castles helps too.\n\nLastly, some commentator says starting players are being attacked for they are very weak. Yes, starting players are weak, but for an experienced player to attack a starting player, there is a severe penalty for the experienced player. So starting players are not going to be attacked by the stronger players.\n\nSo does paying help? A bit. But it can be countered by staying online a lot like I do. In fact to be online a lot has a greater effect than to pay your way. Paying players will receive some small advantages, but not enough to change the odds when they are stacked against them. Please, if you want to give your opinion, stay with the game long enough to give a good advice.\n\n","November 16, 2015","true","696.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stopreadingmeitscreepy/recommended/47410/","stopreadingmeitscreepy","Captain Breakfast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stopreadingmeitscreepy/","195 products in account","I'm not proud of the fact that I ended up giving up over two thousand hours of my life to this piece of crap. It was terrible ♥♥♥♥ing addiction that I'm glad I got over. I got the starter pack free with Stronghold HD and this rubbish has been stuck in my library ever since.\n\nThe fact that they recycled a lot of the assets(graphics, music, sounds, etc.) in this game from the first Stronghold means I can never enjoy that amazing game again without being reminded of this.\n\nThe gameplay is the typical "strategy" pay 2 win, wait-fest ♥♥♥♥ you'd expect from a browser F2P. The combat is composed of you throwing hundreds of units against your enemy's walls, with the only real control you have over your units being over their spawn location. And then you have to wait for them to casually stroll across the landscape/Irish Sea(the latter of takes literal days without paying for speed boosts) before the attack you planned finally comes to fruition. Even then, you have to send multiple simultaneous attacks in order to actually capture or completely destroy a village, because they can repair all the damage you dealt and protect their village from being attacked in the time it takes for you to send your next attack.\n\nLater on the wait times for villages can take entire weeks if you don't pay. Literal real time weeks. And castles(the defense portion of your village) will take an entire month to be fully built. I can not stress this enough: the one line of defence preventing other players from freely raiding and burning down your village whenever they feel like it takes an entire month to be built. And this is a game where you can lose all of that in the blink of an eye due to multiple attacks hitting your castle within the span of a few seconds.\n\nThis is a game that requires you to be awake and playing the game for as much time as you possibly can. If you aren't online 24/7, then you are at serious risk of losing villages to attacks during the night.\n\nThe "community" in this game is the worst. I'd imagine the only reason it hasn't accumulated as much infamy as most MOBAs or other notably toxic games is because it isn't nearly as popular as those games (thank god). The game technically has 'rules,' but everyone ignores them because the mods rarely do anything about the cheaters. People in my old faction(don't know or care what those are actually called) even bragged about having dozens of alt accounts! You know a game is screwed up when people are bragging about cheating.\n\nEven the mods are cheating! Some of them even abuse their mod status on top of the cheating. I've seen screenshots of conversations between mods and other players where the mods try and bait the other players into insulting them or raging, just so they have an excuse for a ban.\n\nThe meta-game revolves around helping your house take huge tracts of land and keeping hold of them for a long-♥♥♥ time. Your house earns points for this and the first house to recieve the goal number of points wins a prize. And after months of work, if your house wins, each member gets a bunch of comparatively meager prizes. The winning house also gets a post in the news section on the the world select screen declaring their victory which will get buried shortly afterwards by other houses' victories on other worlds.\n\nI am not sure why I found that ♥♥♥♥ even remotely fun.","May 16, 2015","false","011.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Premium features make no sense.\nI should not have to buy premium for a month just to get standered features. Want a building and research que? To bad you've got to pay for it. These times also continue to increase as the game goes on but its really inconvienent for most to log in every 17 mins, then 30 just to que something.\n\n2. The developers don't know what they're doing or are just lazy.\nI've seen smaller teams do more work in less time than this entire game existed. Most of the resources go into making new worlds and not improving the ones we're already playing in. This basically means little new features for the game and just more rpetty maps. It's as if they're scared or something.\nI don't think they know this, but if you actually update the game play to not be the same since release it might be benificial. Actually improving on graphics and other aspects of the game. Heck, maybe even a new research branch one day but nope. Apparently we will just sit here with no actual updates to the game.\n\n3. New maps/worlds are fun but yet kill the game\nBasically a new type of map gets released most people go play it. When 3 months pass (I beleive) a new world gets released ussually of the same map. This ussually causes a severe population drop in the new world compared to the other. Example would be the Global conflict world 1 and 2. 2 had like what 20+k at launch and still does. Number 2 has around 5k and a few of them are actually playing.\nImprove on the worlds and make us actually want to stay through the ages, don't keep releasing new world. It be more beneficial if you have a few worlds but encourages newer players. That way the world stays alive and gets a constant flow of new players.\nMore points to those who do not play the game will unsderstand\n\n4. Horrible administration and moderation\nMods don't have the power to ban people from the game, they barely have the power to mure players. Heck they don't even have a proper report system to report cheaters. There are many cheaters in these worlds. A great example would be Global conquest 2 world. The lands of "Republic of congo" are filled with alt accounts. These accounts give players an advantage over others. Since day 1 there had been OVER 20 ALT ACCOUNTS. They're literally named village and player 6003, 6004, 6005 and so on. Heck it's even reported on the main forums and they still exist. All are the lowest rank so they probably were used to keep others out and to spawn parishes.\n"Hmm I wonder who did it, couldn't possibly be the only 2 players there that are higher than a village idiot, nooo."\n\n5. Lazy updates\nRead above reasons\n\nThat being said its not the worse game ever\nIt provides political struggle and competition, unless you don't speak the laungage of some one, then its ussually war.","April 20","false","631.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It was developed by Firefly Studios and based upon their commercially successful and popular Stronghold series of games. Firefly Studios started development of Stronghold Kingdoms in 2007 as their first entry into the MMO[1] genre. The first Alpha test began in 2009 and was open only to 150 players.[2] These were drawn from previous testers of Firefly Studios games, and volunteers of other prominent fansites. Afterwards, an open Beta was run for just under 2 years before the games official release on the 17th of October 2012.\n\nIn addition to the central theme of castle construction and design, Stronghold Kingdoms incorporates a variety of architectural, economic, military, agricultural, mercantile, industrial and political elements which challenge players ability to prioritize, direct work-flow and resources and administrate their holdings in the manner of a medieval land holder or noble. An individual player's success is not entirely predicated upon the ability to defeat computer-generated enemies, but also upon teamwork with fellow players.\n\nThe player begins relatively alone, one village amongst others in a single parish. From this beginning, strategic decisions are made and dialogue established with fellow parish members which introduces the social aspect of Stronghold Kingdoms. All players can vie for stewardship of the parish, dependent on rank. When two or more players wish to be Steward they can negotiate to decide who will take control of the parish, or take it by force, razing out the opposing players village from that parish. If Theology is researched, then monks can be deployed to infiltrate the parish and influence the vote. This is usually referred to as a monk war in the game vernacular. When the successful candidate becomes steward they gain control of the parish army along with the ability to set taxes (tithe), and build the necessary guilds to improve life for all in the parish.","December 1, 2012","true","166.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Many people say that it is pay to win, which I will have to disagree with. Although you have the option to purchase "Cards" which have numerous effects, the effects are extremely small (such as add 10-300 troops, which isn't alot considering you can have 40 villages in the game, equaling 20000 troops, so is 300 troops really worth it?). The stronger cards are somewhat good, but those are so rare that it is not very efficient. So this in my opinion is not a pay to win game, whoever said that, I am sorry, must be rather noob like to even come up with that excuse. Anyway, this is a great game and you can win even if you don't pay, you just have to play this game right.","September 22, 2014","true","76.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Many people say that it is pay to win, which I will have to disagree with. Although you have the option to purchase "Cards" which have numerous effects, the effects are extremely small (such as add 10-300 troops, which isn't alot considering you can have 40 villages in the game, equaling 20000 troops, so is 300 troops really worth it?). The stronger cards are somewhat good, but those are so rare that it is not very efficient. So this in my opinion is not a pay to win game, whoever said that, I am sorry, must be rather noob like to even come up with that excuse. Anyway, this is a great game and you can win even if you don't pay, you just have to play this game right.","September 22, 2014","true","76.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It was developed by Firefly Studios and based upon their commercially successful and popular Stronghold series of games. Firefly Studios started development of Stronghold Kingdoms in 2007 as their first entry into the MMO[1] genre. The first Alpha test began in 2009 and was open only to 150 players.[2] These were drawn from previous testers of Firefly Studios games, and volunteers of other prominent fansites. Afterwards, an open Beta was run for just under 2 years before the games official release on the 17th of October 2012.\n\nIn addition to the central theme of castle construction and design, Stronghold Kingdoms incorporates a variety of architectural, economic, military, agricultural, mercantile, industrial and political elements which challenge players ability to prioritize, direct work-flow and resources and administrate their holdings in the manner of a medieval land holder or noble. An individual player's success is not entirely predicated upon the ability to defeat computer-generated enemies, but also upon teamwork with fellow players.\n\nThe player begins relatively alone, one village amongst others in a single parish. From this beginning, strategic decisions are made and dialogue established with fellow parish members which introduces the social aspect of Stronghold Kingdoms. All players can vie for stewardship of the parish, dependent on rank. When two or more players wish to be Steward they can negotiate to decide who will take control of the parish, or take it by force, razing out the opposing players village from that parish. If Theology is researched, then monks can be deployed to infiltrate the parish and influence the vote. This is usually referred to as a monk war in the game vernacular. When the successful candidate becomes steward they gain control of the parish army along with the ability to set taxes (tithe), and build the necessary guilds to improve life for all in the parish.","December 1, 2012","true","166.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Having in-game connections helped. I still recommend it for the sake of trying and knowing what is what, it's not for everyone. I didn't feel that I needed to Pay4Win to get a good game and be a good player. Sure, you won't get to the feet of those that love to spend their pennies, but not bad either.\n\nAaaah...I remember playing this game not so long ago. Once I logged in I had the gut feeling that I was going in for a treat at first glance on the map. It looked peaceful at first but the objective in this was quite clear:\n\nTeamwork\nWar\nDominate\nRule\n\nThe first thing I did was set me up good with the parish ruler and all the parish player. Help each other out, ask what were the objectives of that specific parish and keep in touch so to work together on setting up a good strong parish. In no time I'm recommended a faction since I had a good set of objectives and knew how to team around and keep in touch. A sense of loyality eventually grows, got to trust those more experienced and keep in touch with everyone (again) to dominate and secure all the parishes/counties belonging to your faction.\nOnce secured we just got to keep the rule, enter a wee bit of peace time and in a flash trouble brews and once again, lose some win some (territories).\n\nSounds quite exciting doesn't it? Seems like your thing? It was for me, too.\n\nThe game's diplomacy is brutal and if you end up in a very active territory you should be ready to be farmed/conquered and do the same too. Unless you've got more military driven people to back you up, climbing the ranks as a peace keeper will be very very painful and very well a waste of time. You basically have to set up two main initial roles at least: Fighter or Support.\n\nI was a fighter and got to admit it was one of the best online fun (browse(kinda)) experiences I had. The communication, the fighting, the commerce, the conquering the thrill of getting payback and crushing opponents knowing I was making them angry in real life.\n\nBut after 1 month and a half I had enough. This game requires a certain commitment and while I knew how to manage the time, this game isn't for the person that doesn't know how to manage time of online fun. Otherwise you'll look at the clock and your wife/husband/partner/errand fell asleep or was ditched waiting for you. Unless one does know how to manage time, this game will only suit retired people or very very bored people with much time to spare.\n\nI recommend the game because of its strategical competitivity and how it can all turn into a messy chaos with all backstabbing and having to rely on teamwork/diplomacy for survival. The collective ladder climb. If you're a competitive person that seeks some competition in the online gaming department this game is a great provider of such.\n\nJust be aware of the timing downside and be very manageable. Otherwise stay away.\n\nCheers","July 23, 2014","true","281.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So far it is the kind of game I will always jump on everyday and build my armies and villages until war breaks out then it will be a fight for control!\nIf you want high action and fast pace then try the 3D action version of this game. If you prefer to play over longer periods more casually and want to build up forces and factions with other people then go for this. The premium features are quite good too and not to pricey to buy a premium token for a month.\nAll I can say is jump on and join a world and try it for yourself.","September 9, 2014","true","353.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magicmalachi/recommended/47410/","magicmalachi","w655k_kaboose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magicmalachi/","","I've been playing this game for over a year now and it is by far one of the best MMO War Games that I have played. With the monthly updates and near 100% uptime you never have to worry about this game crashing or bugging out. I love the card system and the ability to increase pretty much every aspect of the game with cards. From increasing the speed of your scouts and troops to the ammount of food you make in a day everything can be made better. Also One of the biggest selling points about this game that got me into it was the customizable Castles that you create 100% yourself. Other games dont allow you to do this which is what makes me like this game even more. Also seeing the scouts/merchants/armies/monks going across the map is pretty awesome. Being able to see just who is getting attacked and by how many armies is just awesome. Nothing better than seeing 10+ armies flying across the map to 1 village. Honestly, what got me to play this game in the first place was the fact that they had a USA map and that I could have a village in the actual state/county that I live in. No other game has their map based on Real Life locations that I am aware of which makes Stronghold Kingdom that much better. I strongly recommend this game for anyone who likes realtime war games.

Stronghold kingdoms is a good and fun game where there is alot I like about it and some things I do no like. I love the complex of what you can do and be in this game and the different strategys you can use to defeat your opponents such as taking his castles by force or beating your opponents in monking ( political power by votes etc) and even taking his weapons / food and resources. The one downfall I do not like about the game is how much cards can help you or aid you in winning over your opponent who has not buy cards. Than again this game is free so they gotta make there money somehow.\n\nAs a little review of the game you basically start off with 1 village and begin making buildings and upgrading your castles to defend either against AI's or real players from either destroying your castle, pillaging , ransaking ( destroying your buildings you built inside the village ) or even destroying the castle all togethor.\n\nAlso in the game there are what is called Parishs, and each village inside this parish gets to votes once per day electing one person to contol the parish as a steward of it. There is also even more seats that you can earn thru people voting for you to be the leader.\n\nYou level so to the speak from Honour, Honour is used to lvl up thru the ranks earning your more villages , research points and the ability to attack your opponents. You can earn this thru buildings , Banqueting, defending your castle from troops or from attacking AI.\n\nThere is so much more and I can go on and on but Overall its a fun and great game as i have over 700+ hrs played and strongly recommend it.\n\n\nNerdRageDan","September 10, 2014","true","491.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Without a chat window, alliances bond less and have more trouble communicating in game. With a chat window, this game would be everything my medievalist geek self could wish for.\n\nByrtfirth","September 13, 2014","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is the threat of being attacked by a larger force, but then, a comet to hit the earth too, so, both would suck, and being a game, don't let it get to you that seriously.\n\nIt is fun and a good creative challenge.

I´ve been playing this game since the Alpha and I was astonished how cool it was and still is. Yet, in World1, I needed a break, because it was too much time consuming. I came back 4 years after that and started World8 where I was very succesful, but then they announced there will be the Europe Map, something I wanted since the very beginning. Europe was a big disappointment for me because i wanted to be king of my home country, however there were so many Polish I had no chance to fight against them with just a few of my countrymen, so I quit it. I eventually got to be Crown Prince in World8, but that world was too competitive for me and after I finished the quests I wanted (I wanted to unlock all charges for the coat of arms designer), I quit the game and the whole summer it was left untouched. But I love that game so much, building villages is the greatest thing ever, fighting might get repetitive, research is slow, but cards are a great thing though and very helpful, quest make the game interesting and even though as a newcomer to a nAge4 world, you can rise up the ranks if you make the right friends. It´s the perfect game for strategist and lovers of the Stronghold franchise and because it brought me back to play it after 4 years (I kept thinking about the game the whole time!!) I have to say it´s the game that fits my appetite most. :)\n\nMatthias Vitalis","September 8, 2014","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Large scale wars, faction vs faction, House vs House. The thousands, the millions of players choosing to either share and get along in a lasting community, or to destroy anyone in their path. The game has it's ups and downs. Up: You can have 40 villages as of current! There are tons of ranks to work towards, and many many unlockables and boosts you can get for no charge, including researches (You may buy spare points with in-game gold), you can own tons of landmarks such as Counties, Parishes, Provinces, and even the Countries themselves! Downs: You're prone to destruction at a low level if you don't find yourself protected by a high standing Liege Lord. My Liege Lord is my grandfather, who currently holds a high position, in the top 500 players globally, with over 14 villages, he's a Crown Prince.

However, it is never necessary to just play and support teammates and your factions. You can get enough free cards with just a couple of minimal purchases to allow you to do a few interesting things such as intantly repopulate an army on occassion or keep your production levels running high in your villages.\n\nI first ran into Stronghold Kingdoms just after lauch. I had been a fan of the franchise for several years already. I had already played a few 'MMORTS' games already, though, and was a bit burned out on the type of gameplay necessary to keep from getting steamrolled, i.e. sleepless nights, missing work or school, constantly watching from your smartphone... well, you get the point. The change from the high competition to strong cooperation was such I actually felt let down and dropped the game after a few months. (I will note that I did not make a strong effort to find a faction or join a house in the glory race, and so I had missed out on a huge section of gameplay that would have kept me playing.0\n\nI recently picked up SHK again and started playing and noticed some of the changes that had been made. I played a few weeks and noticed some of the core things weren't really different, though. If you don't join up with a faction/house, things are pretty boring. I should note that is unless you just decide to be the thorn in everyone's side, and of course, that has its own levels of excitement. I joined a house on the latest server, USA 2, and things are promising to be interesting.\n\nThe one big addition to the game I have really liked is the quests. For people completely new to the game, it gives some direction as to how to play and what to do. For all, it's extra rewards that help you get established in the game faster and something else to compete over. They start off easy and build up to the difficult or very time/resource intensive.\n\nMy final complaint about the game is that the honor cost of attacking smaller players can still be prohibitive. This is what gives the game its more laid back style, but makes it difficult to deal with the annoying players that deliberately don't level up and constantly harrass with cheap troops just to annoy those around them.\n\nOverall, I give SHK a thumbs up as it can keep a properly-minded person entertained for hours and days at a time without requiring you to sit and stare at your avatar 100% of the time. For those easily addicted and like to micro-manage each minute: play at your risk.","September 8, 2014","true","355.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has a great pace for those who are willing to part with some money, but if u decide to go the no money route u can still achieve success, it just takes awhile longer. It has a nice mix of game features that can be done at your pace from scouting, warring, to just plain farming. Although its a war game, monk and farm based players are essential to the success of your house and ultimately your own success as well.

There are very few drawbacks the fact that it takes a long time to get things done but they try to reduce this by starting and kind of scaling up in time, but eventually things will take a very long time to get done but thats the kind of what you get with games like these. For the genre I think that SK is the best I have played because of some of its features, like the skill tree and its titlebased honor leveling system. The game is strategic also if you have a couple of friends playing with you it would be best because it would really help in getting up the ladder faster. I really like the quest system as well because the rewards are actually useful for the quest u complete like they are fair. 10/10 would play again.","September 8, 2014","true","204.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Id enjoy more maps and more game options like castel customization, village politics such as what you would do if you found a little boy stealing or if you found someone with special skill or someone in your village threatens you. more options for honor gain. Also i think research points shouldnt cost as much gold as it does after buying them only a few times, and you should gain more with higher lvls reached not just 3 everytime i lvl up in honour. Also a better way to veave threw inactives it sucks having inactive members in your parish that are no help i think you should be abke to report a player inactive that way the faster their village can be removed. thank you, yours truly  Blood_Hound_MP\n\n","September 8, 2014","true","179.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I normally play through the stand alone client and have 2 years of experience. Now taking about the game... i can honestly say this is one of the best mmorpg games i have ever played. Although the graphics look like it's from the late 1990s, the fact that this requires so much communication between players especially in wars, makes it so much addictive even without decent graphics.\nIt is free to play but as all f2p games are, there are special bonuses for people who pay. There is no premium account here, rather a premium token which grants the player several bonuses like research and building queues, auto trade, scout and recruit troops. These are generally in from of 7-day and 30-day tokens which can be bought but there are 2-day tokens which are given in the tutorial and some quests. The fact that free players can have these 2-day tokens from quests in multiple worlds makes them at level with the payers. Also another thing that is bought are cards. Now these give massive boost to almost everything in the game. Free players do gain cards by completing quests, but this is nowhere near the amount of cards bought by payers. This is where the games get very pay to win. A f2p player can easily get frustated at this and leave. But there is a way to carry on. A f2p player just needs to communicate with the payers and ask them for help. Most will gladly agree and also invite them to factions if the player is active. Now in a faction, different people gather together and can help each other out in times of need whether its war or building up. Lot of f2p players complain that payers can get their villages, castles and armies up in seconds with cards. This is true and very frustating for a f2p, but through communication and diplomacy, you can get resources to make the same. But the drawback is that it does take a lot of time. The fact that there is no limit to the amount of cards that a player can purchase is a very serious drawback to the game for f2p players. The only way to get round this is to leave pvp to carders and play the role of a supplier or monker to the fighters for f2p players. This creates the necessicity for lot of communication and that is one of the strong points in the game. In war, helping others with resources and monking(influencing) requires so much communication, that one is able to lose sleep! However the chat system is pretty flawed and people don't use the mail syestem that much because it takes too much time. That's why people use 3rd party programs like teamspeak and skype to communicate.\nYou can have many villages and that too with of different types which grant special resources, research different technologies, create different armies, battle the AI, wolves and other players. The main goal is to win the age and you can only do that if you are in a faction/house. So this is not a solo game and requires teamwork. It is possible to succed as a f2p player if you know the game mechanics very well and communicate with others, but if not then you can get very bored easily. The most inetersting part comes when war takes place, as you feel the urge to be online almost all the time lest your villages get destroyed by the enemy and also to take them out while they are offline! And as stated before this requires huge amounts of communication which can help us create new friends. The faction and house is literally like a family when you play for long with them.\nAltogether this is a great free to play game but not close to the best. If you can spend some cash or dedicate enough time this will really become very addictive :) I would recommend this to others who want to play strategy games and have a lot of patience.\n\nWith regards\nGuardian002\n(currently active in usa2)","September 8, 2014","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is challenging on many different levels, and requires multi-strategy.  You dont just build your villages you build and maintain castles.  At the same time, you research, trade, and cultivate faith points to make sure you have enough to ID when needed, and to use them to fight.  Your villages can be destroyed with a well timed attack or multiple attacks timed up, so there is strong impetus to learn how to defend well.  By playing with a faction and ultimately a house, you strive for glory, learn how to fight as a team, and end up joining communities online of like minded people; so in effect it becomes a very social game.

This is not a game for someone who isn't willing to exploit every little fiber of the system or the fact that one is playing with real people, and therefore the smart player who cannot afford to spend hundreds of dollars to keep up with the big spenders must essentially lie, cheat, and backstab the majority of the player's adversaries--and at the same time, the big spenders with their awfully game-breakingly large armies are liable to do the same to you! Even if you chose to be a peaceful bystander.\n\nOn the technical side this game features doznes of technologies from four trees: Industry for resource production, Military for the army, Education for cultultural influence (which moves you ahead), and Farming for general agriculture. Their functions in the game are more or less obvious, but in order to use them effectively you must be willing to forgo wasting in-game currency on "useless" technology and find the best way to combine the usefulness of technologies.\n\nThe military is very simple: Peasants who are easy to draft en masse (expect to use these little guys a lot early on, and expect the premium players to never use them until they're spent), archers whom are fragile but can easily snipe enemies at a distance (expect to see big complex castles hosting these in their towers, which are protected by statkes early on and moats later on), pikeman for a balanced assualt and defense (early on these guys are impossible to get without spending real money, meaning you will not be able to use them for nearly a month while players who pay large sums of money will almost certaainly send these guys in waves in the first week!), swordsman who are basically the ultimate offensive unit, and Captains who serve as city-takers and leaders.\n\nThe castle construction part of the game is more complex and a bit fun when you're in-game rich enough to capitalize on the insane powers of tall towes and thick stone walls built in a maze with deliberate weaknesses in certain spots for the sole purpose of luring the attacking A.I. (even human enemies cannot control the battle itself, therefore the winner is essentially determined at the start) through your death maze with hailstorms of arrows!\n\nAlthough the beginning can be rough, if you survive, you might see what I mean in the above.\n\nHowever, this game is in real time, which means human enemies from the other end of the world hitting you in your sleep and real people waiting on you. If you cannot commit to serious play then don't play at all--"semi-actives" are almost always ignored, bullied, pillaged and eventually conquered by the 16-hour players.\n\nLuckily the majority of the players don't like money-spenders unless they're in the same "faction" (i.e., a group of players who formed a veritable country with a government and political process and everything), and will therefore be willing to work with you in fighting the rich. Also note, the real fun comes from factions, as they have the real power (despite the fact Houses are meant to be groups of factions, they don't have any direct authority whereas faction leaders are practical dictators). In my experience the best role to play is that of a faction leader, but I highly recommend you find people to join you at least a month ahead of time. Otherwise you're putting faith in the random people you recruited in the local regions.  Also note being a dictator--or oligarch--requires you to invest much of your personal time and have extensive knowledge of the game (or at least a very good idea).\n\nFrom the follower perspective, the game is much harder as it's very difficult to find a decent faction to match your desires. And if you join then leave too many factions you will almost certainly develop a bad reputation and be shunned by many. Therefore you might want to consider taking up leadership--even if it's small and weak, it's better to be the sole owner of a small-time business than a shareholder in a coorperation because you will at least learn from your mistakes and from them, do better next time (under a different name and account ideally).\n\nIn conclusion, this game is the epitome of Social Darwinism and it greatly favors people willing to shell anywhere from 30$ to 150$. With those who spent 150$ effectively buying out the game.\n\nI have found it a massochistic pleasure, the challenge is punishing but the rewards are great, I'd give it a score of and 80/100 compared to most browser games and a 60/100 for games in general. This game will tease you with it's fun times and really bite you in the butt with it's jerks and big spenders, therefore if you want to play, you better bring your poker face and conceal don't feel.\n\nUsername: Alois Blucher","September 8, 2014","true","275.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is at least for me, as it is highly addictive.  I feel compulsed to play everyday, as there is always more to achieve.  I have noted several reviews which complain about card play and buying cards.  I have gotten strong in the game by investing time, not money.  I did buy cards to move from three free cards a week to 14 cards a week.  But I am keeping most of my cards for a future game . . . (evil laugh).  I do find the premium token useful, mostly when I am building a new town.\n\nIf you want to see come check me out in USA1.

I do wish they used a little more with the landscape like in the old ones.    Also,  the troops tend to do stupid things sometimes.    I wish you could put rally points for the troops to go to,  when they get there they could proceed to the next one. (maybe as an advanced option.)       Game is to reliant on Faith Points.   There is a domination world that removed them completely but it's not a long term game.

This is one of those games that you can pick away at, village by village, farm by farm, castle brick by brick.  Or, this is a game that you can get swept up in, by either trying to stay out of the eventual fighting by opposing Houses and Factions, or by jumping in headfirst to join the slugfest between hundreds of live opponents.\n\nSK asks for patience as you develop, perform missions, gather resources, and build your villages and castles.  Developing growing and successful villages, leading to resources used for castle building, can test even the most patient of players.  SK's game system admittedly offers those that can play "cards" an advantage in this all-important economic progress aspect of the game, enabling players to accelerate the pace of their development through the use of in-game cards.  War fighting and other combat related aspects of the game can provide a similar challenge.  Attack a computer-generated target without proper resources and troops, and you risk a punishing war of attrition against an inanimate foe that constantly regenerates.  Attack a human player with a similar lack of war readiness, and you risk being annihilated by foe and potentially countless hordes of opportunistic foes alike.  Attack or counter-attack with good strength and patience-driven readiness, and the glory of a 2D face planting of your enemy is yours.\n\nSK is essentially a winner-take-all game, with a twist.  Players can attempt to stay neutral (my 10-year old son named his village "Be Nice to Neutrals" and has so far survived).  Or, players can join a House and one of its many subsets (Factions) to wage either diplomacy and/or warfare on your enemies.  The game can seem unbalanced at times on the latter, as players seem to gravitate toward joining the strongest House out of fear of getting wiped off the map or shunned to the ash heap of Houses that are periodically eliminated as the game progresses.  SK game designers would be well served to add 2nd place, 3rd place (etcetera) awards to Houses (like mine) that seem to start the periodic map resets at a numeric disadvantage to the one or two Houses that are immediately in the lead.\n\nOverall, SK Is a solid game for those that want a 2D game that they can enjoy either semi-passively -- or quite aggressively.  It basically comes down to this:  What you put into it, you tend to get out of it.  And, as the game offers a very deep strategic experience, if you are fortunate to join a House and Faction that is well connected (we use Raidcall to communicate in the House and Faction that I am in), SK can offer even some very enjoyable operational and tactical experiences as well.\n\nusername:  jazos","September 8, 2014","true","812.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is challenging on many different levels, and requires multi-strategy.  You dont just build your villages you build and maintain castles.  At the same time, you research, trade, and cultivate faith points to make sure you have enough to ID when needed, and to use them to fight.  Your villages can be destroyed with a well timed attack or multiple attacks timed up, so there is strong impetus to learn how to defend well.  By playing with a faction and ultimately a house, you strive for glory, learn how to fight as a team, and end up joining communities online of like minded people; so in effect it becomes a very social game.  One issue is that certain individuals (I wont name any Russians names) multi account, and because they spend alot of money firefly allows it, and they dominate certain servers, Europe server being one.

This is not a game for someone who isn't willing to exploit every little fiber of the system or the fact that one is playing with real people, and therefore the smart player who cannot afford to spend hundreds of dollars to keep up with the big spenders must essentially lie, cheat, and backstab the majority of the player's adversaries--and at the same time, the big spenders with their awfully game-breakingly large armies are liable to do the same to you! Even if you chose to be a peaceful bystander.\n\nOn the technical side this game features doznes of technologies from four trees: Industry for resource production, Military for the army, Education for cultultural influence (which moves you ahead), and Farming for general agriculture. Their functions in the game are more or less obvious, but in order to use them effectively you must be willing to forgo wasting in-game currency on "useless" technology and find the best way to combine the usefulness of technologies.\n\nThe military is very simple: Peasants who are easy to draft en masse (expect to use these little guys a lot early on, and expect the premium players to never use them until they're spent), archers whom are fragile but can easily snipe enemies at a distance (expect to see big complex castles hosting these in their towers, which are protected by statkes early on and moats later on), pikeman for a balanced assualt and defense (early on these guys are impossible to get without spending real money, meaning you will not be able to use them for nearly a month while players who pay large sums of money will almost certaainly send these guys in waves in the first week!), swordsman who are basically the ultimate offensive unit, and Captains who serve as city-takers and leaders.\n\nThe castle construction part of the game is more complex and a bit fun when you're in-game rich enough to capitalize on the insane powers of tall towes and thick stone walls built in a maze with deliberate weaknesses in certain spots for the sole purpose of luring the attacking A.I. (even human enemies cannot control the battle itself, therefore the winner is essentially determined at the start) through your death maze with hailstorms of arrows!\n\nAlthough the beginning can be rough, if you survive, you might see what I mean in the above.\n\nHowever, this game is in real time, which means human enemies from the other end of the world hitting you in your sleep and real people waiting on you. If you cannot commit to serious play then don't play at all--"semi-actives" are almost always ignored, bullied, pillaged and eventually conquered by the 16-hour players.\n\nLuckily the majority of the players don't like money-spenders unless they're in the same "faction" (i.e., a group of players who formed a veritable country with a government and political process and everything), and will therefore be willing to work with you in fighting the rich. Also note, the real fun comes from factions, as they have the real power (despite the fact Houses are meant to be groups of factions, they don't have any direct authority whereas faction leaders are practical dictators). In my experience the best role to play is that of a faction leader, but I highly recommend you find people to join you at least a month ahead of time. Otherwise you're putting faith in the random people you recruited in the local regions.  Also note being a dictator--or oligarch--requires you to invest much of your personal time and have extensive knowledge of the game (or at least a very good idea).\n\nFrom the follower perspective, the game is much harder as it's very difficult to find a decent faction to match your desires. And if you join then leave too many factions you will almost certainly develop a bad reputation and be shunned by many. Therefore you might want to consider taking up leadership--even if it's small and weak, it's better to be the sole owner of a small-time business than a shareholder in a coorperation because you will at least learn from your mistakes and from them, do better next time (under a different name and account ideally).\n\nIn conclusion, this game is the epitome of Social Darwinism and it greatly favors people willing to shell anywhere from 30$ to 150$. With those who spent 150$ effectively buying out the game.\n\nI have found it a massochistic pleasure, the challenge is punishing but the rewards are great, I'd give it a score of and 80/100 compared to most browser games and a 60/100 for games in general. This game will tease you with it's fun times and really bite you in the butt with it's jerks and big spenders, therefore if you want to play, you better bring your poker face and conceal don't feel.\n\nUsername: Alois Blucher","September 8, 2014","true","275.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is at least for me, as it is highly addictive.  I feel compulsed to play everyday, as there is always more to achieve.  I have noted several reviews which complain about card play and buying cards.  I have gotten strong in the game by investing time, not money.  I did buy cards to move from three free cards a week to 14 cards a week.  But I am keeping most of my cards for a future game . . . (evil laugh).

Even if you only have ten bucks a month to spend on it I would recommend it.  (if you are into an in depth long term strategy MMO.)        I do wish they used a little more with the landscape like in the old ones.    Also,  the troops tend to do stupid things sometimes.    I wish you could put rally points for the troops to go to,  when they get there they could proceed to the next one. (maybe as an advanced option.)       Game is to reliant on Faith Points.   There is a domination world that removed them completely but it's not a long term game.

It is also a good game if you have limited time these days for gaming, pop in, build a view building launch a few attacks and check later.  Either way, the game is fun and easy to play/catch on.

After working at my job and then doing work on masters courses, you just have to have something to do in order to change things up.\n\nThe best part about this game is that it brings the original Stronghold to an online type game. The Stronghold franchise has been one of my favorite for the past six to seven years and Kingdoms is a great addition to it. Another great part about this game is the ability to play it with other people and get to know them. I have played with doctors, actors, athletes, and many others, on this game and the ability to connect with others in a game that models after a favorite of mine for years is incredible.\n\nI am still kinda sad that they got a few of the states wrong in the USA maps, but can live with Columbus not being the capital of Ohio and other things like that.","September 10, 2014","true","904.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The geography of this game is well made and several times on the USA worlds I have been like "wait I have been here in real life". You can build friendships through this game that last for years.

For instance, Stronghold Kingdoms has various researchs which need to been done in order to advance further in the game, and various other advantages for paying users who buy crowns. But, ultimately the game becomes very time consuming taking days and months on end to advance very far. Which results in the fact that many people leave the game, because for example you leave for about a week with everything being fine but return to find a mess and half your castle destory. (Happened to me, and a few friends.) Lastly, the factions and glory race part of the game leaves something to be desired since, as the ages progress in the game all factions and houses are reset to help things over. But such is not the case since, more often then not I have found getting into a house is challenging and the members of the former winning all are top rank and join the same house over again to win the next age.\n\nUltimately, I would recommend the game, but would advise avoiding it unless you like a high degree of user-interaction and waiting around.\n\nEmperorElijah\nPlaying since September 2012\n","September 10, 2014","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
