You need to keep in mind, this is a teamgame and if you get paired with randoms they wont teamwork as well as you would alone or with friends/guild.\n\nI wont go deeper into grind and progression as a whole, as it will be changed a million times, before airing.\n\nBalancing is more or less "rock-paper-scissors", i havent found an overpowerd unit or anything that hasnt counterunits.\nKeep in mind as mentioned before the progression tree enables you to command stronger units. Those should meet equally powerfull units, as the playerbase should be big.\n\nAs of now, there isnt a big wideness of different units(unittypes), but keep in mind this is Alpha and the game plays in a timeframe that havent had a BIG variety of troops.\nWhere the game really shines and offers big potential is the "general" progression system. Every general has special traits active and passive that you use in battle and that you can synergize with your units. If this is executed right and there will be a balanced and wide variety of generals this can offer tactical variety and planing.\n\nFor an alpha the game is playable and i didnt encounter gamebreaking bugs. If you like strategy games and dont mind it being more arcady than previous TW titles or just want a game for 30 minutes to relax, go for it. I believe on release it will be f2p, so even if you are not intrested now, you can check it out free on release.\n\nI cant speak for the final product, but as of now, i would try it out.","January 31, 2015","true","17.9"," 264 of 298 people (89%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","89","264","298","26","15"

This game makes sure no battle is won without cooperative team-oriented multiplay.\nAt its current state (latest test in december 2015) the graphics are nice, the army management system is well thought, the connectivity is good, wait time is acceptable (3 min tops) and the skill tree is quite complexe.\nIt's important to note that the leveling system is designed to work with Units and Commander XP earned through gameplay. Gold bought from the store can be used for esthetic and a few extra special units (IMO only level 10 extra might be worth it).\nOh, and it's free to play.\nThis is another great achievement for SEGA and Creative Assembly.\n\n95/100","February 3, 2015","true","79.4"," 106 of 133 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","106","133","8","3"

Once your general (Leondias) is a high level, you can actually get the 300 Spartans and finally, be able to (sort of) recreate the last stand at Thermoplae (As stated before, you actually get a Thermoplae map).\n\nNow there are problems.\n1) the camera isnt the greatest\n2) It seems more arcadey and this is what its meant to be however, i still want my realistic Total Wars\n3) MICRO-TRANSACTIONS!!!\n4)  Not really that many generals to choose from (Obviously, even if theres a million generals, you must pick Leonidas), but seriously, give us more generals!\n\nOverall I score it 8/10 - bonus points given as it is Free to play and it will be released as a free game. so whether you like it or not, try it, its not going to be a waste of money if you dont like it","May 4, 2015","true","18.2"," 85 of 111 people (77%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","77","85","111","50","7"

Multiplayer only, right now, in the alpha phase.\n\nGameplay\nChoose one type of unit. Choose one commander. You should do that. But if you choose   bad commander and you want to choose another, you need to do everything again.\n\n“Where there is unity there is Victory”. Says it’s motto. In that game everytime you can win.\nIf you have many archers, you will fear of horses, but if you have many spearmen you will fear of archers. That’s the balance. You can win, everytime.\n\nThe team never be good. Matchmaking system make it impossible. Everywhere there are beginners and everywhere there are some professionals.\n\nWhat’s are Tiers? Tiers show the unit’s level. Max tier is X (10). Your commander have tiers, too, not just the units. Your commander can level up by skills. If you have an amount of commander XP you can buy items for units or level up commander’s skills. If your commander get an amount of skills upgraded, he/she will get a bigger tier.\n\nEverytime, in every battle you can bring only 3 units. (That means: 1 archers and 2 spearmen or 2 horses and 1 spearmen) Then you can go to a match.\n\nAnd what’s the currency? There are gold and silver. Gold is what you can only buy by real money or by winning matches (Yes! You can get 100 gold/win). And you can get silver by playing matches.\n\nLast words\nGood to see another free2play RTS game.\n\nGameplay: 7/10 – Great Combat system, Great XP system, but it’s very slow.\nMatchmaking: 6/10 – Very slow and just sometimes fast.\nDesign/Graphics: 7/10 – Very unoptimized, but nice.\nSound Design: 8/10 – Not bad, but can be better.\nFree to Win: 8/10 – Free to win, but payers can progress faster\n\nDO NOT FORGET: IT’S CLOSED ALPHA!\n\n\nALL: 72/100\nNeed a try.\n\n\nSource: https://pcrage.wordpress.com/2015/05/16/total-war-arena/","May 17, 2015","true","7.4"," 54 of 79 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","54","79","7","8"

But i have a weird feeling that it is going to become p2w. In that i mean you can pay to level up commanders or armies quicker, it reminds me of Heroes and Generals the leveling system as  there is a unit tree to change your soilder into better ones or cav. Also it is great that CA are doing an alpha for this as it means the community can give feedback to help improve the game. they should do this for other TW titles so the game doesn't come out like rome 2 did smh. Overall this game is great as it requires teamwork, strategy and tactics with people you don't even know, also it is better when you finally figure out how to make the game use your dedicated gpu instead of your intergrated one. So i like the direction the game is headed but my main concern is sega forcing CA to make it p2w like tw kingdoms is.

As someone with a few thousand hours of Total War games behind me I found myself back in time when I played my first battles in Rome Total War. "How do you do it? What happens when you do this?". You stumble alongside your allies for a few fights before you find the courage to try something of your own and of course it doesn't go as you planned. War is chaos, and TW Arena quickly becomes it's IRL counterpart without co-operation and communication. Yes, it's next to impossible to get the whole team on the same plan but co-operate with one or two other players and you could become a formidable team who captures the base. Or catapult fodder while your comrades do the same. The choice is not entirely yours, but I love that. Chaos, casual chaos...

The coalition against napoleon could not have succeeded if they all fought alone. This game is like an entertaining test, and, like any other total war game out there it will appeal to anybody who enjoys strategy. But this game tests not only your skills or strategic combat ability, but also the way you co-operate. In a battle there would be many captains, not just one god-like entity. This game really shows this very effectively with only a few squads of units under your command. It reminds me of the shogun 2 total war avatar conquest, except in a more survival style gameplay akin to War Thunder.\nAt the moment the graphics are more than decent and I would not be able to tell the difference between the graphics for this and RTWII...(but then I never zoom in too see if the whiskers are different lengths or if someone is a bit chubbier as graphics are not quite THAT important to me (not to say that I don't enjoy epic graphics...)) , the barracks and army management system is quite well thought out with progress being not to hard to make (even if you lose) and yet still keeping the game challenging due to having to rely on your comrades. In general the rate of connectivity is decent (going at about 20-30 fps) and takes little time to get a game set up with a large scale battle (terrain and buildings being just as advanced as in RTWII and Attila) and the skill tree is quite complex with extra shields, helmets, spears etc available...(you don't even have to pay to win!)\nIn my opinion another of the greater works of Sega and The Creating Assembly.

People familiar with Rome, will definitely be in their comfort zone. Though, there are some changes that clearly need some tweaking.\n10v10 going head-to-head. 30 groups on both sides trying to fight head on or use stealth in unseen areas. Keep your eyes open, for an ambush is waiting!\n\nOverall, the game is awesome. though some units need a bit rebalance. Artillery shoot like snipers, almost a 90% hit chance. archers are pretty strong and there doesn't seem to be any form of combat-lock. Escaping a lost fight can be really easy when you have the lighter ( read: faster ) troops.\n\npro's:\n- love the upgrade features.\n- A lot of usable troops with different abilities\n- Pretty huge battle scale\n- unit line of sight. makes the fight more intense and makes me very wary of unseen areas.\n\ncon's\n- No combat lock, archers can easily escape an infantry charge and shoot em to bits and pieces\n- Accuracy of catapults and scorpion like units.\n- Just clicking "Move" through an enemy unit does give you a damage penalty but you can move through the formation, but sometimes the rear flank bonus ( moral shock ) makes that damage penalty pretty worth it. It should not be possible in my opinion.\n\nTL;DR\n\nF2P so why not? It's a pretty good game. I definitely recommend it !","April 30, 2015","true","317.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

So far after a few hours of playing it seems like this game is a mix of MOBA and RTS. The thing that separates this Total War from the others is the amount of teamwork and strategy required to win. Unlike the other Total Wars this game forces you to work with other players, I like to think of it as if you're an officer in an army and the other players are also officers, and you all lead your troops together as an army.\n\nCommander Feature:\nWe saw something close to the "Commander" feature in Shogun 2, in which we picked created our own commander, customized him, unlocked troops, etc. We see this return in Arena except, we pick from historical commanders, Julius Ceasar, Leonidas, Scipio, etc. With each of these commanders their own special features.\n\n"Free to Play": The game is planned to be free to play, which means we are going to see the same old, same old, in-game currency seen in other games. As of now i don't see any problems with the one in Arena, I would say its similar to "War Thunder"'s currency system(Haven't played War Thunder in a while so that not be accurate.\n\nGraphics: Graphics aren't amazing, but they aren't to the point where i don't even want to play the game anymore, graphics aren't everything.\n\nBugs/Glitches: I haven't seen any game-breaking bugs, haven't been playing the game long enough to notice any.\n\nI don't really know what else to talk about in this review, It's a good alpha and a good step for Total War.\n\nThe game overall is very good, it is in alpha so there is a lot of changes to be made.","May 1, 2015","true","45.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","7","13","3","0"

I've enjoyed my time on it so far, even if the game play doesn't feel as deep as there other titles, getting tired etc. I'm sure most of them concerns will be addressed.

You need to have a certain strategy every game. You need to work with your teammates to equally split your forces in such a way that so that you won't be flanked, but you would be able to flank the enemy.\nNow comes the best part: you can only have 3 units of your choosing, but the number of players on each team is 10 so it would be better if you have a few mates to play with you and figure a way to work as a team. You have no chance of winning without teamwork, because every unit has its counter so DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT GO IN ALONE.\nIt has a troop progression system similar to that of World of Tanks, where you need to upgrade your current tier troops before getting new ones. Still, the tiers are still WIP so I can't really say anything else on this part of the game.\nFor an alpha version, it is quite stable, not even 1 game breaking bug or glitch found so far. If you enjoy the Total War series, be sure to try this one out, or if you want a way to relax just play a game on this, because even if you have a competitive nature you will not get upset or rage (most of the time at least).\n","April 4, 2015","true","48.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Rushing in with zero tactics. There were countless times in my first match where I could see perfect places for my allies to flank the enemy. But no, I guess thoughtlessly piling your men down a narrow street is a great idea. Said no-one ever.\n\nOther than that the graphics are nice and I like the core, MOBA-esqe gameplay. Although, I can't seem to right click and drag my units into position and the unit controls just feel clunky. If there's a way to change some of the controls to how it was in previous Total War games, like in Shogun 2, Rome 2, Napoleon, etc, then that would be great.\n\nI like the line of sight mechanic, it makes it really easy to know what you can and can't see. And what the enemy can and can't see.\n\nArcher damage needs to be toned down a bit. They seem to be heavily spammed.\n\nIf you are only given three units (not a complaint, that's a nice number for a game like this) then you should at least improve the matchmaking to put Tier 1 players with other Tier 1 players, not a mix of Tier 1 and 2 players. That would mean relying on tactics and actually using your brain to win. Rather than just rushing you army of Tier 2 units straight through a poor guys Tier 1 units.\n\nI'm gonna give CA the benefit of the doubt and recommend this game, in the hope that these modist issues are atleast considered.\n\n-Verdict- (As of 28/03/2015 - Non-American Date Layout)\n\nPros\n+Nice Graphics\n+Good Gameplay\n\n-Can't right click and drag to move units\n-Poor Matchmaking\n-No incentive for Tier 2 units not to rush defenseless Tier 1 units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I always get put with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who have hardly played the Total War games, and play battles like Rome 2 AI?? :(((","March 27, 2015","true","1.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's a total war themed game for a World of Tanks model. Don't get me wrong, this is a good thing. So you have:\n\n- general which resembles the tank crew - so get some skills/attribute bonus for the units (good part those skills are active, there are not many tho)\n\n- the army composition (3 units) with their own upgrades which are passive linear prograssion upgrates until you unlock a more powerfull unit of the same time (which are displayed in a army tree just like in wot)\n\n- the game mechanics are based on Total War games (rock, paper, shotgun) meaning cavalery will destroy archers etc but have implemented a line of sight and some forests for more strategy (element of surprise)\n\nI like the direction they started with this game, it can be huge but it lacks something. I know some won't agree but i want a higher purpose not just grinding for improved generals and armies. Maybe a clan wars? :))\n\n\nAnd of course they can improve the diversity a bit (more customizeble generals maybe?). I would have gone with a pool of skills and skill slots for customization. Say one wants a General which by design is defensive and make it offensive by choosing offensive skills from the skill pool. Just my 5 cents.\n\n\nEven so the game is in alpha so i give it a thumbs up.

Friendly fire is a punishable thing here and if not for the small loss of some currency, the community will certainly hate you if you keep firing your archers at enemy soldiers engaged in battle with friendlies (yes ale.tell, I still remember you).\n\nSystem requirements are very low for now and I like how I can run this game on a potato with no difficulties whatsoever.\n\nI despise the fact that this game will be just another freemium-type game filled with microtransactions and pay-to-win scenarios. Guys, this is a Total War game; you have the support of so many people around the globe and you could find much more clever ways of turning in profit (much better profit !). Please take examples of Valve with Dota 2 and Team Fortress 2. This game has all the chances of becoming a competitive sport !

This being said I still love this game (as with most Total War games), but I know that a lot of potential is being wasted.\n\nSomething else that bugs me at this point in the game, and I'm sure it will be a recuring problem after the official release is the lag. Nothing is more crippling than watching your archers getting flanked by cavalry and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nOne of the best things the devs will do to this game (at least I hope so - it's what they said in interviews) is introduce armies from all Total War games. Just imagine the impossible battle between Caesar and Tokugawa Ieyasu, or between Saladin and Napoleon !\n\nAgain, there's a lot of potential in this game and I hope the devs will harness it.","April 13, 2015","true","66.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have only 3 units, so communications with the team and preplanning are keys to victory. I'm really looking forward on this one, and I really hope it will not be Pay2Win ;)","April 1, 2015","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This can lead to some trolling.\n\nOther than that, I can't find a fault at all, keep up the fantastic work Creative Assembly!\n\nI hope they really put full effort into this game, as I can see this replacing my want for "Age of Empires: Online" back.\n","April 12, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The maps are so far 10vs10 players, each with 3 units. So you have to work together to fulfill objectives on a map.\n\nYou can see what your friends commands are briefly with arrows, so when you attack an enemy unit lets say, your colleagues see an arrow from your units to the enemy unit and they can coordinate accordingly","April 12, 2015","true","368.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Friendly fire is a punishable thing here and if not for the small loss of some currency, the community will certainly hate you if you keep firing your archers at enemy soldiers engaged in battle with friendlies (yes ale.tell, I still remember you).\n\nSystem requirements are very low for now and I like how I can run this game on a potato with no difficulties whatsoever.\n\nI despise the fact that this game will be just another freemium-type game filled with microtransactions and pay-to-win scenarios. Guys, this is a Total War game; you have the support of so many people around the globe and you could find much more clever ways of turning in profit (much better profit !). Please take examples of Valve with Dota 2 and Team Fortress 2. This game has all the chances of becoming a competitive sport ! (Just imagine how competitions would look like and all the strategies that will be employed). Please help turn it into one, if you love the community and if you love your games. This being said I still love this game (as with most Total War games), but I know that a lot of potential is being wasted.\n\nSomething else that bugs me at this point in the game, and I'm sure it will be a recuring problem after the official release is the lag. Nothing is more crippling than watching your archers getting flanked by cavalry and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nOne of the best things the devs will do to this game (at least I hope so - it's what they said in interviews) is introduce armies from all Total War games. Just imagine the impossible battle between Caesar and Tokugawa Ieyasu, or between Saladin and Napoleon !\n\nAgain, there's a lot of potential in this game and I hope the devs will harness it.","April 13, 2015","true","66.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would like it to stay that way. Have a few thoughts what could be improved though.\n\nIs there any email or forum thread where alpha testers can share comments?\n\nIn general game is quite dynamic, but thanks to commanding only 3 units you can still control the events on the map. It's old good Total War but in micro scale. You dont have to overthink, because you have 5k troops on the battlefield. No, you just need to focus on your task and thats it. Adding f2p play mode (similiar to World of Tanks in meaning of progress) gives multiple possibilities how to play (you can have few commanders at the same time, so when you die you can go right to the next battle), and fun to discover new abilities for commander, new gear for your units, and consumables.\n\nReally, really addictive :)\n","April 13, 2015","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Much more arcade-ish than a regular Total War game, but with a lot more options to customize and unlock new and better units. Really good for a Free to Play game, and there are no real pay-to-win factors in it either. Easy to learn, easy to play and extremely fun.\n\n\nThis game is not pay-to-win, more like pay-to-progress-faster. You can buy gold for real money, which can be used to do the following things:\n\n\n-Buy more color packs which are used to customize the looks of your soldiers. Doesn't affect gameplay at all, other than your troops looking more customized.\n-You can buy certain troops that can only be purchased with gold. My experience with them is that they look cool, but they are nothing special in their actual combat effectiveness.\n-Convert your gold into commander exp (Free exp) or silver.\n\n\nSilver is the only currency that is actually useful, and it is easily obtainable by playing the game. Factors like friendly fire and how much damage your units take decrease the amount of silver you earn from a battle, however even with those factors chiming in you will usually earn several thousand silver from every battle.\n\nOverall a great arcade free to play game. It lacks the feeling of accomplishment that you will find in regular Total War games, however the game can not really be compared to any of the main Total War titles.","April 6, 2015","true","74.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you played the multiplayer of total war or the battles in campaing, it's just the same.\n\nYou can selected three cultures Romans, Barbarians and Greeks. Romans and Greeks have three generals and Barbarians two. Any general have unique skills that you can use on the troops. The troops tree is good when you level up your troops you can select other troops of other tier.\n\nThe battles are great but tend to be a bit chaotic, the problem here is the comunication with other players. The maps are very good.\n\nI see that the game needs more game modes like siege, capture the flag or a simple team deatmatch why no base, formations for the troops and tournaments/events.\n\nThe game is very promising and i think that the final version go to be a great game.\n\n","May 27, 2015","true","25.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like Total War battles, except you're commanding 3 units instead of 30, and there are a total of 20 players in every game (also there's no fatigue). Between battles you spend your hard-earned experience and silver on buying upgrades for your units, essentially a very large tech tree with units. Each unit can also be upgraded with stuff like improved armor, shields, helmets, often changing the visuals of the unit.\n\nThere's definitely a long grind for unlocks in this meta game. On the plus side you get matched mostly with people from the same tier of units.  This means that even as you grow more powerful, so does your enemy. And you all become increasingly specialized into different paths along the tech tree.","May 27, 2015","true","201.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tho for now i can't say too much as the game still has a lot of stuff to add in more than one way.","May 23, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was very much suprised in a good way when it turned out to be really good game.  it is fun to play and has potential.","April 23, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
