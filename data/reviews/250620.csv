I have yet to completely finish the first Amnesia. I have a backlog of horror games (including some point n' clicks) that grows every day. Because I have a problem. I LOVE horror games... but like an ice cream enthusiast who happens to also be lactose intolerant, horror games do not love me. So there you have it; that's the score.\n\nNow that being said, I'm going to power through this one to completion. Know why? Because it's that good. Oh man is this game good. It is a testament to why horror games are so great... and why even now, in a market saturated with action horrors and tired old tropes, you'll still find an "Among the Sleep." This game is horrifying. Care to know why? What's the biggest issue plaguing the horror genre? That's right: termites. And player empowerment. Sometimes I'm a big, brave guy lugging around a shotgun. Sometimes I'm running around with a camera. Sometimes I might as well be stark naked. But I always find myself on equal ground with the baddies. Sure they're menacing, but I'm faster. And smarter. And sometimes more heavily armed. And suddenly we're not playing a horror game anymore. So how do we remove player empowerment, a hypothetical developer might muse? How do we make the player feel like a babe lost in the woods?  We turn them into a ♥♥♥♥ing babe, right down to the wobbles and coos and imaginary friends.\n\nAnd when I tell you that makes this game immersive and terrifying, I'm not kidding. When you pause the screen you cover your little eyes. When you move at all, AT ALL, you make adorable little sounds of struggle. And when you, the player, gaze into that mother♥♥♥♥ing abyss, that sucker stares right back. Every shadow hides a menace, every sound betrays a would-be threat. Everything is so big and intimidating. The whole environment just mocks you as you explore it semi-impotently. Because you're a baby. A smart baby, yes. But a baby. And that big, scary world is out to get you.\n\nI'm not remotely done with this game. I know I have a ways to go. I'm already freaked out - in a good way! If you have a passing interest in horror, you won't be disappointed. Now I'm going to go clean the boom-boom out of my pants and press onward.","May 29, 2014","true","4.5"," 2,096 of 2,221 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","096","2","8","56"

But will you want to play this through ? In Among the Sleep you dont play as an adult but instead as a two year old child. The game begins and its our birthday and we get a teddy bear as a present. But one night you wake up to find out that the teddy bear and your mom is missing so its up to you to find them. So how is Among the sleep ? Im kinda mixed on this game honestly. The gameplay is smooth and its a blast to play but there are problems that weigh down the experience. First of all the game is just like amnesia. The main charecter is defensless and theres nothing you can do about it so you have to hide to get away from monsters. The game also throws in puzzles you need to solve to get to the end. So now for the pros and cons. Pros: The game looks amazing. Its just amazing to see a nightmare world through a childs eyes. The story has a great set up and the ending is also really good. Atmosphere is outstandng and its one of the best i have ever seen in a horror game. But now for the cons. The game is incredibly short only an hour to beat. Easy puzzles that dont feel like they should be there. Sometimes frustrating stealth segments. Confusing map layouts and sometimes wonky controls. Overall Among the Sleep is an excellent horror game but it has its fare share of problems. I highly suggest you get this game on a sale and not full priced and dont go in expecting a masterpiece and you should be all good. I give Among the Sleep a 7/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 19, 2014","true","2.9"," 211 of 236 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","211","236","7","11"

Where everything and anything is possible. A world so full of life and colors, danger and adventure, fear and magic. Nothing your plain adult life could bring you close to. A world where you can be the hero of your bedtime story. You begin your adventure at night, the time when we rest after a long day, time where nothing mostly ever happens. But not for a 2 years old!\n\nAmong the Sleep, introduces you to a terrifying experience, which is completely insane and traumatizing on a basic human level. Takes place on a stormy late night, your mother is missing and you're a helpless little infant who sets off on a quest to rescue her. While he faces his fears of being lost in the dark, monsters lurking in the closets and every dark corner, worlds shifting, objects stretching which gives the illusion of hellish presence in the most clever ways I have ever seen, that you begin to imagine things and jump at the slightest noise. A psychological masterpiece.\n\nMany recent horror games, such as Outlast, Amnesia, DreadOut and more, have been aiming to achieve making the player feel helpess in the face of danger or supernatural exsitence, by stripping away any means of fighting back. Which is probably the scariest feeling of all. But I can't imagine what could be more helpless than a little toddler, who can't yet talk and can barely walk, so you're basically forced to cope with your surrounding.\n\nA big thank you to the Devs for releasing an update with new achievements. Being an achievement hunter, I had to replay the game, and it was even more rewarding than my first playthrough. It opened my eyes and made me realize what a special little game it was. It also added a Slenderman feeling into it, only a toddler version.\nThe game runs perfectly smooth, haven't encountered a single problem, still has its amazing visuals and physics and I noticed a greater update in the ambiance and sounds, which creates a much better horror atmposphere.\n\nI strongly believe this game deserves a lot more credit, as it leaves a strong impact on you that a lot of big titles can't do. With its provoking story and innovation to the horror genre, I urge you to try it.\nSuch rich gem is very rare to find!","February 27","true","9.6"," 58 of 60 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","58","60","0","8"

Though it has some issues. Animations at the beginning they just, they look horrible. I'm sorry to say. The achievements are broken I didn't get one of them, and I beat the game.\n\nThe game was good, and I enjoyed the storyline, and it was a completely different take on any horror experience, and it was such a beautiful original idea. But at a $20 price tag, that's a bit much. I waited a year and a half for this game, and though I did enjoy it, that $20 thrown on it, was steep, very steep.\n\nI beat the game, my first playthrough in 103 minutes. $20 for an hour and a half of play, I have to admit, it's not worth every penny.

It tugged at my emotions and I identified somewhat well with the toddler that stars in this game. While my own mother wasn't too similiar to the one in the story, I did closely identify with the kinds of negative problems a problematic parent can bring into your life, especially at a young age. As such I think I identified a bit too closely with the toddler and it actually left me feeling a bit emotionally distressed for awhile. Due to this, I'll issue a minor warning to people that the game addresses some really difficult mother parenthood negatives and how it can effect the child(ren) involved in somehing like that.  This could be very disturbing for some people, especially those who had issues with their female parent.","October 31, 2014","true","3.3"," 69 of 82 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","69","82","6","1"

BUT... what do you say about a game you progress through by murdering mobs of faceless mooks? That game mechanic goes beyond "it's been done" to the point of "why are we still doing this?"\n\nAmong the Sleep is different. Its protagonist is non-gendered skillfully enough that I could easily assume it was a he... but a female player could just as easily assume it was a she, and neither of us would find anything "weird" about that.  And I didn't beat up, much less kill, a single other character in the entire game... even though it was a horror game, and a legitimately scary one.  And even though in the reveal at the end of the game I was presented with more than sufficient reason to harbor ill-will toward the antagonist... the natural progression of the game didn't force me to, but allowed me to /discover/ a touching, compassionate gesture instead.  That, again, felt perfectly natural when it happened.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a horror game, it is a creepy one, and it has some truly scary moments in it. It is captivating, it is not a light casual romp. And yet... it breaks completely free of the "kill mooks to progress" mold without feeling in any way forced. Do yourself a favor: set three to four hours aside and Play. This.

I can't believe I had this game in my library for close to a year and ignored it for all that time. I was so in the mood for shooters or some puzzle games that everything else was pushed to the side. But one day I was in the mood for something where I could traverse at ankle height and defecate myself involuntarily, and, boy, am I glad I found this little gem to scratch that particular itch.\n\nThis is going to be a slightly awkward one to write about because half the fun of the game is not knowing exactly what it is then discovering it as you go along, most of which is best left unsaid. What I can say about it, though, is it's predominantly a psychological horror played through the eyes of a small boy on his second birthday as you crawl your way through stages related to his life in search of his missing mother along with the aid of his tiny teddy bear friend, occasionally toddling around on your hind legs like a wee little Rory Calhoun. It sounds like it could be gimmicky or a million miles away from anything that would typically be relevant to your interests, but believe me, there's so much more beneath that unassuming surface.\n\nBy doing something as small as lowering the player's view to ground level, there's instantly a very fresh and unique feel to the game. Add to that the fact you're playing as a baby trying to navigate an adult world where a simple everyday object now becomes a sizable hurdle, and you've got something even more captivating. But then throw it all inside a horror game and you've got the perfect recipe for something really special. All of that could have been enough by itself, but they took it even further and went to great lengths conveying the world as filtered through the barely developed mind of an infant.\n\nIt's incredibly easy to take for granted, and I never really thought about it myself 'til now, but this game really makes you think about and appreciate what it must be like to inhabit the world as someone who's practically a stranger to it, and how it does that is a stroke of genius, as everything that's unfamiliar becomes alien and terrifying. A crash of lightning feels like an earthquake, or a household appliance could be an evil monster waiting to get us should we disturb it, even words on labels or books are gibberish symbols since we don't understand how to read them. You can even hug your teddy bear at times to make you "feel safe", "safe" in this case being to illuminate the path immediately ahead of you. The way it plays with your perceptions and interpretations of everything around you and feeds you back distortions of the child's own fragmented memories is a master stroke of design and execution that succeeds from the start right through to the increasingly dark end.\n\nThat end won't be too far for most people, maybe between two-and-a-half and three hours of play, and could easily be done in a single sitting (which I'd recommend). And while the length didn't bother me (if anything, it probably would have suffered were it drawn out any longer), the cost certainly would, and had I paid full price I would have been a little irked by it, given that it has little to no replay value beyond that time. But otherwise, I can't praise this highly enough. There's so much more I want to say about it, but unfortunately I can't without spoiling it, and I wouldn't want to rob any player of both the wonder and horror that awaits them here. So turn off the lights, turn up your headphones, and immerse yourself in the marvel that awaits in Among the Sleep.","September 25, 2015","true","8.6"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","36","38","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/250620/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Among the Sleep is a game of perspective and confusion, seen through the eyes of a toddler in a world vastly larger and more terrifying.\n\nIts appeal is largely wrapped in this unusual viewpoint, but it's so novel and well executed that it's a strong enough hook to pivot a game around that if shown any other way would likely fall entirely flat. Seeing the dark and often surreal world around you from barely a few feet off the ground, your awkward steps making a quick escape unlikely as you stumble and fall in an attempt to run from the nightmares that haunt you, is frightening and enthralling. The vulnerability felt through playing as such a small character is immense, and had me scurrying under chairs and attempting to pry open cabinets as my only defense was to hide where the monsters pursuing me wouldn't think to look.\n\nIt's hard to deny that beyond making your way from each twisted environment to the next there's very little interactivity to be found in Among the Sleep, but in most cases this works in the games favor and makes sense given a toddler's limited motor skills. There aren't involved puzzles or elaborate mechanics to deal with, it's simply you and your teddy bear trying to find your mother before the horrors around you find you first, and this simplicity allowed me to fully embody my role in this world that was intentionally beyond my comprehension. Much of the narrative is told nonverbally through the environment, with themes of alcoholism, domestic abuse, and child abandonment dripping out of bits and pieces of the world as they painted an exceptionally bleak picture in an already oppressively eerie game.\n\nAmong the Sleep isn't without its flaws; there are moments when its gameplay becomes too shallow even for how deliberately designed it is to be that way, the voice acting ranges from acceptable to weird, and many of the textures can be shockingly muddy. But what it's trying to be, and in most ways entirely succeeds, is something that will stick with me long after the credits finish and I sit in the dark hoping the child I'd been playing as finds better days to come.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","December 28, 2014","true","3.1"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","34","39","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/250620/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","The simple act of presenting a game through the eyes of a toddler is ingenious. Not too long ago Bioshock 2 gave us a somewhat exaggerated and short taste of what it might be like wondering around madness as a small child. Among the Sleep stumbles a bit in game design, but it does have something new to offer.\n\nThe opening finds you staring through a distorted glass before you drop your cup and your mom comes in to feed you cake. Someone knocks on the door, and as she leaves the room, her raised voice is heard which cues the visuals and sound to intensify until she returns to carry you of to your room. What is being displayed in this sequence is an almost innate pang or irritation that swells up when a parent is upset. Among the Sleep then follows this sequence by setting players firmly into their toddler limbs with quick crib escape in order to introduce the young protagonist to  a cordial, talking teddy bear who attempts to rid the child of fear. It is quite the opening. The child's comforts are made clear through the mother and friend, as are his limitations and abilities with his toys and Brobdingnagian world of everyday objects and furniture. Among the Sleep attempts to carry these motifs throughout the game through various objects and designs from eerie coats and countless doors to the memories of happiness the child must find. While these are nice ideas, there are some hiccups in gameplay that mar the experience a bit.\n\nAmong the Sleep is marketed as a horror game, which means that the surprise is somewhat ruined as people will now be searching for scares. It is also this focus on horror that takes away power from the monsters in the game. Horror is the visceral, the monsters, or Carpenter's The Thing in the flesh; terror is more of what we build up in our minds, the monsters we imagine when the lights flicker or the floorboards creak. Among the Sleep crafts terror expertly with the humming of a TV and the dancing of shadows, but it is the actual sight of the monsters that take away the power they had. This is no slight against the monster's design, because good monsters are hard to make; in general whatever we imagine in our own head will probably be scarier than what an artist can represent. Pushing the player to face a monster that is in fact not as creepy as the atmosphere the game created so well, is a misstep.\n\nThe game's pacing is a bit uneven. The structure of returning to a home and filling it with memories is understandable, if a little heavy handed, but these bits of going to the little home come off as more of a chore. There were also some areas, such as the swamp section, that were easy to get lost in because everything looked the same. Some large areas with lots of climbable objects seemed suspiciously designed to take up more time than necessary. The game's sense of style really seemed to shine when it was recreating the real and only adding in bits of distortion, but most of the game is filled with wildly warped areas that did not appeal to me as much.\n\nTime is also another important issue with Among the Sleep. Standing at only a few hours with the middle area dragging a bit is a rough edge. The game is not that challenging ( though I did have a monster sneak up on a me few times, and I did fall off a bridge more than once which sent me back further than I would have liked) and there is very little interaction or gameplay involved: you crawl around and climb to your heart's content with little consequence and with not much else to do aside from grab key items. The lack of player involvement stacks on with the pacing issue.\n\nAmong the Sleep is not perfect, but it is an interesting game. Some sections should probably have been longer while others could have been trimmed away. The shift in settings might be welcome for some, but I rather liked the hints of imagination at play. Aside from the minor gripes, it is an enjoyable game. There are definitely some elements in Among the Sleep that I hope to see in other games.","September 20, 2015","true","2.5"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","32","37","5","1"

You play as a little 2 year old boy, who can barely walk, whose outlook on life is a lot different to us adults. It’s actually pretty cool being so small and everything around you that in normal situations wouldn’t be a problem, suddenly become a challenge.\n\nThis game is also very surreal, at times I definitely got a “Alice: Madness Returns” feeling from it. You aren’t quite sure what is going on at times and it is never really spelt out for you, so on a certain level, this game is open to interpretation. It has a strong message to it, but the way that it was done and the details about the game make you wonder.\n\nThe level design was quite creative, the general mechanics are all the same for how the baby gets around, but each level had a different thing going on. It wasn’t too repetitive and of course that works in its favour.\n\nHorror wise, someone that suffers with anxiety problems like myself would definitely get a little worked up playing this. The ambient sounds and noises are definitely enough to rustle those jimmies and it definitely caught me out a few times making me jump. But like I mentioned before, I don’t exactly play many horror games so I wouldn’t know what those Horror veterans strive for. Compared to other games maybe this isn’t scariest game of the year, but it is definitely creepy.\n\nI think the only thing about this game people might not be so happy about would be its length. I personally don’t mind short games, I have a short attention span and I think as long as the game has core strengths to it, I’m happy with it being short and sweet. But other people maybe not so much. It took me 3 hours to finish the game (and start a new one to go back for 1 achievement) but it definitely felt shorter.\n\nTL;DR : All in all, this game has an interesting story, great atmosphere and the tiny-man’s perception is new and refreshing for any game let alone horrors. Only fault being it was pretty short (for most people, I would assume).\n\n","June 28, 2014","true","4.8"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","3"

The game is extremely short (as of writing this, I have beaten the game, but not even played it long enough for a single card drop), and fairly predictable.  Plus, there was no real sense of urgency.  It wasn't even until near the very end of the game that I even knew you could get a game over.  The atmosphere is more nonsensical than spooky.  And the concept of playing as a toddler is lost rather quickly when you're solving puzzles, rather than picking up the toy plane and shoving it in your mouth.\n\nThe underlying idea, of trying to piece together what could be a rather mundane occurrence, as seen through the warp of a child that does not understand what's going on, is a highly interesting one.  The execution here doesn't quite pull it off.\n\nIt doesn't do a terrible job of it, and there's plenty for people to like.  I'm just not one of those people.\n\nOn a more technical side, the game qualifies for an "auto fail" for me in that I cannot change the movement controls to arrows.  Fortunately, I was able to play the game with an Xbox 360 controller, but being left handed, I cannot use a standard WASD setup.  Nor can anyone with a different keyboard layout.  Preventing us from rebinding movement controls in game is something that no PC game should do.","August 1, 2015","false","2.8"," 88 of 132 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","88","132","9","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ergodemise/recommended/250620/","Ergodemise","Ergo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ergodemise/","723 products in account","I really dislike horror games. They tend to have a very weak or pointless story (if they even bother to have a story at all) and the settings in which they take place are pretty over done (stone castle/old mansion or science lab/hospital). Then there are monsters like "unknown killer monster x" which have very little reason to exist in the game's world other than to walk around and make you hide. Then there are stupid level design choices and puzzles that don't really work or are far to complicated when your character can just use that freaking axe its carrying and break a damn window to get out. But enough about annoying horror tropes, lets talk about Among The Sleep.\n\nThis is one of the best horror games I've played. Its not something I say ever find easy to say since I dislike horror games in general but Among The Sleep is just that good. The art and level design of the game really stands out overall. Twisted but familiar the levels of the game never feel like they are repeating and the developers took great care in crafting each and every part of them. It was fun just exploring the levels (like a child) just to see what little bits they had hidden around.\nThe puzzles aren't hard at all and or pretty much "Find item X to open door" but the search for the key never feels tedious or repetitive since there is always new places to explore. I often ended up finding a key to a door before finding the door due to me having fun wandering around.\n\nThe monsters feels very much like part of the world. It is familiar but also very twisted. Throughout the game you start to discover what the creatures are but that doesn't make it less scary and only enroots it to the world the developers have made.\n\nThe game is about 3 hours long, shorter if you just run around as fast as you can without taking the time to look around but its a great 3 hours. This game does not need to be 12 or 20 hours long since there is barely any back tracking or filler content trying to push that gameplay timer just a bit further. During those 3 hours though you get a strong sense that they kept everything that worked well and weren't afraid to remove what wasn't working. This is a quality game that deserves to be in everyone's library even for people like me who are not fans of horror.","October 11, 2014","true","4.2"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","32","38","2","1"

Capcom pumps out action titles, calls them Resident Evil and somehow they get classified as survival horror. I miss the classic survival horror titles like Silent Hill and Eternal Darkness. There was hope of a revitalization with Kojima’s P.T. but that ended before it could even get started. Enter Among the Sleep from Killbrite Studio and after a few trailers I thought this could finally be the survival horror return I’ve been waiting for. Does Among the Sleep deliver, and is it truly survival horror?\n\nAmong the Sleep takes you through a trippy adventure told through the eyes of a two year old as he tries to find his mother, preventing you from achieving this is a shadow like individual (very similar to Slender Man). Not only that but you have a companion talking stuffed teddy bear (named Teddy for obvious reasons). How could this not be a survival horror title?\n\nLike I said earlier, Among the Sleep is told through the eyes of a toddler and I mean that literally. This is a first person toddler title and through your adventure you will crawl, climb and kinda run. While also picking up objects such as drawings and other children’s toys along the way. Among the Sleep is not a very long game; clocking in around 3 hours. I really don’t want to dive into the stages involved in the game for spoiler purposes. I will say you get to explore the child’s house rather early in the game and this is where the game starts you down the rabbit hole on its eerie nightmarish adventure.\n\nBasic controls involve; crawling, grabbing items (holding items has them float in air which reminds me of Half-Life) and hugging Teddy to lighten up areas as well as calm the toddler down. Controls and gameplay are very basic and honestly that's not what’s important about Among the Sleep. The atmosphere and musical score is what I was looking forward to most, and in my opinion it is the most crucial part of any survival horror title. So I’m happy to report that while the game is very short, the environments and mood throughout really enhanced the storytelling experience. Playing Among the Sleep with the lights off will deliver more creeps and scares than Capcom has been able to deliver with any Resident Evil title for the past 10 years.\n\nAmong the Sleep is a baby step (see what I did there) in the right direction when it comes to the survival horror genre. It’s an original concept and a very unique experience. Not to sound like a broken record, but Among the Sleep feels like it’s over just as it’s getting into its groove and that’s really my only major complaint. Hopefully this isn’t Killbrite Studio’s only entry into the survival horror genre because I would love to see what else they could pull off with a longer story and bigger budget.","May 14","true","4.0"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","20","21","3","0"

Closest things are the Master Reboot and F.E.A.R. series. Scariest experience was the hotel in VtM:R: Bloodlines. So I am rating this game from this point of view. If you are a seasoned spookymans player then this could be a boring baby simulator for all I know.\n\nIn this game you play as a toddler accompanied by a talking bear (who doesn't turn out to be a pawn of Satan as I predicted the moment I met him) and you'll have to achieve your goal by going through a world too big for you.\n\nGameplay itself is mostly walking, climbing on stuff and some very simple puzzles. You can walk upright and sprint like that for short distances, or you can baby-crawl. Instead of a flashlight you hug your bear.\n\nThe 'horror' is mostly achieved with atmosphere and ~spooky~ stuff happening, there are no screamers or monsters rushing at you. The (for me) scariest part was just at the beginning and I'm sure there is not even a 'monster' in that part.\n\nSpeaking of monsters, there are two that I saw (plus one in the Prologue), and many that I imagined. I can't really describe them as I didn't want to look at them, and only took better glimpses from a distance. Hiding from them is easy and I don't know what happens if you're caught as I avoided it. But I think that 'being easy' is a very good thing in a horror game, as imagining what would happen to you is scarier than being torn apart or eaten or whatever a monster would do to you. And when the scary goblin rips you apart for the fifth time, there's not even a shred of horror left.\n\nThe story is quite predictable (judging from me, a dumbass, figuring it out) and in the end you will be beaten to the head with it, in case you didn't get it. But the matter is handled quite well I'd say.\n\nGraphically the game is good, considering it's an indie kickstarted game. Some sceneries are even stunning.\n\nThe free DLC Prologue is quite cool also, although I had a problem with the monster being stuck in front of my hiding place so I had to retry from last save point, which wasn't a setback at all, honestly.\n\nNote that the game is very short, even with the free DLC you can finish it in around 2,5 hours.\n\n\n1 solid spooky golden sloth.","June 30, 2015","true","5.7"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","24","28","10","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/250620/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Among the Sleep is a first-person horror game where you play as a Toddler. The game is a bit more of an experience game, or if you will, a 'Crawling Simulator', though there are a few physics-based puzzles, and a few occasional sections where you get stalked by a monster.\n\nIt's your second birthday, and your mom has given you a teddy bear for this special occasion. However, when left on your own in your playpen, the bear begins to move and talk on its own devices. Soon it tells you it wants to show you something, but you need to be in the dark...\n\nAs a toddler, you can crawl, walk, and run a bit (though running for a while will make you trip). Crawling is faster than walking, and you can fit under tight spaces, but walking let's you see more and interact with higher-things. There are a variety of objects to interact with and pick-up in your environment, and the physics of objects are all pretty well handled. You can also climb up onto objects that are waist-high for you.\n\nWith these mechanics, you are let off to explore and interact with things to progress. The first half of the game is more of a straight-up 'Crawling Simulator' type of game, as while there are some small puzzles and some good atmosphere, nothing really comes to hunt you... That is, until the second half of the game.\n\nSound design is top-notch. The music is appropriately odd and somewhat mystical, but what really needs to be mentioned is environment sounds. As a 2-year old, the world is still a foreign and strange place, and sounds we as adults find familiar take on strange properties through the imagination  of a child. The sound design is legitimately unnerving and creepy, and is honestly one of the first horror games in a long while that I've been this impressed with how it handled its sound design. It leans perfectly on the thin line between the familiar and the strange and terrifying.\n\nGraphics and art direction also deserve mention. The game looks good, with a sort of unique creepy cartoony-fantasy look that really fits the tone of the game. The art direction is also extremely well handled, especially in the later locations, and contain a lot of imagination and visual imagery that is easy to stick with you. The game gets more surreal as it goes on, and gets more twisted, and the imaginative art direction makes quite a few visual splendors to behold.\n\nScariness is subjective, but while the game could of maybe been scarier with a few more tricks, I would say it did manage to unnerve me, surprise me, and tense me up on a few occasions. The sound design made me not want to continue every now and again, and the few encounters with monsters were appropriately tense and scary.\n\nBut the monster encounters are very few, which is both in my eyes a good thing and a bad thing. On one hand, the two different monsters the game has never became overly familiar due to how infrequent they were, and both managed to really tense things-up whenever they did appear, and provided interesting challenges and context to situations. But on the other hand, there were many sections, especially in the middle part of the game, where I felt a little too safe.\n\nThe game maybe could of dared to be a little scarier and explore a few of the possibilities it raises with it's fantastic atmosphere and a few implied danger scenarios that don't actually lead into anything, but arguably its infrequent quality is what helps the game stay tense.\n\nThe story was interesting, while not entirely too surprising, I would say that it was handled rather well. Some nice use of symbolism throughout.\n\nBut it's one flaw is that it's rather short, being about 2-4 hours long. Those two to four hours are rather well-done, but it did leave me wanting more at it's conclusion, and some may not want to pay $20 for a 2-4 hour experience.\n\nBut Among the Sleep is a good little horror game that will likely stick with you some after completing it. It doesn't rely overly on jump scares, and unnerves with atmosphere, fantastic sound design, strange moments, and a few infrequent monster encounters. It's short and sweet, and will likely be appreciated by fans of 'Walking Simulator Experience' type of games with a little more gameplay, and horror fan who especially appreciate atmosphere.","June 5, 2014","true","4.3"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","1"

I know for sure I can't think of one...\n\nWith that said, I found that the audio queues seemed a little too loud, I could here the monster coming from a mile away, the Teddy seemed a little useless to me and only seemed to fit a narrative point of view, voice acting was really good and did not get old and tiresome, the start however seemed to drag a little, especially with the Teddy asking what everything is, he seemed to just stop his dialogue and wait a few seconds before proceeding to talk.\n\nNow with above all taken care of, how are the main mechanics of the game?, they are solid and work really well, you really get the feeling that you are a scared and defenseless Toddler, you clumsely walk through the terrain like a Toddler would and if you run for too long, he loses breath and falls over, the scenery is beautiful, even when it's dark Among The Sleep still manage to make it look stunning, the atmosphere is creepy, with doors creeking, glasses breaking, footsteps lightly walking behind you and the mothers voice in the background all seem to add it's own sense of creepyness, the Monsters scream is terrifying when you least expect it and it has it's quiet points to add to the tension of if and when the monster apears to devour your innocent 2 year old soul, I was scared of every inch of the game, though it may not be the scariest of horrors, but it's the only one that kept me on the edge of my seat right through, you get the feeling of accomplishment, only to realize that you still have to get back and place the piece and continue onwards, however the monster is predictable but not in a way that ruins the experience, I personally don't think the monster is the main experience, the universe is stunning, it's like a gothic picture that has come to life, it's frighteningly beautiful and atmospherically superb.\n\nNow you may ask,\n\n"Is it worth $19.99/£14.99?"\n\nYes it is, it's a stunning piece of artwork and the devs have truly done a great job with Among The Sleep and it has great potential to further what it already has acheived, with atmospherically stunning visuals and great progression, you are never left thinking that you have seen this before, buy it and see for yourself, I guarentee that you won't be dissapointed at all.\n\nI would personally rate this 9 out 10, there is a few issues here and there, but none that I have found to be game breaking or none that take away from the immersion that Among The Sleep gives you.\n\nI hope this has helped you to choose whether or not this game is worth your time and money and I can't wait to see what Krillbite have to offer in their bright looking future.\n\nFor more reviews follow our Curator Page","May 29, 2014","true","2.4"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","29","41","0","2"

The game starts with an opening scene where you celebrate your second birthday. Your mum feeds you some cake before taking you upstairs with a birthday present delivered by someone who your mother does not invite in (maybe the father). The gift turns out to be a teddy bear, which comes to life and acts as your guide throughout the game. Shortly after you are off to bed, you wake up in the middle of the night to your cot being dragged across the room before tumbling over. After some wondering you realize that your Mummy is not in her bed and you set off on an adventure of sorts to find her again. It is clear that you are in a dream world but the further you go into the game, the darker it becomes.\nThe control system is good. You have two main modes of getting around, walking and crawling. Crawling is faster, but you ca not carry anything or hug your teddy (he gives you light when you do so). While walking you are slower but from the standing position you can climb up onto furniture and boxes. In fact all the animations throughout the game are good. A cool little feature is when you pause the game, the child brings his hands up to cover his eyes.\nThe graphics are good so far, could be a few more details but nothing big to complain.\nSound plays a huge part in the game. Teddy will talk to you sometimes to help guide you through the story but usually you are listening to the sound of your mum humming a lullaby with you trying to head towards the source. Also you can hear some eerie music, creaky doors or floorboards or other objects moving or falling.\nThe game itself is too short. I finished it within 109 minutes.\nAmong the Sleep is not scary at all but it has a great atmosphere. The ending of the game is pretty shocking. I will not tell you anything, you have to play and see it by yourself.\nI can recommend Among the Sleep but you should wait for a discount, 19,99€ is a bit too much for only around 110 minutes of gaming.\n\nSounds 9/10\nGraphics 8/10\nGameplay 7/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","July 14, 2014","true","2.3"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/250620/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Among the Sleep is a cleverly written survival horror game developed by Norwegians. It is a unique little game in the sense that the protagonist is a two-year-old little boy who's aided by his Teddy bear in order to go through various horrors that are lurking in their house.\n\nThe story begins with a birthday celebration that reveals Teddy to be the gift. However, he is taken from the boy and in chapter 1 we need to retrieve him quickly only to realise that the real protection from the dark can only be offered by mom. The journey then continues to find mom and along the way we encounter some monsters and cleverly thought out puzzles.\n\nThe game has a great atmosphere and for full immersion a headset is required - similarly to the Amnesia games. The Unity engine does its job properly and the visuals look great. The only downside is the game's short story: it can be completed in a mere 2 hours including its DLC content which is a kind of prologue and is meant to be played after the story is done.\n\nOverall, Among the Sleep is a good game that I can recommend mainly to the fans of the genre. Hopefully, the guys at Krillbite Studios will develop a - much longer - sequel or another game with similar level of quality.\n\nUPDATE: The latest update (version number 2) introduces some new achievements (all related to collectibles) along with some nice graphics enhancements thanks to the new version of the Unity engine.","June 20, 2015","true","7.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","2"

But even then I feared that this game will be too short, which happens sadly often today. And this is the main defect of the game, for me maybe the only one. I literally crawled in fear and sometimes ran till I fell down (literally, again - remember that you're just a little boy - if you will run too long, your character will simply fell down). I listened to the weird sounds surrounding me and wandered through dream-like locations. I was scared to death.

You think you are tough? Then why not test your limits as a 2 year old toddler who is completely defenseless against every odd. The creepy voices, sounds will make your toddler scared as hell. In search of his mommy he will surely come across some pretty scary stuff for a mind of a two year old.\n\nPrice tag may bit up for a short game like this. And yes it is short. Some may say it's a wanna-be amnesia clone. But isn't most games are clones of past games? Hasn't any modern game took the formula of Quake? Delta Force? Soldier of Fortune? So yes it might look like amnesia, but took on a complete different path. 2 year old character animations are also in remarkable state. You run for few miniutes and you fall, You wanna get away from scary stuff, close your eyes with your hands, mumble when scared is some of them.\n\nSo don't buy this if you wanna complain about your money and being short or just wanna complain about being a clone. Enjoy it, as it is. I looked very forward when buying this on steam, so even up voted during the greenlight. So if you really wanna some piece of art, something different than running, killing or probably hacking or solving your own murder.

I am not a big horror fan, but I felt that the take these guys were taking on it was cool and intriguing. I give this game a lot of credit for the art and the atmosphere! The story is okay, but very sad, and it's tough to play as a baby/toddler.\n\nIt might just be me, but I work at an elementary school and deal with kids very often, so my heart goes out to them and hope they succeed in their search for what they're after. I never want to be responsible for a two year old drowning to death. I was personally extremely put off by the ability to die in such a gruesome way. I was also reminded of the reveal of the aliens in Signs when I first saw the "Mysterious Character". I was much more scared when dealing with something that allowed my mind to search for what it could possibly be, once I saw it, it kind of made it more tangible and easier to deal with.\n\nThe sound development was awesome!\n\nI also agree with some of the other reviews in terms of the price, it's the same price as Rust. Rust's replayability is practically infinite, any linear story is a tough $20 price tag these days, let alone an hour and a half one. I see how much you guys put into it, and it definitely shows! But I wish you decided to sell it for less, with the hopes of more people being able to experience it with less worry about getting the time out of their money.\n\nOverall, I think as an indie game, this is up there with Gone Home in my list of favorites in the last couple years.

Their first being The Plan, which was a 'preview' of their first shot at developing with the Unity engine... and quite frankly changed my view of what defines a good game in a matter of 2 minutes time.\n\nIt seems that this small group of developers has a knack of thinking outside of the box. Again using the Unity engine, Among the Sleep puts you in the unique position of viewing the world through the eyes of a two year old. Never before has a lovable protagonist been so helpless. Using this gameplay method in a horror game is a stroke of genious, since you have no way of defending yourself against unknown evils. It really adds to the feeling of helplessness. Periodic jumpscares plus extraordinary psychologically tense background noise creates an unnerving edge-of-your seat venture.\n\nThis game is not without its flaws. Glitches abound, and the the monotone surroundings feel clausterphobic at times.

This has always annoyed me slightly as you feel forced into being vulnerable even though in real life the chances are you would find a weapon to defend yourself. In this game however, you play a 2 year old toddler so it makes sense to not give you weapons etc and it makes a nice change to know that in real life a toddler probably wouldn't be able to defend itself very well.\n\nEven though I'm yet to complete the game I'm already in love with it and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh take on the horror genre.","May 29, 2014","true","4.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I feel pretty confident in opining, however, that if you like the sound of this game's basic premise - in short, Amnesia-style horror from the perspective of a two-year old toddler - this isn't liable to disappoint.  Unless you're one of the "this game it too short" brigade, in which case you probably should have learned not to buy these sorta games by now, especially at or near full-price.\n\nIt's slow to build, and a LOOOOONG time before you encounter any true "danger" within the game, but when that moment comes in which you realise that, yes, the spooky creatures you've been safely spotting from afar ARE actually interested in moving in for a closer look, it's every bit as legitimately pants-browning as the best horror games you've ever played.  What's more, the "child-like" perspective, while not fully reinventing the wheel, does put quite a different spin on well-worn first-person adventure gaming themes; for example, where other games would require your character to push a crate up against a wall in order to access a high vent, in this one your toddler has to pull a kitchen chair up just to reach a regular-height surburban door handle!  Everything feels quite dauntingly HUGE to our diminutive hero, making it feel not unlike Alice trapped in a nightmare Wonderland (one in which she never managed to find the antidote to the shrinking potion)!\n\nIt's super-spooky, super-imaginative, has amazingly atmospheric sound design, and your best friend/sole ally is a talking teddy-bear!  So what are you waiting for?  Unless the answer is "a better computer", you really don't have any excuse...unless you're a complete wuss, of course.  C'mon, are you really so much of a wuss that you're not willing to brave the same horrors as a TWO YEAR-OLD KID?!

Somewhere among the sleep is me, half awake and bufuddled.  The barely awake dad who has to see what is terrifying my 2 year old at 3AM.  Those dark hallways with toys everywhere, been there. *You* try walking through that minefield of balls, dolls, and wooden blocks.  But I've seen the terror in thier eyes, tears falling and crying out frantically for someone to make them feel safe again.  And in no other game has it ever been recreated with such clarity.\n\nIn this game you are two years old again.  Toddling long.  Crawling is faster.  Exploring the hidden world that always seems foreboding.  Mundane objects take on a menacing appearance, unknown sounds all the more spine chilling.  And also in this game, there is a tone of something else.  Alcohol bottles strewn across the floor.  Refridgerator doors left wide open.  In the world of Among the Sleep you must traverse the completely believeable household universe of two year old terror.\n\nGameplay is mostly interacting with objects, some simple puzzles.  You travel through some toddler nightmare lands collecting items to fit in a slot, or solving a way to smash open a toy chest.  Then a bit of cat and mouse chases with a monster that looms nearby, searching for you.  Seeking you out all the time.\n\nVisually, it's quite well done and a lot of attention to game detail with shadow and specific uses of color.  I played with both a KB&M and Controller, both work very well.  No in game crashes for me and I never got stuck on geometry or bugs.\n\nI have to add, that although this is a horror game, you are limited the horror of a two year old.  It's not a gorefest of a demon infested graveyard waiting for you, it's a  playground with ledges and hiding holes, spooky libraries, or being chased in a coat closet.  These are familiar areas to most of us and it may or may not frighten you.  I would say for those who cannot endure most horror games, this is substanially less anxiety causing.  Perhaps with some, it may hit a few heartstrings which you will discover later towards the end.\n\nThe game is a story more than anything.  Not a visual novel or a game with lots of in-game dialogue, but a storytelling nonetheless.  And at the end, you'll see what the true terror is that plagues our little character.  The full game is a little short. After I was done I played the DLC which is also short where you save your plush toys from the cold, but a little scarier than the main game.  Among the sleep is a good game, a gamble really in this age of horror games.  And it's well done.   At $20 I personally think that it's pricey.  I got this in a bundle, though, and think it was money well spent.\n\nForgot to add - in the kitchen I spent a good bit of time destroying everything I could get my little hands on.  Wreaking the dishes and lobbing a coffee maker off the counter was bliss. Destruco-Toddler skill points +10.

First, we were promised that the game would last up to 3 hours. I finished it in 90 minutes. In the end I can't blame no one but myself. If a developer says it's this big, it's usually a couple of hours shorter. My bad. Second, we were told this would be a horror game, but it didn't scare me for one second, even if some of the chases creeped me out.\nSo there's that, and the fact that there isn't much exploration to do, and if you do find things that pique your interest they usually can't be interacted with.\n\nBut, there are some good things to say about the game. The textures, for example, are sharp and the graphics are, at times, colorful, Something you don't see very often in horror games. The voice acting is also pretty good and the way that you see things through the eyes of a 2 year old is different (it has a bit of a fisheye effect) and well done. Pressing escape is also a cute way to bring up the menu. And running for too long will make you fall on your hands and feet. Small little details that I can always appreciate, no matter if the game is good or bad. The story is actually pretty good, too. Good, but predictable.\n\nBut... I just can't recommend this. I would absolutely recommend this if it cost €10 or less, but asking twice as much is outrageous for a game that can be finished in one sitting. To be honest... I feel a bit ripped off. And that's not a feeling that I have very often. So my advice would to be to wait for a sale.

Even with the free DLC extra chapter, its short... like under 4 hours short. There is not a ton of replay value unless you get drawn into the story and want to go back to see little meta-clues and child-drawings you missed. The couple of graphical glitches, overlapping lighting through doors, odd seeing through objects at odd angles... not bad honestly, and definitely not game-breaking.\n\nThe good: this is a rather well told dark story, and seeing it explored through the body of a 2-yr old child is a very unique approach to telling it. Your adult-brain logic being used to guide the character through the puzzles and tale aside, they've done quite a good job of making you feel like you're interacting through a toddler. As a small child you are clumsy, slow, very poorly armed and armored against the shadows that crawl along the walls and roar out through the dark... your only defense is to hide and find comfort in the warmth in your teddybear guide and traveling companion.\n\nThere are a few jumpscares, but absolutely no gore... this game uses nothing but unease, shadows and noises, the surreality of childhood nightmares and exagerations, and the inherent helplessness of your character as the basis for it's horror. A significant part of the entire storyline involves some well written emotional manipulation; if you play these kinds of games in any sort of emersive mind-set (or you're just kinda over-emotional like I can be), you will get a far greater experience from this game. You'll be motivated to help the child through this journey, feel afraid of the creepiness of this world, and seeing the tale through the end will feel rather moving in bad and good ways... potentially triggery ways, depending on your own childhood...\n\nIf you don't do emersive gaming, if you dont allow yourself to play these kinds of games as if you were nervous about the surroundings, if you just plow through these kinds of hide-from-the-monster horror games... this will be a short game with not much meat on it, and you will likely feel more dissapointed than profound.\n\nRecommended to purchase on sale. Despite the effort and atmosphere that obviously went into the game, the full price of $20 is just a little bit steep for the length.","February 3, 2015","true","6.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Lacking in the terms of scares, most of all. I’m all for a slow buildup until things really start to become chaotic and terrifying, but some of the game’s best moments occur in the last half hour. The ending of the game is worth giving some notable praise, though, as I did not see it coming and it’s pretty effective in its message.\n\nAll in all, Among the Sleep is a tad disappointing but far from mediocre. It also shows a lot of promise on the part of Krillbite Studios and their talented staff.

It's not the typical horror game considering you're playing a toddler, which gives it a nice little twist. I loved the story, and the ending scene was fantastic.. it wasn't what I was expecting! This whole game was brilliantly made and a lot of thought went in to it. The game's "scary-ness" definitely increased the farther you got into the game.\n\nTo give you an idea of what you do in the game, you explore areas trying to uncover the secrets of what happened to the toddler's mom. You explore different "zones", and your objective is to basically collect pieces of the puzzle (items) while hiding from monsters.\n\nHowever, the game itself is very short. I finished the whole game in maybe 4 hours, and that was me taking my time. I also think it's overpriced ($15) considering how short it is.

The "story," foreshadowing, unique gameplay, atmosphere and clever level design are all presented well in this game.  The only downside is the length, even though it feels appropriate given the lack of gameplay mechanics the  devs had to work with.\n\nThe cleverness to the scare tactics was genius.  Just like when I was a kid, it was the unknown that scared me the most.  So much of this game works on the player's imagination instead of cheap jump-scares.  In a lot of horror games, it is common to start predicting the scary section which can often soften the blow.  Not in this game.  The ambiance is done  well enough that the anticipation of a predictable scare actually makes it worse.  Kind of like being in a dream and knowing that it's going bad.\n\nThey did such a good job with the sound effects.  The bumps, creaks, groans, smashes, screams and cries all drive the unsettled nerves home.\n\nThe devs also did an excellent job making you feel as helpless as a two year old child.  The toddler can crawl faster than walk, he will fall over if he sprints for more than a short distance, his light source is a teddy-bear that lights up when hugged, water is a nono, everything seems much larger and daunting, he can't reach doorknobs without something to climb on, and his lack of fine motor skills makes the clunkyness of "click and hold" mouse interactions feel right.\n\nThe foreshadowing is great.  A lot of the clues you get to the story are in the environment or depicted as a two-year-old's scribbled drawing.\n\nThough the  length is short but feels accurate for the game, it is hard to say that a 3-4 hour game with little to no replay value  should be $20.  The reason why I say that it has  no replay value is the fact that the game relies so heavily on the unknown and the imagination for the fear to work, that there will be nothing worth seeing again given that the gameplay is a little "slow"\n\nIf you really like horror games,  you probably already own this game, but if you don't, then you need to go get it.  It's worth the full price if you are a fan of the genre; otherwise, wait for a sale, but be sure to grab it when the price drops.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=528707572","October 2, 2015","true","11.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The hook is you play as a toddler, embarking through a dream/nightmare world to find your missing mother.  The dev did a nice job with the toddler aspect.  For example you crawl faster than you walk, your companion is a teddy bear, and everything that looks interesting is maddeningly out of reach.  The puzzles are simple fetch quests, but they too are filled with things from the world of a 2 year old that make them endurable even though it’s a bit boring at times.  You will play shape fit games, search for jigsaw pieces, explore through playground equipment and perform many other tot friendly activities as you make your way through the adventure till the surprising ending.  While the toddler elements make Among the Sleep interesting and worth playing, the gameplay is little more than a walking errr make that crawling simulator without any real scares.  You will occasionally avoid the "Fear" that is chasing you, mostly by hiding, which can be creative at times, but other than that it’s a linear and simple affair.  More creepy than scary, a decent play when you have a few hours to kill one dark evening and want to try a different spin on a "horror" game.

I wish there was a more dynamic grading scale than yes/no.\n\nThat being said, my biggest complaint is that this game essentially puts all of its eggs in one basket. The one point in which this game really excels is its visual effects. This game does an amazing job of not only providing a creepy horror environment, but it also really gives you a feeling of how an imaginative child may picture the world around him. Especially a child with a morbid imagination. It may not be as perturbing as Silent Hill's blood, rust and isolating fog, but the abyss surrounding the playground and the overgrown nature of the library really helps give the player a feeling of uncertainty and vulnerability. In other games the abyss would be viewed as "I guess they put an invisible wall there, 'cause the objective's over that way." but this game is in a unique position to utilize the idea of object permanence; even if the comparison wasn't intentional.\n\nUnfortunately, while I could feasibly recommend playing the game simply for the visual experience, the gameplay and storyline are not on the same level of expertise. The gameplay is not really challenging at all. There's no real danger of being seen or anything just as long as you crawl under something. Even if it's a doorway or a table almost as tall as the monster pursuing the player. I had plenty of times where I was standing in a cupboard, inches away from a pursuing monster who, simply, stood in the doorway until he just...disappeared. As immersive as the environment was, it almost got less interesting once the monsters started showing up...\nAs far as the plot is concerned, the whole game pretty much all builds up to the opening of the sealed portal at the end of the game. There's no real plot advancement outside of progressing from one level to the next until right before the door is opened and the (plot twist?) ending is revealed. It...felt like it was SUPPOSED to be a plot twist, but with the child's drawings littering each level it's not too hard to figure out exactly what's happening. [I'll omit mention of the less obvious hints mentioned in later levels for potential spoiler reasons...although idk if it's worth not spoiling given how telegraphed the ending was.]\n\nOverall, my main reason for down voting this game comes down to the price. If it wasn't $20, I would still recommend a purchase for the sake of getting to immerse yourself in the environment (if you're the type of person who can appreciate that stuff). $5 is definitely a reasonable price for this game, but given the lackluster story and...(I apologise in advance) gameplay that will count you AMONG THE SLEEP (ha HAAAAA! Zing!) I'd have to admit that most people would probably find purchasing this game for $20 to be rather disappointing.","June 3, 2014","false","5.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Maybe 'the ending before the beginning' is a bit sad...\nEDIT2: the giant update with for example 6 new achievements: most of the drawings could be found well enough, searching carefully and for an extended amount of time, but in 1 chapter (I won't mention it), they were hard to find.

Sure, it borrows heavily off games like Amnesia, but making the protagonist a toddler is definitely new territory. It's not particularly challenging except when it comes to avoiding enemies in certain areas. Also, the vantage point of crawling can make things confusing in dark areas and sometimes seems unclear about what direction to go in. Luckily, most of the levels are not too big.

Takes camera away from you a lot so motion sickness can be an issue. Worth the play if you want something a little different from typical horrors.\n*Note as a motion sickness gamer I will keep trying to play this game because I do like it.*\nP.S : this game made sure I looked suspicious  to my teddy\n\nPros\n\nGood voice acting\nGood atmosphere and sounds\nBright, contrasting environments for your main character, the sort of colours you expect to see in a small child's room\n\nCons\n\nIf you have video game motion sickness, don't play this\n\nGameplay\nThis game focuses on a toddler's view of the world, and how their active imagination distorts things and makes things more unsettling. You start off looking into the bottom of a glass, except the effect is confusing - just like how a toddler must feel when interacting with so many new objects and unfamiliar environments. The music in the background and the mother's crooning voice makes the game unnerving for something that everyone does to their children.\n\nThe screen sometimes shakes and despite the normal settings of the game, ordinary things are made more nightmarish by your baby's first person viewpoint and way of looking at the world. Almost everything can have a sinister undertone to it.\n\nWhen you have full control of the baby you prefer to crawl around for speed rather than walk, and you interact with the objects and environment around you. And the teddy bear.\n\nThe voice acting is quite good, the speakers to your baby all use that special voice  reserved for small children or cute animals.  You're not sure if your teddy bear is evil or not. He makes you hide in a dark closet, and you have to hug the teddy to “light” up the area, and make it less scary. Except it doesn't work out like that. The voice acting and noises help to make a perfectly normal environment scarier than it should be, as if your character is isolated and alone in their world. And mother is a potential enemy. And teddy is either your last resort or your worst friend.\n\nI like the fact this game really plays on the feeling of a kid's active imagination. Monsters in the dark, sounds you don't recognise, everything being exaggerated out of proportion.\nI struggled to keep playing this game though I liked it. It's not a good game for those who suffer from video game motion sickness.\n\n\nLiked this review and want to read more of my reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/250620/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Among the Sleep is a First Person horror/puzzle game in where we play as a toddler trying to find his mother in a dark and twisted world. We start off in our birthday party, eat some cake with our mom and are given a terrifying teddy bear as a gift. The bear teaches us the basics of the game such as picking stuff up and climbing but you may be half expecting it to murder you at any given moment. Surprisingly that creepy as sin stuffed bear turns out to be your best friend throughout this ordeal and doubles as a flashlight whenever you hug it. The voice actor that plays the teddy bear has a very calm and soothing voice which ironically enough adds to the creepiness of it.\n\nEverything is all well and normal until you go to sleep and have your crib flipped over by an invisible entity. From there on out the world turns pretty twisted and has no sense of coherency sort of like a dream as the ways the areas connect to each other make no sense. Not much will make sense actually as the story is quite cryptic and you will have to piece it together yourself. As strange as the world is the level design is linear and well thought out so you should never find yourself lost. Most of the story is also told through the environment so there is a reason to pay attention to your surroundings other than the possibility of death.\n\nA large portion of your time will be solving very simple puzzles to be able to progress to the next area but there are a few stealth sections where you must hide and avoid monsters. These are definitely the low points of the game as it can be hard to indicate when the monster is near until you catch a glimpse but by then you will be killed. They just hold you up in the air and show a game over screen so don't expect violent baby executions buying this. Another problem with having to avoid the monsters is that your fat baby legs are nowhere near agile enough to move to cover quickly. As mentioned before these sections are few and far between so it doesn't really have much of an impact to the experience.\n\nWhen you are standing you will be able to run shortly before falling down and reverting back to your crawling stance. Crawling allows you to fit into tiny locations and is much faster than walking but you are unable to hug the teddy bear for light and since you can also run when standing there is little reason to crawl. You can also climb on objects to reach places. An example being pulling up a chair and climbing it to reach a door knob. You can also pick up objects and throw them but throwing doesn't really become a factor until much later on. The baby is surprisingly strong considering how hard he throws objects and is able to move chairs without a problem.\n\nI'd imagine you are not considering purchasing this game for the cool physics or the puzzles but for the horror. Among the Sleep pulls it off pretty well and being a toddler really helps as everything in the world seems big and scary. This isn't really the kind of game that will throw jump-scares at you around every corner. Jump-scares are rare for the most part and the game instead relies heavily on subtle psychological horror such as dimly lit rooms, objects falling and distant noises. One thing that I found separated it from most horror games is the lack of blood, gore or violence. It is definitely a breath of fresh air and shows you can make an unnerving experience without resorting to gross out tactics.\n\nThe audio in Among the Sleep really amplifies the horror. It does a very good job at making you paranoid through use of sudden thumps, braking glass and just tense ambient music. Without such good sound effects and ambiance the game would have been much less effective at horror. Environments are unique and have the advantage of really making you feel like a small defenseless toddler in a over-sized world. Graphics are pretty good as well and I found it impressive how environments went from breathtaking to horrifying in some areas. Levels don't actually interconnect in any real way other than you sliding down a rusty pipe into a new location but it does end up adding to the surreal nature of it all.\n\nOverall this is a pretty good horror title. It does lack in gameplay and the puzzles are so easy that they will not offer any challenge and may feel like they are there just to give you something to do. Though considering the game is only two hours you will likely finish the game before boredom or repetition sets in. The horror does stay unpredictable throughout and they do a really good job at sparingly using the monsters to hunt you. Among the Sleep doesn't feel like a glorified game of hide and seek like other modern horror titles, instead it feels like a very personal experience through the warped mind of a toddler. It really does feel like a walking simulator with puzzles thrown in to slow you down but if you are fine with that there is a truly memorable and unique experience here that will remain in your mind long after you beat it.","June 9, 2015","true","3.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealCrazyCrambo/recommended/250620/","RealCrazyCrambo","EthanCrambo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealCrazyCrambo/","1298 products in account","This review contains a couple of mere spoilers.\n\nAmong the Sleep has a very impressive affect on the player. It shows the great idea that only a genius could think of - using the perspective of a baby. Throughout this baby perspective, we can clearly notice that the baby has worries over many things like their mother's scream. At the beginning of the game, the character's mother goes to answer the door that had just had the doorbell ring. The mother then screams which queues the music and visual effects to give a dramatic effect. This happens to show that the baby feels stressed and panicked as though the mother is giving a distress call - an in-danger tone. I find this is a very creative idea and the creator really understands how emotion is built up in a game.\n\nAfter seeing the monster, I have a slight lust of disappointment, for as soon as a monster is shown in a game, that ruins the horror element of a build up. No studios are able to create a monster that is more horrifying that what we, as consumers, create in our head from mysterious build-ups, such as lighting effects and creaky floorboards. As soon as a monster is shown in a game, it automatically drops some tension and makes the player less scared of the monster. This game has lost the horrific momentum by showing the monster, and the monster doesn't look very scary, but I guess there are limits as to how scary you can make a monster look. And to be quite straight... what is a monster? A monster is a horrific creature or person that is created IN OUT HEADS by dramatic effects and noises. Making a monster be shown in a game really doesn't make it a monster anymore.\n\nThe teddy bear's voice acting and sounds are very good. The sound effects successfully create tension and the teddy bear successfully sounds like a Paedophile - I mean a nice friend.  In addition, the animations of movement in the game are very smooth, however are a little slow and... the opposite of slick. Whatever that word is.\n\nAs far as I can judge on the game mechanics, they are quite simple and not all that amazing. Animations for the things the character uses are very simple and could be improved through more time in development.\n\nI do believe this game has a really good story line, really good twists and successfully shows the in-depth perspective of a baby in every-day situations. Among the Sleep shows a definite prime example of what a baby would think about as they go to sleep on a dark, windy night. It shows how the baby is petrified and shows how simple things are over-exaggerated in the baby's mind, such as a wardrobe.\n\nOverall, I think this game really is worth the play and if you don't play this game, you'd be missing out on a lot of interesting perspective.\n\n","February 21","true","5.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I enjoyed this game - not only because of the horror element, which was very well done - but also because it told a valuable and emotional story with only a few words. In the minds of toddlers, many things and situations that happen in their lives sometimes don’t make sense. This game did a great job “translating” what was really happening into something that a toddler would see and understand. Moreover, it was absolutely terrifying. Many things make this game unique and different from most other first person games. First of all, the only way to transport yourself is toddling or crawling-which can make running away from certain death quite tense at times. Second, you play only two feet from the ground making everything around huge and curious. Third, you can see your body if you look down! You’re not a floating head bobbing around! Also, the baby footie pajamas are very nice. There will never be a dull moment when this incredible game is played and it may or may not make one speechless for a few days. I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a clean and eerie game that has good morals and lessons to be learned - including not making a single noise. There is one thing all must know when playing this: don’t break a bottle.\n","February 23","true","5.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","9"

I personally love horror games and while this game definitely had its moments of jump scare, it was nothing like other games in the genre (Amnesia or Outlast just to name a few), but considering the powerful story they tell perhaps its good they aren't like the others. The subtle way the writers work in real adult issues in the eyes of a 2 year old is impressive, as well as scary. The story reaches a depth that I sometimes don't see in a game with 60 hours worth of campaign, and deserves a lot of credit for it. The game takes you through a fantastic story that leaves you exposed and vulnerable. Definitely a great Indie story in a mild horror game.\n\nPROLOGUE:\n\nThe prologue is a short add on to clear up part of the story that a lot of people might not have picked up on in the original game alone.

Whilst there are some well done / clever moments and the designer did a great job of making the change of perspective into something that was a little overwhelming and scary, the experience was more of a walking (crawling?) simulator with a rather overblown story.\n\nFor a horror, it was more creepy than scary and the 'monsters' were very much more of an irritant that something to fear.  This was partly due to the poor AI presenting very little challenge, but also grinding visual and audio effects that made me want to go brew a cuppa whilst I waited for them to pass.\n\nSimilarly, puzzles were unchallenging - pretty much 'pull this to free this' and 'move this then jump on it', wrapped up in fetch quests.  Not that other horror games don't do unchallenging, but Among the Sleep isn't distracting you with the anticipation of terrifying things happening.  There are plenty of pretty bits, some very nice alice moments and the aforementioned change of perspective, but it's just not enough.

Since you are not so tall, (For being a child.) you have to move things around to climb, walk, and get past.

You could speed run in an hour or so, or take some time to enjoy the ambience.  Monument Valley (mobile game) is the same kind of beast; short but very enjoyable.\n\nTo be honest the 3-d models come across a bit unpolished (specifically the mother), but once you are 1/3 of the way through you don't notice anymore because you are too distracted by the SUPURB audio.  Seriously this game's audio is on par if not better than Outlast in keeping you nervous about what's about to happen (wear headphones). Puzzle elements aren't too difficult and I feel like it was designed in the same spirit of Super Meat Boy in how it introduces a mechanic and then expands on it, slowly guiding you as needed until you understand all the options at your disposal.\n\nThere are some jump scares sure, good ones in fact, and it's not excessive and the times where you are hiding from [REDACTED] are suspenseful.  The ending was good simply for the fact that they didn't take the easy way out with the story. You may think you have it figured out as you go along looking at drawings thrown about but it's not quite what it seems.\n\nI was a kickstarter backer, and I don't regret it, seeing how you can spend $20 on a few pizzas this is very much worth the price, and there has been DLC announced which I believe will be free.\n\nI'd give it a 7/10","May 31, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play a toddler who live through a horrific time, and all is done with very good production values and design. Control, graphiqs and especially the soundwork ( can't stress this one enough ) are all top notch. A very charismatic experience that deserves to be had. Those who read my reviews know i don't often thumbs up indie games because they often are terrible, but this is not the case here.\n\nIt's not worth the price of 22$ but if you get it in a sale for 3-4 or even 5$ it will be worth the price.

But Among The Sleep has gone to great lengths not to forget this. It casts you into the role of a toddler, turns out the lights, and asks you to explore the shadows.  Vulnerability is effortlessly achieved when the character you control can barely walk on its own. Wobbling along on uncertain feet leads your first person view to bobble from side to side as you advance. Keep it up for too long, and you’ll fall onto your hands and knees where you’ll crawl instead at a much brisker pace. Tilt your view enough to see yourself, and you glance tiny grasping hands, and a body clad in a dark blue onesie with a star and moon print. Pause the game, and the static options menu is brought up only after the infant has covered their eyes with their little hands. It’s occasionally adorable. It’s always, always nerve-racking. There’s something out there in the dark -- how are you supposed to fend it off?\n\nFull review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12295/miscellaneous/among-the-sleep/review.html","June 12, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the game clearly reveals its Indie roots by having a playtime value of about two hours, depending on how much of a scaredy cat you are, it's dripping with a great concoction of creepy visuals, haunting sounds and eerie music. It has done what many so called horror titles of this day and age fail to do; frighten me. Among the Sleep shines in making you feel like the fragile little child you control, and it's just enough to make your skin crawl as you struggle to open doors and find elaborate ways to climb on top of a drawer.\n\nCheck it out when you've got the time and cash! This game is definitely worth your time if you're a fan of horror that has the potential to make you soil your pants.","May 30, 2014","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Because the gameplay is cool, no weird or difficult ways to move, just really smooth. Then the puzzles, they are not that hard (if you have imagination ; ) haha) but it's the atmosphere that really makes this a good game! As a composer, music makes or breaks my game experience, and the soundtrack was awesome!!! The sound FX (with subwoofer of course) are thrilling! But I'll try to not spoil your experience by giving to much info here :p\n\nThere are 2 things that have to be said, in one of the levels was a bug. But after a restart of this level the bug was gone. And since this game really gets my juices flowing I didn't mind playing it twice! The other one is that it's simply to short!! :p I finisihed this one in one afternoon. But tonight, when it's dark and spooky I'll replay the entire game!\n\nSo there you go, great game, really worth buying! I'll be waiting for the next one!

You could speed run in an hour or so, or take some time to enjoy the ambience.  Monument Valley (mobile game) is the same kind of beast; short but very enjoyable.\n\nTo be honest the 3-d models come across a bit unpolished (specifically the mother), but once you are 1/3 of the way through you don't notice anymore because you are too distracted by the SUPURB audio.  Seriously this game's audio is on par if not better than Outlast in keeping you nervous about what's about to happen (wear headphones). Puzzle elements aren't too difficult and I feel like it was designed in the same spirit of Super Meat Boy in how it introduces a mechanic and then expands on it, slowly guiding you as needed until you understand all the options at your disposal.\n\nThere are some jump scares sure, good ones in fact, and it's not excessive and the times where you are hiding from [REDACTED] are suspenseful.  The ending was good simply for the fact that they didn't take the easy way out with the story. You may think you have it figured out as you go along looking at drawings thrown about but it's not quite what it seems.\n\nI was a kickstarter backer, and I don't regret it, seeing how you can spend $20 on a few pizzas this is very much worth the price, and there has been DLC announced which I believe will be free.\n\nI'd give it a 7/10","May 31, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But way too short.\n\nGraphics are fine. Could be a little better. But it's still nice to look at.\nSound is alright. Some cute sounds here and there. And the atmosphere sounds are done fairly decently.\nStory is an interesting take on horrors. It's very simple though. Nothing fancy. Kind of leaves you with some questions.\nGameplay itself is simple but fun. Though very very easy.\n\nBut the killer of this game is the price and it's extremely short storyline. You can finish this within an hour to two hours with ease. There is no challenge and the scares are well... not so scary. They are quite simple and predictable. Nothing fancy. So chances are if you're used to horrors, you won't really get much of a scare out of this. The only thing I had was a few jump scares. But there was very little suspense for me.\n\nThere is not really any replayability either on this. The game had far more potential to really be a powerful game with a deep story, proper scares and indepth gameplay. But sadly this did not happen.\n\nBut if the game is on sale, buy it if you're looking for a simple short and sweet take on a horror.\nIf I were to rate this out of 10, I'd give it a 5/10.","June 14, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, Among the Sleep caught my attention with its promise of an immersive world and a new perspective.  Both of which it delivered very well.  I started the game expecting to be scared out of my mind, but this game was very mild on the horror spectrum.  There was a small hand full of times that my heart raced and I jumped a little.  Very reminiscent of my childhood days when I remember being afraid to walk around the house in the dark because my imagination had already created all of the worst possible things that could be waiting to grab me.\n\nThe biggest complaint I read in reviews was that the game was too short.

They did come out with a free dlc which i think i enjoyed more then the main story for some reason lol but that only adds 30-45 minutes of playtime.If your thinking about getting it i would wait until theres a sale but other then that i would definitely recommend it. I think everyone who loves these kind of games should experience it.\n\nIf you want to check out the free dlc here is some gameplay of it!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=useFv0ybfLg","March 25","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The ending itself is something that you should not miss as it holds a gravitas that will resonate with you and stay with you for some time.

It oozes atmosphere akin to Amnesia and has the stylish flair of Psychonauts. I would re-tag this game primarily as an adventure story with horror elements as there aren't too many unsettling factors aside from a few jump scares and monsters. The world is like a childhood storybook and your guide is Teddy, a sentient stuffed bear whose eyes glow when he's squeezed (Glow Worm much?). I finished the game in 3 hours and my gaming laptop chug-chug-chugged along. There seem to be lag issues and when reduced to lower qualities some models and textures glitch and flicker. There are a few bugs, but nothing to complain greatly about though it is a bummer that immersion gets broken once in a while when immersion is the game's pride and joy. Among the Sleep is worth playing through, but there isn't much replay value unless you want to spend time playing with your toys. It's certainly a game to add to a horror fanatic's collection.

I really liked that the controls actually bring life to the idea that you're playing as an infant. Run too long and you fall into a crawl.... the bobbled, bow legged walk. These are all great details that helped immerse me into the world. I actually had an unnerving sense of nostalgia when crawling between coats and dresses in the endless expanses of closets. Remember how big closets used to seem when hiding in them?\n\nI guess my biggest dissapointment was that due to the short amount of time and focus on the game itself, that I really wish I was able to care more about the characters. Maybe that plays into being an infant and not picking up on these things, but it felt like an afterthought. Obviously, Teddy is the only character you really have the chance to connect with and he always felt so artificial that it gave me that "uncanny valley" uneasiness rather than the feeling of comfort he was supposed to provide the player.\n\nRegardless, this was a well crafted experience and I can't find a reason to tell anyone not to play it. The price tag is pretty steep at the moment. In the end, I always equate it to "was the experience worth the price of admission" which is completely subjected to my own opinion. In this case, not for me. It's a game I enjoyed, but I won't likely bring it up in conversations or think about it too much after my playthrough.\n\nI am excited to see what the developers do in the future.","January 24","true","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I wanna focus on the toddler simulation aspect.\n\nHoly cow. I wish there was a way to just have a toddler simulator based on these mechanics. After I played through the actual storyline I went back and started over again and just played around in the playroom and was blown away by the attention to physics. Drag a stool across the wooden floor, it slides okay. Push it across carpet and you're in for a struggle. You can't lift a pillow above your head but you can toss an inflatable ball a few feet.\n\nYou can pick things up, put them down, open and close things, climb and even fall. There's no health bar so spills don't really matter. You wobble when you walk and make appropriate sounds as you move around. And it's interesting to see the world from the perspective of one so small (again). In all I would love to see more done with just the simulator side of things. It would be a riot to run around the house and interact with the environment without having to worry about the 'bad guys' getting you.\n\nAfter a long hard week of adulting, sometimes I don't want my gaming to give me puzzles or enemies to deal with. I just want to unwind. but I'm not into the farming or app-type games. This is just my style! I'd love to see more walking simulators like this.\n\nThat said, the spooky aspect to this game and the storyline are both awesome. Sometimes though I couldn't help wondering if -I- was the monster.

There are a few glitches still, and my game crashed making me replay the last chapter, but I didn't mind so much other than having to get through a few scary moments again.\n\nKeep in mind I do not normally play horror games, I'm extremely skittish and jump scares always tend to get me. I thought the game was a good level of overall eerieness without being so scary I couldn't play. It's not going to scare horror veterans, but the story is more important in my eyes. The ending had me scared for the adorable little protagonist in more ways than one.\n\nAs far as length it's a short game. Took me about 4 hours including redoing that last chapter. Any more though would've been padding, as the game told it's story quite well in the time taken. There's not a ton of replay value as the emotional reaction is never the same as the first time, but I know a few people I'll be suggesting this too.\n\nI did not see the ending coming.

Good art direction.  Great story, if a bit predictable.  PC performance was good.\n\nCons:  Short,  took me about 3 hours and I explored everywhere.  Some bugginess towards the end, I had to restart a chapter due to a glitch.  I suppose thats to be expected on version 1.0 of a kickstarted indie game though.","May 30, 2014","true","5.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You get a few shock scares, but all in all it's a puzzle game with a dark setting. The terror vibe wears out about 30 mins in and never comes back. I'll admit that the idea of the main character being a 2-year old with their teddy interested me enough to buy the game and although I enjoyed some parts, I regret buying Among the Sleep.\n\nOne play-through is only between 2-3 hours; waaay too short for the price. The graphics lag a bit in certain areas but it's not too bad. The redeeming factor of this game are the visuals. Very well-done, except for the mom's face. Sounds are kind of repetitive, but nothing to get real mad about.\n\nWhat I did get mad about was the fact that I paid $20 for a 3 hour game that doesn't get you on the edge of your seat. I was disappointed with this title, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. How sad :(\n\n\n------[SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT]-----\n\n\n\n\nThe play time is about 2-3 hours depending on how much you run/walk. Initially it's more intuitive to walk than run because you don't know what the game is all about. After about 30 minutes you realize there's no real backlash to being caught by the monster and you run through everything. This is where the game lost me.\n\nFirst of all, it reveal what the monster looks like waaaay too early. In fact, they shouldn't have ever done that considering the short play time. after it's revealed you lose all sense of this game being the least bit frightening. Aside from a few instances where you actually have to hide from the monster to avoid the harsh penalty [sarcasm] of starting almost exactly where you were caught with no progress rewind, there's no real 'horror-value'. There is only 1 event where you have to consider not just plowing through the map. Bottles on top of blocks that summon the monster if they fall? Brilliant, I love it! Showing every bit of what happens during that scene in your teaser trailer? Moronic.\n\nThe end scene has a bit of redeming factors in that we're taken for a loop to find out our once loving mother is actually an abusive alcoholic stuggling with the idea of continuing on as a single parent. Lovely. That, combined with the recent dismemberment of best friend Teddy, we've basically witnessed the making of a potential psychopath. Maybe the sequel will have us mass murdering 1st graders! The possibilities are endless.\n\nBuy this game if you have money to burn.","May 31, 2014","false","2.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

What gameplay there was (about 1 1/2 hours) was really fun, and had a few interesting mechanics, however there were several bugs that ruined the gameplay a bit. The character developement of Teddy was a little sloppy in the way that he's introduced, but over the course of the game, he becomes a lovable character.\n\nThings I liked:\nThe plot progression was really well done, and it had an interesting twist at the end.\nThe limitations of movement accurately represented what it would be like as a small child.\nThe bear-flashlight (Awwh!).\nThe non-violent terrifying monster and hide sequences.\nThe plot twist at the end.\n\nThings I didn't like:\nThe extremely short gameplay.\nThe multiple bugs that ruined gameplay a bit.\nThe high cost for such little gameplay.\nThe somewhat repetitive ambience.\n\nOverall, the game is a really fun experience, but not worth $20. The different sections each have their own unique ambiences and creepy layouts, and usually make you not want to leave any hidey-hole that you find. The gameplay is really short, and leaves you feeling like you bought an incomplete game. Teddy is a lovable character and a useful flashlight, and the movement is realistic, but the combination of bugs and short gameplay ruined the experience a little bit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaseface/recommended/250620/","chaseface","ChaseFace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaseface/","421 products in account","It's a very simplistic puzzle game with a few jumpscares and some chasing sequences. I found myself jumping into the water out of boredom just to hear the sound of crunching bones (from what I assume was some water monster eating me), BEGGING for something to kill me to relieve the tedium of collecting items, using them to open a door, and continuing, while the ambience and lighting tried to convince me I was in some kind of danger, then 80% of the time it was just smoke and mirrors and I was completely aware of it.\n\nI was SUPER amused by all the little details of being a baby. The cooing, the bear, and the pause screen is adorable - he holds his hands up and covers his eyes, like a kid would do when trying to hide from scary monsters - but all charm aside, I would NOT have bought this game knowing how short it is (for 20 dollars, no less) if I hadn't been suckered into thinking this was a bona fide horror game. It's a glorified puzzle game with some creepy theming, but Amnesia was both much more challenging and much more terrifying. This game borrows a lot from well-established series and just feels kind of cheap, and you can beat it in about an hour or two.\n\nTo be frank, there were some very creepy moments. When I was being chased by the darkness monsters, I felt like they were clearly gaining on me faster than I could crawl, so there was a nice helpless element to it like I expected to get snatched up RIGHT as I was about to make it to a a safe place. There are also ambiguous crayon drawings, which is usually a cliche in a horror game - children drawing crude depictions of murder or creepy ladies with long, black hair - but in this context it was pretty chilling on occasion. At one point I saw what looked like a tall dark figure holding up a stick-figure infant above its' open jaws, about to devour it. It's rare for anyone to address the murder of children/babies in games, so that's a unique theme that gives it that extra "Ugh, ♥♥♥♥ that" feeling.\n\nVery ambient, very creepy, very short, very dull, even once the enemies show up. Wait for a sale, until then the LetsPlays will be just as scary. Out of 100%, it's probably a 68% or so. Nothing fresh or revolutionary beyond being about a baby, and the puzzles get really stale.","May 30, 2014","false","3.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It's such a unique game and a fresh and new take into horror - something original that hasn't been done before. The story and game are really short, but the story-telling is incredible and beautiful and so well done.\n\nYou play the protagonist role of a 2 year old toddler, you're movement is slow and sluggish, you can't travel anywhere too fast or you'll fall over, but crawling around is great because you're used to that! You can interact with the world around you by pushing buttons, picking things up, turning them around and looking at them and doing other things as you explore the world around you and develop. However, this is where the story telling begins. You experience the story in such a parculiar yet fascinating perspective of the young and still developing mind of this 2 year old. So things aren't as they seem, things are confusing and odd, but a key piece of detail I love the developers for is simple yet so effective.\n\nThe world around you is new and scary.\n\nThere's not a great deal I can tell you without spoiling the game and I don't intend to as it is an experience that is satisfying to indulge into.\n\nIs this game worth buying? Yes, but be sure to pick it up on a sale as it is REALLY short. You can get through the game and its DLC in a matter of a couple of hours, but don't let that put you off, it is a truly interesting and amazing game that almost brought a tear to my eye when I understood the story behind it.\n\nI rate this game a strong 8.9/10\nI recommend this game to horror go-getters, people who want an interesting short story to experience and anyone who can appreciate a new take on this genre.","January 1, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not kidding...\n\nThe game is unique, no doubt about that, especially with a dark story with really creepy atmosphere. Lighting, poor lighting, shadows, noises and music play a huge role in it. Especially in aspect where I totally love the game but if someone asked me what I like about it, I wouldn't really be able to tell what that is. I mean, imagine Alien:Isolation, but where you are a toddler. Total mind♥♥♥♥. It seems like Alien:Isolation devs kinda got inspiration from this game...\n\nThe game is incredibly short (a bit over 3 hours including DLC gameplay), so much that despite liking it, I'm unsure if I could justify 20 € on it. 10 € yes, at any time. But 20, sorry it's just way too short despite everything. So, when there will be a -50% deal on Steam, grab it as it's the most unforgettable experience you'll ever have.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cdizzillion/recommended/250620/","cdizzillion","cdizzillion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cdizzillion/","377 products in account","So here's what I felt about the story and atmosphere of this game in particular hopefully without spoiling anything:\n\nAt first it didn't make too much sense and I felt as if it were just going to throw me, a two year old man, into a dark helpless environment where everything was out to kill me. However it only did part of that. The atmosphere was very well constructed to resemble what a two year old could possibly be taking in if it were scared of something. Everything that was around me that I would look to for direction and expected to be able to read was surprisingly to me, not in English. It was symbols and characters that made me think that it was the doing of aliens. However, looking back on it after completing the game, and realizing the message of the game, it wasn't in English because I was just a two year old. That struck me as interesting. Another thing on the topic of me being scared ♥♥♥♥less looking to the environment for direction is that there were drawings. In all the little nooks and cranny's that I would crawl to to hide from whatever I thought was chasing me had a little drawing of what a child would interpret towards whatever the ♥♥♥♥ was going down. That was another thing that I was impressed with. Now, when it comes to scary ♥♥♥♥, I do not like to be a part of it. Sure I'll watch it, but ♥♥♥♥ everything about participating in it and leading the charge. But this game really got me hooked. I was a little sad but relieved that it was so short, but I feel like they timed everything just perfectly. And the noises... ♥♥♥♥ those noises. But back to the point here. The game didn't focus on jump-scaring a ♥♥♥♥♥, but instead it focused on timing events just right to where the smallest mistake you make would scare the junk out of you. It really made you pay attention to what you were doing, where you were crawling/walking/bumping into, and why you were seeing the things you were. Unlike Amnesia, it really plays with more emotions than just fear. It gives you that feeling of "Why" rather than "Okay, that just happened" forcing you to investigate and become more interested in what happens rather than making you feel like you have to just escape from what happened. Also, as Halo has proven, if you can see your feet it's a good game. You can see your feet. On that note, your character acts as a 2 year old would if it was scared. (Constantly playing with it's belly button, making little squeeking noises, hugging your bear for security, etc) As the story progresses, ♥♥♥♥ naturally gets more freaky, but starts to foreshadow into what you ultimately discover at the end. I can't really go further into it without spoiling, but its really just a fantastic game. I hated the feels the whole way through in a good way, but I just couldn't get enough of it. I had to know, and when I found out, it was a wrecking ball of awesome. The key to this game is immersion. Without it, you're wasting your time. I recommend this game to any player who enjoys a good story. You will not be disappointed.\n\nTL;DR: Among the Sleep = bigger man-tears boner than The Notebook could ever dream to present.","June 10, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not groundbreaking, but this game does some cool things, adapting the gameplay mechanics to fit its subject matter. Given that you play as a toddler, you crawl faster than you can run, and you can fall down if you run for too long. However, crawling can limit your perception of the environment somewhat, and just "feels" strange. It adds an interesting dimension to the gameplay. Furthermore, rather than just giving you a flashlight, your source of light comes from cuddling your teddy bear. Sure, the effect is mostly the same (albeit with a more limited radius) but it's creative and serves to immerse the player.\n\nGRAPHICS: Looks pretty good. There's a nice contrast between bright coloured objects in dark environments, and the lighting adds to the environments by bathing them in an eerie glow.\n\nENVIRONMENTS: Surreal, they seem like dark fairytales and nightmares, but with a lighthearted twist at once. They're not overbearingly scary, but rather, serve to make the player feel lost in a dream. Perhaps their most interesting attribute is that everything is "big" (sometimes disproportionately so), reflecting the youth of the protagonist. On the downside, they're sparsely decorated at times and there isn't a whole lot to explore along the fairly linear paths.\n\nAUDIO: Good sound effects all around, and the music is ambient and serves it pretty well. The highlight is definitely Roger L. Jackson as Teddy (of American McGee's Alice fame) whose distinctive voice lends its warmth and sense of curiosity to the story. Some creepy sound effects punctuate the generally quiet of the game, with one enemy noise in particular being pretty jarring.\n\nENEMIES: There aren't many (only two from what I recall) but they're pretty eerie and are the impetus for the stealth sections. They continue the theme of childlike wonder, being large and overbearing. One seems like a creature from a fairy tale, with another looking like something a child would see in the shadows at night from everyday objects.\n\nHORROR: This is the department that the game falls a bit short in. I don't think this game was going for Amnesia-style horror here, but it still isn't particularly scary. For me, it was quite tense at the beginning, but I found that it wore off unless I knew there were monsters present.\n\nSTORY: Without giving away anything, it pulls a few punches and is very good. The ending is quite impactful, and I was quite surprised at the direction it took.\n\nVALUE: It's a pretty short game, so I'd recommend getting it on sale.","December 25, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did, however, find myself craving something more in the "scare factor" of this game, I find it more of a puzzle game at heart, with some big monsters that you hardly ever see. There's a lot of ambience, and a few forced encounters, but I didn't fail once in the entire game(Okay, so I fell of a cliff, but that doesn't count).\n\nI thought the map design and the mechanics were exquisite, crawling up stuff and using chairs to reach doorknobs added a new factor that made the game more intimate(keys and pressure plates are so old), but in all, it was far too short.\n\nWith all of the crowd-sourced funding and open map design, I think this should have been a $9.99-$14.99 game because there is no replay value, once you solve the puzzle, there's no other way to spend time. Hopefully, Krillbite will have FREE DLC for the game(Like adding chapter 5 maybe), or some more achievements, or an alternate path through the game, or anything...\n\nThat all aside, I suggest people get this game; but wait for a sale or a mark down in price.","June 18, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe 2-3 years back, I'm not sure. WORTH THE WAIT.\n\nI loved this game, the plot is simple, yet manages to blindside you with something you didn't see coming. And the horror aspect isn't ignored here, in fact the mind of this two year old runs amok with creepy, spine tingling atmospheres, and one horrifying baddy. The only downside I can find to this game, is that's it's very short. Only 2-3 hours long. Yet, even with this in mind, I paid for a good scare and I got one that was well worth the 20 dollar tag on this game.\n\nOther than that, the only flaws I can see within the game are some animation glitches in the beginning part.

Among the Sleep was far better then what I expected it to be and much more deep also. It dwelves into the childs mind and establishes a form of nostalgic fear. It will find its way into being one of the creepiest games you will play as well as intense. The vice acting was great along with your companion Teddy just making it all work and fit and by the end of it I had very little to complain about. However there are some things worth noting about the game that needs to be brought to light for the optional buyers out there. First, the campaign is not long at all. Two hours tops. So this leads to the second thing, the price for a two hour game is a bit high. 20 dollars US regularly. If you're interested and see this game on a steam sale i reccomend getting it quick and instantly. Now also the last real thing I can complain about is that the game isn't very challengin either. Its scary and has its moments of wonder and intense hiding but really it was very quick and easy to figure out. So in comparison to Outlast (If you have played that game) this is a walk in the park. However I still find it being very enjoyable and worth the two hours and it will even be more fun to watch your friends play in the dark for the first time.

Everything is huge. Crawling and staggered walking are integral to how you move around. Your childlike imagination is incredibly active. Norwegian developer, Krillbite Studio, have done an amazing job at placing you in the onesie of a toddler and then subsequently placing you in a night where everything is going bump.\n\nAmong the Sleep uses a whole arsenal of horror techniques to keep you sweating and on the edge of your seat. As I mentioned, it is an atmospheric horror game. A dark house on a stormy night full of creaks, with the faint noise of a plate breaking or muffled voices can be terrifying. Especially at first when you’re wandering through the house as doors creak open behind you, the sound of heavy footsteps echo throughout the house, and there are shadows framing what I assumed at the time were burly, axe-wielding convicts. I would advise playing the game slightly brighter than recommended setting. Not because I’m a coward, but more because the recommended gamma setting was too dark and I couldn’t actually see what I was doing. Though the game does provides a solution to this. There is a “Hug Teddy” button which causes Teddy to light up, softly illuminating the darkness around you.\n\nWhile I’m generally not a huge fan of horror games due to being a bit flighty and preferring games that empower. But I still enjoyed the horror in Among the Sleep academically. Having you play a toddler was an interesting game elements that I’ve never seen it before and thoroughly enjoyed. The game might seem steep in price for a 5-6 hour game, but you pay more for a 2 hour movie, and a lot more for games that that far less unique and well-thought out.\n\nFor full review, visit\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/07/11/among-the-sleep/","July 23, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now, that's not to say I didn't have fun with the game. There is a lot of good stuff to it. However, Among the Sleep is painfully short at only two hours long, and is really more of a 'roadtrip' game, where you look at stuff and experience stuff on a very linear path that, once experienced, really doesn't have anything else to offer. Furthermore, the biggest issue I came across was the monster(s). They were too easy to hide from, and I'll be honest, they really aren't all that threatening when you can just dive into a closet or under a table and know they won't try to look for you. One last big complaint I have is this: stop with the static-y screen when looking at monsters developers! Seriously, whenever you look at a monster the screen erupts into a static filled mess, and rather than scare me, it just irritated me and distracted me from the game. The thing that should be scary about an unknown creature is the very presence of an unknown creature. If the static eruption didn't happen, I probably would feel more of a threat, because the actual creatures and their designs, while simplistic, do in fact have a bigger than life feel when seen through the eyes of the toddler you play as. So Krillbite, in your next game, stop with the static thing. If you want to do something like that again however, try to be slightly more subtle about it, rather than have the screen scream 'YOU ARE FRIGHTENED NOW! OOOOHHH SO SPOOKY!' Stop it. No, I'm not scared, I'm annoyed.\nNow, despite ripping into some of the more major problems, I still recommend this game. Why? Because it is absolutely gorgeous. The aesthetic of the game is incredible, being colorful, but still very dark and creepy, and while the actual graphics of the game aren't the best, they still lend to alter the perceptions you ight have of the world. At the beginning, I found my own mind playing tricks on me, making me think there were thing in places where there was nothing, much like a child would. I absolutely loved that the enviornment of the game could do that on its own, even more so than any of the monsters. The mechanics also lend themselves well to the ideas of the game. You have on your journey a teddy bear that you can hug for comfort, and teddy then acts as a light source to help you see the path you need to go down. When pausing, the toddler covers his face with his hands to hide from the scary things, again bringing in the feeling that this is a young child in a big threatening world that he doesn't understand. To open doors, you need to get chairs to reach the knob, and you move faster crawling that you do walking.\nSo, overall, I think that this game does have some good things to offer, and as Krillbite's first game, I think they did a decent job. However, I don't recommend dropping twenty dollars on this game. Wait for the price to drop, and/or wait for a sale.","June 20, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I loved seeing the world through a childs eyes and the little details were really cool, like the "spooky world" was just the baby's imagination interacting with the house, the key on the baby stairs gate for example, everything was significant to building up a story of this child, the drawings of sad child and grumpy monster etc.\n\nI loved the level with the bottles all over the place that could fall and break, you really got a feeling of panic that how angry mummy would be if you made even the slightest noise etc, at least that's the impression I got.\n\nIt was also really refreshing to have this sad situation where for once it isn't the stereotype drunken father routine, I really liked that.\n\nOne thing though I would liked to have seen better use off was Teddy.  Although he serves as a kind of "flash light" mechanic, you can literally play through the entire game having never used him if you want to.  It would have been really cool if there was some sort of "upset" meter or something that would have you needing to cuddle him to stop the baby from crying or something and attracting the "monster"  it would also have been good that if after an encounter when the screen goes all crazy because you're scared that you need to cuddle teddy to reset that.  Basically I just felt that teddy wasn't used enough which is a shame.\n\nThe game should have been longer for the price asked... I paid £8.99 and that was with a 40% discount, and while I don't feel that I have been ripped off, I certainly wish the game was a good bit longer... I kind of feel that we were only really starting to encounter threats when the game started to come to an end.\n\nWould very much like to see more of this, hopefully some additional content will come from dlc or a sequel, but either way I would recommend to give this a try.  It's a fresh take on the horror fps genre and it's cute scary and fun\n\nI'd give Among the sleep 7/10 lossing a little score for its price to duration ratio.","September 16, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Has your thirst for psychological torment this year not been quenched yet? Do you crave to relive old childhood nightmares? Then Among The Sleep might be for you...\n\nThis delightfully terrifying experience grants gamers the opportunity to explore a creepy Silent Hill-esque world of terror through the eyes of a toddler. That premise alone should capture anyone's curiosity. For what does a helpless baby represent the most? Exactly... Helplessness. You are no soldier, no athletic investigator - just a baby in the land of giants. One that can barely walk on two feet. You don't get to see that type of scenario every day. But what can be said about the game itself?\n\nBoth music and sounds, arguably the most important parts of any horror game, do not disappoint. You'll often be looking over your shoulder to check whether that ominous noise in the distance was really just part of the ambiance or instead a sinister monster stalking you. Among The Sleep definitely plays it's cards well, and spends a good quarter of it's length on excellent build-up to the main events. Especially the first big area, a forested house located within a foggy swamp, managed to freak me out again and again. I'd not want to return there anytime soon, that's for sure.\n\nIn terms of gameplay you'll be collecting stuff in order to access new places. A lot of stuff. Perhaps too much stuff? Eh, it didn't bother me in all honesty. The environments are beautifully designed, and keep things interesting enough to overshadow the simplistic puzzles. I swear to god though... That evil forest. Or the playground before it. The atmosphere oozes greatness around every corner. You'll never know what to expect next. Better grow used to being all alone, for your only "companion" happens to be a teddy bear - one who also serves as a sort of light source if hugged tightly. How charming. Well, you take what you can get as a toddler. Flashlights ain't cheap!\n\nHOWEVER... Among The Sleep unfortunately isn't perfect. The second half of it, in my opinion, happens to be much weaker than the first, which feels as if the developers spent most of their budget on it, only to run out of significant ideas later on. This is quite a shame indeed. And it doesn't stop there. The game is also a rather short experience. Two - three hours, maybe four if you take it slow, are what most players will probably get out of it. And that length is somewhat disappointing, considering that you need to pay 20 bucks for it. Even the story, despite feeling intriguing at points, ultimately fails to outweigh these negatives. After reaching the end, you'll be left with that bothersome "is it over already?" feeling in your gut. Such wasted potential.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say that you should give Among The Sleep a try. I greatly enjoyed my time with it, despite some flaws along the way. And chances are you will as well. But it might be wise to wait for a price drop. Chances are you'd probably feel a little cheated to pay 20 bucks for a game that only last two hours if you play through it in a fast-paced manner.\n\nTL;DR: Good horror. Starts out strong, leaves a little to be desired in the second half. Overall too short for 20 bucks.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 7 / 10","May 31, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a game that can be studied for accomplishments in design.  This is a game that is scary without being grotesque.  This is a game that will remind you of your childhood fears.  This is a game that will remind you how scary the real world is.

However there are some parts that fall flat.  The segments where you had to avoid the creature were more of an annoyance than scary and involved more trial and error than I thought necessary.  For me I was pulled out of the experience everytime I got caught and sent to the "continue" screen and that is not something you want in a game like this.  Overall I feel the game could have been just as scary without them (maybe even more so).

Full of creative physics puzzles this game kept me engaged from start to finish. Playing from the persepctive of a baby certainly added to the fear factor. It adds a unique twist to the gameplay experience not seen anywhere else which makes the threats in game credible (especially the sounds and being stalked). Seeing things from a low-angle POV was a thrill. The artwork is hauntingly surealist and does well to create a spooky atmosphere that'll keep you on edge. The characters are memorable and you really connect with them because the story works to create emotional bonds with them in ways you've probably not seen before in-game. The story is well-crafted and stays with you well after you've finished, a thoughtful experience. As a big horror fan I can honestly say this game is in my Top 10 Scariest games of all time because it takes the familiar and turns it into a fun-filled nightmare. I can see myself coming back to this for Halloween for some more good scares.

I'm not kidding...\n\nThe game is unique, no doubt about that, especially with a dark story with really creepy atmosphere. Lighting, poor lighting, shadows, noises and music play a huge role in it. Especially in aspect where I totally love the game but if someone asked me what I like about it, I wouldn't really be able to tell what that is. I mean, imagine Alien:Isolation, but where you are a toddler. Total mind♥♥♥♥. It seems like Alien:Isolation devs kinda got inspiration from this game...\n\nThe game is incredibly short (a bit over 3 hours including DLC gameplay), so much that despite liking it, I'm unsure if I could justify 20 € on it. 10 € yes, at any time. But 20, sorry it's just way too short despite everything. So, when there will be a -50% deal on Steam, grab it as it's the most unforgettable experience you'll ever have.

I did, however, find myself craving something more in the "scare factor" of this game, I find it more of a puzzle game at heart, with some big monsters that you hardly ever see. There's a lot of ambience, and a few forced encounters, but I didn't fail once in the entire game(Okay, so I fell of a cliff, but that doesn't count).\n\nI thought the map design and the mechanics were exquisite, crawling up stuff and using chairs to reach doorknobs added a new factor that made the game more intimate(keys and pressure plates are so old), but in all, it was far too short.\n\nWith all of the crowd-sourced funding and open map design, I think this should have been a $9.99-$14.99 game because there is no replay value, once you solve the puzzle, there's no other way to spend time. Hopefully, Krillbite will have FREE DLC for the game(Like adding chapter 5 maybe), or some more achievements, or an alternate path through the game, or anything...\n\nThat all aside, I suggest people get this game; but wait for a sale or a mark down in price.","June 18, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's such a unique game and a fresh and new take into horror - something original that hasn't been done before. The story and game are really short, but the story-telling is incredible and beautiful and so well done.\n\nYou play the protagonist role of a 2 year old toddler, you're movement is slow and sluggish, you can't travel anywhere too fast or you'll fall over, but crawling around is great because you're used to that! You can interact with the world around you by pushing buttons, picking things up, turning them around and looking at them and doing other things as you explore the world around you and develop. However, this is where the story telling begins. You experience the story in such a parculiar yet fascinating perspective of the young and still developing mind of this 2 year old. So things aren't as they seem, things are confusing and odd, but a key piece of detail I love the developers for is simple yet so effective.\n\nThe world around you is new and scary.\n\nThere's not a great deal I can tell you without spoiling the game and I don't intend to as it is an experience that is satisfying to indulge into.\n\nIs this game worth buying? Yes, but be sure to pick it up on a sale as it is REALLY short. You can get through the game and its DLC in a matter of a couple of hours, but don't let that put you off, it is a truly interesting and amazing game that almost brought a tear to my eye when I understood the story behind it.\n\nI rate this game a strong 8.9/10\nI recommend this game to horror go-getters, people who want an interesting short story to experience and anyone who can appreciate a new take on this genre.","January 1, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But that being said it is one of the only games out there that puts you at the perspective of a scared little kid. While it might not be the most terrifying horror game out there, it is a one of a kind horror game. Almost nobody would think to put you in the perspective of a scared little kid, which is what I like about this game. Anyways I would highly reccommend this game because, like I said, its one of a kind and you probably won't find many other games like this. Also, if you're like me and have never played another horror game, this is a really good one to start with. Its scary, but at the same time its not as bad as Amnesia, or FNAF. If I had played either of those games first I honestly probably would've been scared to death.","August 17, 2015","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Level design is interesting and varies wildly from location to the next, and the short narrative provides  a peek at the lives of adults from the eyes of a two year old with (hopefully) the mind of an adult. Personally, found the ending surprising which was nice from such a seemingly simple concept of 'take a trip to nightmare land and avoid the various boogeymen'.\n\nSound world is also nice, and the approach of hostile entities is nicely backed by this fact. You'll instinctly start to look for cover the moment you pick up on the audio que that the resident Oogie Boogie is going to pay a visit.\n\nOverall, if you spot this in a bargain bin, it's definitely good for a single playthrough. Also featured an introductory 'DLC' which added another level to the game without the help of your loveable teddybear to guide you in the dark places of the earth, which provided another ten minutes of gameplay.","July 18, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This incredibly atmospheric experience of a game even has a good story that touches on problems in real-life and how different people (or children) react to those issues.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to be scared and enjoys a game where going-in-guns-blazing is not an option.

Since this game has you you playing as a 2 year old child in a suburban household, rather than a student of the occult in a victorian era castle the subject matter is lighter, but only slightly.  It would seem that a child imagination is a powerful thing, and that left alone in a dark house with a very real threat lurking things can get dark quickly.

While the short length might be off-putting for some, I think the game is exactly as long as it should be; lengthening this sort of game would produce fluff, and I dislike fluff more than a short game.  Among the Sleep is well executed in terms of mechanics, tone, and narrative.  The story is better than I gave it credit for when I started playing, and it is told well through the environment and character design.\n\n**minor spoilers**\n\nWhile the mechanics are simple, there are design choices worth noting.  For one, the option to crawl or walk is done in an interesting way; the player can't grab things or clutch the teddy bear for light while he crawls, but he moves faster, has a lower profile, and is not prone to falling.  I felt much more comfortable and "safer" while crawling.  Walking is clearly made the riskier choice, but  the player has to do it regularly in order to progress.  The player is faced with a similar delima with holding the teddy bear.  It sheds some light, but the toddler can't interact with objects while he holds the bear.  I thought  the developers made some very good choices with even the limitted mechanics options.  The player had to consistantly perform actions outside of a toddler's comfort zone (and mine; I would have liked to crawl  the whole game) in order to continue processing what was happening to him.\n\nThe environmental design (visual and sound) is wonderful, sets a consistant tone, and is meaningful.  Look at the screen shots and trailer.  Enough said.  I won't say much about the character design except that when I first saw it, I hid under the bed for like two minutes (in game, of course...).\n\nI won't spoil much about the story either, but it is great to see more video games using things like themes, motifs, mechanics, symbolism, and subtlty to tell a story rather than strictly dialogue/text.  I thought all of the "words" in the game being random squiggles was a very cute yet alienating detail.\n\nOverall, this is one of the most well-executed games I've played recently.  There are a few parts that drag a bit toward the beginning, but the game as a whole is worth the slow parts.  Movement, opening drawers, and throwing objects is cumbersome at times, but, well, you're playing as a baby.  It kind of comes with the territory.\n\nFans of horror and story-centric games would probably enjoy this.","December 25, 2014","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yet, even with this in mind, I paid for a good scare and I got one that was well worth the 20 dollar tag on this game.\n\nOther than that, the only flaws I can see within the game are some animation glitches in the beginning part.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/250620/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Among the Sleep is a psychological adventure game where you are put in the shoes (so to speak) of a toddler while he tries to find her missing mother during nighttime with the help of his fellow, rather talkative teddy bear companion.\nYou navigate the various environments of the game from the very eyes of the toddler: you are mainly tasked to overcome various obstacles along your path (by either crowling, climbing or rarely use some items you collected and put in an inventory) and advance further through the chapters. You can also hug Teddy to illuminate your surrondings (even if, sadly, this feature isn't brought up as much as one would expect).\nWhile many believe this is a full-fledged horror game, Among the Sleep is more interested into make you see how disturbing reality can be when saw from a toddler's point of view and how it twists everything it touches. Therefore, don't expect any jump scare or chases: the game is very tense and will sometime try to screw with you, but that's pretty much about it.\nThe graphics are stylized enough, with their strongest suit being the peculiar and warped level design. The same cannot be said for other models in the game, but they don't tend to stand out that much.\nThe only DLC for the game, Prologue, is unfortunately very short, clocking around half an hour (that is, if you take your sweet time) and not adding everything worthwhile to the formula you've already experienced in the main game. This is especially annoying because the main story isn't that long either (clocking around three or four hours).\nIf you love that kind of games that can offer you an unique and "artistic" experience without being that keen on a superb gameplay, Among the Sleep could be yet another game to add to your Steam library","January 9, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What makes it unique is the perspective; it's a first person perspective horror game where you play as a 2-year-old toddler. The game really makes you see the world through the imagination and fears of a little child. The visual design of the game succeeds in making benign everyday objects look menacing when in the dark. Is that some sort of monster standing there watching you? Or is it simply a coat on a coat rack with some boots sticking out the bottom of it? Even your own toys can sometimes seem unsettling. I liked how, whenever you see written text in the game, like in an open book, for example, it looks like gibberish, since your character can't read. Sound effects are used effectively at the right times to evoke a sense of dread and fear.\n\nIn my opinion, the star of the show here is Teddy, your imaginary friend teddy bear who seems alive and who is with you you traverse the dark, avoiding a monster and looking for your missing mother. Teddy is an ambiguous character; cute n' creepy. Is he there to help you or is he not to be trusted? He is well voice-acted, but there are long sections of the game where you almost forget he is with you because he doesn't have much to say. I realize this is under the pretense that you both have to be quite so as not to alert the monster to your presence, but I just feel like Teddy could have been used more in some of the middle sections of the game.\n\nI'm not going lie, this game can really get you into the mindset of a small child and I did find myself weeping after the climax and at the end. The game can be scary, but there's no blood and guts or anything. But be aware that the game delves into issues that kids shouldn't have to face, but sometimes do. The evidence to me that this game successfully told a story with some emotional impact was the fact that it gave me the feels even though I had a pretty stable and happy childhood.","June 19, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

How the real world and its traumas were conceptualized and distorted into this sort of nightmare scenario was very compelling and clever. The general controls, abilities, and movement felt well designed and contributed to the world feeling tangible. I found the areas in the game quite enveloping and endearing in their creepy fashion.

I mean, in the GAME "Among the Sleep" you play as a baby.  I real life, you may or may not actually be a baby.  I don't know.\n\nThe game, just so you know, only took me about two and half hours to complete.  I'm assuming that's because most babies have the attention span of a squirrel that got one too many jolts from a taser.  I don't speak from experience.  Honest.\n\nWhere was I?  My attention wavered ...\n\nSo it's baby's birthday, and Mom gives the little bxxxxxd cake loaded with LSD (I'm assuming, 'cause the game goes totally bxxxxxt later), and a broken 3rd-rate pirate knock-off of Teddy Ruxpin.  I was disappointed, 'cause I was kinda hoping he'd be vulgar like the bear from Ted.  Bummer.\n\nSo baby goes exploring and has some adventures, and he finds all these crayon drawings somebody drew (maybe his Mom.  I mean, she IS the one that dosed his cake with LSD).\n\nAnd if you bother to look at the sxxxxy drawings, they kinda tell a story ... if you're into that.  Story's not very clear, 'cause whoever crayoned those pictures can't draw for sxxt.\n\nAnyway, as baby crawls and stumbles around his increasingly twisted and psychedelic home, he starts getting stalked by a monster.  The monster is really scary, so I don't know why baby wasn't screaming hysterically and leaving sxxt-trails everywhere (like I woulda been, had I been in that situation), but I suppose maybe there were downers in the cake too, so baby's fine.  Hides under stuff.  Spies.\n\nEventually you reach the end, and it's poignant and sxxt.\n\nIt's a beautiful game.  It's an original idea.  Never played a baby before.  Story's cool ... what I understood of it from those awful crayonings.  But it's two and half hours long.\n\nThey coulda done a lot more with it.  I hope they have some dlc ...

If you don't feel much empathy for kids or don't like them, than stay away from the game since you really need to have an imagination to enjoy it.","June 3, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

How the real world and its traumas were conceptualized and distorted into this sort of nightmare scenario was very compelling and clever. The general controls, abilities, and movement felt well designed and contributed to the world feeling tangible. I found the areas in the game quite enveloping and endearing in their creepy fashion. The game is quite short, even with the included DLC, and the monsters are a bit bothersome more than scary.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this peculiar perspective for a horror game and would recommend a playthrough (although at a discounted price.)","June 23, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean, in the GAME "Among the Sleep" you play as a baby.  I real life, you may or may not actually be a baby.  I don't know.\n\nThe game, just so you know, only took me about two and half hours to complete.  I'm assuming that's because most babies have the attention span of a squirrel that got one too many jolts from a taser.  I don't speak from experience.  Honest.\n\nWhere was I?  My attention wavered ...\n\nSo it's baby's birthday, and Mom gives the little bxxxxxd cake loaded with LSD (I'm assuming, 'cause the game goes totally bxxxxxt later), and a broken 3rd-rate pirate knock-off of Teddy Ruxpin.  I was disappointed, 'cause I was kinda hoping he'd be vulgar like the bear from Ted.  Bummer.\n\nSo baby goes exploring and has some adventures, and he finds all these crayon drawings somebody drew (maybe his Mom.  I mean, she IS the one that dosed his cake with LSD).\n\nAnd if you bother to look at the sxxxxy drawings, they kinda tell a story ... if you're into that.  Story's not very clear, 'cause whoever crayoned those pictures can't draw for sxxt.\n\nAnyway, as baby crawls and stumbles around his increasingly twisted and psychedelic home, he starts getting stalked by a monster.  The monster is really scary, so I don't know why baby wasn't screaming hysterically and leaving sxxt-trails everywhere (like I woulda been, had I been in that situation), but I suppose maybe there were downers in the cake too, so baby's fine.  Hides under stuff.  Spies.\n\nEventually you reach the end, and it's poignant and sxxt.\n\nIt's a beautiful game.  It's an original idea.  Never played a baby before.  Story's cool ... what I understood of it from those awful crayonings.  But it's two and half hours long.\n\nThey coulda done a lot more with it.  I hope they have some dlc ... "Among the sleep ... with knives" or something.","July 2, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/recommended/250620/","GameReviewsAU","GRAU","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/","45 products in account","It’s hard to know how big an effect a parent’s actions can have on children, until certain mannerisms start to materialise in that child’s behaviour. In Among the Sleep, you’ll be confronted by such scenes that might bring a tear to the eye of parents who play through. I’m not a parent myself, but at the end I couldn’t help staring at the screen in bewilderment of what I had just played through. Read more in our Among the Sleep review below.\n\nHaving just finished watching the film “Room”, I was reminded just how much an adult’s behaviour can impact the lives of their children. Among the Sleep touches on quite a lot of issues that parents face, but more importantly, it takes you on a two-year old toddlers journey through a world of imagination that depicts just how different a child’s perception of their surroundings is.\n\nThere is so much about Among the Sleep’s story that I’d love to talk about, but unfortunately that would involve spoiling the majority of the game. I’m going to do my best to touch upon certain aspects without potentially ruining the experience of those who are yet to play it.\n\nHappy Birthday\nThe beginning of Among the Sleep starts with the toddling protagonist downing a glass of drink. Because of the way you are first seeing the world through the rounded walls of a drinking glass, my first impression was that I might be witnessing a birth scene. But as I moved my mouse around, more and more of the world became visible. Eventually I was left looking at the beaming face of the toddler’s mother. It was the two-year old’s birthday and the mother was preparing a cake.\n\nAs you wait for the cake to be presented to you, you’re given the opportunity to look around the kitchen, and even play with an abacus. Finally mother comes back with the cake and cuts a slice for mister toddler to eat. Unfortunately, before we got to sink our teeth into this tasty looking cake, we were interrupted by a knock at the door of the toddler’s house.\n\nHere’s where the strangeness begins. Distortion lines start to appear around everything and the sound becomes muted. A growing feeling of unease pierces the atmosphere. Just as you’re starting to think you’ve fallen into a scene from Paranormal Activity, the distortion dissipates when you hear the mother shout “NO!”, and slam the door.\n\nBack she comes with a present in her hands and a face conveniently disguised with a big smile. But before you’re allowed to open it, she picks you up and takes you and the present upstairs. You get placed in a playpen and the present is set down upon a chest of drawers. When the mother leaves the room, you gain control of the toddler.\n\nThe usual ‘WASD’ keys control your movement while the mouse is used to look around. Also, ‘left-click’ allows you to interact with objects. Obviously toddlers aren’t known for their jumping prowess, so instead of jump, the ‘space-bar’ allows you climb onto platforms such as chairs and open drawers. Holding ‘shift’ lets you sprint for a short period of time, but instead of being presented with a stamina gauge, you’ll simply fall over when you can no longer keep up the pace. The ‘control’ key drops you to the floor and allows you to crawl through narrow nooks and crannies.\n\nEventually you come across Teddy. A loveable soft toy who accompanies you on your adventure. In the toddler’s mind, Teddy can talk, and informs you that by pressing ‘F’ to cuddle him, you’ll feel safer. What he really means is that he’ll light up and allow you to see in really dark places. To be honest, I was constantly pressing ‘F’ because it gets quite creepy in the dark… Not only is Teddy a provider of light, but he also acts as a guide to the toddler.\n\nPlaying Around\nThe gameplay in Among the Sleep mainly consists of solving puzzles. Each puzzle rewards you with a memory that’s required for progressing to the next area of the game. The puzzles are relatively simple and won’t require a lot of thinking to solve, but the journey involved in solving each puzzle takes you through some incredibly imaginative environments; from dark, creepy playgrounds, to mazes of bookshelves haunted by a tall, crazy-haired, lurching monster.\n\nSpeaking of monsters, you’re not going to find as many of them out in the dark as you believed you would as a child. However, in later areas of the game, the tall monsters will appear more frequently. If they catch you, you’ll be in trouble and have to start again from a previous checkpoint. Thankfully the checkpoints come around often, and you won’t be replaying certain parts of puzzles over and over.\n\nAmong the Sleep incorporates a great physics engine that allows you to open drawers, cupboards, fridges and interact with pretty much anything you can see. Some puzzles and achievements require you to pick up certain items and throw them. This gives things an extra injection of realism and also lengthens the overall gameplay experience.\n\nAn extra little incentive when playing Among the Sleep are the many toddler-like drawings scattered around each area. The drawings depict some scenes we can only imagine are events the toddler has lived through.\n\nAll throughout Among the Sleep, you’ll be followed by a feeling of unease. Teddy will whisper to you that things look dangerous and you should be careful. Creepy sounds and crescendos in the music add a feeling of panic to your journey, and when you first encounter the creepy, tall, crazy-haired monster, you’ll be looking over your shoulder every time you hear something out of the ordinary.\n\nAesthetic Charm\nFrom the moment you are taken upstairs and witness the introduction credits apparate before your eyes in the form of glowing lights, you can tell that you’re in for a visual treat. The graphics have a cartoony feel to them, resembling something you might see in a Pixar film. Everything in the real world is drawn with such bright, vivid colours. Each colour stands out the way you’d imagine a toddler to see them. In contrast, the imaginary world is dark, full of shadows and incorporates creepy distorted shapes to the overall design of things.\n\nPlaying as a toddler, you would expect their movement to be quite wobbly and Krillbite Studios certainly deliver in terms of wobbliness. It definitely injects an extra bit of realism to the character you are playing. Otherwise it might just feel like you’re playing as any FPS character in an overgrown world.\n\nThe soundtrack is eery and coats everything with an unnerving sheen. Sounds and effects raise goosebumps on your skin, especially when the monsters commence their pursuit of your tiny form.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nAmong the Sleep is truly a masterpiece and tells a story we’re all too familiar with. This could be confronting to some, but the way it plays out through the eyes and imagination of a toddler, portrays it in a different light. Those of you who aren’t parents might stop and reflect on the adventure you’ve just played through. Parents might shed a tear or go and give an extra hug to their children.\n\nThe entire game is so smooth to play, and although it only lasts for around three hours, you’ll feel like those three hours just flew by. Krillbite Studios have added Steam achievements to the game, so there’s a bit of replayability in terms of collecting everything and unlocking each achievement.\n\nIf you’re looking for a game that relies more on telling a rich story rather than throwing you deep into an action-packed shootout, Among the Sleep will not disappoint. It’s story will leave you speechless but you won’t be able to help yourself from wanting more.\n\nRead the full review[gamereviewsau.com]","February 29","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Tons of items are intractable and it is surprisingly easy to lose yourself in simple things like stacking blocks or piling toys into chests.\n\nThe monsters in the game are unique and tie very well in to the story – no spoilers, you need to play to the end! There are several moments in the game where the monsters can come after you, but if you are patient and hide well then they can be avoided to some extent.\n\nMy overall score for the game: 10/10.

You really do feel like a baby. You're small slow, and completely defenseless in big forbodding world. Now... I am a horror veteran and this game admittedly managed to creep me out and put me on edge. I had to pause and tell myself "do it you big baby do it!" XD\n\nI love some of the creative visusals in the game. Some places like your home look warm and welcomeing (at first) and other places like the playground look slightly surreal. The sound design is great espcially with headphones. I grew fond of Teddy and his friendly face. A baby and his teddy added a bit of charm and warmth to the other wise dark surroundings.\n\nI have just few gripes with the game. WAY TOO SHORT. I am slow with puzzles, and I take my sweet time exploring. Yet I clocked in at 3 hours. Also while the ending did have twist that I didn't see coming the last chapter is rather anticlimatic.  Not that the ending is bad. I actually liked it. It just could have used a bit more oomph and though.\n\nDespite my two problems I really enjoyed this game.

Not realizing that this game 'could' be based on a true story I decided to give it a gander.\n\nLet me first start off with saying that if you are able to relate to the things this kid goes through, then I feel extremely sorry for you, knowing that your just a couple of steps away from blending in with the Addams family. I would also like to state that I will try my hardest not to ruin any surprises in this game as the game has very 'little' to 'no' replay-ability value.\n\nAfter playing most games I ask myself, 'Am i a better person now for having played it?', more often than not the answer is 'no!' In fact some times its even 'I am worse for having played it'. Not so with this game. In fact I left the game having a better appreciation for certain things than when I entered into it. Here's the beauty of the game and where the game shines. Basically your paying for the experience you get from having played this game and it's concept of making you view life from another perspective, that being said ... a 2 yr old.\n\nHere's where I began to appreciate things more. I began to appreciate how dangerous life is for a 2 yr old, a small puddle is something I can potentially drown in and a drawer in the kitchen is a ladder I can use to get to that toaster which could easily burn my face off.\n\nThat being said, the main enemy in the game is a handful of monsters and the main one being a cross breed between a clump of seaweed, a Triffid and a stick of Broccoli drawn by Timothy Burton. The game has nothing to do with the supernatural, however you do know that with the need of avoiding monsters and finding memories, something must be wrong somewhere.\n\nThe biggest downfall to the game is the controls, they were hardly precise and often felt awkward. For instance the hand icon to show you could interact with an object often appeared even if you were not close enough to 'really' interact with it and the designated controls on a controller for walk or crawl are the same ones needed to rotate handles. Hence instead of rotating you often would spend five minutes not being able to make up your mind if you wanted to walk or crawl on a handle. Granted you can customize controls, but i'm lazy and my idea of going outside is to turn on supermario 64 and get my character to look up into the nice blue sky. Also with the monsters always snapping at your baby feet, every millisecond reaction counts and if an icon appears to say you can interact with something, but you really can't because your not close enough, well it just heightens a players frustration level as they're spine begins to tickle the tonsils of the 'satanic evil brocolli'.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to avoid the monsters. 1) Hide under beds or in confined cupboards 2) Hug teddy so hard you snap it's neck 3) Soil your pants and hopefully the smell will send the monster away. Unfortunately options like lay a couple proximity mines down are not in the game.\n\nThe developers have really gone into quite extensive detail with the game which often gets missed by the players. For instance the mother has a pale skin impression on one of her fingers where a wedding ring would have been. All the books and covers in the game seem to have Japanese writing on them, this is because to a 2 yr old everything would look Japanese would it not?\n\nI would also like to point out that the developers have a 'credit fetish'. Seriously! The longest credits I have ever seen in a game. After the game finished I felt sorry and took my mum out to lunch, when we got back the credits were still rolling. The best part is, I later discovered that those credits were just a prequel to the real credits. After finishing the game you get to play some DLC and then treated to even more credits. Seriously the credits are so long that even the seasons change and winter steps in.\n\nThe game will take you 5 hrs at the max. Most of that will be spent watching credits. There are very few games in the market which force you to think in the shoes of someone else and maybe we need more games like this so that we become more conscientious, tolerant and sympathetic . I really do recommend the game, it's worth the experience, but that experience is not worth $20.00 which is the normal price. Wait for it to go on sale. By the way my mum tried to make me eat broccoli soup once and it did feel a lot like what was going on in the swamp in this game. So yes you could say it's based on a true story...Addams family here I come!","January 8, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The gameplay style is similar to Amnesia. However, this is not a violent/gore-infused game since it clearly involves a toddler (and ripping a toddler apart would be kind of weird). It is a very short game, one that took me about 3 hours to complete (and I take my time sweet with these types of games).\nHowever, this game is definitely worth your time. Even though there is no gore and violence, Among the Sleep definitely captures the essence and perspective of what it is like to be a defenseless toddler and have a wild imagination. The storyline is something that many people can directly relate to and it is a sad reality that many individuals go through/have gone through (I chose not to say anything further in order not to spoil anything). This game's spookiness will surprise you!\nP.S.: Although I thoroughly recommend this game, I suggest you wait until it goes on sale.

Delayed 5 months.\n\nAll of that for 119 minutes of not even actual gameplay, since Steam counted the time I spent in the settings.\n\nAmong The Sleep is a huge disapointment. Not only delivering 2 mere hours of entertainment after so much hype and tease is Ubisoft-level ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery, but the game itself doesn't make it up for it.\n\nAnimations are stiff and clunky, lots of graphic bugs and glitches, textures are low res, particle effects are cheap, audio samples are butchered, the very few objectives present are basic, the maps couldn't be more linear...\n\nOne can see the good ideas Krillbite had. The environments are detailed, the layouts carefully crafted to make you feel oppresed and vulnerable to the darkness. But because the whole game is poorly realised, it just doesn't work. Instead of tension, you feel boredom. Instead of fear, annoyance. And worst: Instead of compassion, the only though that crosses your mind is "Thank God it's over".\n\nClearly Krillbite failed to deliver what the trailer and the demo promised. And after all the means and time they had, I have a hard time understanding how.\n\nI do not recommend Among The Sleep because I wouldn't recommend any $18 game that would only last 2 hours, but if one day you can catch it for free or, let's say, a couple of bucks, going through ATS might be worth the (very short) time to explore the mechanics Krillbite intended to use, and the original take on survival horror that made ATS so appealing in the first place.","June 21, 2014","false","2.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Perhaps you all saw that Kickstarter video where it seemed like a stealth game with high amounts of interactivity in its environment with a dense sense of climbable objects and places to hide? Well, guess what. It's not.\n\nIn fact, nothing is particularly done well here. Any "horror" done in this game consists of only 10 mins of game time hiding from a swamp monster and a coat. Which was all done better in Penumbra and Amnesia anyway. Because even IN THIS GAME any sense of challenge flies out the window when you even the game over screen and are sent RIGHT BACK to a checkpoint with all progress still in. As in any items you got or objects moved etc. are still in the same place. There's no real puzzles. Not a single moment that sticks out. Everything was already done BETTER in other horror games. Even the innovation of being a two year old child falls flat on its face with terrible execution.\n\nThe sound effects are particularly dreadful. The quality ranges from well done to something from a DOS game. You'll get random whistle noises that cut off abruptly. Monster sound effects that sound like they came out of a really bad TMNT cartoon, bottles that sound like bell chimes, and even no sound effects at all! REALLY! You can drop soap and you won't even hear a single thud!\n\nAs far as the story goes. It's the bare ♥♥♥♥ing minimum for being "subtle". A child is being taken away from a drunk parent? It's not like this was easily foreshadowed by the swamp monster 30 minutes in the game. The characters never develop. The incredibly forgettable teddy bear doesn't have a personality. Yet the game tries its hardest to make you FEEL bad for him later. Which you won't feel anything at all because he was merely around to babysit the player and destroy whatever atmosphere the game had.\n\nThe visuals are pretty nice I guess. Each section in the game has its own sense of aesthetics and the scale of being a two year old toddler is well replicated.","May 31, 2014","false","1.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Im only a few hours in and already have my own theory as to what is going on in the game though i hope im terribly wrong.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.

To call it a horror is up to the player. Since there's a flowing narrative and not many survival elements, I think calling it a psychological drama would be more fitting.\n\nWhen I came into the game I was pleasantly surprised at how much detail had gone into the world (after my controls decided to work), and really enjoyed the cartoonish art style. The character models could have been better but that's a minor nitpick.\n\nSomething else I noticed was the lack of deep sentiment in the early stages, and felt somewhat let down. However upon completing the game I realised what this all amassed to and why it seemed so by-the-books. I won't spoil anything but the moments leading up to the game's incredible ending are genuinely enthralling and some of the best I've ever experienced in gaming.\n\nI think the game's ~2 hour length is perfect, as it allows for an incredibly streamlined experience. None of the game feels like filler. I am however disappointed at the slightly disgusting price of £15. Yes, it is an incredible experience, but for 2 hours of gameplay I would never pay more than maybe £8. Of course I made an exception for this as I've been waiting a long time for its release.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a PewDiePie-esque jumpscare fest then I really couldn't recommend this game to you. This game's horror comes from its subject matter and subtlely disturbing imagery. If you're a big fan of explorational games (Dear Esther, Amnesia: AMFP) then I highly recommend it, although I'd wait for a steam sale if I were you.\n\nGraphics: 8/10 (Incredible art style let down by occasional bugs and performance issues)\nSound: 7/10 (Fittingly cheesy voice acting, and good ambient effects, however playing through I can see they missed a few solid opportunities for a good audio scare)\nGameplay: 9/10 (If you like explorational games then this is basically flawless as far as walking around goes. If you don't, its minimalistic mechanics may leave you bored)\n\nOverall: 8/10","May 30, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Perhaps you all saw that Kickstarter video where it seemed like a stealth game with high amounts of interactivity in its environment with a dense sense of climbable objects and places to hide? Well, guess what. It's not.\n\nIn fact, nothing is particularly done well here. Any "horror" done in this game consists of only 10 mins of game time hiding from a swamp monster and a coat. Which was all done better in Penumbra and Amnesia anyway. Because even IN THIS GAME any sense of challenge flies out the window when you even the game over screen and are sent RIGHT BACK to a checkpoint with all progress still in. As in any items you got or objects moved etc. are still in the same place. There's no real puzzles. Not a single moment that sticks out. Everything was already done BETTER in other horror games. Even the innovation of being a two year old child falls flat on its face with terrible execution.\n\nThe sound effects are particularly dreadful. The quality ranges from well done to something from a DOS game. You'll get random whistle noises that cut off abruptly. Monster sound effects that sound like they came out of a really bad TMNT cartoon, bottles that sound like bell chimes, and even no sound effects at all! REALLY! You can drop soap and you won't even hear a single thud!\n\nAs far as the story goes. It's the bare ♥♥♥♥ing minimum for being "subtle". A child is being taken away from a drunk parent? It's not like this was easily foreshadowed by the swamp monster 30 minutes in the game. The characters never develop. The incredibly forgettable teddy bear doesn't have a personality. Yet the game tries its hardest to make you FEEL bad for him later. Which you won't feel anything at all because he was merely around to babysit the player and destroy whatever atmosphere the game had.\n\nThe visuals are pretty nice I guess. Each section in the game has its own sense of aesthetics and the scale of being a two year old toddler is well replicated.","May 31, 2014","false","1.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I will break it down into the things it does well and things it missed this mark on.\n\nPros:\nThe gameplay design is great.  You are faster while crawling, but are also at certain disadvantages for doing so.\nThe design of the environments is also well done which includes sound design!  The locations felt important and palpable.\n\nCons:\nI have to mention length first.  It takes under three hours to beat, and while that alone does not make me hesitant to recommend the game, it does not help.\nThe story is full of foreshadowing which is good, but does so in a way that makes everything incredibly predictable.  The story  exists only to allow for the game to take place.\nThe scariness of the game is incredibly subjective, but I did not feel scared with the exception of one area of the game.  I will not spoil what makes me say this because that would ruin the fear that this game attempts to make you feel.  If you are observant, you will not be scared.\n\n\nI played this game without an Occulus Rift which may be part of my lack of enthusiasm, but it does seem more like a tech demo for this device in its length and environments.  When the price drops on it, it may be worth it.  Twenty dollars seems high for a couple hours of scenery.\n\nI also want to point out that the demo includes the best portion of the game since it occurs before the supernatural/dreamy location.  While some may appreciate the supernatural areas more so (and I agree that it allows for the game to become less predictable as it deviates from reality), I felt that it loses a large part of the empathy required to feel fear.\n","May 30, 2014","false","6.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You have to go around finding these items called"memories",uncovering the truth about your mother in the process.\n\nThe gameplay is really interesting because instead of taking the POV of a normal horror protagonist(say,an adult or teen),it takes place in the POV of a 2 year old toddler.\nYou get a teddy bear as flashlight in the game,which helps with some low-light sections throughout.\n\nThe characters are pretty good,the mother especially because of the creepy things you find out about her(just what tho I won't spoil)\nThe voice acting is well done as well.\n\nThe horror aspects of the game are VERY well done,and managed to scare me more than once(keeping in mind I tend to be brave when playing horror games).\n\nThe game is kind of buggy,but that hardly takes away from the value of the game.\n\nThe game doesn't take too long to complete on your first playthrough(it should take you 2-4 hours or so on average),but everything that's good about the game makes up for that for the most part.\n\n9.5/10 from me :)","October 25, 2014","true","76.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

From some let's play footage or trailers you might think it's "Amnesia" meets "Rugrats."  It's unfortunately not. Calling this a horror game is... generous. Atmospheric to be sure, but a horror game it is not. And it's a damn shame too, as there are plenty of elements that would have made this a perfect mixture of scary and creative.\n\nElements such as pulling out shelves and chairs to reach destinations or hide; a teddy bear that glows to comfort you, but lures monsters; or a running mechanic that makes you trip because you are only 2 years old. Hells yeah I'm all about it.\n\nHowever, this is all meaningless as you will have a total of 2, maybe 3, encounters with a monster. It's mostly you just crawling around with a light source you'll rarely need, finding treasure and looking at beautiful environments. The developers look like they put a lot of effort into the maps, and it looks like they had more planned for the game play with plenty of places to hide.  Unfortunately, most are a pointless decoration.\n\n\nAlso, I saw the story coming a mile away. Maybe that's the point?

First off, the asking price (20$) is entirely too high. As a group, we tried twice to get into this, and just couldn't. Its an interesting idea, but in the end it can be boiled down to basically a walking simulator where you 'find the key' and 'find the door' deal.\n\nPros:\n+Fresh idea\n+Makes you feel like a small child\n+Graphics are decent\n\nCons:\n-Waaayyyyy too high of an asking price\n-The game takes some seriously weird turns. I thought the whole game took place in the house, but it doesn't. You go down like this garbage shoot and enter another world, which is really strange, and I didn't like it.\n-Basis of the gameplay is too simple. You basically just walk through the levels trying to open doors and trigger events. Its not terrible - its just bland and has been done a million times before. At this point (and for this price) I would have liked to see some novelty. Something fresh.\n-While the graphics are nice, there is some parts that odd. Maybe they were done because you are a small child, but I don't think so. Like as an example, you walk by a couch that is entirely too big in comparison to the rest of the room (lamp, coffee table, etc.). It just felt flawed. Or shoes that seemed too big. If it was for the child experience, fine, but I don't think that is the case.\n\nI would definately pass on this one. There are other similiar games that are better (and far cheaper). I paid 10 bucks and have buyers remorse.","March 28, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","1"

One thing being the good 3D graphics, despite the texture quality being a little bit on the low side, losing its 1 point. The game play keeps you on the edge of your seat as a baby having to deal with its mom disappearing due to a metaphorical storyline, making you ponder about all the possibilities. Leading to a climactic ending to which no one could have expected! The puzzles may be simplistic, but only adds to the realism that the main protagonist's mind is still developing as a young baby.

There's hardly any challenge and hardly anything to hide from. Honestly, the scariest thing in this game is probably the baby itself.

The first 20 minutes are really good and drew me into the game completely. The intro with your mother, the teddy and the lead-in to the wardrobe world were great.\n\nHowever, finicky climbing, not being sure if I can fit under things and ultimately not really being able to decipher the rules of the scares make the game a bit of a trudge. It gets really repetitive, even in the short period of time you actually have with the game. The story unfolds itself well and you end up having a good sense of what it has been trying to convey to you, but ends by just slapping you with it, just in case you hadn't figured it out on your own yet.\n\nIt started you off with something great and ultimately goes nowhere with it. The DLC is very much the same, it gives you something really interesting, gets repetitive and goes nowhere.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this at its base price, it's far too short for that. Pick it up on sale if you're curious or give it a miss completely, I'm pretty indifferent to the game.","August 2, 2015","false","4.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

They made a few changes since I last played it in 2014.\n\nThe changes I only noticed was at the finale so they'll be in a spoiler tag.\n\nThe voices during the finale spoken by the mother under the spotlights were unaudioable, I couldn't make out her words in hearing as the caption would suggest. Same goes for the, assuming, father that greets the child. Eventually his voice become difficult to hear. Not sure if it's a hardware issue, a glitch, or the game itself as my computer wasn't able to handle Among the Sleep very well but decent enough to play at least.\n\nHalf way Review. (2 hours)\n\nSome say this is short and overhyped... I'd say "When is this going to be over?! And where is my mommy!?"\n\nSeriously, in a body of a helpless 2 year old, looking for his mother, wondering through a child's imagination nightmare, you begin to wonder what is around that corner, behind the door, or through the window. It may become clear what the creatures represent, but still has you wondering what is happening next.\n\nFinished Review. (4 hours)\n\nAgain I ask, to those saying it's short, how can you possibly make it longer? While it may feel that it should've been longer, it really couldn't.\n\nThis is a game I waited since the demo. I loved the demo. I wish I could've helped with the KS campaign, but couldn't risk sending any funds due to job unsecurity. That's my only regret about this game, not being a backer.\n\nGetting this game as a gift, and playing through it... worth the wait. Absolutely worth the wait. I refused to see any playthroughs of this game until after I played it. And I'm glad I did.\n\nThe sense of danger and paranoia as a toddler, looking for his mother and the memories. You may think you know what's about, but you may be wrong.\n\nSpoilers from here.\n\nDLC Review (+ <1 hour)\n\nNow I'm a bit more confused with the story, the father was abusive to the mother, in turn the mother become child abusive and a drunk, and the child went into foster care or back to the father? While this does explain what happened between the two parents to be seperated in the first place... it makes the main game story confusing for me... was there something I missed?","September 17, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I had not watched any of the trailers or played the demo of this game, and I was pleasantly suprised by the origininality of the idea. Playing as a child really changed the dynamics of the player character. It was fun to crawl and solve simple puzzles like moving furniture to reach a doorknob, tasks that we often overlook as adults. Teddy, your stuffed animal friend, was a great companion. The story was meaningful, and the storytelling was well done (although the last scene kind of throws the mystery in your face, should have kept it ambiguous) The ending could be solved quickly, if you are brave enough to explore, ;) but still did not detract from the terror.\n\nOn the note of criticism, I found it was too easy to avoid the monster, Among the Sleep made it too obvious when the monster was near and gave you ample time to escape. While it wasn't reaally a bad thing, I would have liked to have felt more threatened. I liked the level design but a lot of the scenery got recycled as the game progressed. Like most horror games, Among the Sleep is really linear, limited opportunities to explore.\n\nThe voice acting was great! Nice job! I especially enjoyed the sounds the baby would make. If you fell from high up it would grunt, when near the monster it would breath heavily, and when running away in some moments the baby would squeal with terror. This really helped me sympathize with this poor child and I wish they had included more noises from the baby.\n\nWhile it is from the perspective of a baby, the monster encounters felt all too familiar to other horror games. The idea of playing as a baby is so original, I just wish they would have expanded it to the monster encounters and tried something new. Thankfully, there is very little use of cheap jump scares.\n\nFor the time to play this game (2 hrs) the price tag is WAY TOO HIGH. My gosh... 20 dollars... I'm happy to support the developers and I am also a huge fan of horror, but I would highly recommend waiting to get this game on sale.\n\n\n","September 10, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A frightening and compelling nightmare world, made all the moreso by the fact that you play a two year old child.\n\nthat said, I felt like the twist in the end wasn't well realized. I was sure that things were going a certain way because, in my view, the entire game was setting you up to believe in a certain scenario. when it turned out otherwise it didn't have the impact it could have, because there is exactly zero foreshadowing in the beginning of the game. all of the foreshadowing portends the scenario I thought was going to take place, but didn't. frankly sometimes I think games nowadays try to shoe horn these twists in because it's the thing to do, but (and I felt this a little with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter) it would have been just as good if not better if played straight.\n\nSome gameplay quibbles include how damn difficult it is to turn anything with the mouse.","June 19, 2015","true","9.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A frightening and compelling nightmare world, made all the moreso by the fact that you play a two year old child.\n\nthat said, I felt like the twist in the end wasn't well realized. I was sure that things were going a certain way because, in my view, the entire game was setting you up to believe in a certain scenario. when it turned out otherwise it didn't have the impact it could have, because there is exactly zero foreshadowing in the beginning of the game. all of the foreshadowing portends the scenario I thought was going to take place, but didn't. frankly sometimes I think games nowadays try to shoe horn these twists in because it's the thing to do, but (and I felt this a little with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter) it would have been just as good if not better if played straight.\n\nSome gameplay quibbles include how damn difficult it is to turn anything with the mouse.","June 19, 2015","true","9.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's an interesting experience, absolutely dripping with atmosphere. Playing as a toddler in a scary world, and knowing you're defenseless, is a very eye-opening and unique experience. All of this is brought together to tell an interesting and troubling story from the eyes of someone who doesn't understand the world.I'm not typically a fan of horror games, but this one just seemed so unique that I had to Kickstart it, and the final product does not disappoint.\n\nA few warnings to make sure you know what you're buying:\n\n1. Among the Sleep is really short - you can finish it and get 100% achievements in less than three hours, and it doesn't have any replay value unless you want to revisit the exact same experience months or years down the road.\n\n2. I ran into a few bugs in my short time with the game (version 1.01). Most of these were small graphical glitches that almost added to the surreal experience, but one actually prevented me from progressing. I spent twenty minutes or so trying to figure out how I was supposed to move forward before finally looking it up and seeing that I had encountered a bug. There is an in-game option to go to the last checkpoint, which I was able to use to fix this while only replaying about three minutes of the game, so it wasn't too bad, but the game is still in an early stage where you might hit a problem now and again.\n\n3. I've seen at least one person in the forum complain that this brought up bad memories from their childhood. Presumably the subject matter advertised for the game should be enough to let you know if this will be a problem. It's a horror game where you play as a two year old, so keep that in mind if you have childhood trauma that could resurface.","June 2, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the game the mother is portrayed as a scary lady and she screams and grabs you at random times and the only way for her not to get you is to hide, which keeps you scared the whole time. Also the detailing throughout the game is very good like giving off hints to show hoe the mother really was to the child. For example there was drawings on the walls that shoed the mothers actions towards the child and alcohol bottles were thrown everywhere showing her addiction. The down side of this game was how it ended and it was very difficult to see and move around sometimes since it was in the dark. The game ended by the toddler just opening the door to his father and his mother was left in the kitchen crying.","April 6","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A frightening and compelling nightmare world, made all the moreso by the fact that you play a two year old child.\n\nthat said, I felt like the twist in the end wasn't well realized. I was sure that things were going a certain way because, in my view, the entire game was setting you up to believe in a certain scenario. when it turned out otherwise it didn't have the impact it could have, because there is exactly zero foreshadowing in the beginning of the game. all of the foreshadowing portends the scenario I thought was going to take place, but didn't. frankly sometimes I think games nowadays try to shoe horn these twists in because it's the thing to do, but (and I felt this a little with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter) it would have been just as good if not better if played straight.\n\nSome gameplay quibbles include how damn difficult it is to turn anything with the mouse.","June 19, 2015","true","9.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

HE CAN MOVE OBJECTS LIKE CHAIRS AND WOODEN BOXES BY HIMSELF!\nThis baby will probaly be "superman" later.\nYour best friend is a teddy, who gives light. (So basically a glow in the dark teddy bear)\nTeddy is sometimes very quiet, even on some locations that he should be talking.\nTHE GAME IS QUITE SHORT.\n\nI give this game a 9/10","August 27, 2015","true","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story is great, the monster encounters are exciting, unbearably tense, and are actually challenging unlike Amnesia The Dark Descent. Above all, Among the Sleep is incredibly creative and, despite its dark atmosphere, is very sentimental and succeeds in making the player feel like a little kid again.\n\n\nPROLOGUE DLC REVIEW:\n\nAmong the Sleep comes with free DLC, which is a prologue which adds about an hour of gameplay mean to be played after the main campaign. Prologue is a skillfully designed addition to Among the Sleep and makes itself stand out from the campaign in several ways:\n\n- A chilling winter atmosphere, which is refreshingly different\n- Improved puzzles which require more thought to solve than what was seen in the campaign\n- Thoroughly creepy dolls to collect\n\nPrologue also expands upon the campaign's story, although since it's a prequel there is sadly no Teddy to keep you company. Prologue is actually very similar to Penumbra: Requiem, a mission pack/sequel to Penumbra: Black Plague. In Requiem there are no monsters to encounter, only environmental hazards and puzzles to solve. Prologue's only fault is that is pointlessly throws in a new monster which is a complete joke and takes the player out of their immersion. Considering that is all Prologue does wrong and the many other things it does right, it is a great bit of free DLC. Give it a go if you've played the campaign.","June 2, 2015","true","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Decent atmosphere but overall dull material.\n\nPros:\n1. Good atmosphere with great visuals and sound effects\n2. The storyline is sort of intriguing\n3. The free DLC, the Prologue, was cool\n4. Unique perspective\n\nCons:\n1. The storyline, although intriguing, was overall dull and disappointing\n2. Just wasn't interactive enough\n3. Not creepy enough for the horror genre\n4. (Now this is just nitpicking) The 2-year old in the game does not reflect a real-life 2-year old.\n\nWhen you find a horror game "not creepy enough" it's kind of hard to recommend it. If there was a fun mechanic about it or a really cool storyline then maybe this could be overlooked. However, that is not the case here with Among the Sleep. Overall, the material felt dull and underwhelming. If they were to make a new game along the lines of the free DLC, the Prologue, then I could probably get on the "recommended" wagon. There are better horror experiences to be had elsewhere. Quite a disappointment, this one!","May 18","false","5.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

More like "Among the Trash!"  ~Oscar Wilde\n\nAmong the Trash Is where this game belongs. It's an interesting concept, but the story has a dumb, predictable twist, and the game is so full of bugs and glitches that it's hard to even get immersed. It's possible the developers may have patched it since I last played it, but is it too much to ask that your two hour walking simulator at least works properly on release?\n\nLet me paint you a picture: There's a game with three characters, and a monster. There are several clues that the monster is supposed to be a metaphor for someone, so logically it'd have to be one of the characters. Is it:\n\nA: The protagonist\n\nB: The character that never leaves the protagonist's side\n\nor\n\nC: A character who is absent for 95% of the game\n\nHmm, I wonder who will be revealed to be secretly a terrible human being in the shoehorned in twist ending?\n\nIt's another "great idea ruined by hack writers" scenario. I'm disappointed. Oh well, into the trash it goes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FArDg0bfjBQ&t=0m30s","April 25","false","2.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

Any more story elements I lay out for you will completely destroy the story for you.\n\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay consists of basic aspects such as crawling, running, object throwing and simple puzzles.\n\nThe walking animation is by far the best thing in this game :)\n\nAll jokes aside, the gameplay is simple yet fun and this is probably one of the first horror games with a defenceless protagonist that actually makes sense….\n\n\nGraphics\nThe visuals in Among the Sleep were impressive for an indie game running on the Unity engine, unlike most Unity based games there wasn’t any motion blur that was over powering me while I played, this feature can get quite annoying so Im glad they opted out of that idea.\n\nThere was one instance in the game were an object I needed to collect for progression didn’t actually fall down after hitting it sooo in order to continue I had to use a no clip console command to get it…\n\nLater the game crashed and luckily they had a checkpoint before as when the game reloaded I was able to collect the object correctly.\n\nOther than a few bugs here and there the game looked amazing and it really did feel like I was actually in this house, which for me made the experience that much more enjoyable.\n\n\nSound Design\nThe sound design in this game played an extremely important part, with ambient sound alone adding yet another layer of creepy to the environment which helped pull off a horror type experience.\n\nSome sounds that would appear to be scare sounds, weren’t scary at all but seemed placed there to keep you on your toes which I thought was a neat inclusion.\n\nRather than trying to scare you constantly throughout the game, Krillbite decided to ease you into scares which if you havnt seen part 5 of my playthrough I would strongly recommend you go watch that, to get a real understanding as to what I am referring to.\n\nP.S. I nearly flew out of my chair\n\nVerdict\nAlthough there was a decent amount objects clipping through walls here and there… the core game didn’t get effected by this and the creepiness of this game grasped me in and made me want to understand what was going on in this world.\n\nWhich for a horror game is a great step up from the rest… and well you’re a 2 year old with a talking teddy what more can you ask for.\n\nBugs and issues aside, Among the Sleep was a solid indie game developed by Krillbite Studios and seeing as this is their first game… they didn’t do a whole lot wrong.\n\nThat is why Among the Sleep gets an 8/10.\n","November 22, 2014","true","7.4"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

It's okay.  It's certainly not a horror game and the "twists" are painfull obvious.  The atmosphere is really nice and I really like the concept, but it feels like the game is trying to be scary without anything that's actually scary.  You don't encounter an enemy until you're 3/4 through the game, and if an enemy catches you it merely resets you about 10 feet back from where you were caught and now the enemy no longer spawns, meaning there's no punishment for being caught and therefore no tension.  There are also quite a few issues with textures clipping through each other, partciuarly with your characters hands when climbing.  The graphics aren't spectacular.  Opening drawers shows a clearly flat texture, with no attempt to make anything inside the drawer look remotely 3D.  It's also incredibly short, no more than an hour and a half long.  It has charm, it's atmospheric but it falls flat in a number of areas.  Only get it if it's on sale.","November 20, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first I didn't know what to make of it, considering its from the perspective of a toddler and was leery about getting it on that merit alone however I am extremely glad I got over it. The unique perspective of the toddler really lends to the whole story portrayed throughout the game. (sorry no spoilers :) ) DLC really does expand upon the story and though it does leave a couple more questions in the mind for possible more DLC later on down the road, what it does add does make you pause and blink. I know I did.\n\nPros:\n*Unique perspective of the toddler + eye level items ( makes you have to *THINK* to get around some obstacles you'd normally just walk up to and click, in other games)\n\n*Dispite being a first person camera perspective, the shaking/movement animations do *not* incite the usual motion sickness nausea that usually accompany's such "realistic" perspective in a game. I contribute this to this game being VR compatible and that it must have gotten play tested very well to look for such problems for VR users. (don't know how many games utilize this first person camera perspective and because the camera is going EVERYWHERE, its a game I cannot play in one sit thru. Among the Sheep, does *NOT* have this problem. Was able to play through it in one sitting with much enjoyment had.)\n\n*Ambience + level music lends more to the suspense/horror as you play. ( If I'm not mistaken some of the undertones are suppose to supposedly resonate with the player to highten this suspense. Probably mistaken but if your ears are keen or have heard those tones before that may influence mood, might make the same mistake in thinking the undertones are the same. *shrug*)\n\n*The drawings, pictures and monsters = story line goodness (try and see them all!). Especially if playing pretty much uninterrupted by RL things, the monsters (there's technically two if take into consideration the DLC) really lend to the feeling of dread and will probably have you either shock/startle when they appear, or hiding in a closet from a meer noise that might possibly somehow in a far flung galaxy be indication that the monster's coming to possibly eat you, or whatever it does when the screen turns black! ( dun dun Dun!)\n\n* Teddy Bear Companion. This little guy, how they put him throughout the game, there's always this nagging feeling, just by how he talks, what he asks of your character, if you should trust him. I think because of the way the companion was made and what it adds to the game, you do have that added layer that some games lack in creating attachment to sidekicks.\n\n*Graphics=Awesome. There's not much more to be said on that point, provided you have your settings at the optimum for your system and calibrated the gamma correctly to give that spooky look, you're gonna have a great time. Even the pieces of wood have breakpoints and lines, the detail on the items the toddler has to crawl over you can tell someone put a lot of work into those little points that really bring out the mental mind trip Alice in wonderland vibe. ( Makes you almost wonder what exactly was in that happy birthday baby bottle at the begining before the cake!  Ha.)\n\nCons\n\nUnfortunately, with how much I *loved* playing this game. I did find two picky little Cons.\n\n* End Credits. Awesome to pay respect to all the backers from ever and always but it does make the credits uber long to sit through. Took me a good few times of pressing escape before being able to get out of the long list of credits. Sitting though the whole thing on the DLC, took enough time to get up, get a drink, go use the washroom and come back in enough time for it to still be going through the R names. LOL. Certainly there has to be an easier way on the main interface to give all the backers and such recognition than a long scroll screen where its hard to catch all their names, but again, like I said. "that's me being picky."\n\n* DLC is a little hard to find. At first I didn't realize it had downloaded DLC when I first booted up the game. If it wasn't for beating the game and deciding to go back and replay some chapters, I wouldn't know that the DLC is listed in the Chapter Selection, portion of the main menu and I may have missed out on playing some EPIC DLC. The extra story the DLC adds on, especially if you play it AFTER the main game, makes one sit back and go Dayuum.\n\nOverall this is a great game and I recommend it, especially if you have time to dedicate going through an entire playthru uninterrupted. Another time I tried playing it, and I constantly had to set it down and pick it back up again, really had not as many of the features pop out or strike me as the first time, when well, you've been playing it for hours and all that ambience has gotten to you. HA! :)  I really recommend playing the DLC after the Main game, for a different perspective on the game story. I played it both with DLC first, then main game, and also Main game with DLC after. Found doing it one way over the other, tends to lend itself to one verson of understanding the story while doing the other, makes one almost ponder a complete nother.  As to what I'm talking about! Play the game! can you note the difference I"m speakin' of?\n\nLady","November 22, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I went into Among the Sleep with minimal information, I just saw that you played as a infant, and I knew I had to have it. The adventure that followed starting from 12 to around 3 in the morning some might say was shortlived, however I loved every bit of it. The atmosphere, symbolism, and thought that this game provokes stemming from the question of what is real and what is imagination from the point of a two year old was comparable in complexity to the ending of Bioshock Infinite. I also find it comparable to movies such as American Psycho and Donnie Darko in the same way. Not everyone will have the same interpretation, although I have heard very good ones in the forums. If you expect from this game cheap jumps scares or award winning graphics or action, look somewhere else. This game is more of an allegory within a haunting art form, and I will fondly remember those nearly three hours I spent on this game, as  I will also remember what I took away.","November 23, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is very unique in concept. First off, you play as a toddler, so your abilities and interactions are extemely limited, as you would expect. This works very well with this horror genre, as it truely does make you feel vulnerable. Also, because you are a toddler, you have a big imagination, and this is how the levels are designed. Sounds good, right? A childs imagination = endless possibilities for level design. However, it feels like the developers are no so experienced in level design, and are better versed in art. The levels are linear and the puzzles are too basic and simple. However, a counter-argument can be made that the puzzles are suppose to be easy because a toddler is suppose to be capable of solving them. Fair enough. The game also feels to be design to appease a broad audience, including the "casual gamer", so its understandable that the levels are easy and the game short. The graphics are not amazing by any means, and doesn't feel optimized. Maxed out, the game often times dipped below 30 FPS on my GTX 780 rig. Thats completely unexceptable performance for a game of this graphical intergrity.  All in all, I felt pretty disappointed in this game...Until the ending.\n\nWithout giving out any spoilers, the ending to this game, makes the game. It serves as a reminder that video games are an amazing medium for story telling. The ending had be stunned and a bit choked up, and makes you realize all the tiny details you missed out while playing the game, much like how the movie "The Sixth Sense" did. The imaginative game is very symbolic and heartfelt.\n\nI highly reccomend this game. For everyone, anyone. Even for those that don't play games often. The simple mechanics and controls makes this very possible.","December 26, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll start off by saying if you're a big fan of jumpscare horrors than this game IS NOT for you. The game uses creepy atmospheres and frightening visuals to scare you. If you're looking for a long game, this is also NOT for you. The game itself is about 3-4 hours long (depending on how cautiously you play).\n\nI do feel that there is some wasted opportunity here to be honest. The game places you in the role of a sweet, care-free baby that is plunged into a dark twisted world. The game's story may appear loose and almost non-existent at parts but there is a sudden realisation during the game of everything that has been going on, and everything will definitely make sense once you reach the end of the game. The ending really makes the game in my opinion.\n\nI played the game feeling slightly on edge the whole time, having not figured out the game's style yet. I think the fact it is so short almost helps it. You never get a chance to figure out how this game is going to scare you until you've already finished it.\n\nOverall a fun and creepy game, but shouldn't really be classed as a 'horror' in the traditional sense, but it will give you a scare here and there.\n\nTL;DR 10/10 N0 SC0P3R B4BY","December 26, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Literally, it will take only about an hour, and little more than that, to beat and there really isn’t anything to go back through for as far as gameplay/replay is concerned, but the developers just added a prologue chapter (to be played after the regular game is completed) as free DLC, so that kind of makes up for what the game is lacking in.\n\nGranted, this is a game wherein the protagonist is a 2 yr. old boy (so you wouldn't expect overly difficult puzzles) that stumble-walks/crawls his way through dark, mysterious environments with his talking/walking hug-it-to-light-your-way teddy bear, looking for objects to unlock memories related to what is ultimately going on - not gonna specify on that and spoil anything for anyone who hasn’t played this yet, so just play and find out for yourself (it will be worth it in the end as this is a psychological/pseudo-horror game and the revelation is truly heartbreaking --- this is something I felt the developers conveyed to the gamer wonderfully well).\n\nI definitely recommend this game when you can get it on sale for at least 50% off, and the graphics and especially the sound design are pretty good and work well with the game’s theme, but it mostly just feels like a ‘good start’ for the developers and there needs to be more of a game next time around.

It could easily have been ruined by a misguided attempt to extend gameplay, but thankfully, it doesn't overstay its welcome. It is possible to get very slightly lost in a couple areas, but none of the them are really big enough for this to reach frustrating levels. It is pretty much always clear what you need to do--the tricky part is typically steeling yourself to leave the safety of your hiding spot and do it. Saying this game has "puzzles" is a bit of stretch. There is nothing in this game that would strain the ingenuity of --ahem-- a two-year old. At times it feels a little like a walking simulator, scary hiding sections nonwithstanding. None of the above is meant as a bad thing; this is a story-oriented game, and its gameplay mechanics serve the story admirably.\n\nMany have commented on its similarity to works by Frictional Games, such as Amnesia. And yes, it is true that this game emphasizes your vulnerability and requires you to hide a lot, but really, what do want when the protagonist is a 2-year old? A baby bazooka? The world in this game is strange, magical, and often frightening, just as two-year old would see it. The mundane is new and interesting, rules are arbitrary, and frightening things really can hurt you. Any little kid knows this, which is why most of them will start crying over things which seem inconsequential or at least managable to adults. The sense of tension and the mechanics are very similar to the style pioneered by the folks at Frictional, but this game makes those mechanics its own, and the feeling of the game is quite different.\n\nI'd estimate it will take you between 1.5-3 hours to finish this game, depending on how personally vulnerable you are to this particular brand of horror--if you just go straight through, it is possible to finish very quickly, but you could very well spend half your playtime exploring the nooks and crannies of the gameworld, or cowering under tables and chairs. Possibly my biggest quibble with the game is that there isn't more opportunity to do more of the first. It does make for a more focused game experience, but I enjoyed the little details they built in, and would have liked to have seen more of them. (The playroom in the beginning had a nice variety of toys, but why weren't there more things in the house to make a mess with?) The interacting controls are Amnesia-style, and sometimes a bit clunky, especially when trying to do fine manipulation. I could write this off as an accurate reproduction of a child's manipulation skills, but I think the controls just needed more work from the development team.\n\nGraphically, the game is not ultra-realistic, but nonetheless very pretty. There is a slight issue with clipping, but it's not terrible, and it certainly doesn't affect the gameplay. Teddy, in my opinion, looks unnecessarily creepy, but perhaps talking teddy bears are just instrincally creepy.\n\nDon't let any of my minor criticisms turn you off. It won't be everyone's cup of tea (nothing is), but this is an excellent game, and it may perhaps leave you with slightly more empathy for any young children you may know. I found it deeper than most video games, and very scary. I highly recommend it.","January 16, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The atmosphere is perfect, the gameplay is pretty fun, controls are smooth and feel good. The story is, just holy ♥♥♥♥. The ending alone makes this game worth it. Only if you're a hardcore fan of horror and very atmospheric games. The music, sounds, everything is amazing, but $17.99(Price as of the writing of this review-$19.99 after sale) is not worth the content. For me it was worth it because I want to support them, I loved the game, and I'm a diehard horror fan. I also had money to spare. If I wasn't super hyped about this game I'd probably have avoided it knowing the gameplay is only about 2 hours.\n\nFor that reason I honestly can't recommend this game. If the price was lower I'd say everyone needs to play it, but for $20 you could pick up more than 1 game, which will last longer. If the price goes down then I'll gladly say yes, I recommend this. Honestly I do recommend it, but the price is just too steep. I did a let's play/walkthrough of the game for anyone who doesn't have the money to afford the game, or doesn't want to spend the money for only 2 hours of content. Not to mention I feel they missed out on a lot of opportunities. The Teddy could've been more useful than to open one door, press one button, and be a glow stick. Not to mention he could've been used to include more varieties of puzzles and gameplay mechanics.\n\nFinal word: Game is amazing, unique idea, fun, atmospheric, creepy as hell, and amazing. However, the price is far too high for this level of content, and I feel it fell short in terms of some gameplay mechanics. Teddy (Your bear companion) is only used as a light and only opens one door the entire game. He also presses a button that never moves so. Feel they missed a big opportunity to include many more puzzles and options for gameplay.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c5Tx77TIL4&feature=youtu.be","June 2, 2014","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The survival horror genre excels at making players feel uncomfortable due to an increased sense of vulnerability the fact that you play as a toddler is Among the Sleep's most unusual characteristic, and also one of its best. This isn't just a first-person game in which the camera is lower to the ground than it would be if you were playing as an adult. When you walk, your steps feel unsteady; you can get around more quickly by crawling, but walking has its advantages. On foot, you can drag objects around, and you can open drawers, which you often need to clamber up onto in order to reach doorknobs or get to higher areas.

That was just...I dunno. It's 70% wow and 30% meh for me.\n\nI'm not really an expert in horror games since this is the first of the genre that I've ever played but, I have to admit, I was kind of disappointed because I had expected more . I had expected there to be some fighting or kicking ♥♥♥, whichever you prefer, but there weren't any. I wanted there to be epic teddy bear transformations and bedroom weapons, but we can't all have what we want. There was a lot of hiding involved though and bottles. Boy, were there a lot of bottles. There were also jumpscares here and there, but they were okay. If you wanna know how scary it is, think of a really short rollercoaster ride. This game kind of struck me as a combination between Slender and the movie "Mama". You'll figure out why once you've tried it out.\n\nThe graphics and sounds were nice enough, but the story was something else altogether. Mind you, it was great and different, but it was no fairytale. I was able to put two and two together during the first chapter, but I wasn't able to figure out the whole story until the very end, even if there were lots of clues laid out throughout the game.\n\nOverall, it was fun and well worth a try.  I don't know about the price though since it's kind of short. Maybe you can buy it when it goes on sale if you're hesitant about purchasing it.","November 28, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's okay.  It's certainly not a horror game and the "twists" are painfull obvious.  The atmosphere is really nice and I really like the concept, but it feels like the game is trying to be scary without anything that's actually scary.  You don't encounter an enemy until you're 3/4 through the game, and if an enemy catches you it merely resets you about 10 feet back from where you were caught and now the enemy no longer spawns, meaning there's no punishment for being caught and therefore no tension.  There are also quite a few issues with textures clipping through each other, partciuarly with your characters hands when climbing.  The graphics aren't spectacular.  Opening drawers shows a clearly flat texture, with no attempt to make anything inside the drawer look remotely 3D.  It's also incredibly short, no more than an hour and a half long.  It has charm, it's atmospheric but it falls flat in a number of areas.  Only get it if it's on sale.","November 20, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many people give negative feedback to this game since it doesn't have a scary approach, but this game differs from your normal horror game. It has a powerful and unique inner meaning and the noises you hear throughout the game are horrifying. I felt anxious and slightly afraid during certain parts of the game and the graphics are actually quite impressive.

There's a reason I don't play a lot of horror games. But I watched the rest of it on youtube and I gotta say, this game is absolutely genius. So many things to love about it, in terms of both narrative and gameplay. If you've ever been reading and come across something profound and your reaction is "yes! someone else said it!", you'll have a lot of moments like that during this game if you think through the implications of what you're being shown.\n\nThe horror comes in two flavors: gentle suggestion of a threat that causes you to scare yourself via the power of imagination, and actual Slender-esque sequences that will result in a game over. We get the former exclusively for about the first 2/3rds of the game, and it works extremely well although it might wear out it's welcome if the player decides that the game is all bark and no bite. However, after a seemingly arbitrary point you will start dying, and it will seem random and arbitary, which is of course jarring as hell once you're good and tired of the game being harmless. My only issue with this is that you aren't given any indication that this change has happened, and the advice on how to deal with it came 20 or 30 minutes ago. Basically just try not to make noise since that's what usually causes the Groots to spawn, and if they spawn anyway just run.\n\nAll-around it's a genius game and I hope it gets some quality imitators. 10/10 would reccomend.","January 27, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a wee two year old toddler navigating a world which appears nightmarish to your infant eyes. Many people will be reminded immediately of the Penumbra series when it comes to world interaction (chests, drawers, opening doors, object manipulation).\n\nArtistically, this game is lovely to look at. Coats, boots and everyday objects are made out to be creatures in the dark or stylized into the creatures themselves. The baby's room is well done and being able to look down and see your tiny self fidgeting like a child might actually do in reality is a neat little thing to include. The mother looks fantastic and the lighting sets the mood for the rather dark and sad story they are telling.\n\nThis is where we get into spoilers. The gist of the story is that the creatures from your nightmares are actually your mother and, from what I am guessing, either your father or some form of social services worker. As you might have guessed from that last sentence, your mother is losing you. The symbolism that is put forth in the child's drawings scattered around the level was an interesting inclusion to go along with the theme of child abuse, alcoholism and misunderstanding that children have when these things happen really sealed this up into a gem.\n\nSeeing your mother in the floor of the kitchen, your bear in one hand and wine glass in the other weeping left me cold inside at the end. Realising that the witch in the well from your children's story is your mother and her alcoholism struck a chord and is relatable I'm sure to many people growing up from all walks of life.\n\nThis is easily a gem and worth it at any price.\nNot really a horror title as I thought it might be more-so, but actually something much deeper and more meaningful.","January 5, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The great thing about indie studios is that they bring you experiences that are truly different, and Among the Sleep is no exception. No combat, no complicated puzzles, just the experience of how it feels to be a baby and not truly understand the world. It is a sad story, but poignant. It is a little on the short side however, and some of the level design is a little more odd than scary. But there are some very tense moments that make the experience worthwhile. A big plus as well is that it is a horror game without gore or demonism, so if those things typically put you off about this genre don't worry, you won't find them here.","December 25, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whilst it's a little clunky and can be beaten in just a couple of hours, it more than makes up for that by sheer force of concept.\n\nIf the idea has been tried before then I haven't seen it. A horror game told from the point of view of a 2-year old. Genius! They find things scary that we don't, and so you end up in a world which heavily blurs the line between reality and imagination. Ever thought innocent objects made scary shadows in the middle of the night? Well, here they do!\n\nThe level design is very well crafted and you rarely find yourself wandering round in circles looking for something to do. It's a little linear in places, but you feel more like you're being guided in the right direction rather than simply being on rails.\n\nHowever, it's taken six months since release for me to be able to actually play the game as it's been absolutely infested with bugs. One showstopping glitch made it impossible for me to even complete the first chapter, hence the negative review I originally posted here. I still have minor bugs including achievements not working, but at least the game is now completable for me. If it works for you, it's a fascinating original game. Try the demo first to see if it works for you. As one of the original Kickstarter backers it's made me wary about pledging towards the developer's next project though...","July 22, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Even though I figured out everything by the second painting, I felt it did a good job getting the whole feel across from a young child's perspective.\n\nThe game isn't really scary, although it conveys the same sort of childhood 'spookiness' that a dark house and strange sounds bring.  That is it's greatest strength, conveying a nightmare from a child's perspective -- full of strange places and monsters.  This emersion is then quickly ruined by the addition of the damn teddy bear pulled out of some children's show who you HAVE to take with you and who ruins everything.\n\nIt controlls well, looks good, and conveys a feeling of helplessness that a two-year old child would have along with the potential havoc and trouble a two-year old can get into.  At least, until the bear opens his stupid mouth again.\n\nI can't state this enough, but the bear ruins the whole experience by talking.  Listening to him suffer in the washing machine or trying to hang on to you is one thing; I hated him from the get-go but even I felt bad for him at those points.  If they cut out his dialogue and just left him emotion he would have been an excellent companion, but as implemented he screams "HELLO YOU ARE IN A GAME WITH TALKING BEAR WHO POINTS OUT THE OBVIOUS".\n\nThe game is short, and it would have been a nice bit of art if everyone would learn to shut up.  As is, I think some people will enjoy it a lot and ultimately what it does well it does well enough that I can forgive the rest.\n\nThis game is NOT for you if:\n1. You are immune to childhood fears\n2. You want a long game (I've logged 3 hrs and that includes taking the time to write swears in blocks)\n3. You want a scary game (unless you are very vulnerable to childhood fears, in which case this is for you)\n4. You hate physics puzzles\n\nThis game IS for you if:\n1. You are vulnerable to childhood fears and like being haunted by them.\n2. You enjoyed the demo (despite how badly the bear ruins the experirence)\n3. You like 'artistic' game experiences and an interactive way of telling a story.\n\nI'm personally in the middle, and would have recommended this stronger if the bear was mostly mute as well.","December 12, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since I love the promise of horror games like this, and because I play most games for the story anyway, of course I had to play this one.\n\nAfter reading several of the reviews about how short the game is, how scary it is, and how interesting the storyline is, I have to say that after playing, I found that none of those things were true.\n\n…Okay okay, so I lied. Yeah, it was scary. I was afraid. It doesn’t take much anymore. I used to be tougher… *ahem* But the thing many reviewers seemed to be saying was how vulnerable they felt while playing as a young child without a weapon, how they couldn’t move very fast, etc. Actually, instead of making me feel vulnerable, this aspect made me feel MORE secure. First, I’m a BABY, so I didn’t imagine I had bloody death to fear. Who is going to make a game like that? Second, I’m tiny! Who can even see me?? I’m crawling around and hiding under things! And yes, I spent most of the game doing this. I’m pretty sure that most of the time, I was not even hiding from anything at all. Which brings me to my second untruth.\n\nThe game is short. Yes, it’s pretty simple, but the thing (for me) was that I kept hiding and just sitting there going ‘what was that??’ and thinking I needed to run and hide in the cabinet at every little sound, that I actually managed to get 10+ hours out of it. …Okay so maybe that’s not an accomplishment. Like I said, I spent a lot of time hiding from a monster that I’m pretty sure wasn’t even around when I thought it might be, but that was part of what made the game scary. I didn’t exactly know what was after me for a long time, and I spent quite a while just hiding out and praying that nothing would jump out at me. I was doing pretty well until the first time I had an ‘it’s right behind me!’ experience, which gave me trust issues with the game that I couldn’t quite get over. Moving on.\n\nThe storyline… I thought I’d get to be clever and say that I had the story figured out within the first 5 minutes. (Not the whole story, but the story behind the story…story. Yeah.) But as the game went on, and after I had gotten my first close encounter with the monster, I had to change my theory, but only slightly. I was pretty close, and really, the story isn’t complicated at all. If you pay attention to the clues, you can figure it out.\n\nSo, overall, I say that the game is worth experiencing – maybe even more in the way it was meant to be played, in 3D. I bought it during the summer sale for 15% off, but honestly, like others, I’m not sure it was really worth what I paid. So, yeah, it was fun, scary, and if you’re a fan of horror games check it out, but don’t expect anything profound.","July 1, 2014","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like... I loved the game.  But it feels unfinished in a few places.  I won't give away any plot but I will say a few things I find important.\n\nfirst off the pros.  This game does a fantastic job of setting up an atmosphere.  I honestly got extremely emersed in the world by the end of the game and at a few moments I felt like my bones were about to jump right out of my skin.  The story may seem dull at first, but the ending will leave you wanting to go through the game again for sure to pick up on things you might have missed.  Scary parts are pretty scary and a couple of jump moments really make the game a fantastic experience.\n\nNow the cons.  first off, the game is way too short.  I mean I literally beat the whole thing in around 2 hours.  Part of this is because the puzzles are very simple and don't require a lot of thought.  It felt very from point A to point B and while this normally works for horror games, I didn't feel like anything was stopping me from plowing on ahead.  this is because the game takes its time with setting up the horror moments.  Similar to Amnesia the game takes about an hour or so to actually get to the meat and potatoes.  This works for amnesia because the game is long and takes time.  However I didn't first encounter anything scary until I was 70% through the game. (other than one moment) and that sort of ticked me off.\n\nSo over all I think this game is fantastic.  However at $19.99 that is robbery.  the game is worth about $5-$8.  So many things  could have been improved on including more lore and more reason to explore.  The only things you find are drawings which you can't even collect, just look at as you pass.  Overall if you love horror games and appreciate a good story with a fantastic plot twist this game is a must.  I also feel it's perfect for an intro horror game as the game isn't too long and isn't ♥♥♥♥ your pants scary.  Of course get it at the right price.","July 1, 2014","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Among The Sleep is not one of those games. Here you're put into the blue jammies of a 2-year-old scared and confused little kid. The perspective alone makes a world of difference. Everything is more scary when you can't quite orientate yourself, tables become insurmountable objects and hallways become mile-long catacombs. There's also the fact that as a toddler you're weak, literally, so moving things becomes slow and difficult. And with your short legs outrunning danger becomes nigh impossible. I could go on a while as to why being a baby is scary stuff... And this game executes the experience very well. Coupled with a nebulous but interesting story, awesome visuals and terrifying design on everything. Yeah, it's a success. My only complaint is that it could've been a little bit longer.","July 2, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, a little. But really this is just crawling around and solving a few minor puzzles. Nothing really that challenging here.\n\nStory wise it's meh and the ending was not so great. Also it left some questions unanswered. This didn't really feel like a horror game. There weren't really any jump scares, and the atmosphere while creepy didn't really seem that scarry.\n\nMechanics wise the baby is way too slow, even while crawling. It took me 2.5 hours to beat this game and I have a feeling the reason your character moves so slowly is to pad the length of the game. Most of the puzzles simply consist of finding an object along a linear path, and using it in a certain location along said path. This game is highly linnear and there isn't really much of anything to do except crawl through the game.\n\nWould recommend this game at like $5 or less.

Holy Russel Crowe. I cannot stop the praise shooting from my mouth. I Let's Played this for my channel, and you can find the footage in it's entirety here. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk69TxLkva1YHrLxJe6Ho2qmwFrmycnpK\n\nThe premise of Among the Sleep is you are a two year old toddler, trying to find your mommy in what has become a living, breathing nightmare. While the game never stops reminding you of that one simple goal, it doesn't wave it around in your face like others do; it is the main objective of the smaller storyline but you are not constantly bombarded with it enough to make you feel uncomfortable.\n\nThe cast of characters is small, featuring only three main characters (You the Toddler, Teddy, and your Mom). The voice acting, however, is marvelously done. For the small cast and the small script, the voicework imbeds you in the game. For that matter, the entire game's soundscape is gorgeous from the lullaby-like background music to the sometimes spine-vibrating sound effects. Everything makes you feel as if you truly exist in this world, alone.\n\nThe level design is beautiful, taking items one would see laying around a household and twisting them into mighty structures; a park becomes a shadow-cast forest, a set of drawers is an insurmountable mountain, closets are deep caverns where the darkness goes to cling... While there are only four main level segments in the game, they are sprawling, each taking thirty minutes to traverse through in their entirety and every corner beautifully defined and articulated.\n\nThe gameplay itself is simple, you control a toddler. You can crawl, pickup objects, walk, run, and hug your teddy. While very simple, you'll be using all of this to ford a nightmarish take on reality, collecting and interacting with objects, engaging in some platforming, and navigating very dark areas. Occasionally you'll come face to face with a monster, which will scare you, making it difficult to see and navigate, as well as filling your ears with the game's version of the traditional, 'jump scare noise.' In darker segements, you can hug your friend, Teddy, to generate some light for you to navigate. While this makes things easier to do, in many cases you won't ever need to hug teddy as you can navigate in the dim lighting.\n\nThe game is as short as it really needs to be, only clocking in at about two hours. The storyline isn't overtly complex, so instead of forcing more unessecary content out of it, the devs made this game short and (not so) sweet when it came to the story itself. While many people may not realize it until the end, this game is based around one very pevelent social issue we face today, and it will shock you to your core when you reach the game's finale.\n\nOverall, Among the Sleep is a great game. It's short, but sweet, and while it does have little replay value, I'd love to play it again with a loved one. Every production point of the game is absolutely beautiful, but sadly it is pitifully short. If you're not convinced, wait for the price to drop by a few dollars in a sale, then pick it up. You will not regret it.","July 12, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Delivering you into the body of a two year old child, you must navigate the dark and disturbing world of a troubled mind and uncover the mysterious dissappearence of your mother. Alongside you a teddy bear named "Teddy" aids you in your journey often keeping you comfort when you need it. The game sets up an interesting premise but falls short at making you feel more vulnerable as a child as opposed to any other horror game. The true feat here is how large and menacing the environments are and the illusion that every object in the game world is either falling on you or trying to pull you in. Quite often in places you dont want to go. That combined with the chilling ambient sound make for a very unnerving atmosphere. The story is well written and completely out of left field.

You are eating cake in the arms of your mom when there is a knock at the door. This is followed by an argument, and then your mom coming back in with a present. You then fast forward to around bedtime/nap time, I'm not really sure which. It is then that the game takes on a nightmarish overlay.\n\nThe visual look of this game felt like it fit with the character being a 2 year old. I'm not saying that it was rainbows and puppies, but there were those softer colors, even when everything was dark. The levels of this game were beyond creepy, especially for me because I have an almost 2 year old, so I could see myself in his shoes. There is a slight terror to knowing that something bad could happen right out of the corner of your eye. The levels span from a deserted play ground, a library in a forest, small sections of your house, and more. There are villains that creep around as well. All I have to say is you are going to need to hide from them, or you will suffer a restart of the section you are in. I also really enjoyed the companion, the teddy bear that helped me along. All I had to do was hug it and he would produce a little bit of light that would help me see through the darkness.\n\nThe sounds in this game are extremely creepy. Once again it was doubley so because I have a young son, and hearing those noises creep around in a dark area would scare the pants off me at that age. I also think the voice acting in this game was spot on. I could see the roles of the mother and the teddy bear in the voices given.\n\nThe controls of the game are your usual configuration with WASD, shift to run, ctrl to crawl or get up, space to climb, and the mouse to control the camera and interact with objects.\n\nThough this game wasn't as long as I would have hoped, it definitely had enough there to keep me on my toes, and hoping that nothing was going to get me around the next corner. There is just something about this game that awakened long gone fears of my childhood, and the fear of what is in the dark. In this respect the developers did a great job. To be honest I can't really think of anything I found clunky or missing from this game. I will tell you this, the twist is a hell of one, and I'm not going to tell you what it is because you need to play this game to find out, but when the game ends everything kind of makes better sense.\n\nThere were definitely puzzle aspects to this game, most of the time it was moving objects so that you could get to a different location, but there were a couple of times where the developers threw in a mechanism just for a small section of the game that changed things up a little. A couple examples of this would be throwing objects to knock something off a shelf, or collecting a specific type of object so that you could weigh down the end of something so you could get to the other side. I'm not saying that this was a bad thing, but I would have liked to see a little bit more of these mechanics, to do them once and then seeming to throw them away made me feel like they were afterthoughts in the game creation process.\n\nSo lets get down to the part that most of you want to know, and that is should you play this game. The answer is yes, you should play this game, and you should play it in the dark, at night, and pray that no one sneaks up behind you while you are playing. This game gets an 8.9 out of 10.","August 1, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They didn't have to promise me any more than that, I was sold.\n\nAmong the Sleep certainly delivers on that particular promise. It doesn't go much above and beyond, but it really didn't have to. It was suitably scary, with good flow and an appropriate arc. The minor platforming and puzzles were rarely challenging, but they helped a lot with the pacing of the game, and appropriately added to the tension or distracted from it. There really isn't anything I can complain about in the game.\n\nMy biggest issue with it was how short it was; it took me just over 2.5 hours to complete, and I was thoroughly looking through every room because I wanted to get all of the achievements in one playthrough. They are planning on coming out with a free DLC, but there is no word yet on what that will be about or how long it will be.\n\nBecause of the length of the game, I would recommend spending $10 on this game at the maximum. Unless the DLC absolutely blows me away, I wouldn't expect that verdict to change.","June 17, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Creepy sound design.  Some really good scares.  Playing as a 2 year old isn't a gimmick, it's well integrated into the story, map design, and controls.  It's really cool analyzing what you see from the kid's perspective.\n\nCons: I don't usually complain about game length if the experience feels complete (I thought Dear Esther was worth the price for example) but this game clocked in at around 3 hours and felt brief, like it needed one more level to ramp up the insanity before the epilogue.  Some major bugs that affected rendering or caused the game to glitch out requiring me to load a checkpoint.  Doesn't stray from the linear, modern explore, hide, collect horror formula.  Not a lot of replay value, and the story isn't as thought provoking as other games like 'Machine for Pigs' in a way that would make up for that.\n\nVerdict: I don't regret paying full price for the experience, since the art and sound are truly marvelous, but for most people I'd reccommend waiting for a patch and a sale.  If you like what you see in the trailer, that's the game you're getting.  But it feels brief, lacks some polish, and is definitely more style than substance.","May 30, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nevertheless, I enjoyed the game. It was immersive, and had the child-like whimsy I'd expect, with a growing sense of dread and fear always lurking in the background. Even in the opening credits, when the black smoke crawls across the floor, or when the mother looks away and leaves you alone, and you start to panic in your chair, little moments like that helped seal the deal for me.\nThe settings were interesting, pleasantly surreal and vibrant, even when they are dimly lit. However, most of the objects and things you come across are random and have no significance, aside from the scrawled drawings all over. The puzzles were fairly simple, which allows you to focus a bit more on the story. Or it would, if the story was much more than explore the place until you solve the puzzle...\n\nThe monsters shocked me at first, and even throughout the first encounters I was paralyzed in my hiding spot. However, after a while when I realized they were easily avoided I had little issue and little to fear.\nAt one point I even got caught, which sends you back to a checkpoint, and instantly reduces the terror they represent when they become little more than a funny looking obstacle.\n\nThe ending wasn't a twist or a surprise if you pay attention at all to any of the sketchy stick figures, and the bottles littering the place. I was hoping for something a bit darker, but perhaps it's appropriate to have it be something so simple yet devastating... Poignant, but not very exciting.\n\nI think I enjoyed the playground level the best...\n\nBig issue is it's so brief for it's pricetag. $19.99 for something you're done with in a couple hours, with nothing in the way of replay value.  If the price were halved, it would be more reasonable, and more fitting for its content.","May 30, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was short but I definitely reccommend it.  It was creepy in a very realistic kind of way, which usually isn't covered so perfectly in horror games.  What first drew me was the fact that it was in the perspective of a 2 year old, which hits close to home with me as I used to have really bad nightmares when I was younger.  It's nostalgic in a weird kind of way.  If you're interested in games like Outlast or Amnesia, this is very similar but unique in its own amazing and artistic way.  You are helpless to fight back against the monster that chases you around, similar to those two games, and you also can alert the monster to you by causing disturbances around the area.  The thing that polishes it off is that, as a 2 year old, you are going through stages when reality and imagination merge together and you are still learning to distinguish between the two, which means that vivid dreams are something that would seem more realistic to a 2 year old than an adult.  It allows more flexibility in their creativity and they take advantage of that tenfold.  UNLIKE Amnesia and Outlast, these are dream worlds and irrational fears that many people shared when they were younger which in contrast makes it more terrifying and beautiful.  Definitely support these games, seriously, Krillbite is simply awesome in their abilities.","May 31, 2014","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
