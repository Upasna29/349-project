"http://steamcommunity.com/id/exaltedandforgotten/recommended/359040/","exaltedandforgotten","†◎urε††ε","http://steamcommunity.com/id/exaltedandforgotten/","863 products in account","The Music Machine is a pyschological horror walking simulator with a heavy emphasis exploration in the forms of exploring the game world and exploring the narration of the game.\n\nIn this game you play as a 13 year old girl named Hayley, who is currently posessed by the ghost of an older man named Quintin, who is trying to find a satisfactory way to kill Hayley for causing his untimely death. You start on an island where multiple people have been murdered recently, banter back and forth for a while, and then explore and uncover the secrets of the island, as well as uncover the secrets that lay beyond the island.\n\nTo be honest, I didn't know what I would expect from this game and throughout the game I was surprised by quite a lot of things. I experienced a lot of feelings of discomfort, tension, and the sense of unsettlement... and at times was creeped out and overwhelmed by how intensely I felt these feelings. I was also surprised at the fact the game explores the issue of the damage that false accusations can cause. At one point, I didnt know if I would be able to keep playing because of the feelings I felt. This, to me, is a lot better than the other genres of horror games, to me this is REAL horror.\n\nPros: +The two tone colorization of the graphics add a lot of this unsettling, almost bleak aura that permeates throughout the entire game. However, is also adds a lot of frustration when trying to identify items of interest.\n\n+The Music Machine has a very beautiful, but haunting soundtrack, that when mixed with the subject of the game, and the style of graphics, adds a lot more depth to the game. The music itself is not overpowering in any way and helps add immersion for me.\n\n+This "walking simulator" has a sprint button. I state this because movement at times can be very slow, and the sprint option gives this a step up from other walking simulator style games.\n\n+The game has a save feature, that while being clunky at best, is another step up from previous titles by the developer. I would like to note that towards the end of the game the save feature would not function properly for me. However, you can easilly get by with not saving the game due to its length.\n\n+The premise and subject of the game, to me, are very unique. The subject of false accusations is something that is not touched often, and this game explores that subject in such a way that it makes you think for a while.\n\n+The game has puzzles, and though they aren't challenging, are very fun and work well with the game. It is very refreshing to see a game developer to blend two game types and execute it in a way that functions very well.\n\nCons -There are some minor grammar and spelling errors that I saw right away in the opening dialogue. This to me was very disappointing, since this is a narrative driven game.\n-There is no voiced commentary, you are stuck reading everything. While this isn't particularly important to me, I know that some people do not enjoy reading as much as I do.\n-I didn't feel a strong emotional connection to the two characters right away, and at times I thought their relationship was very odd, and not in a good way. I only started feeling a stronger connection to them as characters as the game progressed. I also feel that their backgrounds could have been expanded upon more, as there were quite a few things I found interesting about them.\n\nNeutral This game is very short, taking such little time to complete, depending on how much the person explores. However, I feel the price for this game is very agreeable because it has some of replay potential in it and it is such a unique game that has not been disappointing to me.\n\nFinal Thoughts This game has been a very pleasant surprise to me, and while it has some minor flaws, has been one of the best psychological horror games that I have played in a very long time. It has a very interesting premise, graphics and an atmosphere that stand out from other games within the genre, and was clearly made with care. I would have no problem recommending this to anyone who enjoyed horror AND walking simulator games. I am rating this an 8/10.","May 19, 2015","true","4.8"," 66 of 74 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","66","74","0","7"

We discover lands of some mystery island and we are not alone in here. I don't want to spoil to much, but actually there are 2 persons, at first it seems strange, but every new conversation gives a little bit explanation to the whole storyline. The visual style is unique - it uses 2 colors only. Surreal atmosphere and decent story make this a nice horror like adventure.","June 29, 2015","true","3.8"," 77 of 91 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","77","91","2","3"

Merely the whim of rulers." - Roger\n\n"Loneliness is growing up and listing your barber as an emergency contact." - Quintin\n\nThe Music Machine is the sibling game to go alongside with The Moon Sliver, David Szymanski's previous game. Combined together, they form a most beautiful, sorrowful yet elegant story. When I finished The Moon Sliver, I felt a bit blinded to a deeper truth behind the happenings of the game. After I played The Music Machine, everything falls into its intended place to portray a scene that I won't soon forget.\n\nAs the game starts, our "characters" arrive a forested island on a day break. We meet Haley and Quintin, the 13 year old girl and the 34 year old vengeful ghost that possessed Haley's body to find a satisfactory method of killing her. We soon find out that Quintin dragged Haley there to go after a murderer with conflicting ideas in mind. We start exploring the island while witnessing their exchanged dialogues. The more we explore, the more we learn about them, and the truth of this beautiful yet uncanny island. Suffice to say - to avoid major spoilers - something's really off, maybe something beyond human comprehension.\n\nThe whole game is designed in Unity engine, with the sole usage of monochromatic scenes: the contrast of a single lush color over black shadows, and voila! I present you the most beautiful, strong and eerie atmosphere ever! Forged with a fleetingly eerie narrative and accompanied with thrilling background sounds and music, The Music Machine promises a sublime experience for 2 hours. The scenes that we encounter feel right out of a strong acid trip, with cosmological symbolisms under. Details within worlds are crafted to be wondrously allegoric, as mental associations of the human mind with an alien interpretation. If this is not art, I do not know what it could be.\n\nThe character contrasts between Haley and Quintin are done masterfully, if I may say. Their perceptions, expectations and world view are presented as sharp conflicts in written dialogue with nuances so tender, even though there is neither voice acting, nor visual character design - since this is a first person camera game - they come alive as characters. This is incredibly hard to accomplish since there is nothing else beside a written narrative to enact them. You suddenly find yourself worrying for Haley, or wishing the best for Quintin.\n\nLet's talk about the gameplay. It takes the tried tradition of WASD and your mouse, nothing complicated. There are some very basic puzzles and a story for you to witness. There is no actual combat element common in horror games. Only an elaborate narrative and exploration, so yes, it can be categorized as a walking simulation with some adventure elements. The horror of the game is carefully crafted with an atmospheric expectancy of "something ominous about to happen", and yes, the ominous happens... Don't worry, the game saves your progress automatically when you quit.\n\nFor 2 hours, The Music Machine invites you to take seat, and ask questions. Ask about religion, about society, about morality, about dynamics of power for men, and creatures beyond. What is creation? What is beauty? What means to be alive? I bet you already have your own ideas anyhow, but you might get surprised on what this gem has to offer you.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 12, 2015","true","3.0"," 46 of 49 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","46","49","0","8"

Some of the other areas could have used a little more dynamism like this to make the game really shine.\n\n~ A run button is included, which I feel is important to have in exploratory first-person adventures, but I think she could run a little faster. :)","May 28, 2015","true","3.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

The Music Machine is not a game for everyone. Some might call it a 'walking sim' but it does tell an interesting and rather confronting story that touches base on family matters, religion and philosophy.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d0zwvfQqOY\nGame is quite short but really up to the player how much time they spend exploring. A full playthrough could be done in around an hour but personally I loaded the game straight back up after finishing and found several areas I had missed which expanded upon my first run and tied up some loose ends. Will not go into the details as that would spoil all the fun. If you are familiar with the developers previous work 'The Moon Sliver' you should know what to expect, stark imagery, atmospheric soundtrack and slowly unravelling plotline. With that said it is more directed with less reading involved and far better visuals imo.\n\nWould like to mention it's not a horror game with jump scares, nonstop action or much that would probably shock you but it is somewhat thought provoking and you can tell it's a Iabour of love. Enjoyed my time spent playing and I can recommend checking it out if you take into consideration what I mentioned above.

This was by far the best effort yet. The story itself was engaging and had two obvious layers (the possessed girl and the worlds mythos itself) with a lot of subtext regarding forgiveness and redemption.\n\nThe world was beautiful. Stunning even. Talk about maximizing the effect through minimalism! The colors and the images were truly evocative.\n\nThe gameplay was similar to the prior two games in that you move around using the mouse and WASD, and interact via mouseclicks, but with the added feature of actually being able to use a couple items within the scope of the game.\n\nThe story was stellar IMO. Again, a minimalist approach thhat really spurs the imagination.\n\nAll told, I think it took me about two actual hours to complete the game, including going back to check out the Easter Egg that was presented in the end game credits, which was very nice.\n\n9 portals leading to realms of false creation out of 10","August 11, 2015","true","5.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

I have no idea what to say. I have pieces of what might feel like ideas, such as; I wish it had been longer, more. But in reality that might have been the worst thing, that it is actually beyond improvement in its present form. I wish I could have SEEN better, that perhaps I missed important things simply because visability was compromised. But again, the 2-color pallet created a mood no other game I've played has come close to expressing, and that color scheme was very important to the ending of the story. And since I completed the story three times (once alive, I think) I must be mistaken.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, The Moon Sliver, TMM had a save feature, although it somewhat awkwardly involved exiting, then re-starting the game, and toward the end did not function (for good reason.) The controls were simple, the "puzzle(s)" was/were organic to the story in a very good way. The characterization was brief but adequately ambiguous (but I wished to know much more about both of them, nay, ALL of them). I wish the story had allowed for more exploration in one specific area, but that might have been superfluous, thus bypassed (leaving this player wanting more. Always a good strategy.)\n\nAs far as a recommendation, all I can say is if someone found The Moon Sliver intriguing, the same will be true for The Music Machine. BUt if they wish to play TMM looking for answers to TMS....good luck. If they want to spend a couple of hours in some unique landscapes, they've found that game. I might have liked more clarification, more connection between the two stories. But that's just me, and probably wrong. I haven't been the one to live with this story for an extended period, so I must trust to one who has.\n\nSorry this review is so short and atypical.

It creates an atmosphere like few other games I have played. I genuinely felt terror as I explored the island (and the realms beyond it) and loved its ability to create horror without having to rely on jumpscares. The true nature of the Music Machine (the actual machine, not the game) is one of the most disturbing things I've seen. Haley and Quintin are compellingly written characters that make the game truly come to life. There are plenty of other things in this game that I could comment on, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. If you like horror or interactive fiction, you should definitely play this game.\n\n(SPOILER ALERT! DO NOT READ THIS UNLESS YOU BEAT THE GAME OR DON'T CARE)\nI played this game without an internet connection so I had to play again long enough to get five minutes logged in online. I decided to run into a spindle man to trigger an alternate ending. It was a much darker ending that further fleshed out the story and the fact that I could actually kill Haley and not have a happy(ish) ending made my original choice to keep her from dying feel more weighted.","June 14, 2015","true","0.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

This narrative psychological horror adventure is easily one of the better examples of the genre.\n\nIt is very difficult to explain how eerie and yet strikingly beautiful the monochromatic artstyle is, because neither the videos nor the screenshots do it justice. Simply walking within this world is a fascinating experience worth the tiny pricetag. Accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack and a minimalistic sound design that highlight the atmosphere, you will for once actually not mind wandering aimlessly around and staring fascinated at the shadows of the trees and the patterns on the walls.\n\nAnd yes, you will occasionally wander aimlessly around not knowing what to do next, so some patience and some observation skills are required. Thankfully this is one of the few walking exploration games that is mostly accessible, even if you aren't a great fan of the genre. Despite my best efforts to become confused on where I was and how to proceed, I was most of the time pleasantly surprised when I accidentally stumbled onto what turned out to be the obvious next step.\n\nI am very unwilling to divulge anything about the story, because I was glad to have read very little about it before playing. The game introduces its characters through small snippets of dialogue that pack a few shocking punches yet are often quite entertaining in their oddness. I especially appreciated how beautifully tight the dialogues were despite (and sometimes because of) their occasional melodramatic crescendos. Suffice to say that, if you don't enjoy playing games that are trying their best to make you profoundly uncomfortable, this may not be the game for you. The Music Machine revels in the existential perversity of its world and the troubling dysfunctional relationship of its (surprisingly well realised) protagonists. It is ultimately a story of two broken people that are almost too engrossed in their personal dramas to be actually shocked by the horror of a world crafted by perverted supernatural entities. And despite its occasional flaws (that include some pacing issues and also some glaring typos that are hard to excuse in narratively driven games), I was very intrigued by the well-rounded and well-explored story, enough to try and uncover both endings.\n\nAll in all a very interesting game, unique, memorable, intriguingly written and visually stunning.

To do so, they travel to a derelict island, where they find a strange temple organ which teleports them to a few desolate alien worlds.\n\nTheir banter is the high point of the game. It not only manages to tell their backstory without resorting to long plot dumps, but it is also a good tool to keep up the suspension. Unlike the supposed plot about the heavenly world builders; it feels like their story is cryptic only to mask that it makes no sense.\n\nFor a game, The Music Machine is… not pleasant. The starting island is hard to navigate and you may miss half of the dialogues by accidentally stumbling up on the way forward. The alien worlds are thankfully short, but they are empty. And finally, the visual style may look especially great on storefront images, but actually seeing this two-colour high-contrast style in motion will physically hurt your eyes.","October 1, 2015","true","4.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I don't want to spoil too much about the story/situation they encounter, but suffice to say it is weird and I loved it.\n\nGames like this are why walking simulators are my favorite genre of game.

For a horror veteran, maybe the horrific implications and actual creepy scenes will be unfazing, but for a softie like myself, it really hit me deep a couple of times. Of course I won't spoil anything here, this is a purely story-driven game afterall, but I can say this much: There are no jumpscares, just scary environments and scenarios.\nThe story revolves around two characters... kinda: Haley, the 13-year old girl who you are controlling, and Quintin, the ghost of a 34-year old man that Haleys father pumped full of lead after Haley excused him of molesting her... when in reality Quinint rejected the "love" Haley showed for him. And now Quintin's ghost possesses Haleys body and tries to get her killed. This is why he brought her to an island where horrendously deformed corpses have popped up multiple times, corpses full of holes. Quintin wishes to seek out the one who caused these injuries and leave Haley in his or her professional hands.\nQuite a messed up setup. But the strangest thing is: Haley and Quintin still lead calm conversations, and Haley still shows affection for Quintin. There seems to be little hostility between the two... besides Quintin's very clear intentions. And so this pair of deeply troubled and hurt characters uncover the secrets of this strange island, and believe it or not, it gets even weirder. But any more info would be spoilers, so I'll leave the rest for you to find out.\n\nThe surreal and disturbing story of the game gets supported by a very surreal and unusual artstyle. A 3d world consisting only of a single colour and heavy shadows. For the first few minutes I thought the stark contrast would be a bit weary on the eye, but my eyes soon adjusted to it. The style also brings the benefit of being not very taxing for your computer, so you probably won't have to worry whether your computer can handle it or not, it most likely can. The biggest downside I could see for the game is its length. I beat it in 90 minutes, and after you beat it there is pretty much nothing else to do. It's up to you whether you think that time is worth it for the price. I found the game intruiging, and while it's a bit hard to define whether I enjoyed it or not, it definitely left and impact on me, and it will probably stay with me for a while. The story might not be for everyone, I can imagine that the horror aspects won't be effective for everyone, all I know is that it worked for me. A good friend of mine who is a horror veteran also played through the game and enjoyed it so much that he bought it for me and forced me to play it, so I think that even if you don't get scared by it, you will still get your money's worth.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nPros:\n\n-unique unsettling story\n-interesting and relatable characters\n-visually interesting and disturbing world\n-pretty much any semi-modern pc can handle it fine\n\nCons:\n\n-takes only 90 minutes to finish\n-little to no replay value\n\nI don't like final scores, so I won't add one.\n\nCave Johnson, we're done here.","September 13, 2015","true","2.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The graphics are striking and distinct, which match the mood of the game perfectly. The exploration aspect of the game is very interesting, especially since there are a variety of things to look at. Amusing and interesting exchanges happen between two characters as you examine items, and it really brings the world to life; The Moon Sliver had excellent writing, and this game is no exception. But honestly, what takes the show is the music. The music rivals any AAA production out there, and it's just so achingly beautiful and sad. The only way I can't recommend this game is if you need action scenes or jump scares to keep your interest. If you're a fan of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and other exploration games, The Music Machine is well worth your time.","May 16, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

They go to an island where several people were recently murdered, and they discover some kind of church, with a mysterious music machine that travels through dimensions and different places.\nThe story is really good and the dialogue between the two characters is really well written. The strongest point is the atmosphere, which feels both relaxing and haunting.\n\nGRAPHICSDeveloped in the Unity engine, the game has a really artistic style: every environment has a different color, and that adds to the atmosphere. The lighting effects are also very good, and the places you explore are all very big and fully explorable.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game is a "walking simulator", which is basically a game that mostly requires you going from point A to point B. However, there are some puzzles that break (in a positive way) the exploration. The game is non-linear, and you might have to go back to a previously visited place to find an item that you might have missed.\n\nCHALLENGEThere is little to no challenge: the puzzle are very few and not hard to understand. The core of the game is not to challenge the gamer, but to tell a compelling story and to deliver a worthwile experience.\n\nSOUNDThe atmospheric soundtrack really helps set the tone of the game, and I recommend buying it. There are also sound effects that further immerse you in the game.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThis is entirely subjective: if you like this kind of games, you will come back to fully explore the environments, read all the letters and better understand the story. Others won't see much reason to come back.\n\nOverall, this is a great and fresh experience, with an interesting story and beautiful environments as well as a great soundtrack.

I stuck The Moon Sliver in our indie games of the year list, while the story wasn't the most original, and it didn't look the best, the way it told its story was fascinating. Fingerbones was rough, but its story unique and oblique, just about as dark as anything else in gaming. The Music Machine mixes cues from both games, it's dreamy, vague, and eventually, unremittingly bleak\n\nLike the two previous games, The Music Machine is a narrative exploration game, a 'walking simulator' if you will. You play as a young girl, possessed by a vengeful spirit, who puppets her around with the ultimate aim of killing her in the worst way possible. The game commendably pitches this against a light hearted tone, the girl is playful, the relationship between the two is more familial than murderous. It helps soften the characters, making them likable and relatable, something that can be undermined to brilliant effect later on.\n\nThis is true of the world too. Szymanski's games have never been lookers, but with The Music Machine he's used two tone colours, setting black against colour, to create a striking and at times beautiful world. The large swathes of abyss black create doubt, in a world so threateningly desolate they could be hiding anything. The structures become peering obelisks, the simplicity of the world unsettling, it's something that's grounded in the narrative, and if it's a deliberate attempt to draw from limitations, it works brilliantly.\n\nIt's fair to say that The Music Machine is an original story. There's a moment, or a representation of a character, that I'm less sure lands, it's unique certainly, but in what is otherwise quite a heavy game, and a heavy moment, it just falls on the comical side of absurd. Not that comedy has no place in the game, The Music Machine has its fair share of humour, usually as part of a very well written script. As mentioned the relationship between Hayley and Quintin is superb, they bring the barren world to life, it's a very natural relationship, despite its origins. It's also a parallel for the structure of the game. The light-heartedness, the sense of wonder, eventually becomes undermined, you suddenly realise that the impish threat that had seemed no more than a curiosity has begun to loom over you. Each new area carries with it the threat of the unknown, but there was a point where the game had become genuinely unsettling. That said, one of the possible endings is a little fluffed, I got it out of curiosity rather than malevolence, meaning it lost a lot of its intended impact.\n\nThe Music Machine takes a very grounded issue, the damage of a false accusation, and then throws it in to a surreal high concept world. It's a unique story, the reveal of the what and why of the music machine itself is an old-fashioned kind of horror, and depending on your choices it can explore the darker side of humanity, resentment, and revenge. As usual for anything from this genre it’s not for everyone, it’s not jump scares and gore, but it’s a fantastic story. unique and quietly unsettling\n\n[played itch.io version]\nhttp://bitparade.co.uk/article.php?id=3699","May 15, 2015","true","0.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

You can easily complete the game in under one hour.\n\nThe Music Machine looks and sounds good, but that's where the qualities stop. For some, that might be enough for buying this game, because it works the same way someone would buy Crysis: for graphics and gameplay. However, The Music Machine fails at everything else, with a subpar story enough to make me embarrassed of the awkward writing, a gameplay based on walking (more on this later) with some stuff "patched" in to make it different from most. Of course, that doesn't work.\n\nKeep reading, I promise I won't spoil the story.\n\nGraphicsOkay, let me get started with the good things. The Music Machine looks good. It's not good on graphically impressive, but it is interesting and enough to make you check out the game. Some places looks really cool, and the art style focused on simple colors doesn't put a strain in the eyes. For that, I give the game my points, the last section right before the credits looks really, really nice.\n\nMusicEven though there are only a couple of tracks, all the songs are really nice and beautiful. Nice work has been done here, and together with the graphics, the game had everything to be really good, but everything else overshadows these qualities. The music is moving, sometimes unnerving, and they can pass the feeling really well.\nI can tell just by the OST that whoever did the songs, really loved what he was doing.\n\nGameplayBefore that, the game runs really well. It didn't drop below 60fps in 1080p at least a single time, so that's  something worth to note.\nOther than that, the gameplay relies too much on walking. That can be something if you have actually something to do other walking from place to place. In this case, it remembers me a lot of Proteus, but these two games are two different things.\n\nThe Music Machine also features an inventory system. To be short, it's bad. There's a lot of spaces in there, but nothing you can fill them with. On my playthrough, I picked one single item, which I used two times. Other than that, two pages with numbers to progress with the story. There is one item you get at the end of the game, that feels like something placed because the writer didn't know how to finish the game. It's terrible and completely breaks the immersion.\n\nYou can also pick objects from the game, but I never found any use for that. Actually, there is one time you need to pick boxes to get them out of your way, so you can interact with something. Makes me wonder why so much effort for something that didn't add anything in gameplay. I picked boxes, rocks, wood; nothing was ever used. You can't stack the boxes to reach somewhere higher, because you can't jump. It's actually frustrating because your character feels like a slug even when running, but mostly because you are stuck to the ground.\n\nStoryThat is where everything goes from bad to horrible.\nThe writing is simply off. Awkward, with characters I can't give a damn about, and full of "smart" moments.\nIt's bad. The game tries to be smart a lot of times, and I felt like reading some fanfic from a 12 years old boy after reading Lovecraft for the first time.\n\nThe characters are full of little jokes and collaboration as a comedy duo, and it completely breaks the immersion. Are you on a place that looks unnerving as hell? Well, because your character thinks something looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥.\nThere's also something greater in the story, and let me get this straight: it's the worst part of the whole game.\n\nThe last part looked cool and actually got me a little cautious, but the writer didn't know how to finish his story, so he just ended the section with a half-hearted conclusion.\n\nIn the end, the only thing I could save from the story was... nevermind, I can't even remember most of the game. And I just finished it.\n\nConclusionIt's hard to tell what the developers were trying to do with this game. Something with so much potential wasted on awkward writing and design flaws. You might not feel ripped off if you get this in a bundle, but at least be sure you have something else you want from that bundle, because this game is nothing special.\n\nThe Music Machine is surely a forgettable game, and that's a good thing. It's not buggy enough to make you hate the game and tell everyone to not buy it, it's that kind of game you just say "nah, I thought it was bad" and move on.\n\nI'm sure I will sleep and The Music Machine will just feel like a dream after I wake up, and it will just become another game in my Steam library. One of those I click just to see the screenshots.","July 2, 2015","false","2.8"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

As many others have said, the art and music/sound effects are superb; combined with the underlying premise and developing story, they create a frightening environment. Even during a second playthrough (not long after the first), I still found the hairs on my arms rising at times.\n\nIn the interests of frank disclosure, there are a couple of rough edges:\n\n-Occasional spelling/grammer errors (impacts immersion)\n-A clunky checkpoint-based save system. This is apparently part of the Unity platform on which the game is based. The developer is aware of its limitations, and is considering improvements in his next game.\n-A somewhat confusing inventory system. There are many items with which you can interact, but most of these interactions are inconsequential. What you are listening for is a 3-tone sound, which means you have picked up an item that is critical to the progression of the story.\n\nThere are other areas for improvement. For example, some people are of course bothered by no achievements, and the fact that the game can be completed in 1-2 hours. But those things actually don't phase me at all. And despite my list of areas for improvement, I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this game.

I saw the game being played in a Let's Play Video on youtube and was sucked into it immediately. The characters are written very realistically, the dialogue is snappy short and helpful for the story and the story...well it was basically why I wanted to play the game. It's dark and somewhat ironic and something new. Maybe not the newest of new but the twist and the way you play the game is new, at least for me. The graphics are not realistic or claim to be, they are minimalistic but beautiful and fit the overall feel of the game. Its a very artsy game and has great atmosphere that is supported by the sounds and the music. I loved the suspense throughout the game when you get deeper and deeper into the story and since the tag says horror I was waiting for jumpscares or anything other but really it's more the story, the thoughts of the character and some designs in the worlds rather than flatout 08/15 horror elements. It's subtle but makes you feel slightly uneasy during the playthrough.\nSo I really recommend the game to anyone looking for an emotional journey thought a world of art with heavy, great atmosphere and a touching dark story without too much happening but yet enough to not make the game feel empty. Story and the elements of adventuring the maps are in a very satisfying balance.\nI have no idea if this review even made sense.

This tale takes place in the same universe as Moon Sliver, but is longer, has a more fleshed-out story and game mechanics, and enjoys a more signature graphic styling, forgoing Half-Life 2 and Arma-style graphics in favor of one color-tone, cell-shaded graphics that I can only even vaguely match to Killer 7. This game has more control, style, and tone than the predecessor, and the story really drew me in.

The Music Machine has beautifully rendered monochromatic backgrounds which, as usual for David's games, a wonderful and evocative atmosphere of strangeness and uncertainty. The music, effects, writing, and characters bring this story to life and, while relatively short (right around an hour), is a game that players can revisit and experience again. This is one of the most fascinating and philisophical of David's designs, with many very real world questions being raised. The slow reveal of the story works wonderfully for this type of horror game and I sincerely hope that David continues to create these types narrative based games, horror or not. The Music Machine is a work of art, and highly recommended.\n\n*I've played each of David's designs, and highly recommend them for those who are seeking an experience that is more than just a game, but an exploration of horror narrative, and how a game can be more than just an entertainment piece. Each of David's games are a work of art.","December 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But you can sure bet pedophilia suggestions are in this one.  It wouldn't be a Szymanski game without it.\n\nI don't know what's going on with this developer.  It's obvious this one is about a 13-year-old who had a demon spirit (invisible friend/spirit guide in her perspective) attached to her.  Outside of that, it's a wild turkey shoot as to its meaning.  I guess the demon was hoping she'd continue along with it in death.  How did she get this demon spirit attached to her?  I don't know.  How did she die?  Judging by the room with the slab of concret and sharp knives hanging above it where playing the keys of a mini piano will lower each knife... she died gruesomely.  Judging by the rain hurting her, she was kidnapped and molested in the rain.  Judging by the Voice, its suppose to be Jesus Christ, but I guess David is demonized and therefore cannot say the name of Jesus Christ without experiencing a negative reaction within him.  It would have been a very painful development experience for him.  And judging by the silly mythology in this game, David has a small clue as to the history of humanity.  He's got the demon spirit part right (which makes me wonder about him), but he's got everything else all wrong.  All it takes is picking up the Holy Bible and reading it from beginning to end to truly know the truth.  There's no need to guess, because you're just making a mess out of it.  Unless this is your intention, David.  Unless you're truly demonized.  Cuz you sure have a darn good clue about them.  Telling the Voice to masturbate with a cheese grater must have had those little demons in you chuckling for a week.  Torture devices viewed as instruments to stimulate music within the human machine... or is it the human body is the machine and when its under demonic possession, the demons play sweet demented melodies with it... seriously...\n\nSeek Christ.  He is the solution to your demons, to all demonic presence.\n\nAs for this game... well, let's face it, it's not a game.  You're not actually playing any game in this game.  It's just a warped walking simulator showing you the view of demonic attachment upon a young female who has died and is traversing a weird looking hippie-coloured dream-like world.  You flip some switches.  You walk around.  You read.  The end.  Now go call upon the name of Jesus Christ.\n\nI patiently await David's release that's all about his salvation and finally being free from all demonic attachments and finally being under the all-powerful protection of God.  Could you imagine this?  David makes a game where you go out and witness Jesus Christ to the world.  Wouldn't that be something, huh?  Until then, its incest, pedophilia, end-of-the-world scenarios, and some demon spirits thrown in from time to time from David Szymanski, who's quickly become the Incest and Pedophile king in all of gaming.\n\nEnjoy.","February 19","true","2.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","3","7","3","6"

Let me just say that I LOVE artistic, exploration driven games such as Dear Esther, Gone Home, Gregory Weir's games, etc.  So it's not that I didn't "get it" or that the genre is wrong for me.\n\nThere is barely any story or mystery here.  You find out the reason Quentin is possesing Haley's body within the first ten minutes of playing.  There is a second story going on which is only slightly interesting, but pretty much everything is explained to you in detail by a character you meet halfway through.  You do not discover anything by yourself-  There are a few notes lying around for you to read in the first level but they don't tell much.  You will be walking around in mostly empty areas with nothing interesting to inspect, no clues or anything like that.  Just boxes and crates most of the time.  There are a few "puzzles" but they are insultingly simple.\n\nSome of the environments are interesting to look at or a bit creepy, but calling it "psychological horror" is a HUGE stretch.\n\nI got this game for $1.79 so it's not a huge deal but to be honest it's not even worth that.

First of all, I wouldn't exactly call this a "horror" game, as there isn't much horror to be had. The one thing close to spooky was near the end, but even that was disappointing.\n\nSecondly, the game consists of you walking around various locations, and piecing things together from the annoying back-and-forth dialog between the girl and "the spirit" who you play as (although to me, it's a girl who is insane). If you bought the package as I did, it's a lot like The Moon Sliver, only a little clearer on how to get to the end, but still has you explore and find new stuff.\n\nAll in all, the game was short once I ran out of things to explore, but still wasn't what I was expecting.","September 27, 2015","false","1.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

When they do, it seems that even many of the people who would enjoy them feel reluctant to give them a try. Sometimes a game looks a little too strange and people (at least, people like me) get anxious about the idea of wasting their money. In the hopes of addressing some of the fence-sitters, let me simply say that The Music Machine is the best horror game I played in all of 2015.\n\nWhen The Music Machine begins, all you know is that you're a spirit controlling the body of a young girl. To say more could constitute major spoilers, but even from this fairly unique premise, the story takes some unexpected turns. Speaking of story, the plot of The Music Machine is tenuously connected to the plot of The Moon Sliver, David Szymanski's previous game, but The Music Machine is not a sequel and either game can be enjoyed without having played the other.\nDepending on how often you stop to take in the view, accompanied by a genuinely excellent score, you'll likely spend two or three hours exploring the various monochromatic areas of the abandoned island, and it is in this exploration that The Music Machine shines. Almost every object can be examined and doing so will usually trigger a short conversation between the two main characters. The dialogue is superbly written and you can even keep walking around once a conversation has been initiated, unbound by the object you were examining.\n\nWhen a game is this short, a discussion of its length is unavoidable, which is why I feel I need to mention that the length of The Music Machine is absolutely perfect.\nWhen a game can be completed in a single sitting, it's story stays fresh in your mind throughout it's runtime. Arbitrarily padding a game like this to extend it's length would only lessen the experience in the long run. Keeping a story succinct means it never gets dull.","February 8","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought it was just an amazing game, no idea how I could start it. I probably should start by telling that I watched let's plays for both The Moon Sliver and A Wolf In Autumn, and this was easily better than both of them. One thing to point out though, is that this game is not a horror game. Does it have creepy parts? Sure, the end was really creepy. Can it be considered horror? Nope.  It has slight amounts of blood, creepy monsters and a really psychological parts, but it just is not a horror game.\nWith that in mind, I should get started with the graphics. The graphics were better than what I've seen in The Moon Sliver and A Wolf In Autumn, except it still has some similar flaws. One thing that bothered me is how some sprites looked plain up HD while others looked pixelated. Especially the shadowing from the trees, and the floor.  Other than that they were pretty colorful and pretty. One other problem I had is that the text on the map is almost unreadable unless you are playing in fullscreen. As always I could not do that because bandicam cannot record fullscreen. Though I appreciate how everything else worked fine in windowed mode.\nThe soundtrack was pretty good.  I especially liked the music that played when you picked up the gun at the end.\nOnto gameplay. This game had a lot of walking in it. I'm suprise it isn't tagged walking simulator yet, it definetly belongs in there. Although, I was fine with that really. I have no problem with walking, but it was kinda annoying when in the red city you had to walk so far on an empty land. One thing I really was not ok with is the saving system. The game saves when you exit, which I don't understand. I had a lot of problems because of this. The game should probably autosave by itself instead of doing it when you exit. Some people like me want to save all the time, so there could be a save point/autosaving/save from the menu.\nStory was really fresh, it was really fun playing as two people at once X3 and shipping them. I can really see why this game is so highly rated, it was really a good one! #Halentin ftw\nThis isn't for everyone though. If you want jumpscares, you won't find any. You will also be exploring a lot, and there is a lot of walking and getting lost. Some of the puzzles are also difficult but then again I have the brain the size of a nut, I got stuck at one part because I did not see those large stairs going upwards in the house even though they were literally in plain sight. Definetly give this a try, it's around 1 and a half hours long, and it has a really reasonable price, and I got it while it got a discount.

Then again, I was never big on detective mystery kind of games even if it has aspects of horror.\n\nThis game was certainly powerful and interesting and without spoiling the game, I will go into why you might want to consider giving it a chance.\n\nThe game itself doesn't have much beyond exploration and picking up items. It is however, for the kind of person that loves a great story and a puzzle to solve.\n\nI felt a strong emotional connection to the characters and as I progressed through the story, I realized it was deeper than horror.\n\nIt was a moral conflict and in some ways was a tragedy.\n\nOne that leaves you wanting to replay it again and again. It is also worthy to note that the soundtrack is beautiful and the two tone color setting gives the player an uncertain and melancholy feel to the experience and I can't help but think it beckons the questions; what lay here on this island? What more is going on here? as you venture deeper into the story.\n\nThe story was interesting and the ending satisfying but mystifying. It took me all of about two hours to complete, but it was reasonably priced which is something rare to see on steam as some developers choose to rob their followers.\n\nThe only thing I wish I had been provided is what others have noted as well - background to the characters. We get a brief idea earlier on about the connection between Haley and Quintin but not enough to really explain how prior events in the game unfolded that led them here where the player starts. It is however, enough to go off of and isn't lacking to a point where the player is confused at any time.\n\nThere is also no narrating voice, most of the text you read yourself but I enjoyed this as I could imagine what the characters would have sounded like.\n\nPsychological horror is something I have always been interested in although rarely have I found a movie and even more so a game that has given that genre any justice. This game does exceptionally well in remaining true to its tags.\n\nI would highly recommend this game as it left me with some sense of shock and fulfillment. It left me wanting more and after playing through it a second time it certainly was worth the money.","May 27, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game took everything that was good in Fingerbones and added much more - a fantastic, distinctive art style, spooky landscapes, original storytelling and even some great music pieces (the pink forest track is my favourite).\nOverall, this was a big surprise. It's definitely one of the best exploration games I've played so far.\n\nP.S.: It' NOT a horror game. It's dark and maybe a bit depressive, but not scary.\nP.P.S.: Great secret level :)","September 13, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the only thing I find lacking is the in game music and sounds. The footsteps were too much and the outside world noise in the orange area was uninteresting, also the inventory menu was not the best feature and was forgotten most of the time and the hold down click to view felt unnecessary.\n\nBut, other then that, I have became a fan of this developer's work and look forward to playing their next project.\n","August 17, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The second section is aimed specifically at those who have played The Moon Sliver. So potential spoilers when you get to the part.\n\nAlthough it's described by players and the developer alike as a horror game, I personally don't agree. (Though obviously, genre specification is inherently a subjective thing.)\n\nIt's an exploratory, narrative-driven game. I wouldn't call it as scary as much as it's surreal, and at most, unsettling.\nYou're in a strange environment (in part due to the dichromatic visual style), and as you explore and proceed, the world becomes increasingly stranger. The story follows the same pattern. It starts off weird (you play as a ghost who's puppeting the body of a young girl, and looking to kill her), yet ultimately moves into even more fantastical directions that's much more vast in scope than I had expected from the start.\n\nI enjoyed the tale immensely. Much of the tale is conveyed through the internal dialogue between the two characters (the girl and the ghost who's controlling her) and they are a rather interesting duo imo. It's a short game (1 hr average I think for a full playthrough) but the way the dialogue develops feels both natural and informative, allowing the player to learn more about them while figuring out the craziness that's happening in the game.\n\nThe pacing of the game and story is as good as the character development. The second 'half' feels like it snowballs a bit too quickly, especially near the end, but I think that's inevitable given the number of...environments that the game has. Not saying it was not enjoyable nor satisfying, and that it seemed rushed, or that the dev should have fleshed out the latter half. The pacing just caught me off guard is all.\n\nAnd besides, the final sequence IS good: the one area of the game that I would call horror, and it's very effective. It's an excellent wrap up for the story, the characters, and the game as a whole (followed by a great epilogue-y sequence that I won't spoil).\n\nSo overall, I did very much like the game. The story and characters were both engaging, and the environments were all creepily alien and oh-so intriguing. I felt for their characters during my brief time with them. I felt dread whether I was exploring small claustrophobic corridors or vast, desolate fields.\n\nAgain, I treat it as narrative-driven, exploratory game. So there are only a few puzzles, and they're all very simple. But I liked that; they didn't bog down the experience of the narrative.\nAnd relately, one small detail that I liked was the ability to pick up most miscellaneous objects. Without spoiling much, this interface IS useful for some of the 'puzzles', but what I liked was that for the most part it, such movement was useless. I know it sounds silly but that was part of the reason why I liked Amnesia: The Dark Descent. It just felt more immersive, and as enjoyable to me as the random descriptions you get when examining random objects. It adds just the right amount of interactivity to augment the player's engagement with this world.\n\nThere were even times where I was pointlessly doing X trying to figure out obstacle Y...but it didn't bother me. It felt organic; my trying to find my way through the game.\n\nNow for those who have played The Moon Sliver. I'm sure you're wondering about its relationship to the game.\n\nRest assured, even though TMM functions well as a standalone game imo, it manages to, in the process, expand, clarify, and enriches the backstory of TMS. And it's very satisfying. There is one particular detail in TMS that I was disappointed was never explaineds/shown explicitly. And it's there, right smack near the end of TMM. But if you never played TMS, it wouldn't be as poignant, but it would still be relevant, and would not stick out.\n\nGameplaywise, it's much more of a game than TMS, and I think it's a good thing. It does so without sacrificing narrative quality. E.g. Having an inventory screen did not detract from the experience.\n\nThe way the story is conveyed is different, but I think both games are interesting in their own right, and they both kind of stem directly from the games' unique settings (conversations with a ghost versus a person looking back and reminiscing).\n\nI think pacing is better in TMS, but I'm 90% sure that's just due to the order I happened to explore things in TMS.\nAs I stated in the first section of this review, there's more interaction in TMM, and that's good for it as a game. If you liked TMS, there's a high chance you'll like TMM, as a whole, if not just for the tie-ins alone.\n\nIt's twice as expensive, but I think it's twice as long (same length for me, but I got lost in TMS for like a half hour lol).\n\nFollowing the dev's games from Fingerbones to TMS to TMM over the past week (lol), I'm definitely looking forward to the dev's next entry in the genre (A Wolf in Autumn, I believe is his next project). And probably outside the genre as well, just to see what sort of stuff he cooks up next.\n\nAnd if not, I'll at least look at the soundtrack, cause the music has been awesome. I normally don't acknowledge music in games usually, but when I did in these titles, they were quite mesmerizing stuff.","August 14, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

When they do, it seems that even many of the people who would enjoy them feel reluctant to give them a try. Sometimes a game looks a little too strange and people (at least, people like me) get anxious about the idea of wasting their money. In the hopes of addressing some of the fence-sitters, let me simply say that The Music Machine is the best horror game I played in all of 2015.\n\nWhen The Music Machine begins, all you know is that you're a spirit controlling the body of a young girl. To say more could constitute major spoilers, but even from this fairly unique premise, the story takes some unexpected turns. Speaking of story, the plot of The Music Machine is tenuously connected to the plot of The Moon Sliver, David Szymanski's previous game, but The Music Machine is not a sequel and either game can be enjoyed without having played the other.\nDepending on how often you stop to take in the view, accompanied by a genuinely excellent score, you'll likely spend two or three hours exploring the various monochromatic areas of the abandoned island, and it is in this exploration that The Music Machine shines. Almost every object can be examined and doing so will usually trigger a short conversation between the two main characters. The dialogue is superbly written and you can even keep walking around once a conversation has been initiated, unbound by the object you were examining.\n\nWhen a game is this short, a discussion of its length is unavoidable, which is why I feel I need to mention that the length of The Music Machine is absolutely perfect.\nWhen a game can be completed in a single sitting, it's story stays fresh in your mind throughout it's runtime. Arbitrarily padding a game like this to extend it's length would only lessen the experience in the long run. Keeping a story succinct means it never gets dull.","February 8","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you imagine "The Scream", meets cubism, you're getting pretty close to the idea.\n\nThe game is very story driven, enhanced by the stark, two-toned environment, eerie music and some very creepy sound design. The gameplay mainly focuses on exploration and simple puzzle solving, allowing the player to gradually put together who the two main characters are and how they came to be in this strange place.\n\nWhile it's not the scariest game I've ever played, it does create a good atmosphere and there were definitely a few areas that elicited the "aw hell naw" response before I soldiered on in. The last level especially, in my opinion. The environments were varied, some made use of enclosed spaces, harsh lighting and impenetrable shadows to ramp the "nope" meter up, while others used colour, sinister items and bizarre architecture to wrap you in a steadily increasing feeling of dread. The dialogue between the characters was also occasionally used to add to this, with reassuring statements such as "I feel like someone's watching us."\n\nThe soundtrack blends in and builds tension slowly without you noticing so it can ramp it up occasionally to make you crap your pants wondering what's going on. In the absence of music, the dull, reverberating ambient noise is often worse and if you're playing with headphones, every creaking floorboard sounds like the crack of doom. Right behind you.\n\nDespite all of this excellent atmosphere, I also felt a little bored at times, after exploring an area for a while and becoming used to the ambient noise pattern, there wasn't much else that happened. Some of the mechanics, such as the ability to pick up and throw objects, were barely needed and added some confusion as to what I was supposed to be doing in the earlier levels.\nI understand it's a walking sim, but there wasn't quite enough dialogue or creepy events at times to fill the long walks, and the dialogue itself - while it had its moments - mostly alternated between feeling awkward and out of place and then like someone had thrown a psychology textbook at my face. I love psychological meaning and metaphors worked into game stories, I really do, but after the fifth convoluted, God-complex filled note I eventually got lost. The concept of the relationship between the two main characters is very original and contains so much potential, but I feel it wasn't executed as well as it could have been and got lost as the story progressed. In the end, I think I got a pretty good idea of what the game was trying to convey, but it was not an easy or overly enjoyable process in that area of the game.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy "The Music Machine". It was genuinely scary at times, the design works well with the theme of the story and despite its flaws I'm always happy to see more contributions to the psychological horror pool.","July 9, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The real strength of the game, though, lies within its ambiant setting and the likeable interactions between the two main characters.\n\nEssentially, it's an interactive short story that you can finish in an afternoon. A short experience, but truly memorable nonetheless.","December 28, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The comfort that comes with the necessity for cooperation in an enclosed space was an interesting theme to observe - especially when part of one's goal is to find a suitable method to kill the other. I didn't really understand the other murders?\n\nMonochromatic rendering created some evocative imagery though was occasionally frustrating.

The story is compelling.  I loved the effect of the sunlight through the trees.  The game it\'s self is more creepy than scary.  If you like walking through strange worlds trying to figure things out, then I would recommend this game.  I loved it.","June 1","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
