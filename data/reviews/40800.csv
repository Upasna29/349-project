They're not kidding when they said this game was very hard! But aside from the high difficulty of this game, everything else is awesome. The soundtrack, the retro video games, the playable characters from other games, and I especially love the idea of the Dark World which clones all the main levels but made harder! If you are planning to buy this game, I suggest picking up the soundtrack too. What's an indie game without a zany soundtrack?\n\nBut let me tell you this one other thing: Practice makes perfect. With hours of practice and thousands of meat boys dying, you could negotiate the far reaches of the game and maybe even get the ironman achievements!

After passing the first boss I had to stop simply because my tired old bones and aching hands were almost suffering from RSI .  That said; this is a beautifully executed game that will keep the   most dedicated of platformer fans wanting more.\n\nSMB has an endearing  style of its own  (despite the copious  trails and splashes of blood with precisely  designed levels that  fit the theme of the game perfectly, plus  it takes me back to  the days when skill was   the most important  attribute for getting through  a level.  You'll need lots of that if you are to get to the   end of this game, especially unscathed.  I really don't know how anyone could get through a complete area without dying at least once.  You'd need to be superhuman, or   one of the best platformers in the world to beat   these levels.\n\n\nYou'll  often be  surprised or even relieved  at how short  some of the levels are (no more than about  30 seconds); that said, with a content of over 300 maps, bonus stages and hidden warp zones  that contain challenging extra-maps,  dark worlds (one for each stage, e.g. Salt Factory Dark World, Hell Dark World etc)  and,  not forgetting  the unlock-able characters which can be gained by collecting bandages that are placed in hard to get locations on several levels or   finishing warp zones - try getting through one of   the  main  stages or the hidden  dark worlds without dying to gain  achievements -  only  0.6% to 1% of the Meat boy community are  getting these achievements because they are ultra hard to  achieve.  Anyway, with all of these  extra's plus  using the editor, (which you'll find in your library under tools),  you have the potential to create unlimited  levels, that are only limited by your imagination, need for more levels  and stamina,  it's hard to get bored of this game. On top of that you're able to implement Maps made by the community.\nIf you don't already own SMB; now that its over 3 years old, you'll easily pick it up for a bargain price, especially in the many Steam sales that we get these days.\n\nI highly recommend this game, despite me not  achieving much in the way of completing most of the levels  yet , (I've spent over 20 hours playing this game already and I'm still hungry for more)   nor getting  many of the in game achievements (couldn't be bothered  collecting the bandages, lol).  I certainly intend returning to the game when my hands have recovered from the deviously  executed level designs.\n\n\nIf you've not played this game  get it as soon as you can; maybe check out the demo (unfortunately Steam don't offer a demo download), or play the browser  based   flash game:\nhttp://www.kongregate.com/games/edmund/meat-boy\nto get a feel for the game.\n\nHighly recommended and  a 9 out of 10 from me (it loses a point simply because  its a little too hard for me.\n\nLast words:  It's one of the best platformers of the last decade in my opinion (apart from maybe Gish).\n","December 12, 2013","true","28.6"," 72 of 82 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","72","82","0","0"

It stands out head and shoulders above the rest. It has a beautiful art style, cut scenes parodying old Nintendo games and a simple plot. A villain has taken Bandage Girl and you as Super Meat Boy must reach her at the end of every single level. When you get to her she gets whisked away time and time again. The 7 'chapters' each have around 20 levels that can get completed in 30 seconds or less. The real challenge here is that most everything causes instant death. Spikes, grinders, guns and pits. With each death, you respawn at the start with no load time. This keeps you in the game. Every chapter has its own theme including a forest, a hospital, a salt factory and even Hell itself. At the end of every level is a new and unique boss fight that usually consists of a race.\n\nEven if people have branded it a difficult game, you will eventually get through the game with enough practice. Since there are no lives and you just respawn, there is no consequence. While completing a level just leads to the next level, there is an easy to use map so you can go back and replay areas. On top of that, for every 'grade A' (under par time) that you get for a level, you can play its dark world counterpart making levels tougher. In all around 300 levels.\n\nEach level has their own gimmicks. Platform riding, touch bricks that dissolve, raising lava, shooting saw blades, conveyer belts and so on. Some levels even have keys that when touched they remove lock blocks automatically. There is a lot of variety here. The game ratchets up up the creativity with portals. Since Meat Boy is one block tall, he can fit most anywhere. Some levels have winding paths through factories. Others are broad jumps between conveyer belts that launch him into the area. There are warp zones to find in levels that will send you to far more difficult levels. All with simple controls.\n\nAs a square of meat, the controls are simple, left, right, jump and run. You can even jump off walls and slide down them. Sometimes your wall jump will slide you up from momentum. Other than that the game isn't slippery like other 2D platformers. Meat Boy can stop on a dime. Holding run and jump can fly you across the screen to where you need to be. The Steam version has plenty of unlockable characters from collecting band-aids in certain levels. You'll also get to play as other characters that have different abilities. At the end of each level you're treated to seeing all your failed attempts playing all at once.\n\nThere's not much to say about the game. Its charm, art and music make it more desirable to play than the average 2D challenging platformer. Super Meat Boy has a lot of content for your money, complete with a level designer to unlock. So many people like something that makes them throw their controllers.","December 3, 2014","true","10.1"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","38","42","0","13"

With a regular game I'd give a rating on it's story/gameplay/sound/voiceacting/art direction but Super Meat Boy only has 3 of those things, and so with that, here we go. I'm not going to review the story of the game because the story isn't really there.\n\nThe Gameplay of this game is a lot like putting your testicles in a blender and then grabbing a sledgehammer and...\nThe Gameplay of Super Meat Boy is interesting, to say the least. None of the levels are cheap enough to warrant that the game is impossible, but not many of them are easy enough to finish and say "that's it?". The gameplay is what you'd expect from a game like this, difficult, but fun nonetheless. Some will have more difficulty than others, and while I've finished playing this game on the Xbox 360, I haven't finished it with a keyboard. I will say this, although the game teases you for using a keyboard, I have not been having very many difficulties using one. You can unlock various characters by collecting 'Bandages' and by doing so will be able to play levels differently. I rate the gameplay of this game a 9/10, very good for an 'indie' game.\n\nThe music in super meat boy is catchy, albeit a little annoying, the sound quality is decent and it ties in a lot with the variation of levels. Some levels will be more difficult and the music will show that to be true. The music is about what you'd expect from a 2D sidescroller, you'll find it charming, and the game will show for that. 7/10\n\nThe Art Direction for this game is quite nice, I found it very nice and it ties in very well with the level design and whatnot. It gives you a cute vibe, which is especially strange considering you want to tie a noose around your neck every few levels. Super meat boy is an adorable game, and I find it very fitting for some reason. 8/10\n\nI really enjoyed this game, and for what it's worth, I find that the games content is enough to keep anyone happy for a good few hours. Great work, developers. 8/10\n","December 22, 2014","true","3.0"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","30","35","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpsf91/recommended/40800/","jpsf91","jpsf91","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpsf91/","478 products in account","This is a game that you have to play if you grew up in the 80's or the 90's, where hard platformers were very common. This game is also a hard platformer, but in a different way. When you die, you immediatly restart the level, without penalty. This allowed the developers to design the levels to be even harder, and part of the difficulty comes from the frustration of dying over and over again. Because if you ask me "is this game really that hard?" i would say that not exactly. The levels are hard, make no mistake, but if you can endure the wave of deaths you'll get better and beat the levels eventually. I can tell you that with some previous experience in platformers, anyone can 106% the game, if they can tolerate frustration. I didn't found the last levels to be very hard, but that was because i improved while i was playing and learning the entire game. If i could jump straight to those levels, i would probably be stuck for a long time. But all of this gives you the satisfaction of beating a hard level. The game has simple but tight controls, and they work well with the amazing level design of this game. It also has a cool art and awesome music. The music is very important because you will be listening the same songs over and over. But many times i was acapelling (?) along, so the music never feels old or tiring. There's a lot to do here, including normal levels, dark worlds levels (harder than normal), warp zone levels (with an awesome retro look and music) and bosses (the weakest part of the game to me). In total, there are over 320 levels. And then there's the Super Meat World, where you can play more levels designed by the developers and a lot of levels designed by the community. Many of those levels are cool because they are designed for other characters with special abilities that you can unlock in the main game, where i personally didn't used them very much. And those characters are from other games, like the head-crab form Half-Life and Captain Viridian from VVVVVV. There's plenty to play in both the main game and the community levels, and the entire game fells well designed and thought through. Truly one of best platfomers out there that anyone should at least try.","September 13, 2015","true","89.7"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","20","21","2","3"

For example, in Braid the platform mechanics was only a screen for the true gameplay, actual game problems were solved not by jumps, and by means of time rewind. Super Meat Boy — is an absolute platformer, absolutely banal and unartful in respect of basic mechanics. The hero can run and jump only. Isn't able to fight. Moreover, even if it will beautifully fall to the monster on the head then will be lost: enemies can't be touched. The purpose of each level — to reach the girlfriend by the name of Bandage Girl (it looks as a sexy pink square). The way to a subject of lamentations of the Supermeat Guy is blocked by traps: thorns, saws, lakes of a lava and salt deposits (our hero — a piece of the bared muscles, and contact with salt to it it is deadly). You wait for a dirty trick? Perhaps the enemy will slip on a trail of blood which tries to keep step with the hero? Or the Guy suddenly will manage to spread on a wall, how Gish? No. Anything similar. Only platforms and only jumps, all as 25 years ago. Each level is passed approximately from the 100-th time, but game is so prompt that you don't notice it …\nDirty trick in that if in senses to show to the person any level from Super Meat Boy, he will decide that scoff at it. How to you a cage, entirely utykanny huge circular saws (in it there is no place not that to jump, rise)? Or fight with the boss who fills with the body 90% of percent of the screen and presses the hero in a second after the fight beginning? At modern the platformernykh of heroes for such cases the magic is prepared: management of time or, for example, army of clones. And the Guy manages one only jumps. How to it it works well?\nEverything in matter in a control system. It is ideal. The hero sensitively reacts to commands of the joystick — it is capable to fly over a half of the screen in one jump or accurately to move on one pixel. Also you is thin you set the speed of run and you can change the flight direction during a jump. Besides, the Guy still is able to make a start from walls (all right, we played a cunning trick a little, having declared that his abilities are limited only to run and jumps). For an instant we will focus your attention: all aforesaid sounds is frankly banal, but it, to put it mildly, not so. Behind a control system of SMB stands monumental, it is possible even to tell — the universal concept.

So after 17 hours of sweaty, screaming game time I am finally giving you my opinion on this torture sim.\n\nAlthough this game is very hard and the majority of its players are now lying in padded cells, it is actually an incredibly addictive and fun masterpiece by the makers of The Binding Of Isaac, Team Meat. The games replayability is surprisingly prominent with its dark levels and secret hidden easter eggs and warp worlds.\n\nIn short, Super Meat Boy is about a small boy made of meat (pretty super if you ask me) on a journey to rescue his girlfriend, bandage girl, from the evil super villan, doctor fetus. His journey takes him on an adventure through such worlds as "rapture" and "woods" filled with conveniently placed walls (and inconveniently placed spinning blades) for fast paced and difficult 2D parkour. This game's blend of dark humour and impossible to complete final levels will leave you laughing whilst also crying in fear and rage.\n\nThis N-esque game (most amazing flash game ever) targets your nostalgia whilst also inviting new game mechanics and much harder levels. Some of the bosses are quite reminiscent of The Binding of Isaac, not in gameplay, but in it's spooky, speechless personality.\n\nThis game is notoriously challenging yet its sense of achievement is found in few other games on steam. This game deserves a strong 9.5/10 with the only downside being its floatyness (sorry, personable opinion) however this game will always have a place in my heart.","April 11, 2015","true","20.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","13","15","3","0"

In Super Meat Boy we play as Meat Boy. He loves Bandage Girl and she loves him. Dr Fetus hates both of them so he kidnaps Bandage Girl and its up to you to get her back. So how is this game ? This game is amazing and without doubt the biggest challenge i had to overcome in any video game ever. The game is a platformer where the goal is to reach Bandage Girl at the end of every level so you will have to run and jump and dodge your way through these levels. The game gets harder as you progress through the game getting to the level where you think a certain level is not even possible. The game also has smooth controlls so every death is your fault and not the games thats how good the controls are. The game is also pretty lenghty where you try to overcome 7 worlds where a boss awaits you at the end so you fight him. The game also has bandages which you can collect to unlock other charecters and also you can find hidden warp zones which can include other charecters from other games or even classic versions of meat boy that look like the games from the NES, GB era. The music is also really good  and you will get some of the songs stuck in youre head for a while. If you are a completionist you will simply hate the game cause its way too hard and some of the achievements are straight from hell. Overall theres nothing bad i can say about Super Meat Boy cause it is simply that good. Just remember this. This game is tough as nails and is one of the hardest games i have ever played and it took me quite a while to finish some of those levels. But once you did it you will feel really accomplished. Overall if you havent played Super Meat Boy and want a challenging game without a doubt get this game this instant. Just be prepared to be angry as hell. I give Super Meat Boy a 10/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","February 17, 2015","true","26.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

Would you be broken, beaten and scarred by an infinity of fiery pits, vicious rockets, monsters that look like a pile of vomit and, the worst of all, an infinity of saws and edgy materials that will cut you in pieces and splash your blood all over the place just to save your damsel from the evil robotic arms of Dr. Fetus, the malevolent villain of this grotesque world? That's exacly what our protagonist, Meat Boy, does. Bandage Girl, his girlfriend of sorts, is kidnapped by the forementioned Dr. fetus and Meat Boy must go through more than 300 deadly levels in order to save her. She waits at the end of each level, but as soon as our hero touches her she is teleported to the next level, and so on. With a side-scrolling, 2D platformer gameplay, Super Meat Boy is a challenging experience that may stress the calmest player. From the variety and originality of the levels, to the interesting bosses, this is one of the best platformers out there. Along with this, there are also special levels called "Warp Zones", that take players through a 3-level challenge that is graphically inspired by an old retro game. From Mario to the infamous E.T., there are even playable characters, each one with his advantages and disadvantages, that are based in (mostly) retro games, such as The Commander Video from the Bit.Trip Series, but there is also a headcrab from Half-Life and even a Minecraft character. So, this game is also a little tribute to the gaming culture. With achievements that could drive one to insanity (compare them to the XBox version and take conclusions), Super Meat Boy is one of the best indie games of the last few years. Besides some bugs and other small details, it's close to perfection. I give it a 93 out of 100.

My initial thought at first was that the game was over-rated and didn't deserve the glory that was bestowed on it. Boy....  or Meatboy rather... was I wrong!

The game is wonderfully sensitive to your every movement. It's both sick and maddening. You'll have to be precise in every movement but I love that about the challenge of this game. I can't remember the last time I played a 2D platforming game which controlled so fluidly, felt so fair when dying yet rewarding when finishing a level, and had such clever level design. Truly, Super Meat Boy puts games like Super Mario Bros. to shame.\n\nAs you progress, the game gradually gets more and more difficult. The levels do not stop getting more difficult, they don't get in a stagnant place, this is one of the first games I think I've ever placed where the difficulty doesn't just dip, spike or flatline, rather intelligently keeps a steady case of increasing while introducing you to new environments to change up the variety of levels. The replayability is high, you are timed after all and not only do you have the primary goal of finishing the level but you also get ratings for how fast you finish and can collect objects in the envirinment which later unlocks characters or other things.\n\nThere are bosses at the end of each world, while these boss battles aren't what you'd probably expect, they do give you a keen sense of rewarding the player with accomplishment. Since you cannot attack as Meatboy, you basically have to get from point A to point B without dying. While that may sound boring, it's not. Team Meat has perfected the point A to point B formula and that's truly impressive.\n\nPros  Insane difficulty will please even the most hardcore gamers in the world\nControls feel extraordinarily smooth\nTons of levels\nMeaty soundtrack\nUnlockable characters\nExclusive HeadCrab character\nCons  Players will rage, give up and move on\nStory could be told a little bit better\nFinal Thoughts:\nI highly recommend this game if you favor platforming games or just a challenging game in general. It's the Hotline Miami of the Platforming genre. According to one of the guys who made this game, only 8% of people who have ever played the game have finished it and now it's probably even less. If you have a history of anger problems or domestic violence, you may want to steer clear of this game for your own safety.\n\nRating (9 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","February 25","true","4.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","2"

Haven't played too many, and of the ones I have played Super Meat Boy is easily the most fast-paced, fun and challenging. Chances are you've heard about how hard it is and wanted to check it out if you're even reading this, and I recommend it easily. I've spent about 20 hours completing the first 3 worlds to 100% and starting the 4th (I'm trying to 100% the worlds before starting the next too :p), and though there have been a couple levels that seemed unreasonably difficult, the feeling you get when you complete the level is extremely satisfying, mentally and physically for your hands :p\nThe game may not be worth a full $15, but pretty much anything less is definitely good. I wouldn't say that many steam games at all though are worth that much (Maybe some of the bigger ones like Skyrim and such), but games like this are easily worth the few dollars you spend on it when it's on sale.","June 20, 2014","true","19.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Super Meat Boy is a very difficult 2D platformer with extremely tight controls, making it a very fun and enraging game if you don't happen to be a platformer-deity.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw30xLBT3-w\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You play as Super Meat Boy, a little red character made of meat, and has an amusing slurpy noise as you jump, hop, and run as fast as you can through the world to save your girl friend "Bandaid girl" from the evil Dr.Fetus. But that's all pretty much explained in the opening cinematic!\n\nGame Play: The controls of this game are deceptively simple, you can sprint, jump, and run left or right. You also can wall jump and side down walls. The game increases it's difficulty dramatically after the first level.\nThis game recommends a controller. Well I don't own one, so I've played through this whole game (and... haven't... beaten the last boss. T.T  )  When it says "use a controller" THEY'RE NOT JOKING, DO IT. FOR YOUR HANDS SAKE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T DO WHAT I DID.  I've never felt pain from playing a video game on a computer since I first started PC-gaming, and this game made my wrists and fingers hurt like never before. Do not use a keyboard if you love yourself.\n\nAchievements: No comment.\n...\nOkay fine, the achievements for this game are pretty ridicules, if You're amazingly good at platformers will be able to show off your crazy skills at playing this game. I've just concluded I'm putting this game on the shelf and not trying for achievements until I get a controller and want to break things in rage again.\n\nPrice: Super Meat Boy is currently priced at $14.99, I got the game on a 90% off sale, I've played the game for 19 hours, so for me that was a very good price, but I recommend getting it on sale.\n\nConclusion: While I enjoyed this game it will always be my "hardest game I've ever played" . I cannot say that I "don't recommend this game". I wouldn't recommend it for myself, but for most people who like 2D platformers, the game is actually quite fun!\nOnce again, emphasis on "If you are very good at 2D platformers, you will like this game" I was okay at Mario but apparently not nearly good enough to play this game and get the various achievements. And again, do yourself a favor and play this game with a controller. Even though the game controls are simple and straightforward, it will still hurt to play on a keyboard on the hard levels.\nTo recap: Don't talk to me about this game, unless you want to deal with me ranting about how much of a headache it's been to me, and how I wish I was good enough to get the achievements, wah wah wah.\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update February, 2016: Added a link to my YouTube Review for Super Meat Boy!","August 20, 2014","true","22.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The game (In most levels (249 of the 250+) you can beat the level in several different ways, this is a very good feature and reminds me very much of Bethesda's Dishonered.

I believe it will be studied in the not so distant future as the cornerstone it is. Its very tight controls, the awesome map layout, its great variety, the optimization of its mechanics and its humor are just some of the qualities that make it unique. The music is so great that I sometimes listen to it even when I’m not playing, the different characters offer different ways of beating the same levels and the way the game is divided into light and dark world is an awesome way of providing an additional challenge for those that crave for more.\n\nThe instant respawn, the original achievements, the boss stages and seeing all your deaths at the same time once you beat a level are just signs of how awesome this game is. Yes, you’ll probably rage quit anyway a few times, but after having a go at a difficult level for 50 times, you can do half of it with your eyes closed (seriously). It becomes such a mechanical action that I sometimes just used the time to think about other stuff and put my thoughts in order. It’s almost therapeutic. At the very end of the game, beating a stage could easily take me more than 60 minutes… and the worse is, that once you beat a level, you’re automatically ready for the next one. I’m terrible at this game (more than 50 hours and haven’t even done half of the dark world) but I still had a lot of fun. I’m ready to say goodbye, at least for now, to Super Meat Boy, but it will always hold a special place in my library (and my meaty heart). *dramatic chipmunk sound*","May 6","true","53.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrycheese/recommended/40800/","angrycheese","Angrycheese","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrycheese/","141 products in account","The main issue that Super Meat Boy has is that of being a precision platformer. There is a big reason peope dislike this genre. It is based more so around performing the exacts precise movement to get to the finish line instead of having various ways or approaches of finishing an obstacle. However, Super Meat Boy triumps this problem by being the best damn precision platformer ever.\n-\nFirst, how does SMB overcome the problems that come with a precision platformer? First, the level design is genuinely fun. Other than the couple final (bonus) levels where difficulty goes through the roof, it is built in such a way that before encountering a real obstacle, you get a level to learn the way it works without any big danger or work your way around it and even if you would get stuck, you can pretty much play the levels of an area in any order you want. This is a really good design choice as you may practice on whatever level you want. And if that is still not enough, there is the dark world mechanic (letting you play a harder version of the levels you beat in set time) that lets you practice on harder versions of levels.\n-\nNext, the unlockables have a big inpact on style of play. Unlike many other games where unlocked characters are there only for novelty value or very slight changes, here almost every character is useful. Whether it is to teach the new player and help him finish levels easier (Commander Video, Headcrab) or to make it possible for players to really break some levels if they know how to play (Flywrench, The Kid), all of these characters have a certain usefulness to them besides being fun. Not only that, but there are also bandages and warp zones. Overall, the game is just packed with content and lets you blaze through it at your own speed without making you rush into impossible challenges.\n-\nYou cannot have a cool precision platformer without cool music and graphics. Super Meat Boy does both excellently. The graphics have a very nice style to them that makes them feel both detailed and simple. It's not a style that is done lazily or retro for the sake of being retro or overcomplicated, instead it does it's job- it makes you see everything you need to and does not distract while being pleasing to the eye. Same with the music, although the soundtrack feels a little bit distracting at places, it sets the tone amazingly.\n-\nTalking about the positives, the game has a couple problems too, most of them come from a problem of the game being rushed (look that up, long story). The cutscenes, for example, feel half-♥♥♥♥♥. It is not very bothering though since the devs probably realised everyone would just watch them once and it feels good to know they instead spent their time polishing the game. Then there are a few questionable design decisions. I'm not sure why there are hidden warp zones in the game. Nobody will look for them, because these levels are not made to be explored. Everyone will just look up the location and go "oh, that's where it is".\n-\nOverall, the game has over 200 levels, awesome music and graphics, great level design, many characters, secrets...just as full of content as a platformer can be.\n-\nThe game gets a 9/10 and therefore very recommended.\n-\nFinal notes:\n*The game has a level editor and a mode where you can play fan-made levels. If you like this game, this will blow your mind.\n*There is a really nice Ultra Edition and Ultra Rare Edition, gettable pretty cheap. I recommend it.","April 21","true","120.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

The level design, everything. You can easily soak it as someone that just plays games casually for fun or as someone willing to challenge themself to the achievements that take excruciatingly long amounts of time to get, the most notable being the hardcore achievements, forcing you to fully finish a world or it's dark world counterpart (you unlock each level's dark world after achieving an A plus on the level for beating it in a certain amount of time). There will always be something to do and there will always be a challenge there that can make you sweat quickly. Also, there is a secret character. Type in blobgoo and you will get a character from world of goo. When you press shift, you can cling to walls forever. The length of this game is brilliant for an indie game with a great community that is still active, making art and more levels you can play in super meat world. On the other side of this masterpiece, the music can get drilled into your mind too easily and it's not even really good, and you have to watch each cutscene everytime you go into something everytime, and whenever you beat a boss it does a destruction scene then flips to the next world.

This is a tough but fun platformer for advanced gamers only -- you'll find yourself cussing as loudly as you cheer.  What separates this game from other platformers?  Two things: (1) you spawn as soon as you die so you get right back in the action and (2) the subtle yet precise controls are outstanding allowing you to perfectly manipulate Meat Boy.  Once you master controlling Meat Boy, you'll surprise yourself at some of the levels you'll complete leading to a rewarding experience.  Speaking of controls, it is highly recommended you use a game pad to play this.  I am using the Microsoft wireless XBox 360 controller.  This game has over 300 levels so you definitely get excellent value and hours of gameplay.

Perform this method until you pass that level. I was lucky to complete the game with in only 20 hours. About the game, it reminds me my old days. Especially, Retro Warp Zones.

You have been warned.\n\nAfter playing it for 70 hours, I have to say, this is the most well-coded platformer I have ever played. The controls on keyboard and gamepad are just amazing... The first levels are easy enough for anyone to play through, but from chapter 2 and on it will get harder. From chapter 4 and/or Dark World versions of the chapter 2+ the game will get really hard and you will die countless times unless you are very good at this game.\n\nIt does have a few CONS I will list:\n\n-Alt-tabbing will make your game crash very often if you're playing in fullscreen.\n-Game crashes randomly, about 1 time per 10 hours.\n-''Super Meat World'' has been disabled and you cannot upload more levels to it, because the devs didin't want to patch the game to prevent hackers from messing with the feature, there are a few thousands of levels on it I believe, but you will never be able to upload any more levels.\n-There's very rare glitches where you can die in walls or go through walls.\n\nOther than that though, this is a very amazing game, it's worth the price tag, it has over 50 hours of gameplay, 300 levels and it is addicting. The respawn timer is instant so you're always up to die again in the next few seconds if you are not careful. This game also has my favorite soundtrack ever made for a PC game.

A lot of people complain about its difficulty, and that's a point : even if SMB is a game meant to be played by everyone, it generally gets too hard when you get to Chad, the second boss of the game. I've also seen reviews about the pros and cons of the game, and FatalScriptError's is the most accurate to me : the only problem i found in this game is the lack of controls customization, even if the ones you have on the Xbox controller are far from being difficult to use. Speaking of which, people complain about being "forced" to play with a controller because they find the game too hard to complete with a keyboard. Well, as someone who completed the game using the two, i'd say that my preference also goes for the controller : i find it more comfortable to play with than the keyboard. From a general point of view, i'd say that if you've played platformer games before, (it's rare to see people who never tried a Mario game though ~) you'll be able to play through SMB without that much problems, even if i'd recommend you to play with the controller when you try it. Although, if you never played or aren't used to play this kind of game, you might find it WAY too hard, and even impossible to complete. Keep in mind that i am speedrunning this game and that my opinion might be highly influenced by that fact. Anyway, i hope you'll enjoy this game without thinking that you bought it for nothing just because you can't complete it.

A lot of people complain about its difficulty, and that's a point : even if SMB is a game meant to be played by everyone, it generally gets too hard when you get to Chad, the second boss of the game. I've also seen reviews about the pros and cons of the game, and FatalScriptError's is the most accurate to me : the only problem i found in this game is the lack of controls customization, even if the ones you have on the Xbox controller are far from being difficult to use. Speaking of which, people complain about being "forced" to play with a controller because they find the game too hard to complete with a keyboard. Well, as someone who completed the game using the two, i'd say that my preference also goes for the controller : i find it more comfortable to play with than the keyboard. From a general point of view, i'd say that if you've played platformer games before, (it's rare to see people who never tried a Mario game though ~) you'll be able to play through SMB without that much problems, even if i'd recommend you to play with the controller when you try it. Although, if you never played or aren't used to play this kind of game, you might find it WAY too hard, and even impossible to complete. Keep in mind that i am speedrunning this game and that my opinion might be highly influenced by that fact. Anyway, i hope you'll enjoy this game without thinking that you bought it for nothing just because you can't complete it. If you find it too hard, just leave this game and search for something that suits your playstyle more.","August 17, 2014","true","137.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

PLATFORM BLISS.\n\nSuper Meat Boy is one hell of an adrenaline rush and by calling it that is an understatement!  You follow your tale throughout Team Meat's adventure as Meat Boy which is basically a cube of meat...that's not surprisingly a boy. His quest to take back his dearly beloved lady, Bandage Girl, from the evil cluthes of Dr. Fetus is an exciting tale of anguish, but determination. As Meat Boy trudges through the 300+ innovative and unrelenting stages based on the retro platformers of yesteryear, he meets some fellow characters from other popular Flash Games such as Commander Video (Bit Trip Runner) and The Kid (I Want To Be The Guy) that can be used with their special abilities to better or even undermine you in levels.\n\nBe forwarned: THIS GAME IS HARD AS BALLS. You'll die, and die, and die, and probably even throw your pc out the window into the nearest freaking land heep of other computers that have been throwed out due to this game, but don't let this heed stop you from experiencing this. One thing to surely take from this game is how fair this aneurysm enducing experience is. The controls are precisely fined tuned and butter smooth which is heavily important in a twitch platforming game such as this. Even though this game boils down to being as hard as nails (especially apparent in later levels), each death is fair and most of the time caused by the player, him/herself, but with each and every nerve indusing calamity, it'll help you get a better grip and understanding of how to succeed in further attemps and better you in the future. For whenever you do conquer that one obstacle that's been blocking your way to success, the sense of accomplishment is unparalled and unrivaled. And before long, you'll be flying through with ease and flair like it's second nature!\n\nGraphics are nailed right down to the very center. Nostalgia is definitely an apparent factors as the art style is showcased in gnarly 16 bit fashion. This is carried even further as the bonus secret warp zone stages are brought forth in pure 8 bit style. Worth mentioning are the multiple worlds that you progress though and the levels that follow. Each world has a specific theme that let's the player know where your hero is venturing off into. Each and every level follows through to that suit of representation which really makes you relate to Meat Boy for each and every scenario he ends up getting in.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough! Video game references abound along with a plethora of snazzy, platforming stages to occupy one for days. This is the game that you should be letting your newborn play after he exits the womb. Or even after you Ram Jam your significant other, this is defintely the sweet spot of entertainment. So go out there bucko! No matter who you are, you'll definitely find something charming enough to warrant a purchase of Super Meat Boy.","June 27, 2014","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The one that kills you hundreds of times and when you complete it you're whole happy that you finally got over that thing?\nThat game has about 300 levels of that kind.\n\nSeriously though no one should get eaten by a godzilla.\n*real review*\nThe first thing you're going to notice in this game is its beautiful art and awesome music (which reveals itself in it's full potential later on)\nGame's concep is fun, a block of meat, saving a girl from a fetus. Yet as soon as you complete those early game tutorials (a couple of levels) it completly backstabs you and tends to be a total ♥♥♥♥. By that I'm of course looking at how hard it is (literaly died more than 100 times on some levels, and completed the game with the dark world (harder versions of levels) with 12,5k deaths).\nDifficulty aside it retains those cute little cutscenes (I really like them, personally) and can eat your time quite easly.\nAnd when you complete a level you always have that smile on your face, the one the tells you you completed something hard (and then you're raging about the next level a minute later)\n\nConclusion:\nBuy this game if you have a lot of patience and appreciate good artstyle (even if it's 2d) and soundtrack.\nBuy it if you like challanges and if you're not turned off by hard looking levels (even if it really turns out to be hard)\nDon't buy it if not anything of the above (oh and just FYI I tought I was patient before this game)\n\nAs for playing with keyboard, it's completely fine and playable controls wise on a keyboard (never tried with a controller). It really depends though with what you're more used to playing.\nSo don't worry about the controls\n\nMy final rating is somewhere around 8.5/10 just beacuse I have a feeling It should get this rating.

PLATFORM BLISS.\n\nSuper Meat Boy is one hell of an adrenaline rush and by calling it that is an understatement!  You follow your tale throughout Team Meat's adventure as Meat Boy which is basically a cube of meat...that's not surprisingly a boy. His quest to take back his dearly beloved lady, Bandage Girl, from the evil cluthes of Dr. Fetus is an exciting tale of anguish, but determination. As Meat Boy trudges through the 300+ innovative and unrelenting stages based on the retro platformers of yesteryear, he meets some fellow characters from other popular Flash Games such as Commander Video (Bit Trip Runner) and The Kid (I Want To Be The Guy) that can be used with their special abilities to better or even undermine you in levels.\n\nBe forwarned: THIS GAME IS HARD AS BALLS. You'll die, and die, and die, and probably even throw your pc out the window into the nearest freaking land heep of other computers that have been throwed out due to this game, but don't let this heed stop you from experiencing this. One thing to surely take from this game is how fair this aneurysm enducing experience is. The controls are precisely fined tuned and butter smooth which is heavily important in a twitch platforming game such as this. Even though this game boils down to being as hard as nails (especially apparent in later levels), each death is fair and most of the time caused by the player, him/herself, but with each and every nerve indusing calamity, it'll help you get a better grip and understanding of how to succeed in further attemps and better you in the future. For whenever you do conquer that one obstacle that's been blocking your way to success, the sense of accomplishment is unparalled and unrivaled. And before long, you'll be flying through with ease and flair like it's second nature!\n\nGraphics are nailed right down to the very center. Nostalgia is definitely an apparent factors as the art style is showcased in gnarly 16 bit fashion. This is carried even further as the bonus secret warp zone stages are brought forth in pure 8 bit style. Worth mentioning are the multiple worlds that you progress though and the levels that follow. Each world has a specific theme that let's the player know where your hero is venturing off into. Each and every level follows through to that suit of representation which really makes you relate to Meat Boy for each and every scenario he ends up getting in.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough! Video game references abound along with a plethora of snazzy, platforming stages to occupy one for days. This is the game that you should be letting your newborn play after he exits the womb. Or even after you Ram Jam your significant other, this is defintely the sweet spot of entertainment. So go out there bucko! No matter who you are, you'll definitely find something charming enough to warrant a purchase of Super Meat Boy.","June 27, 2014","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sacrificing his own well being to save his damsel in distress. Super Meat Boy brings the old school difficulty of classic NES titles like Mega Man 2, Ghost and Goblins and Super Mario Bros. 2 (The Japanese one) and stream lines them down to the essential no BS straight forward twitch reflex platforming.\n\nRamping up in difficulty from hard to soul crushing SMB will drag Meat boy though haunted hospitals, salt factories and even hell itself.

The stages are nice and challenging, it's fast paced, the music kicks butt, and the controls are great. One of the things that makes Super Meat Boy so amazing is that it never feels unfair. If you die, you just respawn at the beginning of the stage like nothing happened. The music doesn't even restart. Even if you die a hundred times, it doesn't effect your time whatsoever. The stages are short enough to where you can get back to the place you died in mere seconds.\n\nBut be warned, while this game ISN'T unfair, it will still kick your butt so hard, that you won't be able to sit. Team Meat brought back the extreme challenge of the NES days. If you are patient with this game, you will conquer it.\n\nAnother thing that makes this game fun are the unlockable characters. They are all characters from other games. Some of which include Steve from Minecraft and The Headcrab from Half-Life.\n\nThis is a fantastic game, and I reccomend it to anyone looking for a good challenge.\n","April 17, 2014","true","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The game may have a reputation for being overwhelmingly difficult, but it does a good job of easing in different elements to prepare you for the hard worlds, so the difficulty is not unfair. The later levels do however become increasingly unforgiving and can require near perfect jumps and timing, meaning anyone easily frustrated may give up. The environments and music are very well polished, which lends character to a game like this with its simple mechanics. Retro warp zones, hidden bandages, boss battles, and unlockable characters all provide a break from the normal speedy gameplay. Unfortunately there are some occasional crashes, and the global leaderboards have been hacked to bits which is disappointing. Despite a few problems, Super Meat Boy's excellent gameplay outshines any of its flaws.","July 18, 2012","true","119.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

They take longer than most levels and there are no checkpoints, so if you're having trouble with a certain boss and/or mess up somewhere at the end, it'll get really frustrating.

The stages are nice and challenging, it's fast paced, the music kicks butt, and the controls are great. One of the things that makes Super Meat Boy so amazing is that it never feels unfair. If you die, you just respawn at the beginning of the stage like nothing happened. The music doesn't even restart. Even if you die a hundred times, it doesn't effect your time whatsoever. The stages are short enough to where you can get back to the place you died in mere seconds.\n\nBut be warned, while this game ISN'T unfair, it will still kick your butt so hard, that you won't be able to sit. Team Meat brought back the extreme challenge of the NES days. If you are patient with this game, you will conquer it.\n\nAnother thing that makes this game fun are the unlockable characters. They are all characters from other games. Some of which include Steve from Minecraft and The Headcrab from Half-Life.\n\nThis is a fantastic game, and I reccomend it to anyone looking for a good challenge.\n","April 17, 2014","true","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's greatly inspired by the charm and difficulty of games from the 8 bit era of gaming, however, it isn't at all weighed down by the issues prevelant in games of that time. The game is as simple as running and jumping, there are no power ups or alterations of the game's core mechanics. Super Meat Boy relies on it's level design and tight controls to flesh out the game, and where games of the past would have been tedius, SMB values the player's time. Deaths are quick, and respawns are almost instant. Playing through a world in this game may take you hours at first, but after practice, you can blast through levels in mere seconds. It's a game that you can pick up and play for any amount of time and have a good time, but also one that has hours of content behind it, thanks to hundreds of levels and a ton of unlockables. Super Meat Boy truly is a treat for any fan of 2D platformers looking for a challenge.","April 9","true","40.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is mercilessly difficult, but you get infinite respawns on each level.

For example, I love that after you beat a level, the game shows you a replay with all of your earlier attempts running the course at the same time. So if you needed 20 attempts to beat a level, you get to see 19 failures chasing along with your victorious effort, all flaming out. This is great fun to watch, as death comes quickly and violently.\n\nI also appreciate that leaderboards are tracked automatically, and the game shows me not just how I'm faring compared to the world, but vs my Steam friends list, as well. (Not very well, I'm sorry to say.)\n\nTruth be told, though, I get aggravated pretty quickly playing Super Meat Boy. The repetition and frustration factor is very high. However, I appreciate it as a game to play is brief doses, knocking off a few levels at a time. I plan to work my way through this difficult game whenever I need a quick gaming fix. Any larger dose than that, and I’m afraid that this game might give me an aneurysm from the intense frustration. In the 80’s, we had to pump coins to keep playing. SMB lets you attempt 10, 100, or 1000 tries in a sitting, if you need that many to get through a level.

So if you needed 20 attempts to beat a level, you get to see 19 failures chasing along with your victorious effort, all flaming out. This is great fun to watch, as death comes quickly and violently.\n\nI also appreciate that leaderboards are tracked automatically, and the game shows me not just how I'm faring compared to the world, but vs my Steam friends list, as well. (Not very well, I'm sorry to say.)\n\nTruth be told, though, I get aggravated pretty quickly playing Super Meat Boy. The repetition and frustration factor is very high. However, I appreciate it as a game to play is brief doses, knocking off a few levels at a time. I plan to work my way through this difficult game whenever I need a quick gaming fix. Any larger dose than that, and I’m afraid that this game might give me an aneurysm from the intense frustration. In the 80’s, we had to pump coins to keep playing. SMB lets you attempt 10, 100, or 1000 tries in a sitting, if you need that many to get through a level. Gah!\n","August 25, 2013","true","8.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The only problem I have with this game is the Home Screen and it's also very difficult to play this game using a computer kayboard! The Home screen I think could have way more potential, because it only has a picture of Super Meat Boy and also certain options you can choose from. the only thing wrong with using your keyboard to play this game is, it's only used by expert parkour players, but beside these reasons, I highly recommend this game for everyone!","January 20, 2014","true","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

From the intense-though-always-fair difficulty and the inspired level design, to the pinpoint controls and catchy soundtrack, all of the different aspects converge into something that is truly outstanding. When you hear stories of the unrepentant dangers that stand in your path, it's easy to get intimidated by such a daunting prospect. But don't be. The beauty of Super Meat Boy is that it always plays within the rules, and the smooth difficulty curve gives you plenty of time to become acquainted with everything before the true tests are unleashed. Death is always just one misstep away in Super Meat Boy, but the rush of winning is so supremely rewarding that you won't be able to tear yourself away.8.7/10","January 8, 2014","true","10.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game will either infuriate you to an unnatural level, or be the most fun fast paced side scrolling platformer you've ever played. For me, i absolutely love this game. Team Meat! Really hit it out of the park with this one, this game definitely has brilliant reviews and awards for a reason.\nFor starters, it is you're average "save the damsel in distress" game, but with unique and amazing gameplay.\nYou have short little cut scenes that expand the situation after every stage, and then you're thrown straight into this fast paced side scrolling platformer. You can race against the clock to see how good of a rating you can get or leisurely bounce throughout the level at your own pace. For every "A+" rating you get, you unlock that level in the "dark world" which is essentially hard mode. I felt that in each level, to get that A+ rating, every jump and every move you make has to be precise and timed perfectly. A hell of a lot of the times, you're life depends on it. you can expect to die in this game many many times, but the respawn is quick as lightning, usually in games if i die and i have to sit around to respawn again I’ll get agitated, but you're back up as quickly as you were taken down, ready to try that level again. Some levels are complicated and only having one life to complete it really gets your heart rate going, for me the pressure makes it all that much more fun, dodging blades, saws, missiles, monsters, lava and much more as the game progresses, it starts to become a real challenge.\nThere’s also a fun little system of collectables you can use to unlock new characters and “retro” levels. Each of the characters have different abilities that can help you in harder levels.\nYou are meat boy, a boy made of meat, and your girlfriend is bandage girl. It’s gross but weirdly sweet, as I’ve heard before in an interview the developer did, that meat boy’s skinless body makes him vulnerable and bandage girl protects him. (Even though he's doing the rescuing) meat boy fights to get that back.\nAnyone familiar with Edmund Mcmillens work will recognise the brilliant art style a mile off, his games really take you into the mind of the developer, the crazy ideas he comes up with could only be a work of Edmunds.\nThe Music in this game is amazing, and the way it plays so smoothly throughout your stay is great, when you die, it doesn’t stop or restart, it’s not painfully repetitive and it fits well with the setting. It really adds to the experience, hectic fast paced music for a hectic fast paced game, it’s great. I even went as far as to add the soundtrack to my collection of music.\nI could talk forever about how highly I think of this game, but hopefully I’ve said enough for it to be something people would consider trying, all in all, it’s a great game, and if you don’t want to pay full price, buy it when it’s on sale. It’s worth the time and money put into it, but again… if you are someone with a short fuse, and can see this game getting on your nerves, maybe it isn’t for you. You will either love it or hate it.\n","July 4, 2013","true","32.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Super Meat Boy delivers a good experience.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are well-made, it looks like they intended it to be a flash game from the beginning if you ask me. I rate the graphics 9/10.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is great, good old platforming. Beware though, the game is HARD. It's not just a little bit hard, the difficulty is near games released for the NES if you know what i mean. Don't be suprised if you fail a level multiple times, you'll pass it eventually. However, to compensate for the high difficulty, you have unlimited lives, so you don't have to worry about getting a game over. You can also find bandages on some levels which, if you collect enough, you will unlock a new character to play as. However, i do recommend to use a controller to play the game, as the keyboard controls can be a bit akward. Overall, the gameplay is great. 10/10.\n\nStory: The story is very video game-clichê like, you have the main character, Meat Boy, who has a girlfriend, Bandage Girl. They love each other. The villain is Dr. Fetus, a guy nobody likes. One day, out of anger, he kidnaps Bandage Girl, and Meat Boy must rescue her. As you can see, the plot is VERY similiar to any Super Mario game. I give the story 6/10.\n\nMusic: The music is fantastic, it gets you warmed-up for some hard platforming action. Every theme fits perfectly where they are played. 10/10.\n\nIn conclusion, Super Meat Boy is a challenging, but rewarding and fun game. However, not everyone will appreciate the high difficulty the game has. If you don't like dying over and over, the game might not be for you. However, if you're a hardcore gamer who wants a good challenge, then pick this game up. You won't regret it.\n\nFinal Score: 8/10.","January 9, 2015","true","5.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","1"

Put at least 50-60 hours into the Xbox Live version. Love it so much as to buy it a second time on Steam WITH the massive jam-packed soundtrack.\n\nsome of the best controls in any platformer (with a gamepad), period. Challenging in all the right, old-school ways. Visually charming in a modernized retro way. ABSOLUTELY STUFFED with content and user-supported levels.\n\nCan't recommend this enough to any gamer, especially those seeking a remarkably satisfying and challenging platformer.

The story is pretty much like every Super Mario game ever, safe the girl from the evil guy who's far too strong for you to take on without super powers.\n\nMeat boy has one main 'super power' and that is running really fast! It helps in most situations, in some however, you most likely will not run but simply walk, because jumps are different when you run. The game's mechanics are quite simple, dodge incoming objects, try to survive long jumps, understand the way things are. The controls itself are quite easy to understand and you grow to become a pro. The game takes you on easily, becoming more difficult as you proceed through the levels until you're at the final stage!\n\nThe game seems rather short, but believe me, you'll grow to love it and play it over and over again, as most people I know do. The game is so simple, yet so difficult sometimes. You get to rage every now and then because your jump was too fast, or you didn't see an incoming object! But exactly that rage, keeps you playing, because you want to prove that you can dodge the spikes and get all the bandages.\n\n\nGood\nEasy to understand controls.\nAmazing Soundtrack!\nMany more things to do after the story\nExtra levels you can download online!\n(Plays on crappy laptops)\nBad\nScrew up once and you gotta keep trying.\nSome achievements are way too difficult to get!\nAll in all, I will give this game a 7/10, it's great, the price is okay, but if it's possible, get it cheaper, since it's an older game, that shouldn't be too hard.","January 14, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeltrain/recommended/40800/","eeltrain","Knife-Armed Robot Hedgehog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeltrain/","144 products in account","Super Meat Boy is hard. Delightfully hard. It's difficult to exaggerate or, on the other hand, put cleanly into words the violent sinewave of emotion you'll feel as you appreciate a level's intriguing challenge, get frustrated when you realize you've died 20 times with nothing to show for it, finally beat it with your self-confidence taking a leap, and get thrusted into the next level. It all makes for a much richer and more meaningful experience when you're done (or have decided to take a break). Super Meat Boy is an acclaimed challenge, a rite of bash-age for self-respecting modern gamers, and it deserves in every way to be.\n\nI first tried this game at a meeting with a team with which I'm developing a game right now, while one member had walked away from his computer for a few minutes. I wasn't too impressed initially; the floaty platforming physics and slapstick, adult-cartoon aesthetics called to mind the unfortunate epithet "one of THOSE indie games." I didn't think much more about it until I happened to pick up a Steam card a couple months later. (As a helpless college student, the closest thing I have to a credit card is unconfirmed and unusable.) At that point, I figured, sure, why not, I'd give it a second chance. After all, I needed distractions from the more pressing issues over break, like getting a job.\n\nThe bloody mess grew on me. Like Meat Boy leaping vulnerably over a mesh of squealing gears, caked in the congealing bodily fluids of his unlucky clones, I narrowly averted the tragedy of letting my experience end at mediocrity by actually investing time in the game. As I learned, it's not a product you can touch once for a short time and claim to have experienced; like a young pet, it just needs more time and love. You will grow as a player as you, with fractions of fractions of seconds standing in your way, let countless Meat Boys be ground up, crushed, or burned to death. Even as a seasoned platforming player, you will be in for a long battle.\n\nHopefully you won't bleed too hard yourself.","January 1, 2014","true","41.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything about the game suggests that the developers knew exactly what they were doing. From little design quirks to more noticeable ones. For instance, every level is specifically tailored to be able to be speed ran. Time Trials are implemented as a test of definitive skill. Different characters are thrown in as unlockables for you to experiment with their different gameplay/physics/controls. Hidden bandages and warp zones add an element of exploration to the game. Ect.\n\nThe controls are spot on and really compliment the obstacles. Without the precise controls and creative traps/obstacles, this game would fall apart. The difficulty is perfect, despite what some may say. In fact I find the difficulty much overhyped, the game isn't nearly as hard as a lot of NES games were. This is how a game is supposed to be. Games are supposed to challenge you, not every game is meant to be beaten by everyone who plays it, that's not a "game". People who grew up with modern "games" that coddle you with a safety net and hold your hand with interlaced fingers while frolicking through a field of flowers need not apply.","December 26, 2013","true","37.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the physics and movement of your character make sense and feel similar to the old 8-bit platformers, there's a substantial input buffer and amount of input lag on Super Meat Boy.  This basically means that you'll often feel frustrated not because you messed up yourself, but because your character jumped when you didn't press jump or failed to jump when you pressed it.  Platformers need snappy, responsive controls, not loose ones.","August 26, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes a lot of fast reflexes. I haven't "raged" because when you die, you see what you did wrong and now know to improve it. Games that make you die for no reason make me angry. MarioKart 150cc makes me scream and want to punch a wall because of how unfair it is. This game is much more fair, although sometimes the hitboxes on spikes will bug out and get you. Once you beat that level you've been stuck on for a while, you get a great feeling of achievement. It does take quite a lot of time to unlock everything but it is worth it. I've already got %100 and it is fun to play using the unique characters you unlock. Some achievements that require "Beat ___ without dying" are near impossible and will take hours of playtime. The quest to %100 the game will be hard but worth it. RECCOMENDED: Get an XBox controller.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reevo_/recommended/40800/","reevo_","REEVO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reevo_/","309 products in account","Super Meat Boy is a special type of game. Its one that mainly appeals to the gamer who enjoys quick bursts of endorphins that are difficult to achieve. This platformer yeilds a learning curve that turns most people away, but if you have the guts and patients to jump, die, jump and die again, then this game is worth it!\n\nEnter the world of super meat boy, where just about everything except the floor is out to turn you into the next preservative injected burger at your local restaurant! Due to the tight controls of Super Meat Boy, constantly dying can only be blamed on you...yourself...not the game...sad huh?\nThere isn't much of a story to speak of in Super Meat Boy, bandage girl gets stolen, and you pull a Mario to jump your way to the last world and jump on that evil Dr. Fetus'...fetus body suit thingy...\n\nThe gameplay is somewhat unique to the platformer genre, mainly because of the increased difficulty and the option to play through harder levels with multiple characters, that are suprisingly different and all fun to use! Throughout the game you will master verticle climbs, sprint jumps, black hole avoiding, dying, and speed, lots of speed. Oh yea and dying. You do alot of that, did I say that already?\nSuper Meat Boy possesses the NewGrounds Feel, or at least that is what I call it. It has much flash animation influence throughout the cut scenes, and the in game animations  and textures are simple, but work to your advantage. For example, many textures that are not immedialy touchable, mostly blend in to the other blocks, and the moving objects, such as spinning blades, are mostly what stand out.\n\nAll in all, Super Meat Boy is a highly addictive game, and if you have the time and patients to adapt to the steep learning curve, is a MUST BUY!\n10/10","February 20, 2013","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The challenge curve rises as you play, having a challenging enough boss on in the end of Tier 1. If you find this extremely hard until then, just don't play it anymore. This game will be your purgatory. It will be a sweet torture. You will feel the need to finish it, but on the other hand it will troll you to death. It needs skill and a GAMEPAD! Don't use keyboard, I am still in pain the moment I write these words.\nI enjoyed it and I recommend it with all my heart to all retro fanatic hardcore gamers out there.\nYou can recommend this game to your friends, but also to your enemies too.

You need hard effort just to finish Light World and extremely hard effort to finish Dark World (Light World counterpart, same levels upgraded with more deadly stuff). There're tons of levels where difficulty grows gradually. Some levels maybe looks impossible at first sight, but after hundreds of trying (literally), every level can be solved.\nIf you finish both worlds, you can peacefully leave the gaming career, knowing you completed the famous Super Meat Boy and live happily ever after until end of your days.\n\n10/10 - God among platform games","December 8, 2012","true","54.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I will say this now don`t play this game if your bald, because you won`t know what to do when you are supposed to be pulling your hair out. This is one of the hardest games I have ever played. I havn`t even beaten the final boss battle because of the difficulty. Even while playing Ave Maria in the background to keep my blood from boiling.\n\nBut, this is an entertaining game. It presents great challenges to players, but with great reward. First, somelevels present multiple paths to completion in a fast paced environment. You can go slowly but we all want that A+. After playing the level a bit (A ♥♥♥♥ING LOT) you get a hang of the pace and environment, at this point you feel MLG, zipping through obstacles like you made the game. This takes a while on its own. But at that moment where you beat a level you played 70 times you feel like a god. You feel as if you conquered the impossible and that is what makes you play more. I was hooked to this game till I became permenatly stuck (I`ve done the boss battle level 250+ times and just can`t) but still, it was an entertaining experience.\n\nI do recommend this game but buyer beware! It is anything but a cake walk. You will get frusterated, you may even yell (I did a lot) but that is part of the experience.

Even if you constantly fail you are just inspired to keep pushing on until you can do every level in a single run (since you will have to) and then you watch the replay in awe when you breezed through perfectly, and are also able to observe all the failures at the same time, as added bonus. The art style is sometimes disgusting but often endearing and really adds to the feel and mood they were trying to create.. If you get it, also do yourself a favor and buy the soundtrack along with it. It is all kinds of good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeoTerrifrit/recommended/40800/","GeoTerrifrit","The Highwayman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeoTerrifrit/","170 products in account","Super Meat Boy.  The one and only platforming game I've played in the last two years, and it's very easy to explain why. It's good. In fact it's more than good because it's the most excellently executed 2D platformer since Super Mario World. In fact I'm going to say something about that. Everything in this game is a modern take on the retro style of 2D platform games, but as much as it takes from that time long ago, it doesn't completely thrive off of that. It is its own game too.\n\nThe gameplay is by far the first and foremost reason why I played this for two years.The controls are incredibly well done, because I never have to worry about something in the game screwing me over (except occasional lag spikes that can't be helped, I blame that it was meant to be on Flash). Every level is treated like a puzzle, and at points, obstacles in a level are treated as a puzzle. It is at times difficult to solve but never unsolvable. And through that you get into the thought process that it will be possible to beat this level as long as I keep trying new strategies. Which makes it addicting as hell, which I love.\n\nThe story is simple, but it allows you to fill in the blanks like most games back in the old days. I'm sure they had this in mind the whole time they were making it, and of course it shows through all of the references to older games it makes in easy and not so easy to reach places. The references range from obvious to obscure, but either way you'll at least find a thing or two you recognize.\n\nThe music will take you back just like the story does, but it's so well modernized that you wonder to yourself every now and again if you've heard this music before. You haven't, and it gives the game its own originality and atmosphere that you won't find in another game. Danny Baranowsky, the composer for Super Meat Boy is a legend, and this soundtrack will feel like you're going through one or that you are one yourself. That's one impactful soundtrack if you ask me.\n\nSuper Meat Boy. A hero's tale that can start either with a tiny blob of meat, or the person controlling that blob. Your choice.","March 29, 2014","true","204.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's the best way to describe Super Meat Boy.  An intensely unforgiving platformer requiring split-second precision, Super Meat Boy still manages to present a gameplay experience which ramps up the difficulty gradually, working you up to levels of difficulty you never thought you'd be able to manage.\n\nEven with that, you will die a lot.  A LOT.  Did I mention the unforgiving part?  The slightest mistake will usually result in Meat Boy's explosive demise, but rather than having dire consequences this just means a second delay before you've respawned and are off again.  You'll get it eventually, and when you do you'll feel like the greatest gamer alive.  At least, until the next level....\n\nThe game is surprisingly long.  The "main campaign", such as it is, is long enough, but once you're done with that there's still all the alternate (and much harder) versions of levels to complete.  There's also collectables to grab, which in turn unlock additional characters with special abilities, which in turn let you get access to more collectables that you couldn't reach previously.  There's also a handful of super-secret levels (retro and glitch) which only give you a certain number of lives to complete the level in.  And if that wasn't hard enough, there's the bonus world, Cotton Alley.  Yes, the name is ironic, and yes, there are alternate versions of all the levels.\n\nIf you want an intense platformer you can play in short bursts, Super Meat Boy will fit the bill.  If you're looking for an insanely hard experience with lots of secrets to unlock, Super Meat Boy can also fit that bill too.  Either way, it's fun, provided you have the necessary platformer wizardry to manage it.","December 21, 2013","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game can be quite relaxing and also quite tense, as anyone who has completed a boss battle will know. You play as Super Meat boy, and you have to complete platformer tasks to get to your love, who has been stolen by Dr Fetus (whose trading card is badass in a photo). This is the kind of game in which you die a lot, sometimes hundreds of times in one level; although, I have never enjoyed dying so much as I do in Super Meat Boy. You respawn instantly, and the amount of deaths do not matter at all to your score or completion of the game.\n\nI reccommend Super Meat Boy. I do not play many Indie games, but I love this game. If you play a lot of Indie games, I dare say you will love this game even more.","October 28, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The reason is: this game is never unfair, just very difficult. Old NES games could be unfair and rage-inducing (not saying this game isn't rageworthy at some points- I'm talking to you, The Kid stage) at points, but this game is always fair in its difficulty. I'd reccomend this game to almost anyone, because it's really not that hard just going through the main game, most of the extreme difficulty comes from the dark world (the alternate "hard-mode" version of each stage), Cotton Alley (the extra level after the final boss), and the warp zones, both retro and character-unlocking. Don't get me wrong, the main game is still hard, but doable until you get to some of the last stages, but your skills will be most likely up to the challenge at that point. I'd give this game a 9.75/10.","December 2, 2013","true","106.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not that I've ever been a particulary amazing platformer player, however I found this game very challenging. But this was a good thing overall, it meant that I wasn't flying through the levels really quickly and also that I could go back and replay levels I'd previously done to get better times and stuff. The game itself has lots of levels (over 600 I think) and I've enjoyed all I played so far. However, do be warned that at times this game will want to make you poke your own eyes out (not because of the visuals they are really good) but simply because getting stuck on a level is so depressing and irritating.\nConsidering this however I would still recommend this game 75/100","January 9, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will say this now don`t play this game if your bald, because you won`t know what to do when you are supposed to be pulling your hair out. This is one of the hardest games I have ever played. I havn`t even beaten the final boss battle because of the difficulty. Even while playing Ave Maria in the background to keep my blood from boiling.\n\nBut, this is an entertaining game. It presents great challenges to players, but with great reward. First, somelevels present multiple paths to completion in a fast paced environment. You can go slowly but we all want that A+. After playing the level a bit (A ♥♥♥♥ING LOT) you get a hang of the pace and environment, at this point you feel MLG, zipping through obstacles like you made the game. This takes a while on its own. But at that moment where you beat a level you played 70 times you feel like a god. You feel as if you conquered the impossible and that is what makes you play more. I was hooked to this game till I became permenatly stuck (I`ve done the boss battle level 250+ times and just can`t) but still, it was an entertaining experience.\n\nI do recommend this game but buyer beware! It is anything but a cake walk. You will get frusterated, you may even yell (I did a lot) but that is part of the experience.

The controls are solid and the challenge is legitimate from beginning to end. If you're looking for a sidescroller to test your raw platforming skills, this will do it.\n\nI have to attribute that it gets stale after a single-digit number of hours though. Yes, there are unlockable levels and characters, but repeating levels gets monotonous pretty quickly (especially with how unvaryingly basic most of the gameplay is), and the game gives you a lot more incentive to play meatboy over anyone else, outright forcing you for many of the levels such as the warp zones, bosses, and extra world.\n\nAdditionally, this was designed with a gamepad in mind.

It has hours and hours of content, should you choose to play all the levels, and an absolutely perfect difficulty curve. You start the game running into every saw in sight, but if you keep on playing, you get better and better, and by the time you reach Cotton Alley Dark World, it's no problem. Well... maybe a little bit of a problem. But doable. Doable in such a fun way.\n\nMy only regret is that I could never get one of the bandages... I will forever have a 99 bandage file...

It was made with passion and hard work, I bought it after seeing the Indie Games movie, just by looking at their eyes while they talk about their life and their passion for the game was enough to me to give it a try. And I'm glad I did, this game has soul, despite the old school graphics (which I find quite nice with nowadays improvements) Super Meat Boy brings a passionate story, while not something as complicated as an RPG game, it succeeds by giving you enough to love the game and focus on the challenges of the good old plataformers. You can't go wrong with this game, unless you really hate any sort of challenge and prefer those interactive story games this game is a must.\n\n"As beautiful as it is hard.
