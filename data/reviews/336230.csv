This means that you have a limited amount of commands available with which to guide your protagonist to the goal. If you have ever played boardgames like Robo Turtles or Robo Rally the game mechanics should be familiar to you. Don't let yourself be fooled by the fun and cartoonish artwork or even the easy first levels. This game gets harder as it progresses.\n\nI'm one of those gamers who likes to buy his game on the cheap. Yet this is one of the few games I  bought the day it was launched here on steam. It's on sale now, but really you should buy this game even at full price.","June 9, 2015","true","1.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

I am going to leave it to you to discover all the different game elements, as that is half the fun.\n\n10 outa' 10 - for sure!\n\n","July 14, 2015","true","67.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Your job is to lead the heroes to the goal by placing "commands" on the floor. They will push blocks, avoid traps, and use their abilities and even team up every now and then.\n\nThis game reminds me of RUSH, also in Steam, which has the exact same premise only it is in full 3D, where you lead blocks to certain goals by placing commands on the floor. It also reminds me of Parcel and other Sokoban-type games alike, due to the nature of pushing blocks out of the way and using their special abilities to reach the goal.\n\nWith that said, I would rather play RUSH because it is the superior game, in my opinion. Also, I would rather play other Sokoban games for the block-pushing mechanics, such as Parcel and the like.","February 9","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
