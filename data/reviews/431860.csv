It looks really simple but you have to memorize which combination does what and then be able to do that in a timely manner for the timed levels and be able to see a couple of moves ahead to complete the levels with the arrows in them (from the trailer.)\n\nSomething that isn't in the game or at least not explained that well is how the combinations work. Here they are:\n\nStarting with the block followed by what it is combined with then what that ends up making. Colors stay in their teirs (additive and subtractive) and do not combine with each other. It took me a while to figure that out to be quite honest and I think this will help you out if you're interested:\n\nblue w/red=megenta\nblue w/green=cyan\n\ngreen w/blue=cyan\ngreen w/red=yellow\n\nred w/blue=magenta\nred/wgreen=yellow\n\nmagenta w/cyan=blue\nmagenta w/yellow=red\n\ncyan w/yellow=green\ncyan w/magenta=blue\n\nyellow w/cyan=green\nyellow w/magenta=red\n\nSo basically you have different worlds that have a base block color that all the puzzles will require you to turn all the blocks in to. The first is red. You can see the first level in the trailer if you need more of a detailed explanation:\n\nClick on a block.\n\n6 colored wheel comes up that you can choose from (even though only two work)\n\nChoosing a color from the wheel combines the two colors into whichever one I said it would above this.\n\nRepeat until they're all the color you want.\n\n\nSounds simple in principle, but I did not find it to be. The difficulty spiked pretty fast. As another con, there is no settings button I could find. It's fullscreen only with the ability to silence the music or not and the ability to view the credits (do people do that?).\n\nHonestly, this game seems pretty damn great and the only real reason it could be such a challenge is because the color combinations are not what I learned. I learned red, blue and yellow were the main three colors of the world, with blue and yellow making green instead of red and green making yellow. It's all pretty backwards to me and goes against what I was taught since I was a kid.\n\nI'll update this if I find anything horribly wrong in the later part of the game but since all the reviews are hidden currently I figured I'd throw this one out there with such little playtime. This game seems to be worth $3, no doubt. However, as previously stated, I think this is a really challenging puzzle game and will definitely not be for everyone. Get this if you think your a puzzle god or if you want a challenge.\n","February 27","true","1.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

So at first glance it look simple and childlike, but it is only at first look.)\nAlready at the first meeting you have to stretch out your brain pretty well, no matter how old you are, especially if you liked to mooch your deawing classes.)\nYes, it look little bit toxic, but I hope developers will fix this soon.)\nLet's get your brains to work!=)","February 27","true","0.9"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","19","26","2","0"
