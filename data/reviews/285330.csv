If you remember anything about the first game, then you'll know everything about this version. Right off the bat, the only big difference is larger parks to put your fiendish death coasters into. Other than that, there are minor difference here and there such as now your patrons will take photos of cool stuff like coasters. They can now seek out a first aide station if they feel very sick and if they run out of cash, there's always an automatic teller machine! You'll also find a coaster designer out of game. Other than that, the difficulty seems to have gotten ramped up from the previous game. There are no easy victories here, but its not about the victory, since all 58 scenarios are unlocked from the start. Because this is Triple Thrill Pack, its not just RCT2, but its got all three expansion packs in one dirt cheap price.\n\nFor anyone that doesn't know, Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 and 2 are theme park management games that let you build roller coasters and plop down attractions in an isometric view. What really makes RCT stand out more than any other management game is the fact that you indeed design your own roller coasters! Its fun and easy, first select the type of attraction, then put down a platform and you can make it as long or short as you want. Then in most cases make a lift hill, then some turns, drops, ups and downs, spirals, loops, a helix, a cobra roll and so on. Every type of coaster has different trains, tracks, and specifics.\n\nAfter you're done with your coaster, make an entrance and an exit. Don't forget a line cue to your entrance. This is for everyone waiting in line. A long line cue means boredom sets in and you might need to hire a mascot to entertain them as they wait. Having beautiful decorations also helps keep people entertained. There are many different themes to enable. Even more with the three expansion packs! Perhaps too many, but having so much lets you create something you want.\n\nRides get broken down into three ratings. Excitement, intensity and nausea. To boost excitement, add more decorations, set it next to another ride if not through another ride. Every visitor has their own preference. some can tolerate high nausea, others want low intensity and so on. The tighter the turns, the higher the nausea rating. When someone comes out of your ride they can be sick. So from there have benches waiting for them to rest and regain their composure otherwise they'll heave on the ground and then you'll need handymen tot clean it up.\n\nYou can hire an array of staff, handymen, mechanics, entertainers and security. Then assign them each to have a patrol. Its a nice system to cover a lot of ground. Handymen and other staff have check boxes to determine what you want them to do, stuff like water gardens, clear out trash and mow lawns. Its all your choice.\n\nIf you don't want to build coasters, there are pre-built designs that you can plop down, but you can reap the benefits by making your own custom coaster. You can make it dip down into the ground for a tunnel, hang over water and contour it to the hills and valleys of your land to save money.\n\nThere's even a new feature in RCT2 that will let you design your own coaster without needing to build it right there on the fly in a theme park. This is a money saving feature, because building one in your theme park still costs you money and you might run out. The only problem with using the design editor is that if you need to use the tool, you'll need to save your game, drop out of it, go back into the menu, select the design tool, open it up, make a coaster, save it, get out of the editor, jump back into your save game and then plop down your custom coaster as a pre-built. Some people just want to design coasters, they don't want all the frills of managing an entire park and the coaster designer lets  you do that. RCT2 cares about those people.\n\nI mentioned the 58 scenarios, each one puts you into a pre-existing area, such as a castle, an airfield, and yes even the moon itself. It definitely adds a lot of flair and character that the original game lacked without expansion packs. While these environments are big, detailed and beautiful on their own, I feel like its too much to just start out in. You've got dozens of paths going everywhere when all you need to start is a quarter of a gigantic park. So then to keep from having your visitors walk all over the place, you'll put down barricades over your paths that don't let them cross.\n\nEach one of these scenarios has different conditions to win. Everything from get X amount of dollars in Y amount of years to having X amount of patrons in your park by year Y. There's a lot of variety and between the conditions and the environments, it keeps the game interesting and fresh from park to park. It gives me a reason to keep playing, because one year in the game is an hour in real life. These scenarios often last 3+ years, making for what could be a 175 hour game and that's assuming you stop playing a scenario when you complete it! You can keep going on and on to your heart's content.\n\nThe longer you go, the more your rides will break down. A new ride draws more people while an old ride, just feels stale and familiar. That's why you can save the ride, bulldoze it for some money and rebuild it again at full price! Its not just fictional parks in Africa or medieval times, there's a section of real life parks from the late 90s. Six real life parks including Magic Mountain and others owned by Six Flags.\n\nOutside of roller coasters, log rides and anything else with a track, there are lesser rides that you can just plop down and make an entrance and an exit to. You can customize the entrances with themes and customize the paths, ground height, water, plants and so on. It all costs a price of course, but you can make exactly what you want to. Speaking of that, if you want to turn your roller coasters into death traps go for it! Its one of the fun things about the game. Make a power launch roller coaster shoot people off the rails sending them to their demise! Don't expect anyone to ever ride the coaster ever again, even after you fix it! Cowards.\n\nYour guests will need to eat, drink and go to the bathroom, so don't forget to place vendors in strategic locations. They'll need places to sit and garbage cans too. There is a wide array of shops too, sunglasses, T-shirts, caps and balloons to sell. Place them where people are happiest and they'll spend for sure.\n\nYou'll get to manage the park's finances, but you won't get lost or overwhelmed. Its all pretty easy. You can quickly take out a cheap loan from the bank if you need money. You can spend money on advertising for the park, specific rides or other such things and they have a great impact on your visitors. To unlock new attractions, you'll need to put money into research. The more money per month, the quicker rides will be enabled in the scenario.\n\nWith everything said, RCT2 like its predecessor is a relaxing time sink that you can enjoy for decades like I did. I was still playing RCT2 on CD-ROM before it came to Steam! There's something here for management fans, coaster buffs and creation enthusiasts. While I feel like the vanilla version of RCT2 didn't have that many parks for the original price tag, the three included expansion packs make it a much better game.","March 6, 2015","true","41.2"," 144 of 149 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","144","149","6","0"

Oh man, this game. I got my first disk copy out of a box of Cheerios, and I played the absolute hell out of it. I easily poured about three thousand hours into that disk, and I loved every second of it. By the end of it I had well over 200 save files, some of which were actual serious parks and the rest simple sandbox parks where I had no objective and just ♥♥♥♥ed around with the patrons.\nThen, the unthinkable happened. A virus destroyed the family computer, and when we got a new one, I found that the disk refused to install on it.\nFast forward ten or so years later. I was browsing steam out of boredom when I stumbled across Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 again, bundled together with its two expansion packs for a humble price of $11 CAN. Childhood memories came rushing back in a blur and I nearly fell off my bed in sheer excitement. A week later I got my hands on a copy of the game (Thank you, Jordy!!) and I was soon on my way to a serious nostalgia trip.\n\nThe Pros!It is a legitimate challenge while still being fun! The game, yes, does get quite frustrating at times but there is never any disappointment in starting over. It just leaves you with a feeling of knowing you can do better in your next try. Plus there is nothing more satisfying than building a successful park and watching the money pour in.\nTruly a game for all ages. Considering how far I managed to get as a kid, and how I still love it as an adult years later shows how easy it is to grasp and master by younger audiences, while still being challenging and entertaining enough to hold the attention spans of older gamers. It is because RCT2 can be as easy or as difficult as you want it to be, solely with the help of;\nThe scenario editor. It is a separate game mode accessed through the main menu screen, and it offers up a near endless stream of custom parks long after you have beaten the rest of the ones included in the game. You can customize things such as the guests' preference to less or more intense rides, the rules on the park property itself (IE; ride height and land modifying restrictions), hell, even the climate of the area itself. There is so much there that can be tweaked to your liking, so you are left with a park that is catered to your own unique sense of challenge.\nBuilding Roller Coasters is awesome. There is a huge selection of ride types to work with, giving a lot of opportunity for creativity. Building the rides is strangely relaxing, too.\n\nHonourable Mentions:\n- Graphics and animations are awesome for a game from 2002\n- UI is simple and easy to navigate\n- Very minimal bugs and glitches\n\n\nThe Cons!Patron and Staff AI is simple, and not in a good way. It is quite stupid and can get frustrating at times. (Guests don't know how to use First Aid centres, or how to find the bathrooms/food stalls. They're like tiny, ant sized cattle, all aimlessly wandering around in circles.)\nGame has some compatibility issues. Particularly with newer computers (Win 7 and on), but all of those problems can be easily fixed with these guides.\nGame can get a little boring sometimes. especially during periods where you have no money to work with, and end up waiting for funds from rides and shops to stock you up again. It's a problem that veterans of the Sim City games will be familiar with. If you have a consistent stream of money coming in from those sources however, it won't be much of a problem.\n\nThe Final Verdict!Despite its flaws, Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 is a solid theme park simulator that has aged well. And for under fifteen dollars, you really can't go wrong. I recommend it wholeheartedly with a 9/10.","February 26, 2015","true","44.2"," 55 of 57 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","55","57","7","0"

When I saw that it was, my wallet got sad, because in just a few moments my money was gone.\n\nThis is in my opinion THE best RollerCoaster video game in existance, and well for that matter in my opinion the best Tycoon game of any developer. Everything is made to a precise definity and managing your park is easy, but at the same time heavily difficult! The more you know about how to play this game, the more fun it becomes.\n\nThere is no game out there like this one, and at first glance it might seem like a learning curve but it's actually quite straight forward, and I don't think anybody who could understand this game could play it and not enjoy it.\n\nManage parks, build sweet rides, customize e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g to your desire and get creative with coaster designs! There is literally not much that this game does NOT have to offer in regards to a coaster park simulator, and even more is here with the thrills from the Triple Thrill Pack.\n\nEndless entertainment, thousands of ways to keep you entertained, and it's publicity proves that this game has a great reputation. I give it a 10/10, and it's not easy to get that from me.

New GabeN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrickBlocks1/","159 products in account","Part of my childhood is now in my Steam Library.\n\nRoller Coaster Tycoon 2 is a fun addictive sim game, where the goal is to create a park and achieve a specific objective. Whether it be get so many people to your park, have a high park rating by year 3, etc. You can achieve this by creating rides, adding decorations, hiring staff members to keep the park in shape, adding food stands, the list goes on and on.\n\nWhile Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 was the original, this game feels like it takes it one step further. Cleaning up the UI, adding new decorations, fixing some AI and adding completely new rides. Now you may be thinking, "why by this version when I can buy RCT3 which is in 3d?" Thats where I think they went wrong by making the game 3d. It doesnt have the charm that this game has.\n\nI did have a problem where the game was crashing on me whenever I saved or loaded game. I managed to fix it by running the game in Windows XP (SP2) and admin. I'm running Win. 8.1, so this fix might not work for all of you.\n\nAll in all I recommend this game to people who like casual games, sim games, fun games (not really a category but the game is fun), heck even a hardcore gamer might like this (Im a hardcore gamer so hopefully you share this opinion) For a great value of $10 you can have hours, upon hours of entertainment, which includes everything RCT2 has to offer! I had the basic version of the game when I was a kid, so to see the new stuff they added that I never got to experience makes the game even more worth it.\n\nOverall I give this game a 8.5/10. Get this game, its completely worth it!","June 25, 2014","true","4.0"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 were my go to games before I joined Steam.\n\nMaybe it’s the simplicity of the title, or the enjoyment of charging people to go to the bathroom. Whatever the case might be, if you have an older system you are likely to enjoy this title.\n\nIf you happened to give into Microsoft marketing and upgraded to 8/8.1/10, you should seek OpenRCT2 in addition. RC2 is a game built in assembly (really, just look at the system requirements) it will almost be required for you to use OpenRCT2 to play this title.\n\nThe game plays out of the box on Windows 7, but beware that it uses a lower color depth, and alt+tab users should not be alarmed by the change in color modes.\n\nResolutions are also minimally supported, the max usable for 16:9 users being 720. Obviously, you aren’t playing this game for the “leading” graphics.\n\nAll the other later games in the series personally don’t seem to add anything meaningful, so I’d advise you to just grab RC2 and leave it at that.","March 13","true","32.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Best one out there for sure, since, what is there not to love?\n\nCreate the park of your dreams, with loads of rides, theming and so forth. Create extreme rollercoasters and watch your guest ride it (and crash it, I mean, hey, thats fun time to time ;) ), create flat rides like a Merry-Go-Round (and eventually getting Controle Failure, freaking you out should it be the first time of you experiencing it as the music speeds up), create thrill rides (potentially crashing this as well), water rides, stalls and so forth in your park.\n\nBesides building (and just screwing around), you also need to take care of your guests needs; example of this is put enough toilets in your park, drink stalls, food stalls and so forth, while also hiring staff whom clean your paths, maintain the rides, entertain guests, and even get rid of vandals.\n\nThough, admittedly, the guest AI can be dumb at times. Make a double path, and your guests can get lost at times. Your path is close to the exit, but it doesnt connect to it, so they have to walk around? They'll get lost. Pathfinding of them isn't too well at times. But, let this not break the game for you!\n\nBesides the issue described above, there is much to do in this game. But BE WARNED. This game will suck up a lot of time, when you have fun. Time can fly, as you make your own parks, and do things you want.\n\nAfter all these years, it still holds up.

If not the garbage will be thrown on the ground and give your park a bad reputation.\n\nAttractions don't make the park, no. You'll also need to make it pretty. Plant some flowers in your park. Add decor and theme's. There are various theme's to choose from. For instance, candyland or the jungle theme.\n\nBut it's not all as easy at it seems.\nYou'll also need to hire staff.\nStaff such as mechanics to inspect attractions and fix them if they break down. But also security guards, to prevent your guests from breaking stuff in your park.\n\nThis all costs money, money and money. You'll need guests to keep your park operational.\nYou can do whatever you want, if you want to play with money, you play with money. If you don't want to play with money, you play with unlimited funds. Does that make it easy? Still, not. Your guests still rate your park on various aspects such as the beauty, safety, waiting queue's, the overall beauty of the park and lots more.\n\nThis game is old, but certainly not bad.\nI favor this game over RollerCoaster Tycoon 3.","August 22, 2015","true","19.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PirateSanta/recommended/285330/","PirateSanta","Pirate Santa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PirateSanta/","129 products in account","When I was looking for a flash drive in my desk, I happened upon a disk that I had nearly forgotten about. My old copy of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 had survived through 3 different operating systems, 4 computers and much more, but I hadn’t used it since 2010. I popped it in my computer and started to install, but to my dismay the years had caught up with it and the installation had failed.\n\nIt then occurred to me that Steam may have a copy, and indeed it does. I haven’t played this game for so long, but starting it up to hear the old theme brought me back immediately. While I do assume that most buyers here on steam are gamers looking for nostalgia, I would like to talk about the game for possible newcomers as well.\n\nWhile RCT 2 may not be too big of a change compared to the original, there is no doubt that there is much more for you to do. More rides, stalls, park options and more are available, along with plenty of rides inspired by Six Flag rides. Customization within the game can feel endless, building everything from log plumes to corkscrew rollercoasters, but you can always just take pre-built rides if you’re in a rush as well. While customization is the main idea of RCT 2, management is also important. If you want to build more, you’re going to need more mechanics to keep your rides running. If your rides are intense people will puke and that will mean more handymen. You have to juggle expenses with customer happiness to make sure you don’t go out of business, and make sure you hit the park’s goal in time too.\n\nThis is not to say that the game is perfect—there are plenty of little glitches that are infuriating at times. There are two types of parks: those you pay to enter, and those that are free but are charged for individual rides. When playing a pay-to-enter, you set your admission. When your park has a lot of great rides you can charge more, but that doesn’t mean your guests know that. I’ve built huge, sprawling parks and charged admission at $80+, still winning “best value park” awards, but people only carrying $20, $40 or $68 may still come up to my gates, only to be denied entry. This means that all these potential guests (and revenue) just doesn’t come into my park.\n\nAlong with this are little other bugs. Wide-screen is all but impossible without modification to the game, and guests can complain about “over-crowding” when there are too many people on one path, even get stuck on paths if there are too many people on it, creating an endless loop. The simple solution would be to have a double-wide path, but the AI continues on, ignoring the extra space and complaining the entire time. In the end this won’t do too much to hurt your score, but the fact remains that if you look at your guests aggregate thoughts, be prepared for things you can’t fix.\n\nBugs aside, I still see RCT2 is a masterpiece. As I work now to perfect every park, it seems hard to believe this game is almost 12 years old. You can see it in its graphics and mechanics, but it still has plenty of charm. If you love Tycoon games, I definitely recommend this one. Between customization, management and plenty of other options, this game still has plenty of charm, for newcomers and veterans alike.","July 10, 2014","true","19.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","9"

Keep in mind I said almost, but that is beside the point. This game lets you create a theme park and watch as hundreds upon THOUSANDS of tiny little guests enter your park, buy your merchandise, and ride your crazy rides. This game is much more linear compared to its sequel (which is not a good game at all) which makes it a much better choice for amusement park management. The amount of insane roller coasters that you can create with all the endless amounts of combinatios of scenery of foliage to surround those roller coasters and rides and transform them into attractions. The only thing that is bad about the game is the guests AI. If they see something in the distance, like a massive to scale model of "Millenium Force" from Cedar Point, Ohio, and there is a square of path that doesn't connect to the path "Millenium Force" is on, they will just run around in circles and annoy you.

The ATM and boatload of scenery is especially a nice touch\n-I've read it's considered the "best" Rollercoaster Tycoon, meaning there's likely a healthy supply of fanmade content for the game\n\nCONS:\n-20 second long crowd noise loop still irritating as hell. "ROLLER COASTER" "BUT WHYYYYY" "EHAHAHAHAHA. BWAAAHH. OOOHOOOOHOOOHOOO." It was cute for nostalgic reasons for about 2 minutes before I wished they made a longer, more varied sound for crowded areas\n-It's pretty much the same as the first game except with more stuff, meaning they didn't seem to add that much\n-The scenarios suck my toes. Almost all of the ones I've tried so far make you wonder if they even put any thought into making them. Half the time the existing rides don't even have names. The scenery looks good (or, at least, it probably did back in the day, so I'm trying to judge it on that) but most of the time it just gets in the way. Sometimes guests get lost on the pre-existing paths. You rarely allowed to charge per ride so you're stuck entirely relying on vendors and admission fees. Give me Forest Frontiers or Dynamite Dunes over Alcatraz and Rio anyday\n-Maybe I haven't figured it out yet but it seems like there's no way to access the Steam community inside the game, which makes playing while you're chatting with someone a pain in the neck.\n\nOverall, despite my criticisms, it's cheap and fun and it's in no way worse than the original (aside from the scenarios). If you're asking yourself if you want to pick it up, you probably do.","November 30, 2014","true","23.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Despite coming out in 2002 this game still has a large (And well-deserved) fanbase. I've owned this game since the early 2000's and have always loved it.\n\nANYBODY NEW TO THE GAME OR SERIES WHO IS LOOKING AT THESE REVIEWS BEFORE DECIDING ON PURCHASING THE GAME, PLEASE READ THIS:\n\n1. RCT2 is definitely unfairly rated on metacritic, it seems the game was judged based on scenario play and the expansion packs. The expansions offer new scenarios, rides, shops and scenery though they are pretty lackluster. They are a nice bonus but the game should not be judged based on them. IMO RCT2 deserves 90-95/100, with RCT1 following closely behind.\nIf you are looking for really fun scenarios, you would be better off purchasing the original RCT (which is also on steam). RCT1 is dated and has less features than it's sequel but the scenario gameplay is more interesting. RCT2 does offer custom scenarios though, which can make up for this (There is an in-game scenario creator and there are heaps of customs ones on the internet). RCT2's greatest feature is it's sandbox play, many people like this game for the ability to build whatever they want.\n\n2.  There is tons of custom content for this game available, a quick google serach will bring up countless sites with plently of scenarios, rides, scenery and parks available to download\n\n3. The major player fanbases are at http://reddit.com/r/rct, http://nedesigns.com (The guys at NE make some of the most amazing parks I have ever seen, it's basically an online art gallery) and http://themeparkreview.com\n\n4.

Ok maybe you can hate it, but if you do, then you don't know what true fun is.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nThe building in this game is fluid. The path system is very easy to use, and even has options for elevation. The rollercoaster building is a little sketchy at first but when you get used to it, then you can make some crazy stuff. Not only that the terrain tool is fantastic but with the only downside is no mountain tool like in RCT 1.\n\nMusic: 10/10\nIt's so catchy and will keep you reeled in. The music is so memorable that it will keep you humming it from days on end.\n\nPresentation: 9/10\nThe game looks great. You can't really go wrong with 2d sprites. Everything from the peeps to the rides are so detailed that it makes your eyes bleed. But in all honesty the game looks fantastic with an overall point of "you don't need fancy 3d graphics to make a game look good".\n\nOverall score: 10/10\nThere is seriously no reason as to why you shouldn't pick this game up. Weither it screams nostalgia from your childhood or even looks remotely awesome, then I would very HIGHLY reccomend this game. It will provide you with hours on end fun and amazing gameplay that you wouldn't wanna stop playing it.","August 25, 2014","true","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are multiple parks that you can build and expand upon, each with their own goal. Once you reach the goal you enter your name, get a checkmark near the park in the selection menu, and can continue building that park if you wish. There are a lot of rides and decorations to be built and you can have thousands of people in your park at once. Each person has their own name, money, and thoughts. Some downsides are that the AI is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you build the park too big people get lost and start complaining, which brings your park rating down. Aside from the gameplay, RCT2 has pretty good music and good graphics for the time it was made. In the end I would say this is worth the buy. $10 is a good price for a game that you'll most likely get lots of fun out of.","December 31, 2014","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And that includes some MMOs that have a year+ logged in time.  I nearly cried with happiness when I finally realized this was on Steam.  I bought RCT2 and the two expansions when they each launched, and the triple thrill pack - I used the TTP disc so much It was *taped together*.  I spent hours getting it to line up when it started to crack.  Thats a sign of how amazing this game is.\nIf you find building and sim games fun, you can't go wrong here.  The customization and themes are awesome and can give hours of fun.\n\nYou can also download all of the maps from the original RCT for this, a large chunk of which were released officially, and hundreds if not thousands of other maps custom designed.  There are some amazing parks out there.\n\nFun tip, there is a .dll mod out there to run it in windowed mode.

Those of you that own rct3 and are considering purchasing rct2, this review should help.  So I will list pros and cons about rct2 compared to rct3\n\nPRO'S:\n- The peeps (AI) form sizeable queue lines for your rides, making you feel like your ride is popular\n- Lag does not exist in this game\n- Created by Chris Sawyer\n- Altogether, it feels like a better game (in my opinion, of course)\n- Go Karts are overpowered :)\n- Pre-built Six Flags amusement parks\n- Awesome Pre-built rides (If you're lazy...)\n- Unique scenarios (i.e. Great Wall of China scenario where you have unlimited money but have to keep park rating above 700 at all times.)\n\nCON'S:\n- No 3D view like in RCT3\n- You can't ride your rollercoasters\n- Park staff are equally as useless as they are in RCT3\n- No nighttime phase (some would consider that a pro)\n\nCONCLUSION: Overall, there is not a significant difference between RCT 2 and 3.  Atari didn't change much for RCT3 other than 3D view.  If you thoroughly enjoyed RCT3, you will thoroughly enjoy this game.\n\n\n","August 22, 2014","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has all of the features of the first game with additions and it is not streamlined like the 3rd game. You can build roller coasters, or simply buy preconstructed templates for roller coasters. Both are fun. The only problem is customer and worker AI. They will walk past food and drink stands even though they say they're starving/thirsty, get lost even though they have a map, and they treat transportation as rides, not as transportation in the park, meaning that if you have a train ride leading to an isolated part of the map, they will get stuck there and get angry and not use the train ride to go back. Handymen and Mechanics are absolute necessities, but their pathfinding is terrible. Even if you use guided pathways for mechanics, they will disobey you and inspect other rides.

It's good, as others will be quick to tell you.\n\nHere are some things that are worth knowing:\n* Unlike my old copy of the game, saving actually DOES work in the steam version!\n* It is indeed an old game, and the interface may be a bit confusing if you're used to more modern fare.\n* The AI is incredibly dumb, which can be frustrating. Once you get used to it, it just adds a bit of challenge.\n* The parks can sometimes get a bit cluttered and visually confusing.\n* The game isn't gorgeous, but its pixel graphics do the job. The rollercoasters look great. Don't buy it for the graphics.\n* The game has some weird quirks, like odd sell values and not being able to build while paused.\n* The gameplay is still very good; designing parks is fun, designing rollercoasters is fun, there's plenty of stuff to do.","June 6, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not very different from the first game, but there are many small improvements here and there.  Fans have also recreated the first game's scenarios with the in-game scenario editor, so you won't be missing out.  A legendarily fun game, though having no unlockables this time is disappointing.\n\nThis may not run well, or at all, if you have Windows 7 or 8.  Find the demo and see if it works on your computer.  It did on my version of Windows 7, so there is hope yet.","June 9, 2015","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And that includes some MMOs that have a year+ logged in time.  I nearly cried with happiness when I finally realized this was on Steam.  I bought RCT2 and the two expansions when they each launched, and the triple thrill pack - I used the TTP disc so much It was *taped together*.  I spent hours getting it to line up when it started to crack.  Thats a sign of how amazing this game is.\nIf you find building and sim games fun, you can't go wrong here.  The customization and themes are awesome and can give hours of fun.\n\nYou can also download all of the maps from the original RCT for this, a large chunk of which were released officially, and hundreds if not thousands of other maps custom designed.  There are some amazing parks out there.\n\nFun tip, there is a .dll mod out there to run it in windowed mode.  For some reason its not default in RCT2, but it was an option in the original..","August 24, 2015","true","66.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All that time spent creating parks and in particular, tons of wild roller coasters. This game is still great even after all these years. I've played this for much longer than my Steam time shows. I've played 1, 2, and 3, and I have to say this and 1 are close in which is my favorite. The gameplay is simple yet fun, I'd recommend picking it up if you can, it's a great way to spend a couple of hours at a time trying to beat yet another scenario.\n\nThere's lots of variety in parks and ride in here. Although honestly the two expansion packs didn't add much original stuff, just rethemed rides and lame scenarios that somewhat force you into a box regarding park design. You can also create your own scenarios or download ones that others have made. I'd also recommend adding the UCES expansion, a community expansion that added tons of scenery, a bunch of scenarios, and a few new rides. It might be a little hard to find now as the official site no longer exists, but there are alternate downloads around for it. Just a word of warning, the first time you run a UCES scenario, it will usually crash the game. This is normal as the first time you run the scenario any custom content used in it must be installed. The next time you select the scenario it should run just fine.\nIf you want to make your own scenarios, you can also pick up some custom rides and themeing that are out there. Amazing Earl and Buggy are two people to look up. There is also a pack that contains almost all the scenarios from RCT1 and its expansions which have been remade for RCT2. Just google "RCT1 scenarios for RCT2" and that should get you something.\n\nPros:\n+Great variety of rides available, including lots of roller coasters\n+Various scenario objectives and scenarios for lots of variety\n+Low system requirements will run on pretty much any computer\n+Lots of extra community content (if you know where to find it)\n+Fun way to spend a few hours\n\nCons (These are mostly nitpicky):\n-Scenario editor is fairly limited, making a park that has pre-built rides is a bit round-a-bout and not the best way\n-Expansions don't offer much in terms of new rides, just a bunch of rethemeing\n-Scenario selection screen can get cluttered/hard to navigate if you have lots of scenarios installed\n-No career/progression. All scenarios are available from the start unlike 1 & 3.\n\nA final note, some people may have issues running this on newer machines. I have a 64 bit Windows system, and I have no problem running it at all. A demo can probably be found online, install that and run it before buying to check that it will work on your system.\n\nOverall 10/10, a classic that still stands the test of time.","January 4, 2015","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

We have come a long way with RollerCoaster Tycoon. It's more improved then the first one, but coming off of the 3rd one I feel lost in this one. The graphics are sooooo bad compared to the 3rd one, it's really hard to get into it again after the 3rd. Ah well, it's still a great game and the owners of this will put tons of hours into like I have. I just had to buy it on steam because my disc ran away and I wanted to revisit the parks. (Tip - Play the first 2 games before you go and get the 3rd or else you will never want to come back to the old ones.)","January 19, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There may be a bit of a learning curve when trying to create the perfect level of intensity in a coaster without scaring the pants off everyone before they ride but it's easy once you get the hang of it.\n\nYou don't HAVE to build your own coasters, there are hundreds and hundreds of designs you can drag and drop if you're too lazy or not enthused enough...\n\nYou wanna build a theme park without coasters you say? With only coasters? With no rides at all but only food stands and side-show attractions, such as hall of mirrors and circuses...? You can do any of that and more.\n\nRCT2 is the best RCT game out right now, ignore RCT3.\n\nBUY THIS NOW.","February 21, 2015","true","31.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I HIGHLY DO NOT suggest downloading this game from them, but to try a different online company.This absolutely ridiculous, I was told this was a good company to buy a game off and then this happens and I was refused a refund due to this.\nAfter playing this game for about an hour it started freezing and skipping. I thought it would stop so I continued to play but it has now turned into consistent freezing for long periods of time, game crashing, and I've had to fully reboot my computer three times due to this. It's not even letting me exit the game I had to reboot my computer to stop it after it was frozen for over an hour and would not let me quit the game. I then sent a request for a refund  and to inform Steam of the problem and was told due to the 7 hour play time I was refused. However this game was frozen for over an hour at a time, multiple times. I never got to experience this game due to the freezing.

The entire in-game menu system has been changed around for the worst and I have no idea why as it was great the way they had it before. All the scenarios are playable from the beginning offering no rewards or incentive to work towards something. The scenarios/parks aren't great - they're all based around themes which would be fine for a few scenarios, but not all of them. This basically doesn't give you the creative freedom to build a park from scratch and dictate how you want it to look like. If I want my park to look like Sherwood Forest or a Medieval Castle, I'll make it look as such - don't force it upon me. The game in general just feels like an expansion pack compared to the first and I couldn't get into it (hence the low play time).\n\nTo reiterate, I wrote this review coming from the viewpoint of someone who had invested tons of hours into the original. I noticed the differences and didn't like them. If you haven't played the first then you may enjoy this version.","July 1, 2014","false","0.5"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","2"

However, there does not appear to have been any updates/fixes before releasing this on steam.  I'm not expecting new graphics or content, but i'm expecting it to be playable without having to download 3rd party hacks.  In my experience, it has been a very buggy game since purchasing on steam, others may have better luck, take note of the fact that windows 7/8 are both not officially supported in the system requirements.\n\nGraphics issues abound, don't even think about ever using alt-tab while playing this game, it may still be playable, but frequently the colors will change to what seems like an 8-bit pallette? it is not a good look.  The game frequently takes several tries to start, the music almost always works, but the graphics frequently do not (black screen w/music).  There are numerous workarounds and third party hacks/launchers that help to minimize these issues, but it is a lot of extra work, and none of them quite 'fix' it.  Make sure to save often, the game has quit on me numerous times, frequently the cursor will stop working altogether, or you'll find yourself clicking on one area, but the game recognizing it as you clicking on another area, very frustrating.\n\nFor the times when you do get to play the game, however, it's glorious.","July 3, 2014","false","0.1"," 7 of 24 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","7","24","0","4"

It's not something you think would be fun to play, but it is. You get to completely customize how your rides are built, you decide where people can walk, whether your guests live or drown in the nearest pool of water, you can even create a park designed to make your guests suffer an untimely demise. All that with the ability to create your own parks with their own objectives, there's plenty to keep you entertained.\n\nThe game isn't perfect though, removing unneeded footpaths can be slightly annoying due to the isometric camera angle and somewhat picky programming, but it's nothing that makes the game even slightly less fun.\n\nIf you haven't experienced this game yet, pick it up, you'll surely enjoy yourself.

Bear in mind, this game is more than a decade old now and running on an engine even older than that. I've been playing RCT since 1999, and I've been playing RCT2 since its come out. I literally have logged thousands of hours on this title, and its one of the few games I binge play.\n\nRCT2 brings a huge collection of roller coasters, rides, shops, and scenery items to the table. If this isn't enough, RCT2 will also support custom flat rides and scenery items; although the online community has flatlined over the years (there are still some good sites to pull content from). You can even skip the whole career/story mode and jump right into a sandbox!\n\nOne of the reasons this game has survived for so long is because its extremely easy to play and it masterfully blends several things you like in a game... sandbox, simulation, and design. RCT2 is about as user friendly as it gets, with the learning curve set to child. You are literally limited by your own creativity. This is by far one of the most fluid, relaxing, and satisfying game to play.\n\nIf only Atari would collaborate with Colossal Order, then we could have a game with the impeccable game design of RCT2 and the realism of Cities: Skylines. THAT would be the perfect way to revisit this dusty, old franchise and that would be a MONSTER hit since this whole genre of gaming pretty much ends at RCT2.","April 12, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this game around a week ago and i've already sunk nearly a days worth of gameplay into it.  Lets go into some pros and cons of this game\n\nPros:\n+The game is very immersive and i find myself locked into it for hours on end.  I'll get a text and respond 45 minutes later because I lost myself in the game\n+The custom building in this game is another strong reason to buy this game.  Custom coasters, water rides, go-karts, ect.  And if you dont want to build your own, you have hundreds of other preset options!\n+Custom Scenarios allow you to make up your own ♥♥♥♥\n\nCons:\n-The AI sucks ballsack.  The handymen will walk up and down a paths but only occasionally go down the path with the vomit or trash on it.  The mechanics are also kind of clueless\n-The Scenario Editor takes FOREVER to set up.\n\nI can't think of any more cons so there is my review.

It is far superior.\n\nI've been playing this game since i was about 5, [no not on steam lol] and I finally decided to grab it this summer sale after losing my disc a while ago.\n\nI can't reccomend this game enough. It brings a happiness that nothing else can ever compete with. The premise of RCT2 is you pretty much just build god damn awesome parks, occasionally adgering to the objective. RRCT2 can be played in two ways. Follow what you're supposed to do regading the objective. Pretty simple play, but still incredibly fun. Other is to build your own absolutely insane park with the scenario editor and treat it as a sandbox, doing whatever you please treating you 'peeps' as vessels of your torture. [I preffer the latter]\n\nThere really is very few things wrong with the game. I'll name a few.\n- AI can be a bit troublesome, but when you've got a couple thousand of them, It's bound to happen. The mechanics/cleaners are really the only ones with issues tbh. Can be rectified without too much effort.\n- Isometric can make the game a bit difficult to see a few things, but hey, just god damn rotate the camera.\n- Terrain is a bit 'ech', but defiantly better than RCT3. An issue is that you can't use the 'mountain/hill' tool outside of the scenario editor. Kinda takes a long time to make a mountain\nThose aren't major my any scale. This game is liteally god tier. Seriously buy it if you're in any way creative. I've fallen in love with it.\n\nKeep in mind that if you're buying this to complete scenarios, imo RCT1 scenarios are much better. RCT2 Scenarios seem somewhat sole-less. Sandbox is way better in RCT2 tho/.","June 27, 2015","true","65.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though the base game has countless hours of potential, the expansions bring even more to the already expansive base.\n\nThe best thing about this game is that even after almost two decades have passed, it still holds up as one of the best tycoon games, even surpassing most of the contemporary ones (especially the modern iterations of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series). You can even find ways to kill your guests if you're some kind of sadist or psycopath. In most circles, it's become one of the "staples" of PC gaming, standing up there with X-COM, Doom, and Half-Life.\n\nIt's cheap, it ran great on old computers (and is guaranteed to run silky smooth on any machine from the last 5 years, even laptops), it's endless fun, frankly there's no reason not to get this game.","June 19, 2015","true","25.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Creating buildings of any size and height was a much needed improvement and necessity although it took many hours to create a massive tower. RCT 2 had a fun circus feel to the game when interacting with the peeps and building roller coasters, Creating rides while enhancing the scenery to theme the ride was as much fun as building roller coasters was. Managing the park was basic and at times could get in the way of building an exciting park.\n\nEnhancing the mouse control were a much needed improvement and helped when building a larger park with many roller coasters. Adding the ability to create and add your own objects to the game brought the game play to a new level where gamers could actually get more out of the game by allowing more content options making it a better game overall.\n\nThe peep interaction was fun, and created a more fun game experience. Having spent hundreds of hours in game play, this is one of those games that could never get boring unlike other simulation builders. The soundtrack to the game was fantastic and added to the pleasure of playing, often at times, wanting to get you to listen to the sound effects more than the music. The humorous feel to the game put the player in a happy mood ready to craft a park just to hear the peeps happy laughter. The interaction was captivating and provided a fun experience for each and every hour you put into the game. 5 stars out of 5 stars. A very time consuming game because of the fact it was just plain fun to play.","November 5, 2015","true","209.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You might have a bit of a slow start with it (your attack and speed will be halved for five whole turns!), but soon, you'll be building parks that rival the best real world parks. Manage your finances wisely, though. If you go crazy, you might find yourself in debt. There's a great amount of content for this game, and though it probably won't last forever, it's definitely capable of taking a few hundred hours out of your slowly decreasing lifetime. At least those few hundred hours will be spent having fun.\n\nPlease, try not to kill people. You can do that in this game, but please don't. It will be detrimental for your park's reputation, and also, it's killing people. I have yet to understand why so many players decide to kill their guests.\n\nWindows 10 users, you may experience a problem with the game. It tends to crash very frequently on Windows 10, but there's a way around it. If you go into the steam files for RCT2 and troubleshoot the program's compatabiliy, you should be able to set it to run in Windows 7 mode.

Its all here for you to build an amusment park to top the charts and records of thrill and ecitement. Forgetting about the cheesy reviewing, the game in all seriousness is wonderful. Anything you want to build or design is probrably in the game. The park building is limited to what you can think of.

It's not the GAME'S fault whatsoever, it's the problem with newer OS's.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, this game is very fun. There's a lot to do and you have to think strategically and listen to what the people at your park want, don't want, or what they like and don't like or what they complain about. This makes it very challenging to make decisions on what you should add or take away, which also plays into the complicated financial part of the game. Also, with tools like "OpenRct2" this game has a bit of a "cult following" community (or amongst people like me who have seen people play the game on youtube with some humor), which does it a favor because people care about this game still by adding mods and multiplayer and new ideas to it. It's quite a magnificient feat that when a game that's almost two decades old and totally obsolete can have a following still and a community, and it's because it's a good game as well.","April 3","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

True testament of the good old days. I am impressed I was able to complete some of these scenarios when I was a kid, some of them are damn near impossible!\n\nPROS -\n- It's Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, pretty much a culture icon by now\n- You can make roller coasters\n- Very micro manage friendly.\n- Did I mention you can make roller coasters?\n\nCONS -\n- Dated graphics,\n- No widescreen support (This game pretty much predates wide screens lol)\n- [Insert crappy con because you now expect much more of modern games which doesn't apply to this masterpiece]\n- Misogynistic game. No female sprites.

For one, the scenarios are bland and not very memorable. Two, I personally feel the game was a little rushed since almost everything here was reused from the first instalment minus the new rides. Those are my main problems, the game is far from bad but those problems are enough to make it my least favourite of the three main RCT games.

Making your own park is really really fun, and the levels, or "Scenarios" are challenging. There's even a scenario editor where you can make your own. Something everyone's done at least several times on this game is make a death park with crashing rollercoasters and Freefall rides that are too short. You can trap your guests in too by putting signs in front of the way they came in and mark "No entry". Personally, I like to let guests ride a monorail or chairlift somewhere and making the exit where they get off above some water so they drown. Sounds kinda messed up but it's so funny.\n\nCons\nNow for the bad stuff. Honestly, there's not much other than the graphics, which aren't really a turnoff for me or really anyone. The isometric view can be annoying sometimes when trying to be precise with scenery, but it's not so bad. But one thing that's really stupid is the AI. The AI is really bad sometimes. Even if they buy a park map, they sometimes just refuse to eat or use the bathroom, lowering the park rating. Now don't let this  turn you off, it really isn't very annoying. One thing worse than bad guest AI is bad employee AI. handymen, or janitors, are sooooo stupid. Sometimes when they won't clean anything up, I have to constantly carry one around and constantly place him where the garbage is so he can clean it up. The mechanics who fix the rides aren't as near as bad, since they can usually get to where the ride is. But every now and then they get stuck somewhere and you have to go place them next to the ride exit so they can fix it.\n\nIF YOU'RE BUYING IT, READ THIS PART\nThis game usually won't run on anything newer than Windows Vista, which sounds pretty bad. But if you get OpenRCT2, (Basically a patch that adds new features and good optimization, and maybe coolest of all, multiplayer.) it fixes this. I have an antivirus, so I'm sure it's safe. You can download the installer at https://openrct2.org. Anyway, hope you read this all, and I hope you have fun with the game.","March 12","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is far superior.\n\nI've been playing this game since i was about 5, [no not on steam lol] and I finally decided to grab it this summer sale after losing my disc a while ago.\n\nI can't reccomend this game enough. It brings a happiness that nothing else can ever compete with. The premise of RCT2 is you pretty much just build god damn awesome parks, occasionally adgering to the objective. RRCT2 can be played in two ways. Follow what you're supposed to do regading the objective. Pretty simple play, but still incredibly fun. Other is to build your own absolutely insane park with the scenario editor and treat it as a sandbox, doing whatever you please treating you 'peeps' as vessels of your torture. [I preffer the latter]\n\nThere really is very few things wrong with the game. I'll name a few.\n- AI can be a bit troublesome, but when you've got a couple thousand of them, It's bound to happen. The mechanics/cleaners are really the only ones with issues tbh. Can be rectified without too much effort.\n- Isometric can make the game a bit difficult to see a few things, but hey, just god damn rotate the camera.\n- Terrain is a bit 'ech', but defiantly better than RCT3. An issue is that you can't use the 'mountain/hill' tool outside of the scenario editor. Kinda takes a long time to make a mountain\nThose aren't major my any scale. This game is liteally god tier. Seriously buy it if you're in any way creative. I've fallen in love with it.\n\nKeep in mind that if you're buying this to complete scenarios, imo RCT1 scenarios are much better. RCT2 Scenarios seem somewhat sole-less. Sandbox is way better in RCT2 tho/.","June 27, 2015","true","65.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This 2002 game shows that a good design and an eye for quality goes a long way. Hastily made 3D graphics may break what could've been a good game (i.e. RCT3) and will not help if the underlying mechanic is not fun, nor will any amount of advertising, DLCs or graphical bells and whistles.\n\nI've been playing this game on and off since it came out.

This game not only provides players with the ability to create a vast range of coasters, flat and dark rides, but also allows your imagination to shine. A huge range of decoration and scenery items, allows you to create a park of your dreams. This game combines the ability to create wonderful turns and twists of roller coasters, whilst having to manage the park from a staff point of view.\n\nPricing of rides and merchandise, to taking out a loan to fund your new development area. This game has it all.\n\nIf you manage to complete the huge varied range of levels, all of which focus on different themes and objectives, you can create your own scenarios for others to play, or, design rides to import into your park.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone who has the most remote interest in theme parks!","April 22","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
