Not a huge amount of depth but seems easy to dip in and out of it. I'm not sure a lot has been added over the Gear VR version though. It does however seem a lot clearer and more defined.\n\nPlayed on an HTC Vive. Was a lot of fun for me. My wife also tried but it made her nausious so you have been warned. It may cause VR sickness.","May 4","true","0.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

Problem is the turning right left using the stick.\nThey have alot of options for turning tough. Turning by looking. Turning by snaping. Incremental turning.\nSnaping or incremental turning did not make me motion sick, but wasnt much fun either.\nIf you are relatively immune to motion sickness you may give it i try.\nFor me, this is no go.","May 4","false","0.2"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","22","39","0","0"

Flying around in a jetpack in VR..I mean, who wouldn't want to do this?\n\nThe game itself is pretty cool, even the freeflight mode has you searching for briefcases and solving little puzzles to get your blueprints..but after approximately 15 minutes, I suffered that pretty bad nausea feeling from playing this. I suffered a tiny bit playing Dreadhalls and noticed that any game where you're playing with a joypad and have to use the right control to move your direction, the nausea begins.\n\nI had this on the Samsung Gear VR and played it quite a bit and it didn't bother me as much as when I tried it on the Vive. I played it whilst sitting, thinking that this would help with any disorientation but the sickeness was there even after approx 1 hr.\n\nReally disappointed as I really want to love this..but I ended up getting a refund :(\n\nRecommended but if you are prone to sickness..you'll probably suffer. God help the people playing the Oculus with a joypad..urrggh.","May 7","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Second only to windlands for the Vive right now, in my opinion.\n\nWhile still rather shallow compared to non-vr titles, when compared to other Vive games out right now, it's one of the fullest game experiences I've played.\n\nThis IS, however, one of the worst games for motion sickness. I felt it after about an hour, and I have never felt motion sickness in any game on Vive. Just rotate slowly and it's far less of a problem. It's the ninja rotaton in enclosed spaces that actually starts to get me. I could play out in the open city with reasonable rotation all day long. I'm DETERMINED to get my "VR Legs" so I can play this game for even longer.\n\nThis does require an xbox controller. It's a seated game and the Vive controllers don't work, but that's not a con at all. I rather like it.","May 21","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can go anywhere and have complete freedom in Omega Agent. Sure, you can make yourself sick if you spin around too fast but I've found it very comfortable and have had no issues playing for a long session. The game itself is a bit limited in scope, but I can see the awesome potential here. If a full story and more cities were added this would be a really great VR game. Basically you can perform race challenges that require you to fly through rings quickly or shoot down objects, but my favorite part is just the free flight where you can explore the city and feel like you're actually flying. I hope they port this game to IRL.","May 5","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Has player movement which can be problems, but the positional movement didn't seem to impact motion sickness but the rotation does, feels like it needs an option to turn that rotation speed down. And add that to the time trial nature of everything means this can be an intense game for eye strain.\nHaving to use a controller sucks. I know it makes sense for the game, but the virtual hands in the world map to 2 joysticks and it seems like these conuld be emulated somehow with Vive controllers.\nThis is still a great game though. Nice art style, good progression structure, weapons feel cool, but it sure feels like they are stretching content. I blasted through more than half of it in this first session (30mins?). Lots of repetition in mission types, the narrative is that you are training and maybe it will get real in the later mission groups.","May 8","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love flying around and while i dont mind the controllers this would be fun with vive or oculus touch.

It runs smoothly and has a bunch of missions, new area unlocks, etc.\n\nHowever, I highly recommend to the developers that they incorporate the Vive's controllers in order to help reduce motion sickness (if that's possible.) Using the XBOX controller really turned my stomach after a while, especially when rotating. Some indoor areas such as tunnels made it feel like the rotation speed suddenly doubled.\n\nAs far as motion sickness goes, I was really beginning to think I wouldn't get it. Windlands doesn't bother me, and I thought if any game was going to get me sick it would be Windlands. But no. This game is on a whole different level in terms of motion. It's the first game I've had to stop playing after feeling nautious (after an hour).\n\nIt's such a well made game, I really don't want to return it. Hope to give it another go in a day or two and see how it goes, but anyone with a weak stomach should probably look elsewhere and avoid this game for their own sake.","May 22","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's one of the best VR games I've ever played. This is one of those very few games that just feels perfect. Everything is polished. Gameplay is fantastic.\n\nDon't bee fooled by the graphics, this game is all about gameplay and the simplistic graphics helps out with the fast paced movement.\n\nI recommend changing the settings for the rotation to "Right Stick Snap". After doing that I no longer had a problem with motion sickness! It may feel a bit awkward or ugly at first, but you'll get used to it.","June 6","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
