You control a person on a jet pack who collects pieces and assembles them into blocks to make weapons to destroy the other side, but to get the pieces, you need to fight aerial monsters and you have to wrestle them away from the enemy player.\n\nI really didn't find much enjoyable about this game, really. As an avid fan of puzzle games, this was really a let-down, because the aerial combat is so much more important. You're not really given any time at all to strategically plan your board to get awesome weapon combos... even if you knock out your enemy, he'll be back in seconds to hassle you again. The only thing that might be worth it is the multiplayer, just for the fun of beating the crap out of your friends.\n\nThe graphics are cel-shaded and look alright. The music and sound work but aren't memorable. I used keyboard controls, and they seemed to work just fine. The only thing this game is really missing is fun.\n\nIf you're a big fan of frantic fighting-type games, then maybe you'll get more out of this than I did. I was really hoping for more puzzle-based gameplay from the screenshots, and I was let down. I certainly wouldn't recommend it at full price. If this looks good to you, wait for a sale.","May 14, 2013","false","0.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Having said that, when I first signed on for working on the game, I initially wasn't all that attracted to the gameplay, since mashup brawlers were not my thing, but I did love the visuals a lot. It seemed like a good fit for Steam, so despite me not liking the gameplay, I took on the project. However, I was very quickly won over with the gameplay, and now I love the game. It has just the right balance of "omg, should I continue beating up the opponent right now, or should I go after more blocks and building more towers/weapons??". It's frenetic and addicting and especially so when playing against your friends. And I still really love the visuals.","December 15, 2013","true","60.8"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

The playful sound track and jelly like noises enticed me and had me from the word go. It's a very casual party sort of game. The game play is kind of like Tetris, you have different shapped blocks, that when you match them up, create "attacking blocks" that shoot at the opponents blocks.\n\nYou also have your character which flys around hitting other flying around enemies which turn into the blocks allowing you to expand your wall. After a few levels on the single player you unlock the multiplayer game which is where this game will excel. I for one will keep this game installed for the ure fact that it is so much fun to play with your partner or friends in the front room on the big tv.","February 23, 2015","true","5.6"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","0"

Not just "bad control scheme", I mean straight up "the mouse is treated as a joystick with absolute ♥♥♥♥ acceleration and you will find it impossible to move across the screen without constantly lifting and dragging".\n\nAlso unless you plan to have people over to play this it's kind of limited in fun quotient. AI is not amazing, and it seems a lot like this would benefit from ♥♥♥♥ing around with pals. But the multiplayer is local-only.\n\nGo buy Go Home Dinosaurs instead from the same company, it's just a much better GAME if you can deal with some clever tower defense puzzles instead of... uh... defending literal towers of blocks.","June 24, 2013","false","1.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Its smash brothers meets tetris. You are building squares (each colour having a function) the bigger the square the better, you can also beat up things that drop blocks, the other player and other stuff.\n\nYes it has a campaign which gates off content but to be honest this game is only any good in vs mode because who really cares about beating up an AI?

Lemur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nalgasdlemur/","949 products in account","Building "weapons" (read: turrets that attack your opponent's turrets) by matching blocks is somewhat satisfying, but the game doesn't really feel like it goes anywhere with it in the single player. Half the weapon types feel useless, and the combat for your own character feels button mashy, even if there are a few combos. I have a feeling it's the kind of thing that would work better against real people (and it does have local multiplayer I haven't tried), but whether it would turn out to have more depth than I've seen or devolve into punching each other in the face while throwing blocks around randomly, I can't tell.","August 22, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
