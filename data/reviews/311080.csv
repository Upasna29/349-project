It's recalls my favorite time in gaming, when titles like Terminal Velocity and Descent Dominated PC gaming. The tourtorial is a bit lacking so taking some time learning the controls from the options menu first will go a long way, the instant action option is a nice touch and multiplayer (with some system tweaking) is workable and entertaining at lans.\n\nTo address the Negative reviews:\n\nThere seems to be a trend of people assuming that this new wave of old games getting re-released on steam are similar to 'remakes' available on consoles. These are more like diving in the bargin bin at a local retailer. They aren't repolished with new fixes for modern machines, most will require a few extra steps to get running and this should be expected if you are buying anything before 2009. This one is no exception, luckily there aren't as many issues as with some other titles. I was able to get it up and running by right clicking on the gamelauncher.bat in the install folder and running as administrator. After  running it once this way it launches fine from steam. Just so you don't think I have some odd setup that might be old enough to be compatible:\n\ni7 3770k\n16 gigs of ddr3\nGeforce 780\nWin7 x64\n240gig SSD\n","July 8, 2014","true","1.4"," 66 of 81 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","66","81","0","3"

The graphics have not aged particularly well, and the menus are sometimes a pain to navigate, but overall it remains a solid arcade-ish "action sim", with neat gameplay and a bit of originality, some of which has remained to this day even. There aren't a whole lot of these "futuristic VTOL gunship" sims on PC nowadays for some reason.\n\nIn regards to the Steam release: Well, the English localization is an interesting contrast to the Russian I remember. And the game did not launch for me the first time around. It took me the unimaginably difficult effort of going to the game's install directory and running the game's launch script as an administrator to set up the necessary registry and be able to play. (:P)\n\nNo, I didn't notice the line in the system requirements telling me to run the game as an administrator at first either.\n\nNot needing a CD in the drive (which this tablet doesn't have anyway) is a definite plus over the times I played it in the past though. :P","December 9, 2015","true","3.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"
