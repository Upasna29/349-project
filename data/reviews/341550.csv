"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sibushang/recommended/341550/","Sibushang","Moebius JD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sibushang/","405 products in account","If you have a craving for some contra-esque gameplay this will certainly satisfy the craving.\n\nThis game looks, plays, and feels extremely similiarly to the original Contra released way back when on the NES. There's even the "flying football" power up holders, You can certainly feel that this game was made by people who loved Contra and wanted to recreate the joy they felt when they played.\n\nThe weapons are all the classic Contra 1 weapons, you have your M powerup, for machinegun which is basically a much faster and more powerful version of your basic gun, S spreadshot which is pretty self explanatory, E for electric shot which is a reskin of the original fire burst shot (and IMO makes more sense) and L for laser (Protip: rapidly hit the shot button with this weapon for DEVASTATING results). There's also a R powerup which adds rapidfire to whatever you're currently using. They added a couple of interesting twists, the weapons all have alternate fire modes that are basically charged up power shots, and there are hidden power ups in the levels. (I have yet to find these "hidden powerups" but they're hinted at in the achievements.\n\nThere's both local and online coop which is a great feature, this kind of game is best enjoyed with a friend. Online coop is handled via user hosted lobbys, but I have yet to play with anyone so I can't honestly say how well that handles.\n\nYou can also change the color and sprite (albeit a minimal change) of your character which is also a rather nice feature. The detail on the boss sprites is incredible and you can really get a feel of the "grotesque alien mutation look" they were going for. My only complaint when it comes to the enemy design is that certain enemies look pretty lackluster, like the eyeball enemies in the first 2nd and 3rd stages in particular.\n\nGameplay wise, the controls feel solid and precise and can be adjusted to suit just about any taste. You can even adjust your x and y axis which is somewhat rare for a side scroller. The level designs flow well, and you have a pretty decent chance to see what's trying to kill you before it gets a chance. There are 3 levels of difficulty and there's a significant difference between the 3. I don't recommend you play on normal alone unless you have VERY good reflexes or you're a glutton for pinishment. Boss patterns change with difficulty so there's an incentive to replay in that regards.\n\nI recommend this game to fans of Contra or side scrollers in general. the price is right and it's quite fun.","July 8, 2015","true","5.5"," 47 of 49 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","47","49","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lunaticmara/recommended/341550/","lunaticmara","Mara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lunaticmara/","333 products in account","This game is maximum badass to the maximum. As someone who has played way too much Super C on NES, this game has some guts. I found this game on Recently Released page when the game got released. At first it looked like any other random indie scrubbity scrub but as the trailer went on and showed the gameplay, it was pretty clear that I have to try this right away.\n\nSuper Cyborg has some heavy inspiration from Super C (or Probotector 2, since our heroes are robots) which is a good thing for my point of view due Super C did improve the game in so many ways compared to original NES Contra. Better jump physics, top down levels, mid-bosses and non-spread weapons are actually powerful. This is exactly what Super Cyborg has but with some extra spice on it.\n\nYou can for example lock your position so you can shoot any direction you want without moving. This is insanely handy when you want to fire diagonally without running back and fourth for example when fighting against stationary turrets. Super Cyborg also has an ability to charge your weapon (it has own button for it) which adds some damage to the shot. Pretty useful against bosses to get that accurate damage going.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, there are two types of bosses in this game. There are bosses that are trial and error and there are bosses that actually requires you to be awake and focus on the battle. While trial and error bosses aren't too nice, they are definitely much better than Super C bosses that were insanely boring and easily the weakest point of the game.\n\nThis game also supports online co-op which is very nice. Unfortunately I only have one friend that won't lose all his lives on the first level and he lives at the other side of the globe which this game does not like at all. I highly recommend getting a friend that is pretty close to you (read: region) to enjoy online co-op the fullest.\n\nSuper Cyborg is a great game, but it won't get a perfect score from me. There are some areas in the game that requires you to have a powerful weapon or you have going to have insanely bad time. Good example is the rolling corpse ball thing in final level. If you are unable to get the spread in there and you have playing with default gun instead, it gets insanely tricky since you can't hit the ball diagonally unless you are about to get hit by it. It could be me just being bad but any powerup before that section would be nice.\n\nOne of the features I would like to see in this game is the ability to go back to level 1 from the game over screen. In Super C the game goes back to title screen after 3 game overs but in order to start all over again in Super Cyborg, you have to go back to the menu and then make a new game which takes a bit more time than just pressing "Restart Game" or something. I find it a good way to try perfecting earlier levels and get prepared for later levels better.\n\nI'm actually amazed how Super Cyborg hasn't gotten any showlight from Steam. People don't even know this game is being sold in Steam which is a real bummer. Super Cyborg is a hidden, rough looking gem and while apparently it has been out in Desura for some time, it was my personal GOTY for 2015.\n\nSo do I recommend this game to you? If you have played too much Contra/Super C, this is a must buy. Don't even think about it, go for it. For everybody else, you can download a demo and try it. It's a difficult game but success always will be rewarded.","July 8, 2015","true","48.0"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PURESEXCELLENCY/recommended/341550/","PURESEXCELLENCY","Squire Grooktook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PURESEXCELLENCY/","360 products in account","Super Cyborg is a very polished Contra-styled arcade run and gun shooter. It controls identical to Contra in terms of movement, shooting, and jump physics. Level design is also extremely reminiscient of Contra.\n\nSuper Cyborg plays really well, with lots of very varied level and boss designs. It's playstyle is much closer to the older Contra's, as it emphasizes platforming and constantly moving forward over the "boss rush" style gameplay of later titles (see: Hardcorps, Shattered Soldier, and many Treasure titles). I found this refreshing, since I like the constant push forward in older titles.\n\nIt is much harder then the older Contras however, and not in the way I would have liked. I'm an arcade game veteran who's 1 life cleared Ninja Gaiden, Ghouls and Ghosts, and various shmups, and I have to say that this game requires an absurd amount of memorization. Usually, I play these sorts of games on one credit, restarting from the beginning when I game over, but this sort of playstyle is not feasible for Super Cyborg until you've learned the whole game. You need a plan and a route for every stage after the first 3, so you'll definitely want to grind some of the stages for a while with unlimited continues if you want to clear this game.\n\nI'm also a bit more partial to challenges based on reflexes and improvisation. I always enjoyed Contra 1-3 and Ghouls and Ghosts because many of the enemy behaviors were extremly randomized and required on the spot reflexes instead of just planning. Super Cyborg has a few spots like this, but it's much more static and memorization focused in general. If you like formulating plans and routes for strategic gameplay, you'll likely enjoy this, but it's not quite to my tastes.\n\nOverall, I like SC quite a bit. It does a lot of great things, and its platforming focus is a breath of fresh air for run and gun shooters. It's not quite my ideal run and gun shooter, but it's definitely worth it for fans of the genre.","July 11, 2015","true","1.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Super Cyborg is an action platformer in the vein of classics such as Contra. It requires quick reflexes but also patience because the difficulty as well as visual style are straight out of the S/NES playbook.\n\nTight controls, cruel deaths, evil levels & enemies and bosses you're gonna hate!\nI really enjoyed the music and art too. It's recommended for those that can tolerate a difficult platformer, and by difficult i mean relentles. Paths and attacks can be memorised most of the time though there are a few enemies with random aim to throw the player off. Despite the onslaught of bullets and monsters to pay attention to, deaths very rarely feel cheap. Similarly to Volgarr the Viking, expect to repeat levels many times before becoming skilled enough to complete the game. And just completing one level feels like a big deal. Compared to Volgarr though, the pace of Super Cyborg is quicker, and difficulty maybe a touch easier. You'll still swear it's impossible many times.\n\nI'm not very good at these games so i tend to hate them. Super Cyborg felt surprisingly encouraging. It's easy to play but everything kills in one hit so it's important to figure out how to deal with new enemies or sequences. The game stays fresh with new types of pain to put you through and even though i'd have to replay stages again and again, i was motivated to get through and see what the next pit of hell is gonna be like.\n\nIt's tough but fun, mostly because of really good gameplay/controls and a lack of repetitive elements. An excellent tribute to a different era that still feels good today. Well designed and polished, making an excellent use of the retro style. Sprinkled with evil.","August 21, 2015","true","2.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","2"

Were you a fan of Contra when it was ported to consoles?  Have you been a fan of contra since the begining, or were even newly introduced to the game, lured by challenge and generally fun gameplay?  Well, I cannot recommend this game more for you.  It captures the spirit of contra, it and provides quite the enjoyable experience.\n\nI would give this game a 10 out of 10, but there is one part of the game that is really holding it back from greatness.  I don't care what your opinions or intentions were in designing stage 6 of this game, but there is and will not be an excusable reason to include THE WORST ASPECTS OF SUPER CONTRA AND CONTRA 3!  As a matter of fact, every game in the contra series to embrace the "top down shooter" model as been a dismall failure because it simply is not fun, no matter how easy it may be.  This game, did not make the top down stage fun either.  I would go so far as to recommed scrapping the stage all together.  Just make the cut, and render the game 6 stages long.  Or go the extra mile, and give us another side scrolling platformer stage.\n\nThe stage didn't work in any of the games the devs clearly pulled inspiration from, and nostalgia for the sake of nostalgia is never a winning business model, especially when it is painful nostalgia (IE, I will not play super contra again because of these stages).  They are terrible, they break the paradigm of gameplay that is established in the stages leading up to them, and following them, and the pace of the game is dropped to an almost litteral crawl when you get to them.  They are so jarring.\n\nThat being the case, the music in the game is amazing.  The sprite work, is top notch, and the levels are fricken cool to play through (barring stage 6... it was just boring to play through).\n\nStage 6 wouldn't be so bad, were it not so damn long.  I mean, it is literally the length of 2 stages put together, and even comes complete with check points (which is not excusing or making the stage out to be better than it could be, make no mistake...)\n\nAll things considered, the game is awsome.  It is a solid release, that I have not been able to break in any of the time I have been playing.  The bosses were clever (albe it incredibly frustrating to figure out at times), and I am currently looking into the harder difficulties the game has to offer.  Normal mode, is actually pretty difficult by comparison to other games of this genre.\n\nI am not sure the game required a save feature that saves your game at check points.  It does kinda... make the game much easier to be able to keep repeating from where you last saved.  Part of the charm of the games this game is inspired from, are that by the time you make it past stage 7, you have mastered stages 1-6.  This game just allows you to fumble past each stage and get lucky in some cases, powering through your lives in hopes that you can barely beat the boss of the stage and get to the check point.\n\nAll and all though, it is worth the investment, and comes complete with Netplay so you can play with friends from a distance so you won't get punched in the shoulder or face when you jump the screen to high, and burn their last life.\n\nPick this game up.  Its worth the money, if this genre of action platformer is your cup of tea.","July 12, 2015","true","13.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I have enjoyed the Contra series until it moved to Playstation 1 and they started to go off the deep end by confusing collossal and impressive with cartoon comical.  Now, the arcade contra series had a particular nuance in the gun firing control which was interesting and frustrating at the same time.  The NES one- is the one that I believe truly put Contra on the map of every young person who owned the nintendo at that time.  Coop became a 'thing.'  Large bosses became a 'thing.'  Punishing one hit deaths and getting rick rolled by a game became a 'thing.'\n\nFast forward to this game:\nThis game has too many human looking eyeballs :P However, overlooking this, it is perfect and I mean perfect in the feel and control of the game to match and duplicate the Nintendo Contra.  Not the later series ones, but the solid NES control and feel.\n\nThe game has some of the BEST and imaginative boss fights in a side scrolling shooter I have ever played.  It is worth it to play through the game JUST to get to these fights.  Also be very glad the guns are all auto-fire- especially for the later stages and last bosses.  Unlike many of the Contra games, especially the arcade Super Contra, losing your power ups does not mean you cannot survive the game.  The default gun is great and has a solid ROF.\n\nThis game has coop and netplay.  What can I say here, this is excellent.\n\nI will say that some elements of some of the levels are a bit bland and could use some enhancements.  However, you WILL overlook this as you go on further in the game.  Personally, level 3 was the least impressive to me and I WISH it had a lot more environmental terrors in it and that the mid boss played a bit differently.  This is minor though and borders on nitpicking haha\n\nTo sum up:\n- excellent control, truly an inspired sequel to the first NES Contra titles (Contra and Super C), with some additions to control that make it pro player on every level (ability to fire at angles in a locked standing position for example).\n\nGet this game, support the developers- I would love a sequel :D","January 14","true","17.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Turning off filtering and blending options gives a very old school emulated look that I find appealing.  The sprites are chunky and what they lack in style they make up for in character.  Curiously in this day-and-age the game is locked to a 4:3 ratio screen which leaves the borders black.\n\nThe music is generally good and has a remixed contra vibe going.  It doesn't quite have the presence of a lot of the late 80s games and as such is fairly forgettable; but this is not a significant criticism as it still suits the game.  The sound effects are very similar to Super Contra but - again - miss something vital and don't quite feel 'there'.\n\nMy biggest gripe is with the gameplay.  It's punishingly difficult in the later stages.  A frustration that's exacabated by the lack of a quick restart button.  Miss or lose a power up and that's the point at which the stage is failed, everything afterwards is just killing the player.\n\nIt's made more frustrating by a myriad of small differences from Super Contra.  Things that should have been fixed during playtesting.  The enemy bullets move too fast and being purple / yellow are difficult to spot agains purple or yellow backgrounds.  There are cheap deaths near the borders of the screen: enemies spawn underneath the player or shoot from outside the edges.\n\nCouple this with a lack of checkpoints in some very long stages and it's time to start throwing controllers.\n\nThe controls are classic Contra though the player moves a bit more slowly than in the original.  The gun doesn't angle correctly up inclined platforms but this is hardly a problem.  What is a problem is that analogue controls on game controllers do not work; there is no diagonal fire with the analogue sticks.\n\nTo wrap this up.  If you're feeling nostalgic and want to mess around in a Super Contra like game for a couple of hours then buy Super Cyborg.

I've seen people complain that you are helpless once you lose a special weapon but that is not the case at all, the default weapon is incredibly powerful when used properly.\nThere is a single minor flaw to the game: when you're on a slope and you shoot diagonally the aim will not realign itself to be at the proper angle like it does in every Contra game. I find it weird that the developer who obviously loves the series as much as he does could forget something like that but again it's a minor thing and its absense is only noticeable in a couple of spots.\n\nIf you've been craving some more Contra then you need this game.","October 6, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It takes a lot from both Contra & Super C with a spice of HardCorps and Shattered Soldier. The overall level design follows the Super C template with a little bit of HC influence as you will be facing bosses about 2 or 3 times a stage. the Shattered Soldier influence comes with the chargeable weapon which gives a strategic element to know which weapon to use at what time and when it is better to simply tap'n'leave with a Charge shot rather than fire at will. The patterns for the bosses are mostly inspired by HC, which feel a bit unbalanced at times since you don't have the abilities needed, but it comes out as a NES-Hard difficulty where you either man up and do a perfect run or you simply won't make it. The last boss is incredibly hard. I'd recommend this game in a Heartbeat to any old-school Contra fan, especialñly if you liked Contra/Super C/Hardcorps/Shattered Soldier over any other installment.\n\nTL;DR If you're an oldschool Contra fan, you better get this game immediately (it is currently bundled for 1.99 on bundlestars and is frequently bundled in other bundle sites as well)\n\n9/10 Would Lock n' Load and Attack Aggressively again.","February 10","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The style of the game is based mostly off of the NES Contra games, but uses Contra 3 firing rules (every weapon is autofire, so no blistered thumbs) with an extra weapon charge button like Contra: Shattered Soldier. Lets you choose between BOTH types of player locking (The one from Contra 3+Contra 4+ Contra ReBirth where you hold the button, but also has the toggleable lock from Shattered Soldier if you really want to use that garbage). The laser weapon is kind of a mixture of Contra 3 and Contra 4's laser, so it isn't underpowered. Most enemies are weird and mutated things that look like something out of Contra Hard Corps. This game really tries to combine all contra games into one experience, and even has local co-op and netplay.

This game is one of these small hidden steam gems and it's a must-have if you grew up in 90's. It's all coming back to me now. Post-Soviet Russia, good old times. I had this pirated "Dendy" console that used to clone games from all the platforms you could imagine... NES, Sega, Gameboy, you name it. We had none of those back then in Russia, all we had is damn Tailandese clone, "Dendy". The curse of grey elephant. We even geneinelly believed that the grey elephant on the cover was the real deal and not some asian knock-off of actual consoles. But yeah... Anyway, I got carried away a bit by the waves of nostalgia. Point is.. There used to be one game in particular that made me suffer and ruined my childhood. God-damn "Contra" game. It took me a year or so to complete it from start to the end... But times had changed. I grew up, as everyone else. Moved to another country, settled in there and in one of those nostalgia trips I remembered about "Contra". Looked for it everywhere and (Of course) no one have it in here. People didn't even heard of such game. But then... To my surprise I found it in steam.\n\nThis game... The mechanics, the enemies, the ambient, the music... Everything feels like good old Contra.

On easy-mode, mind you.\n\nBall busting hard for all the wrong reasons, your character is too slow and cumbersome to move to dodge the streams of projectiles or keep the hordes of enemies swarming the screen at bay. Firerate and weapon-power are kinda weak and not really fit to level the playing field between you and the attacking alien scum that take way too much damage. Gravitation while jumping feels weird, almost floaty - the midair-spinning feels off. And the leveldesign is made for autistic people that know the exact positions and hit/hurtboxes of basically everything. It's so bad, that you can basically reset the later stages if you lost / missed a weapon power-up unless you are a japanese arcade god, because there is no coming back from that otherwise.\n\nI imagine this game was playtested with two players in mind, but even with a COOP-buddy it demands a level of precision and dedication that is insanely high - and to be frank, I don't think the game is rewarding enough to spent that serious amount of time on it.\n\nThe weird / disturbing visuals realized in a most garish way (imagine the worst palettes from Mega Drive, NES and MS-DOS era EGA mashed together) and a soundtrack that doesn't quite get me psyched for the action do not help the case of Super Cyborg.\n\nGame could have been THE BOMB - instead it's a brutal and punishing clone that doesn't get fundamental things right and also takes way too long in the second half (seriously, those stages toward the end of the game would easily be two or more levels in an actual old-♥♥♥ run & gun).\n\nIf you want a stupidly hard and frustrating, poor-mans Contra - congratulations, you found it. But people that are looking for a genuine "golden age" Run & Gun affair can skip Super Cyborg and won't be missing much.

I love the oringal NES contra, great design, great challenges and smooth and very well excuted.\n\nThis on the other hand has some bad issues that keeps throwing me out of the contra nastalgia.  First is the framerate...at time it's really smooth, but mostly it's just not.  It goes from what appears to be low fps, that's hard on the eyes, to sometimes a bit choppy, all sorts of really bad stuff done, in a game with low end graphics.  Just feels like as powerful as my computer is, this shouldn't happen.  I also tried changing all sorts of settings, they didn't do anything, except make the game look and feel even worse.\n\nShooting...well, my biggest gripe on this, is when you go up and down diagonal platforms...while trying to shoot up/down them.  At times your bullets all go into the ground, other times, he shoots directly over everyone's head.  Very frustrating.  It's like the bullets have a set path, and the ground just doesn't match...which just makes me wish they never put diagonal type pathing.\n\nDesign...well, I liked the original's diversity.  In here, they kind of did mostly right scrolling.  The one that was kind of top down, well, it felt like they forgot about it so rushed it into one place.  Even the platforming felt forgotten.  IMO, it just felt like they didn't particularily care about the design.\n\nOf course, all that said, it's not like they're asking a lot of money for this game...however, all this game made me really want to do was load up an emulator and play the classic again.","August 22, 2015","false","2.2"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

Seriously, Konami, hire these people.\nIt's like being 10 again and playing Gryzor with a buddy in front of a NES and a CRT TV, except now I'm over 30 and playing in a big-♥♥♥ monitor, using a 360 controller and skype to play from far away.\nThe graphics are crisp and well defined, the color pallete is MegaDrive-ish (on purpose I guess?), but the scenery is well defined and you won't have problems telling whats going on. Music is great if you like 8/16-bit chiptunes and the sound effects are adequate (not annoying and give you clues to what's going on).\nThe Difficulty is HARD. I haven't tried on Easy, but in Normal, you will die and continue again and again. But through the power of memorization, old school skills, muscle reflex and sheer willpower, you can overcome every level (Some design choices for the levels are downright sadistic, though). It is highly recommended to play it with a buddy, either local or netplay (it's just more fun, and it's relatively easier).","July 13, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
