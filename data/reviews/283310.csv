I'm a serious retro gamer and this game is so awesome!  I finished this game years ago, but I'm really looking forward to completing it again.  FYI, the first time I played it I actually broke the game.  The  final boss is supposed to have it's health reduced to 25% and then runs to the last room, however I amped up my character so high that it killed the boss on the first meeting.  When I ran to the second room there was nothing to do, no end movie or credits.  I searched the web and figured out what I did and LAUGHED!!!!  I ended up reloading an earlier save and taking it easier on the bad guy and was able to finish the game.  I'm so looking forward to playing this again!","March 13, 2014","true","0.4"," 175 of 217 people (81%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","81","175","217","21","10"

This game is pretty fun, the lore and the world feels gothic and pretty much dead at some parts, it has a heavy gloomy felling all over it, and it is good.\n\nBut there's an issue here with this partiucular version, since Infogrames closed and its IPs are scattered around different companies, no devs have appeared to patch this game.\n\nIt is technically unplayable on this given moment on my Windows 7 64 bit computer, I can't find a healthy way to fix the fps, the screen ratio, the sound and the unsurmountable amount of crashes, I wanted to play it and to feel this game again, but too bad that it is unplayable right now. A fanpatch won't come soon enough since this game is pretty underground and doesn't have a big old fanbase, probably most of the people that enjoyed it back then have now forgotten it.\n\nFor the moment, all that I can say is:\nThe game is good, it's fun, has some fun mechanics and good physics interactions for the time, the lore is extense, the world is vast with much to explore, the voice actors are pretty fine too. But...\n\nDon't buy it if you don't own a old computer, you'll only be able to play it on older computers with Windows XP or earlier, or else, the uncompatibility issues will hit you hard.","March 4, 2015","false","0.4"," 54 of 77 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","54","77","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Warfoki/recommended/283310/","Warfoki","Warfoki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Warfoki/","526 products in account","Note: The followings are my first impressions, not a full blown review. I refuse to play this any longer just to write a full review.\n\nThis game is a travesty. It's parctically unplayable. It runs on my machine, unlike for some here (probably has to do with the fact that I have a ~10 years old PC with Windows XP), but that just means that I wasted more time on it.\n\nFirst of all, the game has no tutorial whatsoever. But hey, it shouldn't be that hard, right? Except the very first enemy (a weak, half naked bandit) almost killed me. Whenever I clicked on the enemy, my character just tattered around, doing nothing and only actually attacked for every 2-3rd try. Clearly I am doing something wrong here, right? Okay, let's bring out the manual. Let me quote the supposed solution:\n\n"Click the 'combo' button. Rename the combo from 'Combo1' to\n'Brigand Basher' and press 'Enter'. Click the sword icon in the\ntop-right of the panel to display your knife's combat actions. Then\ndrag the 'cut' action into the first empty slot at the top of the\ncombo sequence, and drag the 'cut' action into the second slot.\nFinally, click the button to the right of the first slot to make the\ncombo loop back to the start."\n\nAre you kidding me? Am I suppose to make an auto-repeating attack "combo" for every weapon?! In any decently designed game this is done with repeated clicks or just keeping the attack button pressed.\n\nHere however accomplishing ANYTHING by clicking is a pain. The game is horribly unresponsive and uncomfortable to control. The character always positions himself in the required starting position of the animation VERY tediously. This means that I'll receive 2-3 attacks from an enemy before my character could be bothered to start his own attack animation.\n\nPicking up stuff isn't any better. First of all, I have to find that exact few pixel large area, where I can actually click on the given thing (pixel hunting ahoy...). Then, the character steps closer, tatters around to find the right position for the animation to start. Just to show how tedious this is: I found 3 mushrooms and 2 herbs on the riverbank, near the starting location. I took me over a whole minute to pick them up. As a cherry on top, let's add an absolutelly horrendous pathfinding to this mix. Again, an example: I stood a bit to the right from a door to a building, with nothing blocking the path (tested it). Yet the AI sent my character to the left, went around the entire building, got stuck in a barrel for a while until it finally managed to find the door.\n\nThe other main issue is the range of sight. You can see in a distance of, say, 5 meters (~15 feet for ye Americans). Beyond that, everything's pitch black. It's nigh impossible to find anything on the main screen because of this. And there's no minimap. There is a map in your inventory for the starting town, but even that is useless: it shows the entire town as one unit, when in practice it is made up from small chunks, separated by walls. It took me about 40 minutes to find the inn, which was marked on my map, and another 20 to find the uncle's house, where I was supposed to go all along.\n\nThe text is painfull to read, since the game uses a bright orange text on a dark backround, and a small font with thick lines, which makes the letters painfully hard to read. The dialogues are even worse, since those are heavily stylised in addition, making them nigh impossible to read, so I relied on the voice acting mostly. Which is amateurish and lifeless for the most part. As for the writing: it's stiff and unnatural, using the oldest cliches under the sun.\n\nThe game has some good ideas. Like the balance based magic system (the more you use one of the five, the weaker the other will become) or the freely customisable combos. But the game is so unplayable, that these are meaningless.","August 5, 2014","false","1.1"," 27 of 66 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","27","66","0","1"

Too bad I no longer have my windows 98 computer.....oh wait even if I did, steam wouldn't run, which means I won't be able to play this game.... because XP is the min OS required now...","April 7","false","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
