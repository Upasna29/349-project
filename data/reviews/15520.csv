You jump off things, gravity takes over and you steer, as with actual base jumping.\n\nThis game isnt rocket science, but it is challenging and although as stated above, it is the same basic action and objective in every level. However, the levels are massively varied and theres a few extra things thrown in, (hand gestures and spraypainting buildings with the mouse).

Then you put it back away for a very long time. I don't blame you. It's fun for about 15 minutes, but then you just keep doing the same thing over and over again. There's only so much fun you can have in a game about jumping off buildings. Well....maybe that's not true, but there's only so much fun you can have in this game.\n\nYou start each round by jumping off a building. Points are scored for getting close to objects without hitting them, interacting with people (thumbs up or flipping off), flying through certain gates, and sticking your landing. This gameplay can only interest you for so long. The controls work well enough while falling, except controlling after deploying your parachute can be a little awkward.\n\nThe visuals are bright and intense, but not all that interesting. There are lots of flashing lights which could be problematic to some people. The music is fast and somewhat entertaining. Maybe the best part of the game.\n\nI could not recommend this game for more than a few minutes playtime.

While it's fun to play for a bunch of the levels, it slowly decends to a kind of perfectionist/point ♥♥♥♥♥ style of gameplay where you can only advance if you play previous levels to excess to get more teeth (in-game currency) and allow you to unlock more levels. I wouldn't mind so much if the teeth values for most levels were significantly lowered, but having to play and 5-star the easiest level 200 times to unlock the next level is tedious. Other than the occasional ARG content, it's not worth playing past a certain point mid-way through what's available and leaves much to be desired.\n\nIf you really want to play it: unlock all the little extra videos/audio content first, then see how far you can get. The extra little tidbits are genuinely hilarous by virtue of surreal humor.\n\nGenerally: give this a miss.","July 1, 2011","false","20.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The levels are mostly very stylized (with a few which are meant to mimic natural landscapes). The game is very entertaining for the first bit, but is best experienced in bite-sized chunks. Once you've done a few levels, take a break and come back later - it can get repetitive rapidly, and while the later levels definitely add a lot more to keep track of, the core mechanics remain consistent.\n\nIt's a pity, because the later levels are the better ones in the game, but ultimately, since the replayability is based off of the levels you've unlocked it doesn't feel like there's a great deal of depth beyond what you see on the surface.\n\nI had a good time with it. However, I've only played about 5 hours and I feel "done" with it - I don't have any particular desire to go back into it. If you're looking for a neat, stylized experience? Hard to do any better.

Now, what is this game about? There's no real story to speak of. You are some guy, who does BASE jumps from very large buildings. Don't mistake this game for some sort of simulation though, you don't just jump off of real skyscrapers, but rather interesting and fictional constructions and there is quite an array of things to do on your way down. The game is very highscore oriented, so the most replay value comes out of reaching the best score you possibly can on each level and while that could sound dull to some, I really enjoyed playing it.","October 2, 2014","true","9.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

AaAaAA is a pretty fun - if sometimes frustrating - game which involves BASE jumping from the tops of skyscrapers, floating platforms, mountains and more. It is not a "realistic" BASE jumping simulation, though. The levels are crazy-insane and the game is rife with a twisted sense of humor, which all comes together to make AaAaAA a very unique experience. While some levels can be extremely challenging, failure usually leaves you with a "just one more time" feeling, rather than outright frustration. I thought AaAaAA was well worth the price of admission, and recommend it if you are looking for something completely fresh to kill some time.","April 17, 2011","true","9.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It doesn't let me change the resolution (Which would have been fine if it didn't fail to run properly at my normal nvidia surround resolutions), and it doesn't let you change the keyboard layouts (which would have been fine if it didn't introduce the grafitti action on a ♥♥♥♥ed up hand-contorting key).\n\nSo way to go, developers, you showed us how pointlessly anti-configuration you were for no god damned reason.  Hope you're proud of your perplexing design decision because it ♥♥♥♥ed me up.\n\nAs for the game itself, some levels have a bit of a super meat boy vibe of short levels with challenging manuvering, but sometimes they make the levels long so it's hard to practice them, especially the end of the level because it's hard to get to it.  Also it's a little needlessly unforgiving, such as falling on a 1 degree plane counting as falling onto flat ground, and catching the very corners of things should damage you sure but it just anihilates you instantly.\n\nAnother really messed up thing is that they're offering a one-time-only achievement. That's right, play now or forever have an empty slot in your achievement list. That's some really epic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

There's not a whole lot to say here - it's a well designed, simple concept that's extremely fun. I don't see myself playing this to the point of obsession, but I will definitely play until I unlock everything and see what else I can do with it.\n\nFor those of you who are like me, and entirely too afraid to actually participate in extreme sports like base jumping, this will confirm your belief that you're really not cut out for it. You will be perfectly satisfied to sit in your chair, breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth, and imagine yourself floating to the ceiling.\n\nA fun little game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has enough silly humor to make you smile - note that you won't laugh uproariously, but I don't believe that was the point of this, anyway.\n\nGameplay is top notch, soundtrack is fun and funny, and I will definitely enjoy any time period in which I play this game, but I seriously doubt I will get addicted to it. One of those rare gems that's worth anyone's time, even iff you just have a few minutes to kill. I, personally, enjoy games that don't require a huge time investment in order to understand what they're about and have fun with them, and this is definitely the type where your boredom will die for a bit.\n\nPlus, after you play for an hour or so you'll exit and still feel like you're playing it.\n\nNeat. 8/10.\n\n(Small edit: I mean it's not very addictive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/recommended/15520/","ajpos","Andy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/","483 products in account",""A Reckless Disregard for Gravity" is a game based on a simple concept: jump off a high point, do some sick tricks to earn points, and land on the ground safely. Despite many positive aspects, the game is marred by several technical and aesthetic choices made by the developers.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Unique use of humor.\n\n* Excellent sound track and sound effects.\n\n* The base-jumping mechanic is a new, innovate way of playing games. It is a joy to jump from your starting point and hear the rush of the wind blow across your avatar's ears.\n\n* Flight controls are good enough to seem realistic but forgiving enough to let you make a few mistakes and have fun.\n\n* Plenty of unique ways to score points: getting close to objects, staying close to objects, giving spectators a thumbs-up or an obscene gesture, and spraypainting graffiti were all things I found within my first hour or two of play.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* For the world's first base-jumping game, the game feels remarkably NOT like base-jumping. Rather than zooming along the side of tall skyscrapers and landing on the ground, the player instead navigates an obstacle course of abstract, floating blocks that stand to "represent" buildings and lands on a final circular block that is meant to represent the ground. If the player overshoots "the ground," he continues to fall. Yes, you can actually miss the ground. Interestingly, the levels that feature base-jumping off a mountain feature a well-modeled and detailed mountain that actually resembles something like a real mountain. (If you are going to use aestheticized shapes to represent real-world objects, why not do it consistently?)\n\n* Every aspect of the game, from the UI to the action portion, looks and feels like a first-generation iPhone game. From the big, finger-friendly buttons conveniently placed on opposite corners of the screen, to the simplistic level design, to the generic graphics.\n\n* The simple level design gives the game a very low difficulty level. I understand the point of the game is to score points and not just to reach the bottom of the map, but I wish there were a few more levels where it would be a challenge to reach the landing pad.\n\n* Although there are several dozen levels (80), the variety of them is lacking. Each level is essentially the same as the last; none of them seem more or less fun than any others.\n\n* No backgrounds in any level. Every level has a simple color gradient for a background. How about at least a simple sky wallpaper?\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n* The game has a horrible name. There is no way I am going to talk to my friends and be able to mention this game by name, which hurts word-of-mouth recommendations. It's as if the developers\nchose this name because they wanted to come first alphabetically, and then later released  "1...2...3... Kick It" when they realized that numbers precede letters in Steam's alphabetizing system.\n\nVerdict:\n\nWatch a few videos of the game online. Wou will have more fun watching other people play the game than doing it yourself.","December 24, 2013","false","6.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It a freefalling game where you have to do 'stunts' to gain points really. Except, it doesn't look like a freefalling game. Yes, you have the feeling you're falling down, but that's it really. It's all in first person perspective so there's no actual character involved as well. The idea is cool, but its execution is kind of poor. It would've been so much cooler to have a realistic freefalling game. Like the realism of Mirror's Edge and the freefalling/parachute gameplay of Just Cause 2. But that's all just in hindsight. So all in all; it's ok. There aren't a lot of games with this sort of gameplay so I can't really recommend any better alternatives.\n\n[Rating: 70/100]","August 28, 2011","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The other objective is to get a 5 star high score so you can earn 'teeth' the in-game currency (that's what we going to use when we run out of paper?) which you can spend to unlock more levels. Each level you complete you get treated to some funny news announcements or instructional videos. One video teaches you the do's and don'ts of accidental time travel, another video teaches you grandma's secret ingredient in her choc chip cookies being human remains and the list goes on. Most of these are either novel or groan out loud weakly executed attempts of humor.\n\nThere are a number of ways to build up your score. The main one is to kiss a building (get so close you can plant your smackers on it) and to hug them (free fall down at a constant close distance), but you can also do other things such as give a two fingered salute to red spectators (Mr Bean is Professional at that) and a thumbs up to blue ones, you can also graffiti tag certain buildings on your way down, smash into a bird, hit various glass colored plates for money, or perform the very tricky thread a needle move.\n\nMost of the time you will struggle to do any of this as you will be too busy in a g spin of certain death since the controls are ridiculously hard to master. Hit a building and you become a human pinball against concrete flippers. I dare you to smoke a joint and try this with rift. You will be vomiting up your lungs as your characters nasal passage begins to smell the back of his brain thanks to the constant concrete jungle your treated to.\n\nWith all these things going on and it's unique game style you would think that this would be thumbs up material. It ISN'T. The game gets tedious and laborious fast. It gets too difficult too quickly, you might get 5 stars on two of the levels if your lucky. While it is possible to get 5 stars on the other levels, still you will soon discover that you will need to spend this life time, and your next reincarnated life time, or your next eternal life on a paradise earth, or your next life time being burnt alive forever and ever, but look on the bright side least you don't have to get five stars on this anymore.\n\nThe other reason it's thumbs down is because there is another version on Steam which is exactly the same, but contains more content with more 'polished' controls since it uses a different game engine. The other game is called 'AaAaAAAA!!! - for the awesome'. So if your interested "Go! .... Go Jump off a cliff!.... What are you waiting for??? .... JUMP!!!!"","January 16, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It puts creativity to falling from the sky. The graphics alright. The music is really unique. It just has a charm that keeps you coming back for more. While falling you can give gestures to onlooking fans or give the bird to onlooking protesters. You can spray paint buildings on your way down. It's a very enjoyable game to relax to. The levels are very unique in style. There is much humor in this game and if you enjoy these type games then you won't regret buying it.

While the game does feature a wide variety of playmaps and modes, and the unlocking and teeth currency system are welcome, the game has some pretty noticeable flaws.  First and foremost is the lack of controller support, which given the twitch nature of the gameplay seems like a must.  Secondly, the game does not feature any interesting music and the sound effects particularly for the parachute are quite poor.  I had fun with this title for a few minutes, but the tedium grows as these flaws repeat over each game session.

The game is set in a psychedelic, alternate-reality version of Boston, Massachusetts in which buildings are nonsensically scattered throughout 3D space. This convoluted landscape provides the perfect playground for base jumpers with a reckless… you know. You play as one such base jumper from a first person perspective. Each level sees you taking a leap of faith from the tallest building, navigating your way through an architectural maze, then gracefully landing on a platform at then end. On your way down you rack up points by maneuvering dangerously close to obstacles and smashing through glass panels. As you progress you’ll unlock other abilities such as flipping off protesters and giving your fans a thumbs up. Snaking your way through a deadly obstacle course while chaining together the appropriate gestures is incredibly satisfying. It takes some time to get used to the controls, but the payoff is worth it. I would have liked to have seen joystick support, and the menu system could use some serious work, but otherwise A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is a clever game with a fun sense of humor that will leave you itching for one more jump.","February 10, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is set in a psychedelic, alternate-reality version of Boston, Massachusetts in which buildings are nonsensically scattered throughout 3D space. This convoluted landscape provides the perfect playground for base jumpers with a reckless… you know. You play as one such base jumper from a first person perspective. Each level sees you taking a leap of faith from the tallest building, navigating your way through an architectural maze, then gracefully landing on a platform at then end. On your way down you rack up points by maneuvering dangerously close to obstacles and smashing through glass panels. As you progress you’ll unlock other abilities such as flipping off protesters and giving your fans a thumbs up. Snaking your way through a deadly obstacle course while chaining together the appropriate gestures is incredibly satisfying. It takes some time to get used to the controls, but the payoff is worth it. I would have liked to have seen joystick support, and the menu system could use some serious work, but otherwise A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is a clever game with a fun sense of humor that will leave you itching for one more jump.","February 10, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is basically built around high scores, in the same vein as classic arcade games. But when the leaderboards are dominated by hackers (a million points in the tutorial level? Please) with no moderation in sight, that takes out the possibility of an ePeen simulator.\n\nOne positive about this game is the level design.

Despite the fact that this game is frustrating as hell, it is still amazing. Graphically, right from the first spit second of the menu screen, this game is a thrill to play. Unlike DRP, this game says exactly what it entails, and that is the sound you'd be making if you were the protagonist in this game. You jump off a building, you scale buildings for points, you meet score quotas to earn stars which, in turn, earn you teeth which you use to unlock new levels. Again, like DRP, Dejobaan proves that you don't have to be complicated to be an amazing game. Just pair stunning visuals with great music and COUNTLESS levels. I've been playing this for a hours and i still haven't unlocked them all.

My problem with this game was that you couldnt look where you were supposed to go without speeding up. And controlling your speed was critical.\n.....So the game is simple; jump off of a building, avoid obstacles, direct yourself though bonus areas for points, or just follow the fastest route.\n.....Unfortunately, looking in a given direction moves you in that direction. So you have no control over your body, just your head. So if you look straight down, so you can see where you're going, you accelerate down. Faster and faster until you can't change direction fast enough to survive. Looking up or to the side slows you down, but then you can't see where you're going.\n.....On the other hand; while you can't control your body, it can kill you. For example, you are directed to skirt certain objects for bonus points, but if you got too close, your body would hit them and you died. The margin for error was tiny, and extremely frustrating.\n.....I have this game listed under those games that should have been fun, but weren't.","January 8, 2015","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They feel cheap and ill-maintained, as well as little consideration to practical functionality.\nOn the other hand, that can all be overlooked with this one. Sure, the menu system is terrible, sure it takes too much effort to organize - but what a fun little game!\n\nThe objective is basically to hug buildings, survive and land well; in that order. Hugging buildings is very fun - it can get tricky at times but that's the challenge really. The levels are a little short and I haven't unlocked the bigger, harder (?) ones - but for now i'm satisfied.\nSurviving is however easy to make it for yourself; those high points only come from kissing/hugging buildings (their terminology, I promise you). It takes some practice and a few quick-thinking moments but you can rack up those numbers. There's even 'bonus' things to smash.\nLastly is landing safely; relatively easy to get it into the landing area.\n\nIn summary - a great little mini-game, lazy developers.","June 22, 2011","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game mechanic is unlike almost anything out there, the levels are similar to each other but with enough differences to keep it interesting, it offers high score challenges to accomodate any level of player and the humor and "story" of the game are all enjoyable.  Even the progress system as you choose levels and unlocks is fun and how often do you ever hear that about a game.","July 1, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
