In the game you take a role of mysterious keeper who embarks on new land. Your job will be establish colony and fight enemies. Game looks a bit like simplified dwarf fortress. You dig for resources expand your dungeon repel rides from your enemies and eventually go out there and get them. Learning curve is quite high but every attack on your dungeon is caused by the player himself either by too aggressive expansion building army buildings too early, killing peasants or even by chopping to many tree and bringing revenge of the spirits of the forest.\n\nOnce you learn the basic mechanics it is just a job of mastering it and improving with each and every new design of your base. Interesting twist is presence of the keeper. If he dies it's game over. He starts as a below average unit but with training, battle experience and researching spells you can train him to be able to singlehandedly take on the dragons. So it is fine balance between keeper safety and him gaining experience to become your ultimate weapon.\n\nSo far I have clocked about 9 hours into the game on steam and some more outside of it and I really enjoy the game and strongly recommend it. Actual map can be finished in about 5-6 hours at this stage of the game so it is nice one long afternoon game and then you can try again with new procedurally generated maps.\n\nI have started a let's play series where you can see how game looks like and learn few tips as I share what I learn with you guys. You can see it here.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0eRAPFJe4U&list=PLCZleGQiTyuC4bPM1qt2bcWSQpvRqWsKz&index=1\n","March 31, 2015","true","25.9"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","42","46","0","3"

Knights and archers were entering my dungeon, and the weak poison traps didn't really hurt them. Orcs and even the lowly goblins tried to put up a fight, but were cut down mercilessly by the knights. A few of the vampires had more success against the intruders, killing a few. A vampire's head was chopped, yet it kept fighting, swinging wildly.\n\nUltimately the knights were victorious. Not much was between them and the Keeper of the Lair. I controlled the keeper, stunning them, buffing myself, fighting down an archer, stunning another knight in a hallway so the others cannot enter, then blinking away before they were able to catch me.

Let me expand on that.\n\nDwarf Fortress is a game I love to read about. You get such awesome stories from it, like Bronzemurder[bronzemurder.timdenee.com] (one of the more succinct, well-presented ones).\n\nI've always loved reading DF stories. But when I try playing it, even after sinking 20 hours into playing and working through tutorials, I'm still quite baffled by what to do, why things happen, or how to get things done. I've never had a functioning Fortress. I've never been able to figure out how to brew booze (which Dwarves need for life, like water). I think it has something to do with plants I have to grow, but I can't figure out what plants, how to grow them, etc etc.\n\nEnter KeeperRL.\n\nAfter 20 MINUTES into KeeperRL, I have a (rather haphazard, admittedly) fortress dungeon.\nIt works. It functions. The game prompted me on the very basics I'd need. If I wanted to deviate from that, it let me; it even lets me turn off those hints... but it didn't assume, from the get-go, that I wasn't a new player. It never assumed that I wanted to spend as much time researching this game as it takes to write a college paper just to be able to play the game on the most basic level.\nThat's important in such a complex game!\n\nThe Dwarf Fortress game cycles like this: Play, Die, Boggle, Google. Repeat.\nBut KeeperRL cycles in like this instead: Play, Die, LEARN. Repeat.\nThat makes it, even in this Alpha state, far more enjoyable than the glorious complexity of one of its main inspirations, Dwarf Fortress.\n\nTL;DR, yes, KeeperRL is DF for sane people.","September 23, 2015","true","18.3"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","41","48","5","3"

Even in early access stage, the game is already very fun and replayable.\n\nMechanics:\nYou build a base somewhat like in dungeon keeper/dwarf fortress. You have mana and bunch of mineral resources. You can build different rooms to build equipment (automated), traps, etc... Minerals like iron, granite, gold are limited and non-replenishable  (gold is somewhat via enemy drops/chests). Monsters settle in your dungeon based on the sort of rooms that you have.\n\nYour goal is to survive raids and defeat all the enemy's villages in the map. Right now, there aren't enough mechanics for the game to be "deep", but it can kill a few hours of your time. The difficulty becomes pretty easy after a few attempts at the game.\n\nWhat I feel it's lacking now [Alpha 13]:\n\n- Multithreading issues make setting the game to "single-core" in task manager preferable to using multiple cores.\n\n- No system to generate gold. Once your base grows large enough, and you have mined the paltry amount of gold generated on the map, you can only rely on raiding villages and drops from raiders. This amount is very small to keep your base going. Your minions require quite a lot of gold.\n\n- Balancing: Both your own henchmen and enemies are very unbalanced. Usually, the enemies will be much stronger than your own minions.\n\n- Not enough raiders/attacks on the base. Sometimes you will get attacked by a powerful dragon, but it feel unbalanced and the dragon will fly away. I like a challenge. Sometimes groups of lizardmen, dwarfs, etc... will attack your base, but not frequently enough in my opinion.\n\n- Only way to attack is to command a team manually by taking control of a creature (And thereby his team) or by placing guard flags. Needs more command flags.\n\n- Villagers wont come out of their house. Attacking is mostly a slaughter via a 1 tile entrance where it turns into multiple 1 vs 1 battle for a couple minutes. (What I mean to say is this: There is a doorway into the house, and your monsters will cluster outside the doorway, and the villagers will cluster inside the house. There is no room for either to move in or out)\n\n- No option to build walls.\n\n- Some basic difficulty and world-gen settings would go a long way to increase/decrease difficulty. Options to Increase amount of enemies in map, more frequent invasions, mineral frequency, world size,etc...","March 31, 2015","true","6.4"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aozgolo/recommended/329970/","aozgolo","Coelacanth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aozgolo/","851 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nKeeperRL has some serious potential for an indie dungeon management sim. It certainly feels charming like the classic Dungeon Keeper which is borrows from more than a little. The top-down look works well and the simple indie graphics have their charm despite a lack of animations.\n\nWhere it shines is your ability to micromanage your dungeon layout and build teams of multiple units and take direct control of them to attack your enemies. Despite finite resources, particularly in the form of gold, granite, and iron, you will rarely feel too rushed and are given ample time each playthrough to develop your dungeon as you see fit, and once you've mustered strong defenses it's really up to you when you decide to set out and conquer.\n\nThe biggest downside of the game is the difficulty caps pretty early, despite having your dungeon attacked by enemies that can early on prove to be quite devastating, once you've figured out the basics of dungeon management you will be able to conquer with little problem, and as more enemies are defeated, your job just becomes easier and easier to the point that you could just zerg rush the enemy's base at the end and win with overwhelming force. Having the game come with randomly generated worlds was a nice touch but with the same type of enemies in each, it quickly becomes rather easy to plan a winning strategy.\n\nDo I recommend this game? If you love Dungeon Management, it's definitely worth picking up and it is a lot of fun to figure out, but if you consider yourself a strategy veteran you may find the lack of challenge in the game to be a serious detractor.","November 6, 2015","true","54.2"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

Mixing elements from Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper and Roguelikes. You will feel right at home if you enjoy any of those types of games.\nHowever there is some blemishes on this Early Access title. There is no tutorial. Also the game can be brutally punishing, given that its a Roguelike. One bad spawn and your easily overwhelmed and destroyed. Creating a dungeon that can survive a wave of invaders is downright hard and tricky at best. However there is still lots to love. Not only do your craft your own trap filled lair. You can take the fight to your enemies and conquer them one at a time. The troops interaction is also something to be highlighted as they provide weapons, armor, potions, accessories for each other. Even a little lovin sometimes in the form of the Succubus. With a split Adventure mode that lets you challenge and battle in other Keepers dungeons.

So perfectly, in fact, that after  I heard the concept it made so much sense that I'm suprised it's not a more common practice.\n\nUnfortunately so far this game hasn't really made it very far beyond its great idea.  Even the title is just an abbreviation of the idea, which, as you may have guessed by now, is to have a dungeon keeper game combined with a roguelike in which you run people's retired dungeons.  Such a simple yet great idea!\n\nGraphically the game is extremely simple and at this time most of the assets are the same free assets we've seen in half a dozen games in the last year.  This is a lo-fi game and will stay that way, which is usually not a problem for roguelike fans (in fact for us it's a bit of a badge of honor).  If you are looking for a slick and modern keeper experience get Dungeons 2 or War for the Overlworld.  That being said the gameplay mechanics are already solid if in need of balance, and in true roguelike fashion with a little digging you can discover just what is happening under the hood (spoiler: it's math, lots of math).\n\nIn a market environment brimming over with indie roguelike titles it takes more than just a good idea to hook players- only games with truly memorable gameplay and unique aesthetics stay relevant for any significant period of time (think Binding of Isaac or Sunless Sea, for example).  KeeperRL has that spark in its original concept and the dev is active and open to input- with proper care and attention that spark could catch and we could have a roguelike/keeper hybrid we'll remember for a long time. At the moment the keeper gameplay, though diverting and enjoyable, doesn't clearly distinguish itself from a thousand other indie dwarf fortress clones; and I could the same of the roguelike portion.\n\nI found the keeper portions much more fun and engaging- the roguelike play lacks balance and largely consists of dying near the entrance to someone's dungeon.\n\nIt doesn't feel fair to give a number rating at this early stage of development so I'm giving KeeperRL an overall "mediocre but with lots of room to grow."  And I'm giving it a definite recommend if you are a roguelike collector like me or if it's particularly  important to you to support the hard work of  a truly independent developer.  Otherwise it's a conditional recommend offered because of my hopes and feelings about this game's potential, not based on the current user experience.\n\nAlso, there's a special bonus fanservice for hardcore roguelike lovers: ascii graphics mode.  This man knows his core audience.\n\nNo Drama, Just Reviews","April 25, 2015","true","2.2"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","3"

Dungeon Keeper + a roguelike.\n\nThe DK mechanics are there: you'll be digging out areas and building familiar (for DK players) rooms in them.  You'll summon creatures, and set them about their tasks accordingly.  You'll build traps and doors, mine for iron, gold, and stone (each of which requires a storeroom), and construct equipment for your beasties.  But instead of the realtime 3D of DK and its ilk, you are presented an old-school roguelike UI with the sundry keypresses to boot.\n\nAs of AUGUST 23, 2015, the barebones mechanics are there.  All of the rooms work, monsters are summoned correctly, as go about their tasks and level up as you would expect -- even to the point where they will occasionally visit an equipment storeroom to grab any goodies that catch their eye.  The imp AI is especially good in prioritizing tasks you give them.  Grouping up critters and manually controlling them (the only real way to send out a raiding party/army) works fine as well.\n\nOutside of the barebones -- which as I stated before, actually work well, and is the most important feature! -- there's not much to do.  You obstensible goal is to conquer 5 enemy outposts to win the game.  When you attack one of the enemy races, they will occasionally send their forces to attack your dungeon; conquering the race ends that particular threat.  Nonaligned bandits will also show up.  There's a few other "special" events and areas, but the game as it stands right now basically revolves around building the best dungeon you can, then controlling your forces out to overrun the five "good" races.  The building part is pretty fun; the conquering is kind of a chore.  (Of course, it could be said that this repetitive pattern of build-then-zerg is part of DK's DNA, not a failing of KeeperRL).\n\nShould you buy the game now in its state as of this review's writing?  I'd say yes only if you acknowledge you're getting a game that has its core mechanics nicely in place, but not much to do with them.  Of course, you'll also be supporting the game's development into something bigger and better.  If you want a fleshed-out experience with lots of interesting decisions, I'd wait.\n\nOne thing that I do want note is that KeeperRL's DK design is nice and streamlined, and follows the original DK2 monster and item variety pretty closely (although it adds individual weapons and items for critters, which is nice).  I was uncomfortable with War for the Overworld's changes and additions to the DK roster, particularly in the way that many things were added simply for the sake of being cool rather than important to the game design.  KeeperRL right now is all meat, no-filler, 4/4 time and I hope the dev keeps it this way.","August 23, 2015","true","9.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

It's like a light weight cross between Dwarf Fortress and (showing my age here) Lords of Chaos[en.wikipedia.org].\n\n\nAs I said, it's early... so what's in game? 2 dozen creatures and about 10~ room types. You build the rooms to draw in extra creatures (like Dungeon Keeper) and store resources by using imps that you summon. You have a limited stock of mana that is recharged by killing enemies and ticks up slowly too. The mana is used for summoning imps, your spell repertoire (~17 spells) and a special room type.\nRooms require resources that are mined or cut down. Creatures will craft equipment if given access to work areas.\n\n\nThe aim of the game is to kill off all your neighbours by taking charge of a team of creatures in a roguelike fashion and killing everyone.\n\n\n\nIn the current state, each session is only a few hours long once you've mastered it but it's fun enough to keep coming back for more.

It's obviously inspired by Dwarf Fortress ‚Äì it should take a page from the DF playbook and have enemies and sieges arrive from the edge of the map and attempt to lay waste to everything. Bandits sort of try to do this, but don't quite manage to be a compelling challenge.\n\nOverall, my biggest complaint is simply that the game has an ending and I don't think it should.\n\nI'd also like to see a little bit deeper research tree and perhaps some more interesting breeding mechanics. Succubai seem pretty imbalanced at the moment, once you've unlocked the high level mutation research. Just build out a big ritual room and suddenly, POOF, absurdly massive high-level army after a flurry of copulation. Too many undead and vampires? Just absorb them with dopplegangers that don't mind the sun.\n\nHaven't tried adventure mode in earnest yet.\n\nI know that sounds like a list of complaints, but really, it's a great take on the Dwarf Fortress genre, one of the better ones by far.\n","April 15, 2015","true","5.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There's a handful of monsters and they all fill a role, some help generate mana, some help build equipment or potions, others do manual labor, such as installing traps or doors.\n\nThe general idea of the game isn't too bad, but to be perfectly honest, there just isn't a lot there to the game. The selection of monsters you can access isn't terrible, but it doesn't feel like enough. The spells you gain access to, are useful at times, but I always feel like I am wasting resources to unlock new branches of the Sorcery trait.\n\nThe game world isn't all that big and once you've played it for a few hours, you'll quickly learn that the game isn't nearly as large or have nearly enough options to keep you playing for days or weeks at a time. The game is also lacking some polish - I've had save files get lost multiple times, for whatever reason sometimes the game just slows down to a snails pace (I am willing to bet it has a massive memory leak).\n\nPeople have been comparing it to stuff, such as Dwarf Fortress and while I can see how it'd be easy to compare KeeperRL to that game, the reality is, it's not nearly as deep, complex or polished as Dwarf Fortress; it's no comparision at all.\n\nIt feels like the game is aspiring to be something much better, more complex and polished, but in it's current state, I can't really justify the price cost for the game and it's because of this I can't recommend the game to players.

Sure it has its up's and down's like for example.... starting for the first time, and not knowing about Tree Spirits..... I learned the hard way with that one, cutting down loads and loads of tree's for that precious wood...... annnnnnnd suddenly a tree spirit appeared, Killing my imp's making it's way to my dungen entrance and destroying my entire dungen, forcing me to start over again then realising realising the situation i was in over the... Perma death. Soon as your " Keeper " Dies, It's all over boys.\n\nThis game is all about trial and error at first, much alike dark souls. You never know what you're about to face unless you poke an educated guess.  ( this game is nothing like dark souls btw ) So down to the point. I see alot of people compairing this game to Dwarf Fortress. Yes i understand how people would compare it to that game, However as of current state " alpha 18 "  This game is very far from Dwarf Fortress's Complexity and nothing alike. You just can't compare this game to Dwarf Fortress, other then the similarity's they share.\n\nWhat i like about this game the most, is you can do whatever you like. You decide weather or not you are good or bad. you can go around slaying innocent creatures and humanoids such as Farmers, Women, Children, Pigs, cows, horses for that oh so precious mana early game and ultimatly end up getting raided. Or you can play it peacefull early on and then decide to wreak havok at a later part of the game, when you have finally learned how to train your Minions up to be strong enough to take on a red dragon. ( which is srs buisness btw ) You can even decide at the begining of the game to go explore and see what's in the world. You may come across something interesting such as the Human keep and see all that free gold sitting there and think.... " Holy hell look at all that gold!, its just sitting there.... Im gonna take it "  Not realising what may happen if you do take that gold ;).\n\nThere are many supprises in this game that i cant even begin to elaborate on. There are Triggered events, that happen during the game when you least expect it. suddenly you are being raided by Bandits, Or the notorious Elementalist and you must defend your keeper otherwise... It's all over boys.\n\nNow there are some issues with this game, But the devs are TRYING to do their best to sort it out, they even go as far as asking for your save file to look into whatever errors/bugs you have encountered so that they can learn from it, I like this. It's actively supported and not forgotten about.( Like Dayz )\nI found it to be a bit of a learning curve at first. There is no tutorial in game currently, the dev's say they plan on adding on. In depth information about creatures is almost non exsistant on the internet but im sure they will eventually add in the information when they have the time. It is a little bit annoying having to learn game when there is 20% of the game that is roughly hidden to you, such as how minions are recruited, Learning the combat system and finding out the hard way, your minions just arent high enough level to go out and take on a bunch of bandits or elves... MY GOD I HATE ELVES.... So will you.....   But its all in good fun.\n\nI would reccomend this game if you are bored with everything else on steam that you've usually been playing and you want to try something new and differnet. If you've heard of Dwarf Fortress and have never tried it out before, i would reccomend you try KeeperRL. i gaurentee you that you will like it. Personally i've always found Dwarf Fortress to be a little to daunting to try and learn for myself.   Then i found this game.","May 12","true","30.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Minion combat AI can be improved, the replayability is rather small at the moment, and I wish there were more objectives than simply "kill everyone." Also the documentation is rather lacking, and most mechanics of what is actually going on with your economy, where minions are coming from, etc. are completely opaque.\n\nDespite all that complaining though, the journey taken is very fun! The magic is entertaining, the loot upgrades are satisfying, and the fort-designing is theraputic. When it comes to Rouge-likes with building mechanics and squad combat (a somewhat small field), KeeperRL is a solid contender for your attention. It's no Dwarf Fortress, but that can be a good thing if you are looking for a more simple and quick play session.","April 15, 2015","true","8.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I won't lie the create a team thing was strange and i nearly gave up on the game because of it. when you click new team it pops up a menu that says drag to create new team or something along those lines. but what you actually have to do is click the minion above and then a menu for that minion pops up and you then click and drag to the "new team" option.\n\nI can tell you right off the bat you wont get the best dungeon layout or understand the best way to start out without some trial and error also the ingame wiki is abit vague and im still trying to figure out how to get succubus to copulate since it is just grayed out for me. but otherwise i enjoy the game alot i've probably made about 6-10 different dungeons that all fell ( 11 is holding strong now that i have an idea of what im doing) it sucks restarting but i accept the flaws in that those dungeons and take what i've learned to make new and better and each time it gets better.\n\nword of advice thou to mess with dwarfs early on they F@@@ you up really easy. other then that avoid making too many  enemies early on so keep an eye on your exploring teams alot of factions have triggers say if you kill their people and one of the biggest ways to slow progress down if your not ready to deal with it is constantly being attacked and having to recoup. One more warning ill give beware of Dragon-Sickness ;D. otherwise enjoy the game\n\nRecommendations for dev:\nbetter ingame wiki/ tutorial for features: can be alittle confusing on what everything does when you first start out and what to do\n\nability to lock certain minions into tasks: ie stay in training (besides the times they need to fullfill basic needs sleeping eating etc or when i take control of the lead minion of a team)\n\nability to tell exploring teams not to attack unless they are attacked (avoid wars with lizardmen)\n\nability to tell a certain something to eat certain minions ones i select rather then random ones( at least it feels random)\n\nshop to sell excess or weak/not needed equipment too: say a demon trader or something that is sometimes summoned when you get a ritual room that you can buy select equipment to or sell equipment to for gold and have enchant weapons for you based on a list of all enchants ingame and then have a price in say gold or mana or both to enchant.\n\nseperate room that imps stay in when they are not in use or doing anything?: they seem to conjest at the doorways, hallways and front entrance and it slows down my teams even more when im trying to leave to raid. or they get in the way when im being attacked and get killed/seperate lead minion from my team.\n\nA way to pick what your minions make and say it gives a time limit similar to the cooldown on spells before its made and you can selet how many to make.\n\nwhen you drop an item that a minion is holding have it so they drop it in they room that is for equipment or everything if there is one. if there isn't then they just drop it.\n\ncertain items seem to disappear idk if its durablity or what but i had a strength gloves 2 def 1 str and boots that gave speed 30 2 def and they were gone from my keeper after i returned from a night raid. i killed one main human town a bandit cave and some kobolds in their den. if it is durability a value to show how long it lasts and an option to repair would be nice\n\nOtherwise great game cant wait to see what you come up with in the future for this game\n\np.s. is it possible to save worlds when keeper dies its game over but say  keep it so they cant be uploaded at the end since it wasn't one life victory it was however many deaths. say back it up to the previous day before keepers death so that you could try and see if there was another possible outcome or if in the end the dungeon wasn't good enough?\n\np.p.s how do you make the succubus copulate i have two now and the option is grayed out and the only one avaliable is rituals for both. I have a prisoner and have found two human settlements one major castle and one small town. plus i have orcs, orges, and goblins under my control  and both the beast and humaniond yet they wont give me the option?","March 3","true","55.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

A keeper whom seeks to conquer all, and raze the plains.\n\nPros:\nThe world is alive -- the countryside's only threat isn't just you.  Civilians have to maintain themselves, and avoid being eaten by other monsters that roam the lands.\nDungeon building that's a true heir to Dungeon Keeper -- traps, rooms, micromanagement of units\nStrategy game that kicks in where you can move your units according to their stats (slow units move slower) around in a turn-based combat environment.\nResource-management, and consequences of your dungeon becoming too 'lucrative' of a target\nRandomly generated maps\nAvatar who acts as the leader of the dungeon, whom must be protected at all costs.  Starts out as the weakest unit, but can quickly rise to strongest\n\nCons:\nResource management -- gold is sparse, but most-used, especially if you want to actually keep your minions around\nUI is slightly confusing to use\nLack of explanations on game mechanics (minion attraction, etc.)\n"Black Glob" wall that (I guess) represents the 'edge of the map,' (and you sometimes starting right by it)\nPacing of the game is a little on the fast side (Depending on if you like that or not) -- if you're good, it's over before you really get into it.  Research is instant!\nNo control over crafting mechanics -- minions make whatever they feel like.\nKeeper character is a rather stale unit (evil wizard! rawr!); no other options or skill tree to define your own keeper\nUnit pathfinding can burp (imps got lost trying to make a U-turn)\n\nOther than that, pretty solid alpha release.  Entertaining, to boot!

A lot. With each death though, you learn from the mistakes you've made on our previous Keeper and improve.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nA bit of a more personal moment just to tell you what can happen in this game.\nI became more adept to the game and managed a pretty good base, but was running thin. Only just getting new Orc trooper recruits and goblins that've made a scarce few amount of weapons, I thought my defences would be okay against some bandits so I decided to send my Imps on a big resource run - alas they ran into a dwarf camp and it got to the point where my keeper was on a last stand against 3 lightly wounded dwarf warriors and all he had with him was a level 3 goblin shaman. I was so happy that I equipped my Keeper with decent gear and made him study and train for ages, because he defeated those Dwarfs like a BOSS! Anyway... So I wasn't expecting to win that and realized I should beef up my troops. My army grew larger and toughter but wave after wave of lizardmen kept it waring thin.\nThe last invasion I had I lost my Ogre which I beeefd up hard and it was a big loss, but my Orc men were growing strong and I was also gaining Vampires that were wielding 2-H Warhammers (lol) and bows - all these soldiers I've had left were around level 10-12 and only amounting to around 9-10 soldiers. Then the Green Dragon decided it was a good idea to attack my base. Yes, the GREEN DRAGON. Level 35, pretty crazy stats. I thought my soldiers were done for... I grouped up my men with the level 12 orc as the leader, and slowly lead them to face off the dragon in the Resource Room (the largest room I had, thought it'd be the best area to fight the dragon so more of my men can fight him at once) and they waited in formation ..... BANG! the Dragon blew open the door and approached my men. The Orc Commander charged with his soldiers, slicing and dicing him with every oft hit ... while the Dragon constantly missed like a drunkard. I was surprised... Every turn I ordered my men to attack the dragon, they swifty dodged every attack and in no time, they chased him down to the corner fo the room where he was whimpering, critically wounded. I could feel it, I could feel the Orc Commander smiling as he raised his sword to take the final blow on this Green Dragon who decided to invade his home. The Dragon died.. and I shed a tear, as I thought I would not see a single one of my men alive and that the Keeper would have fallen. I never cry in games like this, it's a Rogue Like (who cries in Rogue Like games... seriously? XD), you get used to your characters dying - but this moment. It was something unique. I felt a new respect for my soldiers, my characters  - against all odds, they stood on top of their foe - ROARING with satisfaction of defeating an impossible foe. This is the most vivid and real experience I've ever had in a Rogue Like, if ANY, game ever. (yes.. I did actually shed a tear when my men killed the dragon.. I'm the feeler type okay :p)\n\n\nTL;DR - If you love Roguelikes and have been looking for something new and different in the genre, this is for you\n\nalso, I like bacon.","April 1, 2015","true","9.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I personally like Sprites, i find them very charming.\nThe difficulty, though this does need a ton of balancing, and you can be totally screwed by the randomness.\nA variety of monsters and Enemies (there's around 20+ monsters at the moment in the alpha, not sure about enemies, but theres 4.5 different factions, i say .5 because ones just a different tribe but with the same species, that being human)\nCombat is pretty nice, let the AI handle it or take some control yourself.\nit's turn based, however the turns run by themselves as long as you're not controlling a minion. you can also speed up the game or slow it down as well as pause it.\nit's very replayable with random maps\nWhat i didnt like\nMost of my complaints are being addressed at some point during early access as far as i'm aware\n\nThe map is really small, which makes the game more difficult than i feel it should be. It pretty much places all the threats at your door step, thankfully those threats dont usually attack unless provoked (random enemies will come and attack from time to time)\nSome of the enemies that can come early game (random times enemies will raid your dungeon, and they seem to be randomly chosen) are pretty powerful, one such being dragons if you're unlucky enough, you'll most likely not survive early game if attacked unless you hide your keeper somewhere safe and pray to RNGesus the dragon cant open doors\nthere is a lack of tutorial right now, so the game has a larger than needed difficulty curve because of it, however experimenting can be pretty fun! also i can understand why it's not in yet because it's alpha, the game isnt too hard to learn however some mechanics need a tutorial/explaination ASAP.\nThere are in game hints, so you can get started and learning from the get go\nresources are very limited, this is due to the map size most likely, gold is super limited yet you need gold to use some of the more combat fit minions, because of upkeep (use beasts in the beginning, costs nothing to use and they can hold their own against some enemies) you can get gold from raiding factions, however right now factions are super powerful so raiding early game is not a good idea.\nhmmm that's about it for now, i will update as i play more.

I noticed when massing troops in the later part of the game it becomes slow, uncoordinated, and out of hand. There was a point where I was forced to manually send my dudes to go collect gold because the fetch item command was no longer working. In the early stages of the game I did not have this issue, but in the later it became much for the game to handle. Aside from that this game has a lot of potential and I really enjoyed it, but I do not think it is yet worth the 15$ price tag. Although it is still in alpha and I have high hopes for the future. Definantly something I will be trying out again and again.\\n\nP.S\n(You can find me at the very bottom of the player leaderboards!

The game as it is right now is a great blend of a casual Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, with two modes accomodating this. Keeper Mode allows you to build your evil lair, raid and pillage with custom made raiding parties and generally become an evil overlord of the land. Adventure mode works more like a classic roguelike, you generate a hero and explore other player's lairs/worlds, which is a very cool touch. Haven't played much of it, but it seems solid enough, a watered down version of adventure mode in Dwarf Fortress.\n\nEach game can take 2-3 hours or possibly longer (but not much longer), but as you start you'll likely lose an awful lot as in any good rogue like, frequently within 30-40 minutes, but it doesn't feel frustrating - you learn the triggers/context for your failures.\n\nThe music is relaxing, the graphics are oddly charming and the interface is intuitive, with a lot of detail at your fingertips. It hasn't crashed at all for me and peformance has been fine(Windows 7, GTX 780 3gb) and I've encountered no bugs but the developer seems to be addressing bug-fixes very quickly for every available OS. Setting the program to one core via task manager can solve performance issues, as noted in the steam forum.\n\nThe only issue, as other people have pointed out, is the gold situation. Gold is a finite resource in the map and you need it to pay your humanoid minions. The developer has stated he is going to work on a new economy, so it is perhaps only a result of it being an alpha but this is the only glaring gameplay issue I have encountered.\n\nOverall I can recommend this game if you have the itch for a relaxing and fun dungeon keeper/dwarf fortress blend. The price is maybe a bit steep for some, but if it is on sale and you're interested, definitely grab it.","April 8, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is definitely worth buying.\nHowever, there are some cons: the game is still in Alpha, it may accidentally crush sometimes and the generated maps are not that big at the moment.

Or stay hidden for as long as you like before you unveil your plans to the various good/neutral powers that you need to demolish in order to win. Or choose adventurer and try to storm others' Keepers.\n\nPlenty of replayability with dozens of possible minor factions/enemies/monsters, dungeons that you'll need to control a team of monsters to storm to find loot/allies. Has Sokoban one-try puzzles for a powerful ally. However, the game does become quickly easy after a couple games unless you deliberatly try to make it hard by aggravating multiple/all factions.

Easier said than done, especially with the recent addition of "Campaign mode" that spreads your allies/enemies to a randomly generated world map. In this mode you can even download and place enemy dungeons designed by other players as enemies!\n\nYou can't be complacent at all in this game... you can train your Keeper to the max and still be insta-killed by an invisible adversary. For example, yesterday I sent a team of vampires lead by my level 11 keeper to a tomb filled with level 2 zombies. Easy, I thought... until a sleep potion flew from the darkness, KO'ed the keeper and then a zombie proceeded to rip him to shreds. I was in a narrow corridor so the vamps couldn't help. You really have to be careful in this game.\n\nIf you enjoy Dungeon Keeper and Roguelikes, you'd like this. Despite early access this is already a fully playable and fun game with reliable development (unlike some other early access games which have been abandoned).","May 27","true","81.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a very pleasant mix of both Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper that I can't get enough of. In fact that might be its biggest flaw. The sessions are tough but they don't last as long as I'd like and there's almost no replay value which, especially for a game like this, is pretty devastating because I have next to no desire to start over again since there's no unlockables, no carrying over of saves/characters, no new game plus or anything of the sort. But I gotta say learning the game has been really fun and aside from that one issue I really can't think of anything else wrong with the game. If it had a bit more replay value then It'd probably end up being the most played game in my library.\n\nKeep in mind this game IS in early access so there's always a chance it'll get updated with some great stuff. As it stands now it's still good enough to recommend.\n\nUpdate:\nA campaign mode was added, making my one big complaint moot. With that, the world is far bigger adding many more hours of fun in a single playthrough.

Special towards the unknown. They burned everything which is not right in their eyes. Imps, Doppleganger, Orcs. It doesn't matter. It's all the same for them. And then, one day, as it had to be, I turned. I don't know why, but I had allways dreams of the "unknown". Ofcourse I was too afraid to tell my family, my village. I don't want to end up in a fire where my soul burns for my "sins". So I fled. I decided to hide in the mountains where noone can see me. I also found a few new friends on my journey. They were Imps. My family was allways so wrong. They are just some harmless creatures (If you can stand the smell ofcourse). I told them who I am and why I am not with my kind anymore. For some reason they believed me. A few days later we made it to the foot of the mountain. Till then my "power" grew. The imps weren't friends anymore. They obey me now. There was some nice experiment I made with it. I told one Imp to scratch his arm until I say stop. Sadly I fell asleep because it was allready dark. He scraped with his sharp claws down to his skull and... beyond. It was a huge mess. Maybe that was the point where I changed. Ofcourse not just because of that, but also because of my family. I had to leave or I will die. Now someone else died because of me. Whatsoever we made it to the mountain. For some reason Imps allways have enough equipment with them to dig in dirt or rocks. So I made 'em dig. We build up our own basement, my power grew and grew and it lured more creatures to me. Willing to obey me.\n\nA few months later we found some dwarfs in the deep belly of the mountain. They noticed that we aren't normal anymore. We are, by far, not these creatures that we used to be. Our skin is.. white, because of the darkness in the inner of the cold rock. Our eyes, pitch black. The Darkness itself, took controll of our bodies.\nWe. Are. Death.\nNoone can stand in our way.\nA werewolf took one of the dwarfs and broke his neck with a simple strike. Meanwhile two other tried to overpower a doppleganger. Fools. They vanished as soon as the creature looked at them. There were about 14 of them in this cave. Now you can't tell anymore. The whole room is splattered with blood and flesh. I stand above the last of them who is asking for mercy. No mercy for them. Not for those who would kill our kind. I rammed my sword into his throat. I can hear his death rattle. Blood flows into his throat and he suffocates on his own fluid. We gather everything together what we find. Weapons, armor, bows. We need them. Tomorrow is the big day. Revenge. Finally..\nI have lived long enough in this cold dungeon.\nTime to greet my old blood.\n\nWe started in the middle of the night, I spoke a spell on a raven, so he can scout the landscape for us. A few hours later we made it to the village. I can see the houses. The graveyards. The wheat field. Everything looks so familiar. And then I see it. A big black cross. It still glows a little bit from its last feast. This is why I came back. Now its time for them to burn for their sins.\n\n\n\ntl;dr: Freaking get it.\n\n{PRO}\n~ Excellent music\n~ Excellent turn-based fighting system\n~ "Open World" (It's still limited)\n~ 16 Spells to master\n~ Top down look with some really great oldschool graphics (I know hwo that sounds, Sometimes I am also a graphic ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• but this looks actually great for that kind of game!)\n~ Take controll of one of your minions\n:- haunt a village as a werewolf\n:- take the corpses rom kids as a vampire in MJ-Style!\n... Ok sorry for that. That was stupid...\n~ You can be the evil\n:- Raid villages\n:- Make your own dungeon\n:- Build your army of the evil (Werewolfs, vampires, orcs and much more!)\n:- Torture prisoners (Like, for real)\n:- Enslave a whole village\n~ Trade with dwarfs (Yes I killed them but I am evil >:))\n~ Get lost for hours!\n~ Enslave the whole map!\n~ Burn down forests!\n~ Burn down wheat fields!\n~ Burn down your old blood!\n...\n~ You can also play as a hero.. meh\n\n{CONTRA}\n~ Clunky performence\n~ Early Acces (?)\n:-> Just adding this here because some people think EA is a bad thing (But tbh it's not)\n~ Bugs occure for sure\n~ Rogue-Like (?)\n:-> Thats actually a good thing, but you get frustrated when they kill you in your dungeon ):\n:-> But then again, REVENGE!\n~ You can play as the good old hero. What a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•..\n\n\nMake sure to act like a grammarn.zi so I can change it to a better form.

That turned the game from frustration of hours wasted and never winning, to actually a great game.\n\nNow I think this is one of the greatest games ever build (your vampires fly!!??  and die if they go out in the sun!?? Attention to details, and so mauch of it, is incredible!!)\n\nI do think it has replayability issue.  Perhaps a mode where you continue to build up and hordes of monsters keep coming at you would be a good addon?  Sort of like Terraria, there could be bosses that drop great weapons, waves of creatures that come every x hours and slowly get stronger?  I don't think it would be horribley much coding to add that as one of the modes?\n\n------------Original Review: ------------\nI'm a veteran strategy, RPG, and survival-type gamer.  I love the depth of this game, the dynamics and how there are so many different types of monsters and allies.\n\nI however can not take on a single attack or defense wave.  There are always enemies that are level 20-35 that single hit my level 5-15 allies.\n\nMy Keeper never levels or uses the training the room.  If I take him out, he dies, if I keep him in, he stays at level 5.\n\nSo the game is the same every time, I build up my dungeon, finally go and try to explore and lose all my army by single enemy somewhere, or the enemies attack my dungeon and wipe everything while I can at most kill one or two things.  Even after hours of playing and a huge dungeon.","May 8","true","29.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It also has child death and murder.

It's not an original idea but one that in my opinion is executed really well. Gameplay wise.\n\nHowever, I cannot give this game a positive review until they fix the issues plaguing multi-core cpu's or maybe simply windows 8.1 and higher machines (I have windows 10). I've looked around trying to make this game run on at least decent FPS, tried re-installing, tried changing the core allocation, tried putting it on higher priority list, disabled one of my monitors to try it on solely on smaller monitor with decreased settings, uninstalled and re-installed my nvidia graphics, switched graphics between nvidia and intel and nothing works. Leaving me to believe it's just poor opitmization on part of the developer.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't like to see any features added until this is fixed, and I'm not the only one. If this does get fixed I will change my review to a positive game because like I said before it is an awesome game. Also, autosaves take about 5 minutes to go through, as does manually saving, and generating maps in single map mode takes about 10-15 minutes, generating maps in campaign mode takes about 5-10 minutes. It's ridiculous, in game FPS fluctuates between 1/1 to 6/6. Its unplayable.","May 15","false","18.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

I do love this game, but it does jack things that could make it extraordinary. Thereplay value needs improving i got burned out after playing thru about 4 or 5 times. It needs faction buffs the raids are just too small to effect your dungeon significantly once you are established. It needs better generation, while the random seeded generation is good, you will end up without a certain resource on occasion that or you will be digging random mazes throught the mountain getting to the ore veins. the games progresses to fast, when you start out it goes at normal speed then all the sudden the progression feels like it gets throttle extremly easily , then before you know it you have researched everything but humanoid and beast mutation and you are just trying to find a way to make the game last longer.\nOne way the game could be improved greatly would be with Steam Workshop support.This could up the replay value by a MILE (or 1.609344 Kilometers for those of you not from the US) thus greatly improving the game.\nOverall rate 7.5/10\nPLEASE NOTE: This game is still in early access(EXTREMEly early alpha from what i can tell) This game IS most CERTAINLY going to be a TREMENDOUSLY AMAZING game when it is fully released.

It is a finite resource yet you need it to keep your army. It kind of ruins the game. You aren't a dungeon keeper, you are just some guy who hires mercenaries. Plus, if you have long games, you are screwed because gold is a limited resource.\n\n2. my minions absolutely refuse to work on traps. I think you should be able to designate what your minions actually do at the work bench. I wanna play defensively but it is entirely impossible atm.\n\n3. It takes entirely too long to get minions. You can make extremely large rooms and still attract almost no minions at all. Pure rng\n\n4. Crashes\n\n5. Many aspects of the game are random, which is fine but they need balance. Workshops produce random weapons you may not ever use while you have traps planned out but they don't get made. You may also get a ton of useless minions while not getting any that are combat capable.\n\n6. Balance. Training doesn't help your grunt minions enough to even be semi reliable, they just waste space. The enemy units are much too strong for most units. There are only 3 that do anything right now, the vampire, the legendary beast, and the legendary humanoid. Anything else right now is entirely useless in an actual battle.\n\n7. I beat the game in 2 hours. It certainly has tons of replayability and is meant to be played several times, but 2 hours is pretty short for a whole playthrough. An endless mode would be an unbelievable addition to the game.\n\nThe idea of this game is great, however execution is poor at best. I hope there are some changes so this game can reach its full potential.\n\n4/10 atm, may change at some point. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy the game but it just has too many problems going on right now for me to be able to recommend it. Keep an eye on it though for sure.","March 31, 2015","false","7.8"," 29 of 66 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","29","66","0","29"

Really like the graphics and complexity, animations are not implemented yet. BUT it's so long in development and still it crashes, on mac. It crashes on windows. Problems are known but not fixed within month.. new features were added but bugs still exists and are not going to be fixed. For me it is not playable on my macbook 2015 and on my dell 2016.\n\nSo if you like a buggy game that may be stable in a year... or not, buy it. But if you want a game that is playable at some point: don't buy it. The developer really have to focus on fixing bugs, also most are crashing the game and freezing the system on windows. On mac you just get an error message. Until this isn't fixed, my rating is: no.","May 7","false","14.6"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","4"

It has a lot of potential. It's also one of the most frustrating games ive played, and not in a good way.\n\n*Right now* I wouldn't recommend this game to most people.\n\nI like to play the game mode keeper. Unfortunately, the random events are very unbalanced in the beginning. This makes it impossible to get to any late game, because I get killed by some level 30+ monster when all my minions are level 10.\n\nI find it very frustrating to play. I've done the initial dungeon set up about 20 times now.\n\nI hope the devs see these complaints and adjust the game accordingly.","April 5, 2015","false","15.5"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","37","10","27","2","1"

But it doesn't have much of manual. Maybe I missed the manual somehow and it does exist. What I learned is that it is quite difficult.

As many others have said its a clever mix of Dwarfort and Dungeon Keeper. One of this game's major strengths (and one of its drawbacks to be fair) is that it handles much of the micromanagment for you. You build a workshop, and your minions automatically start pumping our equipment, and your units automatically trade up. You build a beast lair, and monster automatically start joining your ranks. This is great because it allows the really interesting emergent behaviors you see in Dwarfort without the insane barrier to entry. On the other hand however, as a player it feels like you dont have as much control over your situation.\n\nThe trap management is fun, and a lot of this game is interesting, but I think it needs a lot of work still. It speaks volumes about the balance of various systems when my only consistantly winning strategy has involved just digging out a huge room just inside the mountain, putting literally everything in that huge room, completely ignoring traps, and just rushing the facilities that enable you to spawn the strongest units.","April 11, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No tutorial, but gameplay is easily picked up through hints and by my third go I could get started fairly easily. Surviving can be very brutal however, as enemy armies can easily ransack your dungeon if you don't crank hard to build an army. But once you get your defenses established, sending out your horde to conquer villages and dragon lairs will keep you entertained for hours. There are many different types and classes of units which can be trained, each of which have their own talents and uses making for unique gameplay.\n\nAs far as how a game actually goes, your objective is to defend your Keeper and raise an army to destroy the surrounding towns, including a dwarf village, a lizard village, a human castle, a viking fort, an elf village, dragon lairs and some farmer shacks. These are the same every time you play. You must collect Stone, Wood and Ore to build and expand your dungeon and plunder or mine gold to pay workers. Digging into the mountain claims land for your dungeon, and you use zoning tools to tell your workers what to put where. The game will give you some early hints as to what you need to build. New units will naturally flock to your dungeon as you build the appropriate zones for them. Research is done using mana which is produced from killing or your keeper workin a library. Very simple, but well executed concepts.\n\nOnce you win, you can upload your map and it can then be played by others in adventure mode, where you play as a lone hero whose quest is suddenly changed when he discovers the land ravaged by the dungeon. You navigate the traps that the map creator has set and try and kill the Keeper. Also fun.\n\nOverall super awesome and replayable, definately work every cent.","April 11, 2015","true","38.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
