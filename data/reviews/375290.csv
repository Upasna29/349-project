It is worth mentioning that The keystone mechanic, possessing enemies, doesn't really change all that much about the gameplay; What it does do is allow you to approach the levels in a far more aggessive manner with possessed guards then, once they're expended, playing more methodically with the protagonist.\n\nWhile not as stylistically driven as the most prominent comparison, Hotline Miami, the game feels tight and very satisfying, definitely worth picking up for the reasonable pricetag.","September 16, 2015","true","1.5"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","22","29","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/breenster1/recommended/375290/","breenster1","dr_breen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/breenster1/","92 products in account","Superstatic is a game heavily inspired by Hotline Miami. It switches between frantic combat and energizing hunt with your supernatural psy abilities. But some of the things I liked most about Hotline Miami are sorely missing and it could use a bit more development.\n\nUnlike in HM you can't start out with any weapons and the game does not have anything like the mask system to adapt to a certain level layout or enemies. The weapons of your enemies are random and you are always low on ammo. You cannot collect ammo and you're limited to the weapon you picked up from a corpse that only has one magazine that is more often than not already half empty. I guess this is supposed to make us use the psy abilities, but they are limited by your mana that does not regenerate.\n\nThe game would be more fun with regenerating mana or a checkpoint system or bullet time that costs mana.\n\nIn HM you can use close combat weapons like a katana or knock out guards with doors. Sadly there are no close combat weapons in Superstatic and your fists can't kill your enemies at all. The enemies wake up seconds after you knocked them out and can kill you in an instant since you can't survive a single hit.\n\nAnother thing that makes the game harder than it has to be are the pixel art graphics. The pixelated style means that you might not see the power boxes that let you recharge your mana or even your crosshairs. You can change their colors in the menu but most of them blend in with the environment (black with the dark background, white with the tiles, red with the blood etc.).\n\nThe keybindings should be more independent and the interaction with characters can be a bit wonkey: your shadow clone has to stand right besides an enemy to posess him and initiation a conversation rarely works on the first try.\n\nThis game is good and worth the money, but it has potential to be so much more.\n\n(Like:\n- A level in darkness only illuminated by the flashlights and gunfire of you and your enemies\n- Bullettime\n- A bit more stealth\n- Distracting guards)","October 25, 2015","true","7.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I refer to it as a shooter(ish) because your primary weapon is not your gun - rather, your ability to create a spectral double of sorts and use it in an increasing variety of ways, from possessing enemies to turn them against their allies as a sort of ablative second life for yourself, to passing through a wall to deal with door locks, and even as a rudimentary explosive to deal with otherwise lethal concentrations of enemies. Full disclosure: I have beta tested this game before it came onto Steam, meaning my time with it on Steam is rather low, but would still thoroughly recommend it.","September 16, 2015","true","0.4"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","25","45","3","0"

Issues I have:\n\n-Power boxes needed to refill the power bar are too hard to see, they blend in with the environment.\n-I found myself at the beginning of sections with all the ammo depleted from my gun, whether this is purposefully done or not it means quickly getting killed by enemies in my line of sight. I then respawn again with my empty gun to repeat the process.\n-Enemies in doorways are hard to possess.\n-I couldn't get the 'explode' ability to work beyond the first level.\n-Story and soundtrack are dull and uninteresting.\n-I had to unplug my controller to use the mouse.","September 18, 2015","false","4.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","8","15","4","2"

Bullets hurt a lot, so the small decisions you make are really important because both you and your enemies go down FAST when hit, in fact one-hit kills and deaths are very common. Again, very much like Hotline Miami.\n\nWhat separates this game from its inspiration is its cloning mechanic. You have an energy pool that can be used to make a ghost/clone, and it depletes once your ghost moves far enough away. This ghost can be used to scout potentially unsafe areas, to explode and take out enemies, or to take control of an enemy. That enemy can sneak past others, unless you make him attack them, at which point everyone who can will attempt to kill him. So basically a controlled enemy is a stealthy you, and also an extra life. And killing guards is the main way to get more energy. There are energy packs on some walls too, but each level has a very small number of them, they get depleted fast, and then they recharge very slowly.\n\nThe shooting is decent, except that getting shot by someone off-screen is extremely common, because you view isn't as wide as their perception range. This forces you to use the ghost to scout. But your energy bar depletes pretty quickly when the ghost is only a medium distance away. So you have to manage energy by quickly finding a guard to possess. And your energy still runs out while possessing. So hurry up and kill people to get more energy. Hopefully the enemies aren't just out of your reach.\n\nSo here's how playing a level looked for me: Find a safe wall to hide behind. Send a ghost to scout around. Find and control a close enemy. Use that guy to kill as many other enemies as possible. Repeat until I can't find anymore, then move forward and repeat the whole thing. Inevitably I'd run out of energy, now I gingerly walk around hoping I don't get shot by someone I can't see.\n\nSo I got frustrated and bored after a few hours. The possession stuff is a really cool concept, but it's execution makes the game more tense and frustrating that I can deal with. Widening that view to equalize what you and the enemies can see would fix a lot of these problems, but may make the game too easy. Full disclosure, I also got really frustrated with Hotline Miami too.","December 12, 2015","false","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"
