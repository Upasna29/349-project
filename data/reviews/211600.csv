Had to play it in software rendering to play it. Even with that compromise in quality, the game offered absolutely amazing immersion factor and gameplay mechanics, meaning no two game modes can be the same. Especially at Expert difficulty, when you're forbidden to kill anyone and are required to accomplish additional objectives, this is where the lore of the game truly shines.\n\nFast forward 15 years, and I'm amazed at the level of support this game has garnered from its fans. There was a patch recently released by the loyal fan community, which pretty much fixed the game and made it compatible with modern hardware. Running windows 7 with quad core processors, latest GPU technologies & gobbles of RAM, alongwith a 1080p widescreen monitor, no problem. The patch fixes them all. There's even support of OpenAL for Creative's old Audigy 2 ZS cards which makes full use of EAX sound effects which we haven't heard of since XP days. It so good to finally play and listen to the game the way it should be after so many years.\n\nIf you're a fan of first person sneakers, and haven't yet played this game. Do yourself a favor and buy it. Games like these only come out in decades, as the sad demise of its deveoper studio meant nobody took the reins and pushed the franchise forward until now. Hopefully, the new development team can do full justice to the game franchise, though the absence of Stephen Russell is extremely unnerving. He was and always will be the voice of Garrett.\n\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nP.S: In order to help out the community make this game run perfectly on modern hardware.

I never played Thief: Gold (or Thief 2, for that matter) before 2014, and was far too young to play and understand video games when The Dark Project was released. I must also note that I patched the game with TFix, as without it I would be playing a 640x480 600% speed mess designed for a computer from the late 90s. I also installed a texture/lighting mod called HDmod, which was not neccessary but did vastly improve the graphics from their dated, fugly appearance.\n\nWith that out of the way, I have been wholly impressed with my first few hours of play. The movement feels surprisingly good (after assigning WASD controls, of course), and the bow and arrow feels realistic (though the arrow flies slowly). The melee weapons aren't perfect, but fit their roles nicley. The sword combat is deep but slow (fine, since combat is discouraged) and the blackjack has a limited range and requires you to stand up. It's slightly awkward to use, but it's satisfying to knock out an unaware guard. The level design so far (on level 2 currently) is perfectly balanced in terms of being difficult to navigate but not so much that you get stumped for hours on end. I like how it presents you with stealth situations that have no apparent solution, challenging you to think of your own clever work-around. The animated cutscenes look surprisingly good, and the story has me curious, especially about the Keepers.\n\nI definitely reccomend it so far. I will update this review as I progress through the game.\n\nEDIT (3/30/2014, 14 hours in): Level design is a bit inconsistent. The "Assassins" mission was an absolute joy to play through, giving you a surprisingly large chunk of the city to sneak through in addition to Ramirez's well-designed mansion. I am unfortunately hitting a bit of a rough patch in the "Guild" mission, which started off great but quickly degraded into possibly the most convoluted labyrinth I've ever seen in a video game. Perhaps the new missions introduced with the Gold edtion should have been optional, or just side missions. The story feels both vague and simplistic, with a little bit of backstory on the Hammerites and Keepers between chronicles of Garret's unrelated (as of now) thieving exploits. I sense it's going to pick up soon, though. Still loving the gameplay, of course. Can't wait to finish Guild and (hopefully) get something a bit easier to navigate!\n\nEDIT (4/11/2015, 30 hours): It should be said that this game has a ridiculous amount of content.There is a good amount of variety as well. Levels with human guards showcase the superb stealth gameplay. Levels with monsters/undead focus are weird, but encourage the player to take an action-stealth approach that is very satisfying. Story has picked up nicely, some very interesting characters have showed up and each mission has a purpose and cool backstory. Despite my 30 hours of game time, I am only a bit more than halfway through the game. Even if I never finish, It's been a fun ride and I'm glad this game hooked me into the phenomenal Thief series.","March 1, 2014","true","38.1"," 66 of 67 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","66","67","0","3"

Also your inner monologues sound like a 50's sitcom you should go to the doctor or something.\n\nGameplay:\nThief Gold is the most complete and satisfying stealth experience you will ever find. The A.I. is incredible for its time with some of the most impressive sound design I've seen in a game even by the standards set today. There are also some mods out there that fix and improve the AI and graphics by making the game run on the engine of the sequal Thief 2. With that being said much of the limits of the stealth must be self imposed. You can crank up the difficulty and make not killing enemies an option, but if you put the difficulty up you will also have to do more side objectives that can either be frustrating or just pad the length without prior level knowledge or a guide. The reason for this is many levels are huge and complicated with a few being near maze-like. If you miss one or two treasures along the way you'll be lost on where they are on higher difficulties and be stuck backtracking for a long time. The enemies in this game take two forms: humans and other things that are annoying. Without spoiling too much just know there are sprawling levels that are massive in size filled with awful enemies and very old-school puzzles. The game itself is also very long clocking in at close to or over 20 hours. That may not be bad if the gameplay advanced in some form, but what you're doing in the first hour is what you will be doing in the last hour. This was definitely a boon when it first came out but with the present state of games there's usually a large advancement in some form that occurs over the course of the game to keep you fully invested.\n\nStory:\nThe game is absolutely drenched in atmosphere and lore but light on the exposition. You get a brief introduction between missions but that's almost it for being "told" what's going on that is all up to you and your attention span. If you decide to read everything and pay attention to the world expect a decent story experience, but if you plan on playing only for the gameplay expect a lackluster story with a nice little dash of interesting at a certain point.\n\nFinal verdict:\nThree doughnut holes/A coffee","November 8, 2014","true","17.4"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","93","51","55","30","0"

Thief consists of levels that are beyond expertly designed, each more impressive than the last masterpiece. As the game progresses so does the level of abstractness in the levels. I doubt games will ever reach this point again as every company these days are run by suits who know nothing about this industry other than its profitability.\n\nThe AI is not by any means terrific, but still far more impressive than any stealth game of this era as once they spot you, it will most likely warrant a load as they don't stop hunting you down throughout the lengthy levels. You will need to use objects in the environments such as plates and goblets to create noise distractions in order to sneak past them and flash bombs to blind them momentarily if no nearby resources are available, I find non-lethal playthroughs to be the most entertaining and immersive as you're a Thief, not an assassin or murderer.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a massive part in making Thief the masterpiece it is, is the sprawling layouts of the levels which are atmospheric and absolutely perfectly designed that allow for freedom by giving you multiple paths to your objectives, the graphics may seem dated to some but I still find them more appealing than the overly gloomy, bland and soulless games of today.\n\nThief is a timeless classic which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys games that aren't dumbed down and have no handholding, also to those who can appreciate good design, solid mechanics and a fair challenge.","December 2, 2014","true","33.3"," 51 of 58 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","51","58","0","18"

The guards always have something interesting to listen to, and listening to them can help you tell if they are looking for you. The one complaint I have is the combat.

Still, I agree with everyone here - you need to play this game.\n\nI got Thief Gold on sale and it was an absolute steal. I am a huge fan of stealth games and the Thief series earns its spot alongside both the Metal Gear Solid and Hitman series as must-plays.\n\nPositives:\n- Excellent, well told story;\n- Quality stealth gameplay. You hide in darker areas and shadows, you sprint across rooms when you feel unwatched, you knock people out and hide their bodies, you climb up ropes to higher areas to hide, you manipulate the environment to your advantage. Impressive gameplay mechanics especially when you consider the age of the original game;\n- Very large levels, leading to a number of options or paths to take to complete each one;\n- A range of difficulties that you can play the game on, with increased difficulty requiring more objectives to be completed before a level is completed;\n- Various types of bows to use and experiment with, either for stealth or attacking purposes.\n\nNegatives:\n- The game is fairly old, so don't expect the most amazing graphics. It's shouldn't be enough to stop you playing, but if good graphics are a must for you, you may not like this game;\n- You may get stuck at times, unsure of what to do. (In fact, I would say this - don't give up if you feel lost in the first couple of levels. The game will start to click with you shortly after if it doesn't early on);\n- The controls can take a while to get used to. I recommend customising controls to a typical WASD and setting 'Run Forward' to shift and 'Speed Toggle' to Mouse 3. Spend some time in the tutorial playing around with the controls until it clicks and you know how to customise it right for you. It's also worth spending some time to Google and find help with the controls at the beginning.\n\nIn short, this game is a classic, and now I see why. You owe it to yourself to at least try this game if it's on special, and buy it regardless if you're a fan of stealth games.","January 7, 2015","true","29.3"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

I always planned to also play the old Thief games and now in the last few weeks, I've finally come around to playing the first Thief.\n\nThanks to Mods and Patches from the community the game looks acceptable and it did run flawless on my contemporary Win8 machine.\n\nThe great thing about this game is that in most missions, you are relatively free in how to tackle each situation and the overall mission. There are often multiple paths through a level and you have a variety of tools to dispatch enemies or to simply try to get around them undetected. Thief basically invented the stealth genre and it still works well. The enemy AI is quite predictable but this not a flaw in my opinion. It allows you to precisely plan every move and to become an expert at the game - which is the main source of enjoyment. The story is more or less video game standard fare but the presentation is intriguing. It's very dark and foreboding and generates an impressive atmosphere. There is also a lot of humor in the game, especially with the guards and their reactions.\n\nThe voice acting deserves a special mention, Garret sounds great but I liked the character Constantine even more. It perfectly fit the game and character.\n\nSome frustrations I had were that sometimes the levels were almost too big, so it could get quite confusing. Especially if your mission involves finding some tiny little side object which sometimes were easy to miss. Before searching for hours, I would reccommend just looking at a guide.\n\nThere are three difficulty levels and every level adds more mission objectives which increases replayability. I played on the second level,"hard" and I think this should be the default difficulty because there it gets interesting. On the easier setting you have to just find the main object most of the time while on the higher levels you also have to make it safely back out again which should be mandatory for a thief I think :)","January 31, 2015","true","20.6"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/211600/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Thief Gold is 1999 year's special edition of Thief: The Dark Project that came out in 1998. Developed by infamous makers of John Madden 93 for Sega Genesis, The Looking Glass, it was one of the first games to try and combine stealth and FPS perspective. It's also one of the more immersive games around.\n\nSteam release is a Thief Gold edition, which added 3 more missions to the main game. And some smaller fixes and very few changes. Pretty much superior version, ignoring the way that some of those new missions wreck campaign's pacing. Aside from Song Of The Caverns, which is awesome and feels like pre-Thief 2 level.\nIt also means that it includes very few extras in folder, which is just some Thief theme for old Windows OS and Making Of Thief 2 video that probably will not play properly.\n\nTechnically, this release is pretty much as-is. Square Enix is not Night Dive, they didn't do much here, if anything at all.\nIn order to make cutscenes actually work I had to go to game's folder and to change Thief.exe's properties so it's always launched with admin rights given.\nAnd yea, it doesn't support widescreen by default.\n\nThen again, you can go ahead and get some community patches, so to say, which will provide fixes to some bugs. Yes, there are some. But I am more of Vanilla experience person, so eh. And most of them do it by porting Thief 1 code into Thief 2 engine, which also adds some new features by itself. Like ability to creep or leaving map notes.\n\nPlot follows Garrett, thief who once was taken and trained by the Keepers only to leave them for sake of his own greed. Now you shall live the hard life of Thief, stealing and living off it, only to end up in dark epic and interesting dark troubles due to your bad luck. Yes, it turned out to be much more interesting both in plot and setting than I belived it would be. It's like a combination of Dark Fantasy and Steampunk in right amounts, mostly leaning on the former. And you are going to find out about it during gameplay too, from little pieces here and there. Also includes exotic locations and 180 degrees misaligned alarm lights. Can't forget those.\n\nAnd here are few things that must be mentioned about this game. First, it's awesome game. And second, it's not exactly a hardcore stealth game that people might make you belive. In reality, it's a huge mix of a bit of everything. It has stealth. Then it also has horror with zombies and such. Then sometimes you want to shoot monsters instead with arrows. A bit of sword slashing at monsters too. A bit of adventure-puzzlish, with huge mazey mazes and having to find key to whatever lock. As well as puzzles that make you think what you are supposed to do.\n\nNo, seriously, it's more like a Dark Fantasy FPS epic fit into missions where you can play only as thief class, but with gameplay designed around it.\n\nStealth is quite interesting, albeit somewhat not as good as more modern offers. There are two things to watch out: sight and sounds. The part where you must not be seen is quite simple. Just stay in dark, which is pretty much everywhere and where you feel safe, even if it might look not very dark on the screen. But this is what visibility gem is for, to show if enemies will see you or not. Sound on other hand makes it not as simple. Mostly, you have to watch out surface that you walk on. For example, on carpet you may as well run around with no care, while ceramic tiles are as bad as lava, something you never walk on with anybody nearby. Not even crouch-walk.\nYou also got bow and arrows with many ammo types, to feel like a thief-agent, with many tools to get around. Awesome. Lockpicks too, though it's simple, no minigames there. Just keep holding or change between two types, while worrying that somebody may come over anytime.\n\nHowever stealth part still can't compare to more modern games. It's not as punishing to be not stealthly as you might think and it's extremely easy to knock everybody out with blackjack, just by waiting in the dark for person to come by. Higher difficulties try to force you to be more stealthly by often giving restriction "kill no human". Which means don't use sword on those. The thing is, you still got blackjack, which knocks out anybody permanently as long as AI isn't directly aware of you. And knocking everybody in the world is easy. You also aren't as pressured to hide evidence, AI isn't all that good. You can just leave dead bodies right in the center of hallway right where you knocked them out as long as it's somewhat dark, AI will just walk over them.\nHeck, manual even gives you a tip not to leave doors open so not to make AI suspicious while in reallity this subroutine was implented only in Thief 2. Actually I would be surprised that noisemaking arrows weren't implented properly either, couldn't make use of them.\n\nBy the way, seriously, read manual.\nBy the way, yes, higher difficulties give more missions. And you don't keep money between missions, so live for today instead of final level. Awesome.\nBy the way, watch out, levels sometimes require certain arrows type to progress that you may have already wasted. Yay old-school adventure game design.\nAND by the way, Thieves Guild level is like labyrinthish mazey maze that gets really tedious.\n\nAnd it has cliche where you have to get four talismans based on four nature elements. You know what those four elements are. In original version it was two elements per one levels, but Gold added two more levels for those, so it's so cliche that it almost turns my brain off. And then one of those levels you have four arcadeish towers to beat based on the same four elements.\nClicheception!\nClicheption.\nYou get it.\n\nIt also has immersive sound design, with short looping track that are forgettable yet help the atmosphere greatly. With some additional design that makes sure that sound is disturbed realistically through level. You can even close door and notice how you can barely hear everything from opposite door. And it's part of gameplay too, as you will often have to guess what's behind the corner as somebody walks by loudly, making some noise, whistling. And yes, enemy footsteps also follow same surface rules, so you may even judge their position if you know the map.\n\nBut you know, you not only stealth. You also explore the levels, finding secret entrances. And this is what I think is more focused on in the first Thief. And it also gets immersive with some additional naviagion challenges. You see, maps are taken realistically. Sometimes you have precise map and it even points the part where you are. Other times it doesn't point and you have to actually use compass to figure out where you are and where to go. Which is actually the first time compass was useful in videogames in my experience, so this game wins. And sometimes you find out that map actually has mistakes or that Garrett didn't manage to gather any info.\n\nAnd yes, in some levels you will be busy Tomb Raiding and solving actual puzzles. Or, you know, almost all of them. It's like old-school FPS of hardcoreness, you can see that it was made by same people who made System Shock 1. Or at least same company. Though sometimes maps are so mazey that you will get lost. Just to realize that you forgot to take a key in the beggining of the level and have to waste 10 minutes.\nThough combat could be a bit better as sometimes you just have to fight undead. But it's all fine otherwise.\n\nBut you know, I like how this game is pretty much old-school FPS-Stealth-Horror-Adventure-Puzzle, combining lots of elements. And yet, unlike many other games where it means lose of focus, it still manages to success. Mostly because it all still requires some cunning and skills, so to say. Of exploration and thinking how to get through.","March 5","true","26.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","8"

But only one game did stealth right and that was Thief. Thief was the first ever first-person stealth game and is still probably the most hardcore stealth game of all time. Fighting is not encouraged, requiring you to really, really focus on not getting caught.\n\nThe first-person view also makes the experience more immersive. Graphicswise, the game is very old but still looks nice, actually. The sound department is where Thief shines. Thief was the first stealth game to fully incorporate more realistic sound in terms of stealth. You can hear enemies and they can hear you if you make too much noise. Sound plays a very important role in the game as you'll need to figure out where your enemies are and for when you need to eavesdrop on them for more information.\n\nThief is still highly regarded along with the second game, Metal Age. Modern stealth games are becoming very gimmicky, one of the reasons why Thief is still considered superior to most stealth games despite its age. You want the ultimate challenge in stealth?

No nostalgia either, I'd never played this before June 2015. This is an amazing game with great dialogue, AI that is still impressive, and one of the most unique and interesting stories in gaming, as well as the best in all of Thief.\n\nI'm currently playing the Thief series, and this particular entry gets a lot of hate for bad reasons. Put simply, it's more open-ended than later games in the series in that only about half the game is thieving and stealth. Many of the missions, particularly in the second half of the game, involve survival horror style running from (or fighting if you're good enough, more on that later) monsters, zombies, and demons. Most of the complaints against this game stem from this ("You're only a thief half the time"), and this design itself stems from the game not being a full-stealth game until very late in its development.\n\nSo to answer most people's main concern, this is a great game, one of the all time great PC games, but it isn't without negative qualities to the extent its sequel is. Most people relate this to the supernatural elements, but most of the heavily supernatural missions are absolutely fantastic if taken for what they're supposed to be, creepy horror missions where you're forced to run a lot. The Lost City, Escape!, Strange Bedfellows, and The Maw of Chaos are all fantastic, and represent a ratcheting up of the scale of missions as well as intensity of story telling. The Mage Towers more than any other mission perfectly blends stealth (hedge mazes full of guards) with the supernatural (towers full of mages), and is an excellent showcase of the game's strengths.\n\nDismissing tone complaints regarding the supernatural elements, we can begin to discuss the game's true flaws, which actually relate to a series of gimmicky stealth missions that simply aren't up to par with the rest of the stealth missions in the game nor the ones in Thief 2.\n\nThere's just no way around it, Thieves Guild is a terrible terrible mission. One of the worst in any First-Person PC game. Every stereotype of bad FPS design is showcased, it's a confusing blend of underground tunnels and sewers. It reminds you of every level you got stuck in in games like this growing up, and there's no way to defend it. It's worse than just confusing too, in addition to being the second largest level in the game, the objectives even on lower difficulties require you to backtrack at least twice over 75% of the level's length. The gimmick here is that the "thieves" who own the guild keep keys to two locked doors in two different bases, so unlocking the final door requires going to the first, then the second, then back to the first, then back to the second. On higher difficulties, you still have to walk back a third time to escape. Awful.\n\nAnd while I'm discussing missions I dread when replaying it, Undercover also deserves special mention. Up until this late game mission, I had no idea this game even had NPC AI, as every NPC met up until this point was either found already dead or rattled off a single line of dialogue before dying where they stood. The mission involves dressing up in hammer garb and raiding a hammerite temple for a key stored within. This is better in description than execution, and it becomes immediately obvious the engine wasn't designed for this sort of thing. I've never done this mission without having certain hammers automatically distrust me, turning the game into a match of "avoid the 1 hammer" walking around looking suspicious while the other hammers completely ignore you. The mission ends with a timed race to flip 5 switches that are impossible to find without a guide. The game actively tells you where to look via scrolls, but 3 of the switches in particular are all but impossible to find even with these clues. One clue tells you to check by an Oven, with the stage having two Ovens, and the wrong one being much easier to find. Another one tells you to check behind a tree, but gives no indication of which tree, causing you to strafe circles around trees looking for a switch that's actually under the fence surrounding the trees. Awful.\n\nEverything else about this game is good though. If you can skip or speed through those two missions, a great game awaits you. Unlike Thief 2 with its forced stealth, Thief Gold puts no restrictions on your movement. If you want to, you can play it as the sword fighting game it was originally intended to be and fight every single guard and monster. A talented swordsman can defeat any enemy in this game except the bee-shooting-praying-mantis-men without taking a hit, and you have a bow for enemies like the mantis men with ranged attacks. Your maximum movement speed is likewise, never capped, so all your favorite classic FPS advanced movement works here, including one of my favorite versions of bunnyhopping ever. Instead of putting a speed cap on bunnyhopping, going too fast results in a build up of centrifugal force that tilts your perspective back. When you go at these speeds you can actually hear Garrett's individual footsteps speeding up, until you go so fast Garrett's feet can't keep up and you fall on your head and die. So going fast is an exhilarating gamble, and mastery of bunny hopping involves capping your own speed by letting Garrett take a few ground steps every jump once you reach full speed. I'd love to see something like this in a modern shooter.\n\nI've seen some suggest that this bunny hopping somehow ruins the game, a notion that I completely reject. No one is forcing you to bunny hop through the whole game, it just provides a second emergent gameplay style for people who want to chop up crab people with swords while flying through the air at 90 miles per hour.\n\nTaking it as an entire package, this is a great game. It's not in the running for best game of all time like Thief 2, System Shock 2, and Deus Ex, but it's still a solid 9 or 10 out of 10 game, and is up there with games like Quake 1 in level design and gameplay. In addition, the story is absolutely fantastic, and is significantly better than Thief 2's, as well as being roughly as good as System Shock 2's and almost as good as Deus Ex's. Without spoiling anything, the Trickster is objectively up there with SHODAN, and in my own opinion much scarier, though I think that partially relates to my own fears.\n\nP.S. Setting is Medieval, not Steampunk. This was probably played out at the time, but now that steampunk has been done to death this simply makes the game feel more unique than its steampunk sequels.","June 30, 2015","true","24.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

I'm not one for "realistic" military shooters like CoD or BF (love TF2 and CS:S, though), but then there are games such as MGS and Hitman that I can take to and hide in the shadows, preying on my victims. But the special formula, for me, is a FPS (First Person Sneaker). The charm with it is that I may be preying on one person, but may not even notice who's behind me, and subsequently get caught. Today's game does just that. Thief Gold is one of my favorite "action" games of all time, and here's why I think it's worth the investment.\n\nI'd like to go over some point while discussing Thief:\n\n1.Presentation\n2.Gameplay\n3.Overall\n\nReady? Let's go!\n\nAt first glance, Thief really does show it's age with the Dark Engine. Skeletal animation is quite intergrated with some muscular animations, providing rather overdramatic deaths (if any, which will be discussed below). Enviroments are very blocky (or shall I say, simplistically geometric) as polygonal maps are painted with 2-D textures. What may also annoy you is the audio. But not the voice acting, or the music, oh no. It's the more subtle features, like footsteps, and loud dings. What makes up for this, however, are some very artistic cutscenes done in the fashion of victorian oil-paintings. Lighting is also impressively done, as darkness can overcome your sense of vision, yet the game will want you to run from the light when possible. Mentioning the voice-acting earlier, there are some pretty witty lines to be overheard in Thief: Gold, as guards and civilians may converse with each other under a scripted fashion, and will even mutter to themselves with humorous intent. Some of the NPCs sound very wimpy, yet some undead enemies will really freighten you with their demonic chanting and sinfully evil laughter. Even some of the cutscenes with leave you breathlessly in despair. That said, Thief really does show its presentful values with an excellently crafted story, as well as its protagonist. For in Thief, the players' intentions are personified into Garret, a misanthropic nobody with utter disregard for human sympathy, thus thrusting his life into that of cold lonliness upon which he accepts, nontheless. What drives Garret to keep living the way he does, however, is the challenge of a hiest. Likewise, it's the challenge in every level of Thief: Gold that'll want you to keep looking for more loot. These ambitions will lead Garret to rob enormous manors, a mountainside prison, an ancient, subterrainean city lost to the anals (I mean annals) of time, the Thieves Guild (how's that for a TES reference), a madhouse, a wizards' synod, an opera house, and even the depths of Hell, themselves. Thief: Gold really does present itself rather well when you look deeply enough, but that's only one reason to buy this game.\n\nPoint Two: Gameplay\n\nUnder its point of view, Thief: Gold works a lot like your typical FPS under its basic set. Move the mouse around to move the camera, left-click to use a weapon, right-click to use an item. The controls are a little different, though. To move, you use S, Z, X, C rather than your typical WASD format. In fact, you press W to sprint, rather than holding the Shift key. Use Q and E to lean in their respected directions, as a means to peek around corners, checking for guards. You also have a set array of weapons. Garret has a sword for hairy confrontations, a blackjack for knocking out patrols, and a Bow with several sets of arrows, including rope and water arrows. He can also lug around flashbombs for quick getaways, healing potions to mend wounds, and speed potions to hasten his running speed. These are just a few examples of weapons and gadgets you may use in Thief. But you don't really have to use a sword or broadpoint arrows to get past an enemy. You could indiscriminatly kill everyone in every level, and at the same time, you can beat the game without killing a single soul. Crafty thieves will use their environments to their advantage, throwing objects for distraction, finding secret entry points, and patiently hiding in the shadows, waiting for a chance to strike. This game really rewards the patient and insightful, while tolerating the maniaclly homicidal. Of course, the homicidal will need to be patient to, as heading straight on into a confrontation will more than likely get you killed. See, Garret is NOT a tank. He can die within a few hits of a blade, or a few arrows to the chest. Even the sneaky will need to be cautious, as these guards will use thier sights and sounds to sniff you out of the shadows if they so much as suspect you. In turn, however, you are a master sneak, being able to hide in plain sight if you're cloaked in a dark shadow, or run a marathon on a bathroom carpet (for what that's worth). By the way, whatever you do, don't step on tile floors. They are your worst enemy possible, as every step you take can be hear within the nearest 20 yard radius. That said, Thief is a successful stealth game, giving you a light meter to show how visible you are to an enemy, rewarding exploration with tons of loot and secrets to reveal, and providing weapons only in self-defense rather than assault. If anything, the gameplay is where Thief: Gold truly shines.\n\nPoint Three: Overall\n\nGiven the games' age, it's easy to see how obsolete the Dark Engine is. But also has a reputation of providing masterful games with rich storytelling and gameplay aspects, with Thief: Gold as a shining prodigy. It's a very functional sneak 'em up, with about 60+ hours of gameplay, and more if you go back on higher difficulties. It's an obvious cult-classic being the ghost-father of modern gaming, providing intelligent enemies, a powerful storyline, immersive gameplay, and just being an exemplar of stealth games, in general. I would highly recommend buying Thief even today.\n\nThis game has been Dubb-approved.","February 8, 2013","true","63.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Made in 1995 the game follows an assassin by the name of Garret. He is the reluctant hero that the dystopic future city needs, but not the one it wants right now. The game has you going through various places stealing and killing people as you please. The controls are very bad and you will need to rebind them if you buy it, but if you can get past that it's a pretty good game. Guards have very small detection boxes, enemies die really easily and they all run slower then you do. All these come together to make Assassin™ Gold one of the most enjoyable "stealth" games I've ever played. The voice acting is also impeccable and anyone who disagrees is a taffer. I have to admit I was so excited when Looking Glass Studios™ announced Thi4f coming out soon for the Xbox One™ from Microsoft™, the PS4™ from Playstation™, the WiiU™ from Nintendo™ and the Macintosh™ from Apple™. I can't wait to get my hands on it and by the looks of all these great new trailers coming out showing Garret as a more edgy more DmC Dante esque hero I shed tears of joy.

Thief: Gold is effectively the "Game of the Year" edition which includes two extra maps (which admittedly are among the weaker ones in the games). In the game, you play as Garret, a master thief who contains a jewel which notes his visibility at all times, and you use it and your other skills (specialty arrows and especially listening skills) to sneak your way through levels pilfering everything along the way. It is played from a first-person perspective, so there's no means to be able to see around corners, which leads to a claustrophobic experience and requires patience to move forwards, listening carefully for what might be ahead.\n\nI poured an enormous number of hours into this game and its sequel when I was younger (prior to Steam), and had replayed them relatively recently - while the graphics have certainly aged, the atmosphere and gameplay have not, and they're well worth checking out. The mod community has put out a wise variety of patches to help those on modern systems play teh games, and the sequel has an entire new "sequel" campaign that was made for it.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.","March 6, 2014","true","0.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

As one of the first first person games that wasn't a shooter, it introduced many people to a whole different genre: stealth. And in terms of pure gameplay mechanics, I'm going to make a controversial claim: this game (and presumably Thief II, which I will start playing soon) has the best stealth in any series of games.\n\nWhile other games put their own spin on the genre (MGS, Hitman) and are good in their own ways, this game requires you be stealthy. Go up against more than one (two if you're REALLY good) enemies and there's a very good chance that you'll meet your end. It's easier and way more efficient to just knock guards out anyway, as they are funcitonally silent and there's no blood to clean up afterwards.\n\nIn addition to the mechanics, there's great, open ended level design at work here. Each level plops you in the middle of it with only a vague idea of where to go. It's up to you to explore and figure out what's what. And these levels are MASSIVE, especially the special levels included in the Gold Edition.\n\nPlus, the world and lore allows for variety as well. In one level, you may be investigating a manor, while in another you may be running and sneaking past the undead (and the horror themed levels in this game are effectively freaky thanks to utterly superb sound design). There's a neat level where you need to tail assassins and, in possibly my favorite level in the game, one where you go undercover as an enemy.\n\nTo top it off, there's a pretty solid story. Garret is a Thief in an unnamed city who was recruited by a mysterious faction known as the Keepers when he was very young. He rejected their secretive ways, but used the training they gave him to master the art of burglary. After a few vaguely related but nontheless interesting levels, he is recruited by a man to recover an ancient artifact known as The Eye. It twists and turns from there and makes excellent use of its lore.\n\nOne of the best parts of this game is Garret himself. He's not a typical video game rogue, who might steal from the rich and give to the poor. He steals form literally everybody so he can live. He's selfish as all hell, yet the player can still sympathize with him because everyone he steals from are awful in their own way. His commentary through the game is scarce but wonderful thanks to the developers getting the absolute best voice actor they could for the role.\n\nIn short, this game is an absolute must play for anyone who loves stealth or for people looking for an extremely well designed and polished game with lots of variety and meat on its bones.","March 16","true","24.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Not only does it help player get deeply immersed in the dark and mysterious world, but it also works as an effective way to determine enemy locations.\n\n- Impressive shadow based stealth system for its time, in a matter of fact this might be the very first sneaking game that uses darkness as the main tool for hiding.\n\n- The graphics, they aren't bad that's for sure, especially for a slow paced 1998 game that puts a high focus on environment and exploration (Just remember to NOT play on the software mode).\n\n- The main protagonist, there's just something charismatic about everybody's favorite cynical and snarky thief, Garrett.\n\nCONS\n\n- Spiders...Mother♥♥♥♥ing spiders everywhere, damn i'm glad they fixed this in Thief 2 and removed most of dem motha♥♥♥♥as!\n\n- The high emphasis on horror and tomb raiding, thankfully fixed in the successors.\n\n- The last 2 levels just suck... They are just plain horrible.\n\nConclusion: Like i said, one of my favorite games of all time and i definitely recommend this to any hardcore stealth fans that isn't afraid of spiders and creepy ♥♥♥ zombies like myself. My final rating is [9,1].\n\nReview written by a hardcore taffer and a long time Thief fan, Hoxton47","November 21, 2015","true","70.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

You must install TTFix.\n\nThief Gold - the first installment (an updated version of Thief: the Dark Project) in the cult saga of Thief games. The game was released in the year 1999 and very well received by critics. Surprisingly, even though I am a fan of Splinter Cell and Hitman series, I haven't played Thief upon its original release. Luckily, recently I finally got my hands on the game. Even though the game is not about graphics, I highly recommend installing HD Mod - it looks simply beautiful.\n\nThe game is set in a steampunk city called.. The City. Gameplay suits people like me very well. I am the kind of person who likes to crawl around the levels very slowly and sniff every corner. Now, you CAN go through the front door all guns blazing swinging your sword, but that would be just silly. And, unlike Camelot, The City is not a silly place. Although AI is not the sharpest - you cannot expect a super advanced AI from a 1998 game - you will still face a formidable challenge and your attacks are but a scratch to the enemies.\n\nFor a game that is almost 20 years old, the levels are bigger than one could expect. If you like to screw around, it may take around an hour to finish a level. Despite all that, level design is very good.\n\nThere isn't much of a tutorial to the game, since the training part covers just really basic things – it teaches you how to swing your sword and use items (like keys to unlock doors). You will have to learn things on the go. At your disposal you have a sword, a blackjack (a tool for pacifists – when you don’t want to kill your opponent, just knock him out), a bow and some explosives (like flash bombs). You probably won’t use your sword too much however. With a variety of different types of arrows available to pass through levels undetected, you will find the bow to be one of the most useful items.\n\nI recommend the game for everyone who stealth games or a challenge or simply wants to remember old times and replay Thief with HD Mod. For those who haven’t played any games like this before – this is great value for your money and you definitely should try it. However, if you don’t like slow paced gameplay – this game is not for you.\n\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

You've got tons of freedom in how you approach the environment, the levels are very large and varried, and you are never told exactly where your target is, and sometimes you're gonna have to be a little creative in how you get back out, as the route you took could be very hard to go back through. The AI can be a little dumb sometimes, but it's still very playable. Make sure you think creatively with your rope, water, fire, broadhead, and noisemaker arrows, mines, holy water, etc. If the game falls short in certain areas or leaves you wanting MORE, there's always custom maps and you could find some guides to which ones kick ♥♥♥.\n\nRemember that this game is not linear, and there are many ways to enter a complex or get to an objective. Be creative. Think creatively. But don't think wastefully. Water arrows are usually abundant so feel free to shoot off all of those, but buy a ton before entering the level.\n\nDO BUY the OLD 1998 Thief. It's fantastic and gives you loads of freedom in stealing and exploring.\n\nDO NOT BUY the NEW 2014 Thief.

While you still get a lot of fun out of it, looking back, you can see the cracks and rudimentary design that would be further polished and refined down the line.\n\nYou see it everywhere - guard patrols that stack up four or five deep in a single line, rooms with lots of guards facing away from the player, smaller levels on average, rougher animation, etc.\n\nYet, for all that, the original Thief is still an engrossing and eminently-playable experience. The bones of the engine are all there, and blackjacking and using rope arrows still feels as good as it did when I first played it back in the late 90's. It's definitely worth picking up both of the games, if only to see how much the engine and gameplay developed between the two original installments.","April 12, 2014","true","6.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

He pried it out of my hands over a month later. I immediately bought Thief Gold so I could play the extra missions, and the entire game over, and over, and over again. This game, it's sequel, and the community of gamers around it, completely shaped my taste for video games. The story is well written, the environment is immersive, and the ability to solve puzzles and deal with obstacles however you see fit leaves other games wanting.\n\nI remember playing the game for hours in the dark with my surround-sound speakers set super loud. Nothing was going to get the drop on me. In the game, I'd be crouched in a corner with just barely enough shadow to keep me hidden as a guard walked by. There'd be a knock at my door, "time for dinner!" "SHHHHH!!!! They'll hear you!!".\n\nAnyway, super great game. Changed the world, at least my view of it.

It is somewhat of a first person shooter type game, but rather leans more towards the stealth type game as well. You play as Garret a master thief who cares only about stealing riches for yourself. You can kill people, or play at the highest difficulty whereas you sneak around levels without killing anyone all while trying to complete complex missions. This is the first installment of the Thief saga, but clearly a treasure to play. Each Thief game is vastly different compared to  its predecessor, but the game play and controls are generally the same. Just a very unique storyline.

I don't mind exploring but when I start running around and end up getting lost even with the map and objective I just start getting frustrated about either A) what I am currently looking for, or B) I end up getting lost in the place and annoyed I don't know where to go.\n\nHealth: You don't get much health in this game, I know you are supposed to be stealthy but if you get backed into a corner with no way out with no flashbangs or speed potion you basically have to fight the guy(s) and your health drops like a anvil just fell on your head, not to mention health potions aren't all that effective.\n\nNoises: This annoyed me, either Garrett is wearing tap dancing shoes or he weighs a whole lot, if you walk on surfaces such as metal, grass, etc, they all make different noise as well as how loud it is, but bloody h3ll tile is the worst of it all. One time in Constantines house there is tiles almost everywhere, and guards walking around, so I crouched and walked as slow as possible and apparently a guard 3 meters away from my position heard me, and I was going as slow as a snail for gods sake, if I were to actually get close to him it would have taken me forever and he would have had to fully stop.\n\nOut of all this game gets a 7/10 some things heavily bug me and I wish they would fix them or atleast put something up as a workaround.","February 26, 2014","true","45.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Other than that, this is a great game. It shows some age, particularly in some sound quality, though it was still immersive. Graphics-wise, this game was made over 16 years ago, it definitely looks a bit old with low-polygon models and simpler textures, but you still know all the important information from being in a room, wooden barrels, guardsmen, etc. Plus, there's bound to be a texture mod out there if the graphics are bugging you.\nThe gameplay still holds up! The AI isn't the brightest, with some odd pathfinding that I've noticed, but it is not terrible. They're smart enough to make trickery and deception satisfying and meaningful.\n\nA small complaint would be the controls. By default, there are a lot of redundant and confusing keybinds set up. For example, I had to manually set A and D to strafe, so I could have Q and E used for leaning. The walking and running transition is also not retroactive, meaning that if you are walking and you suddenly need to run, you have to let go of the walk key and then run. In my setup, walk is W, run W+alt, so to run whilst walking I release W then hold down alt and press W. As opposed to Skyrim where it would be automatic. Once you spend some time getting used to the game, this isn't much of an issue, but it still slows you down some.\n\nVoice acting, dialogue, story...

Any novel would similarly encourage a reader's imagination to flourish. While save restarts can drive me insane, this game forces you to be stealth, and tactful at the same time.\n\nI highly encourage any player at a minimum to install the audio enhancements. These enhancements are available in conjunction with the HD texture update packs. The depth and quality of sound is amazing, even for a game this old.

Your enemies all fight better then you do, and they call for reinforcements faster then you can press the quickload key. As a result the game encourages you to slow down, and as you do so take in the extremely impressive sound and environment design. As well as it's amazing storytelling.\n\nIt's a game that features a very diverse amount of environments. From drab castles, old abandoned mines, crypts, to hellish alternate dimensions. It provides an amazing atmosphere and is one of the few games that consistantly keeps very good pacing (aside from the Thieves Guild mission).\n\nBelieve me when I say, the only contender Thief has for greatest stealth game is probably it's sequel.","November 4, 2012","true","40.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deimenried/recommended/211600/","Deimenried","Deimenried","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deimenried/","240 products in account","In Summary:\nThief was a pioneer of its time, turning people away from mindless killing and over to tactful thinking and stealth. In many ways it cannot stand up to modern titles, but it surpasses others still. For anyone who is a fan of the stealth genre that spawned around this very important foundation, Thief is a must play. If not for the historic relevence it is simply good sneaky fun.\n\nExpect: Sneaking, shadows, straight lines, polygons, religious dudes, magic, getting your backside kicked, a unique steam-punk world, servants.\n\nDo NOT Expect:A thriller, amazing AI (by today's standard), fantastic graphics, to survive a fight.\n\nThe LONG Version\n\nI find it most challenging coming back to older games to review them. Firstly, there's not many who'd be reading these reviews - most people buying it on Steam owned it at one point and don't really need convincing. Secondly, it's hard to separate nostalgia from honesty. On other words, it's hard picking fault with a game you've grown up with. It's like a sibling - even though they may be flawed as a person you love them anyway. You grew up with them, they mean something to you.\n\nIt has been some time since I came back to the original Thief. Last time I played it I was very young and the prospect of being caught scared me so much I barely made progress through the story. Fortunately my older, possibly more apathetic self, now desensitised from most video-game fear by the many horror games now doing the rounds, found progress much easier.\n\nThe first thing you must consider is the game's age. Thief came out in 1998. To put that into perspective, Half-Life came out that same year. Games in that era were very much similar - FPS was king. Stealth hadn't really been thought of as a core game mechanic and the concept led to what became a very unique game. Rather than goading the player into massacring hundreds of would-be assailants, Thief flipped the whole playing field on its head. Combat was to be something that should be avoided and feared - it meant you'd done something wrong.\n\nThe world created in Thief is rich and deep, even if it isn't overly explored and developed as lore. You get a feel for the various factions and how they fit into the society of the world. From the fervorantly religious Hammerites to the technophobic Pagans and everyone in between, the world is populated with a huge variety of people with different roles in life. This doesn't so much come to mean much over the course of general gameplay - avoiding being detected is key to your success, regardless of if there's a powerful magic user around or just a servant who might royally fudge up your day by running off and telling the guards. All the while you'll be stealing stuff. After all, the game is called Thief. There are also many documents lying around which give valuable information or simply give an insight into the game world.\n\nThis brings me to the storyline. Minus spoilers, naturally. Playing as master thief Garrett you'll get pulled into a very nasty and sinister plot, which echoes many a dark tale of evil. Even considering the game's age the story isn't at all bad. It takes you to many different locales from treasure-laden lordly estates to cathedrals and entire city districts abandoned to an encroaching malevolence. Even knowing such evil exists makes the least magical places seem spooky. Thief boasts one of the scariest levels in videogames. "The Haunted Cathedral" still sends shivers down my spine, even in the altered Thief Gold version of the level.\n\nAI-wise the game does quite well, even by today's standard. There are fixed enemy types, as you'd expect, but they each possess certain attributes which determine how they behave. For instance ghosts and apparitions are completely deaf, but are easily alerted to visual disturbance, while beastmen have heightened hearing. As a general rule, any messing about you do (making noises, picking up valuable trinkets from highly visible well-travelled locations) will trigger people to search for you. The more you do it, the longer they look and the more on-edge they get until they find you. The combat itself isn't great, and for me I'd say it was the biggest let-down in the game. The animations don't quite synch making parrying difficult.\n\nIn terms of graphics Thief is very basic. It uses the first iteration of the DarkEngine, so all the humanoid models are very edgy and polygonal. The animations are what you'd expect, but they get the job done. The game mechanics are fairly solid and the mission briefs/cutscenes give you enough information to go through the levels with the minimal of guesswork. The stealth system itself is very basic. It measures stealth via light and sound. If you're stood still in a dark shadow (or sometimes a very thin shadow in a doorframe) you'll be completely invisible, regardless of surrounding lights and the sillouhette you'd think would be a dead giveaway. Enemies would have to bump into you physically to detect you.\n\nOne thing I should note - Thief Gold is different to Thief: The Dark Project, the original release. Many levels were redesigned, added or removed. In some ways the changes are good, certain things are made easier whilst other things are made much more challenging. It's a mixed bag. Purists will tell you the changes are bad, but you can make up your own mind.","December 29, 2015","true","31.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Thanks Tafferwocky! Your reccomendation fixed every problem I had with the game prior. Anyone who is having problems like I was just follow this link http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=134733 and follow the steps provided.\n\nNow that I've had an honest chance to play Thief I can say that, while it has faults it is still an enjoyable experience. The gameplay is what one could expect from a first person stealth romp, or from games like Splinter Cell for example. You get missions that change in terms of objectives based on your difficulty, kind of like Goldeneye on the N64. In these missions you'll do things that one would expect a thief to do, steal things, lots and lots of things. Though sometimes you'll be busting friends out of jail or other things of the like, but they all come back to the stealth elements of the game. You as Garrett are not much of a fighter, and on the higher difficulties are even tasked with not killing at all, so as such you rely on the shadows above all else. The use of shadows and sound is like I said earlier similar to Splinter Cell. The darker your surroundings the harder to see you, and the different surfaces all make louder noise.\n\nThe first of my newer problems arise here though, and it has to do with your enemies. For the most part you deal with local town guards who don't seem like they'll be too much issue, don't be fooled. Every enemy you encounter is deadly, and when they find you they will chase you everywhere. Do yourself a favor, SAVE OFTEN. Keep a close finger on F11 or you'll be stuck in a lot of tricky situations that have the high probability of ruining your missions entirely.\n\nAnother issue comes in the form of the game's combat, or the lack there of. Your swordsmanship is controlled based on where you are looking at your enemy, right side for a slash to the right vicea versa. You can power attack with a held click and block with mouse 3. Overall the swordplay isn't terrible, but stacked against other combat engines, even some from the era, it's very lackluster. Your bow is indeed a weapon but it's far more useful as a tool, using water arrows and the like to affect your surroundings. Your bow has a sight, but only with trial and error can you reliably hit a target without prior knowledge about where the arrows will go based on the sight. Make sure to do training and take as much time as you need to figure out your bow's ranges. The opening cinematic shows Garrett nailing a guard in the neck with a well placed arrow, don't do this unless you have to. I say this because every time I've tried to kill someone with the bow I've only ever ♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off. Even with an assured head shot all they do is stagger and then shove their sword through my chest.\n\nThe environments are all really great in game, ranging from castles and prisons to zombie infested mines and abandoned sewers. Wrapped around all these environments is some of the best sound design I've ever heard in almost any game, some of the voice acting witholding mind you. The music is non-existent for the most part, leaving you instead to the ambiance of the area you are in. Guards talk about their days, machinery whirrs & grinds, and ghostly sounds wail in the darkness. Thief's environments steal the show for me, above all else.\n\nOne could easily look at the game and pan it for its graphics, and admittadely they're not much to look at. Add to it the animations are a bit stilted and robotic, but admittadely they are pretty smooth all the same. Characters are blocky and have some messy textures at times, but that could be looked past because nearly everything else is awesome. The graphics as a whole are what you can expect for the era this game comes from.\n\nIt may seem like I've got nothing but problems with Thief, but like I said I can't help but laud over the environments and atmosphere that is established. It is amazing, really some of the best I've ever seen. The combat may suck, but a swift blackjack to someone's head when they don't see it coming puts them out of commission pretty much indefinitely. If you're playing the game right you'll never have to really fight anything or anyone, so really the combat takes the back seat to a game that is all about the stealth and environmental design of the world. At least that's what I've got to say personally about it.\n\nSo grab it on sale or the like, slap the mod on, don't get stabbed, shot, bitten, or eaten, and have a good 'ol time with one of the progenitors of the stealth genre.","February 29","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

One where you rely on sneaking around to get to the objective rather than going in guns (Or swords) blazing. And I will have you know that Thief as a series is one of the best first-person stealth games on the market. Gold is an expansion of Thief:  The Dark Project, and I recommend getting this one as it adds more levels and enemy types. The medieval/steampunk setting really immerses you, and lets you feel like you're actually a thief delving into the depths of a manor, or any of the other levels you're placed in. The gameplay is fantastic, although you might want to change up your key bindings as they're a bit...odd...You also get a map, although it's a bit rudimentary it still does the job fairly well.\n\nNow, I do have two major issues with the game, and those are the combat and overall level design. The combat is clunky and cumbersome, which isn't an issue in earlier levels, since killing people isn't your main goal, and you'll often try to use your Blackjack to knock them unconcious, but then you get further in the game where it's absolutely necessary, and then it becomse an issue. The level design is twisty and mazelike, and the map won't really do you much justice when you try to crawl around caverns that twist around like a coked up Etch-A-Sketch.\n\nOverall, it's an excellent game for being an immersive first-person stealth game, but still suffers with clunky combat and sometimes poor level design.","March 27, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The map system is more like a visual representation of hints and doesn't actually tell you where you are, thus making the levels seem almost maze like. However, the gameplay and atmosphere of Thief totally make up for this. The game is totally immersive and sucks you into it's universe. The gameplay is really simple! You play as a thief, Garrett, and must follow certain objectives to complete a mission like stealing loot for item purchases after the end of each mission. Also, you must sneak around; castles, caves, dungeons, cathedrals, mansions, and med-evil cities without getting caught by guards and monsters.

The story is one you really need to pay attention to because this game doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing spoon feed anything to you, and when it does it's only for dramatic affect. And hot digidy ♥♥♥♥ing damn is it effective. Not to mention the cutscenes are absolutely gorgeous. The game itself has some of the absolute best stealth mechanics in any game ever (and this coming from a Metal Gear Solid fanboy) thanks to it's good use of lighting and simply perfect sound design.\nNow this game isn't without it's faults, and unfortunately they are pretty ♥♥♥♥ing big faults. The big one is Monster levels. First you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥ing over the ♥♥♥♥ing briliant Prison break level only to have the game ♥♥♥♥ in your mouth with levels like The Lost City, Return to the Cathedral, that one abandoned city level, and the absolutely atrocious last three levels of the game. Then there's also the problem archaic map design which would have been fine if the map was actually ♥♥♥♥ing useful. Then there is the added flaws with some mechanics like mounting and jumping. Mounting doesn't seem to want to work a third of the time and Jumping while running makes you exceed ♥♥♥♥ing mach 5.\nThankfully the good bits are ♥♥♥♥ing sublime and easily overshadow the rest of the games problems. In the words of The Rageaholic, "it's impossible to shake the feeling of taking one step forward and three steps back while playing Thief: the Dark Project. Lucky for Thief then that the one step was so mother ♥♥♥♥ing monumental." It's the result of a dangerous experiment that got lucky and I can't wait to play Thief 2: the Metal Age\n9/10","June 18, 2013","true","34.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Use sound(speed of movement, surface you move on determine how much noise you make) and shadow(light meter tells you how hidden you are in that regard) to sneak. Everything around you is there to reveal and/or find and kill you. Awesome Steampunk(some modern machines in otherwise medieval setting) atmosphere and world-building. Few but incredible gadgets, like a rope arrow and flashbangs. Tense and challenging. Solid story, yet non-linear game-play, well-balanced. Exploration of themes of the disciplined, science-driven and controlled versus the chaotic, natural and unpredictable. Addictive.\n\nCons: Survival horror elements are out of place, though fun. Graphics weren't even good when it came out.\n\nMy recommendation: Into stealth? Play this.

I am currently almost 14 hrs into the campaign so I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of the game as of right now to give a recommendation. I will list pro's and cons as follows.\n\nPro's: The sound design is wonderful literally some of the best stuff I have heard even by todays standards. The gameplay is always fueled by player agency, not a single point during this campaign does the game spoon feed you with needless cutscenes or take away your control. YOU ARE Garrett and Garrett is YOU. The level design is spectacular as well, this is the first time I've played an older game where I don't feel like I really need a map. You have one, it serves its purpose but as long as you have a good sense of direction you'll hardly ever need it. Plus it is just fun sneaking around stealing random stuff you see.\n\nCons: There aren't many cons I can think of but maybe one I could list is some of the Gold specific missions aren't as good as the non Gold ones. However, that doesn't mean they are terrible because the game is still amazing Gold or not. Another con may be the fact that Steam has done a poor job at getting this ready to play as soon as you purchase it. Would be nice if the Tfix patch was just bundled with the purchase because at this point I can't see anyone playing this without it.\n\nScore & further comments: I personally feel this game lives up to every single praise it has gotten and I can't wait to play Thief 2 and Deadly Shadows, I give the game "Must Buy" rating. I have always heard so many things about this series and I have played some of this game and the others but I always stopped very quickly. It wasn't until just recently that I decided to play through them all and I have to say I'm glad I made this decision.","January 18","true","24.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Well, I found out that I was worthy of this challenging experience and this was one of the best play throughs I have ever managed to accomplish, even after all of quick loads/saves, deaths, mistakes, and retries. Thief Gold is an amazing Stealth game that allows the player to take control of the most beautifully created protagonist, Garret the Master Thief, as he slips in and out of the shadows to knockout his enemies, steal a bunch of pricy loot in gain for personal adavantages, pickpocket enemies for quick access to locked doors: truly a master of it all really.\n\nThief Gold introduces a new sort of gameplay style, one where you have to think about every action that you perform, it can be fluid if done properly, but if one were to mess up  (i.e. failed attempt to knock out a guard) all hell can break lose. Every action is yours to think about, where you want to go, how you want to get there, who do you need to knockout in order to get there, etc. etc. In order to be a Master Thief one must think like a Master Thief, use your wits to your advantage, stay in the shadows as much as possible and dont forget to quick save whenever you feel the need necessary. Can't seem to figure out how to obtain all of the objectives or find the right way to go, then just restart the mission, there is NO PENALTY in doing so, there is only progression and sometimes restarting will only freshen your mind and will help you accomplish the mission with ease. So please do yourself a favor and pleaseeeeee please please try this amazing stealth game out, you WILL NOT be disappointed with it.\n\n10/10 would bang again.

The levels are labyrinthine and ingenious.  Some individual levels in this (The Sword, to name just one) are some of the most interesting I've ever played.  Likewise, there are no quest markers and you are usually only given a crudely drawn map (if even that) to find your way around, which is a refreshing change of pace compared to newer games.  The result is that while this is billed as a "stealth" game (and it definitely is) I'd say the biggest element of gameplay is navigating your way around huge levels and solving various puzzles.  This could very well suck, but luckily the levels themselves are well designed enough to keep things interesting.\n\nUnfortunately the game stumbles somewhat (and begins to show its age) when you run into the combat segments.  I'm still not entirely sure why the designers thought this game needed zombies as it works perfectly fine as just a stealth/exploration game.  But luckily this is (mostly) not enough to ruin a great game.\n","August 18, 2012","true","26.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's probably not for everyone so I would say, you will either love this game a lot, or you will hate it.  Personally I play the first 2 in the series at least once a year, since they came out -  they stand the test of time in a way few other games can.\nPlease do not confuse it with the EIDOS game "Thief" of 2013, i could not make it 10 minutes into that one-already two developer firms have tried to recapture these first two, and flat out failed.  There's a reason, because the look, feel, and gameplay of these two games are probably impossible to copy.  Anyway, this game is one of the best ever and classic games of the early 2000's.  I still replay this game once a year.  It plays just fine on Win 7, no issues whatsoever, with the Steam version, and so does thief 2 the metal age.\n\nThief gold and thief 2 immerse you into a sort of Medieval theme world, the emphasis is not shoot em up it is stealth, sneaking around in the shadows, dowsing torches and knocking out guards so you can achieve your objectives.  Thesse objectives include all sorts of missions not just thievery, although you of course do plenty of that on the way too. You are in a weird world, that gets introduced to you in small steps fortunately, populated by mechanists (they worship the machine), keepers (of knowledge), weird creatures of all kinds, but you get gently dropped into it bit by bit so it doesn't seem bizarre to you.  Your weapons are limited and you  use them in clever ways=sword, blackjack, arrows, water arrows (for dousing torches and cleanign up blood) fire arrows (these do impressive damage and blow up the "head cameras" in thief 2).  There are no guns of any kind in this game but it just makes for a more fun challenge.\n\nThere are no cheats except, if you want to skip to the next level, hit these keys:  ctrl  +alt +shift + end.  I forget if you have to hold them all down at once?  Also if you want to start a level with all the money, like you  might want to do with "First national Bank" in THIEF 2, you can download save games and you can start with all the money so you can buy all the tools and weapons you can possibly have.","October 12, 2014","true","15.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/recommended/211600/","Brotmeister","Hans Brotmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/","352 products in account","Thief: The Dark Project is the first game of the Thief series and basically the mother of first person stealth games. The gold version on Steam is the base game plus the expansion levels. This review contains minor spoilers but they are kept at the absolute minimum.\n\nGarrett is a street child who survived by stealing. One day he gets caught by one member of a secret organization called the Keepers. The man, noticing Garrett's natural talent offers him the opportunity to join the Keepers instead of calling the city watch. Garrett agrees to join the Keepers and undergoes several years of training in covert operations. But eventually he grows tired of the Keepers who are only about keeping secrets and reciting prophecies, so he decides to leave to live by himself again. The Keepers are not keen of his decision but let him go. Garrett wants nothing more than not getting involved with other people's problems and eventually getting enough money for him to quit stealing altogether. However, things don't go as planned. Eventually Garrett gets involved with the wrong people and finds himself within a major conflict that he cannot ignore any more.\n\nThief's setting is a weird but interesting mix of middle ages, fantasy and industrialization. Due to not knowing a better word for it I'd call it fantasypunk. While swords and bows are common weapons electric lights and sophisticated machinery are often seen. Also does magic exist as well as undead and other monsters. The city is controlled by an extremely wealthy elite on one hand and a religious group called the Hammerites on the other. The Hammerites believe in absolute technological progress and also have a zero-tolerance policy against all criminals and non-believers. They are responsible for most of the technological wonders of the city. They have so much influence that they even run their own prisons. The Pagans, the other major religion in the city, have nearly no influence any more. If they are caught by the Hammerites they are likely to be executed since their beliefs are the polar opposite of the Hammerite doctrine.  They believe that humanity is already too advanced and needs to embrace nature again.\n\nGarrett is neither a fighter nor is he able to cast magic spells. He is however extremely good at hiding in the dark and sneaking past people without getting noticed. He also is able to use some gadgets to aid him the most important ones being his arrows. In addition to his sword and his blackjack Garrett is carrying a bow for which he possesses various arrow types. The ability to use those arrows might actually be minor magic but that isn't clarified anywhere. Garrett can for example use water arrows to extinguish light sources from a safe distance. He also has rope arrows which can be shot into any wooden surface and provide a rope to climb up. Garrett also has access to noisemaker arrows come in very handy if he wants to distract enemies from his current hiding spot. Even though Garrett is able to kill with his sword or his broadhead arrows stealth is highly emphasized in Thief. On the highest difficulty setting it is not even allowed to kill any person. Killing someone always makes some noise unlike knocking them unconscious or avoiding them altogether. Even a one on one fight is dangerous for Garrett since his fighting skills are not comparable to those of the guards. If you knock somebody unconscious it is highly advised to hide the body somewhere in the dark so people don't find it. In addition to stealth the gameplay naturally revolves around stealing things. In most missions you have one main object to  steal and many other valuables that you can sell for cash after the mission to get more equipment or hot tips that may help with that next mission.\n\nThe level design focuses on big, sprawling and open levels. Most of the time there are several paths to approach your target. It is always beneficial to search every corner because you might find valuables, documents or even secret doors. The levels look and feel like actualy places, not just like a path for the player to walk. The game's sound design is top notch and still cannot be matched by many modern games. The graphics are obviously a little dated but there is a community patch that not only makes everything look a little crispier but also fixes all compatibility issues with widescreen monitors and multicore processors.\n\nThief features a quite unusual approach on difficulty settings. A higher difficulty does not make the enemies stronger and also does not place more enemies in the level. Instead it just adds more mission objectives. On the lowest difficulty it is often enough to just get your main target. On the highest setting it is not enough to just put the treasure in your pockets. You also need to get out afterwards. In addition to that there are more objectives like finding more special items or stealing a certain amount in gold value. There are many parts of the game that you can only experience on the highest difficulty setting, therefore I recommend playing it on that.\n\nThief: The Dark Project is still one of the best and most atmospheric stealth games out there and I think everybody who is in the least interested in stealth games, games that are heavy on atmosphere or games with good level design should give it a try.\n\nMore reviews here\n\nFor making Thief run on modern systems, use the TFix Patch.","August 18, 2014","true","62.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

All this being said it is still an awesome game, you may just need patience if you wish to play it or you may rage quit. There is none no point running around hacking and slashing at anything that moves, thats just a quick way to die, not to mention certians enemies wont die by your sword, you may have to use special weapons that you can only have active for 30 seconds.\n\nThe graphics in this game are what you may expect from a first person game made in the late 90's, some of the animations are a little awkward (but also kind of funny); particularly when a zombie is on the floor and then stands up in one single movement like a drawer bridge being closed realy fast.\n\nIn terms of gameplay there are about 15 different missions that will take you somwhere in the area of 25 to 30 hours to finish in their entirety with a rather extensive choice of inventory items that will help you in different ways on different missions, one example being you can put out tourches with the water arrows to improve your shadow cover and move around guards without being seen.\n\nThe replay value of this game is quite low, unless you start on the lowest difficulty, then you could move your way up to higher difficulties and with the higher difficulties you will receive additional mission objectives.\n\nMy Tips:\n\n1.If you are having trouble with cutscenes not playing then change the permissions of the thief exe to run as administrator. This has worked for me on Windows 7 and Windows 10.\n\n2.Save Regularly, this game does not autosave and if you have been sneaking arounf for say 30mins and then you die you will have to go all the way back to your most recent save.\n\n3. Pay attention to the light bar when trying to avoid detection, some areas will look nice and dark for hiding away but when you step into said area; your visibility may as not be well hidden as you hoped.\n\nAll in all i do recommend this game, but if sneaking around and potentially dying alot is not somthing you enjoy in a game; then this game may not be for you.\n","August 16, 2015","true","29.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has a lot of stealth missions but it also has a lot of "tomb raiding" missions that don't favor sneaking. It's not a deal breaker and the game is still really good, but these missions are by far my least favourite and can get really boring really fast.

Doing steampunk before steampunk was cool, it throws you into this marvellous Victorian styled world of magic and technology as a character you can't help but love; Garrett.\n\nAs Garrett, you will visit mansions, underground tombs, ruins and abandoned sections of The City, risking life and limb for that final prize; unimaginable wealth.\n\nThe gameplay is solid and rewarding. Your 'Light Gem' will tell you how visible you are at any given time. Hide in the shadows and sneak past at the right time to avoid your enemies... if you want. You could kill them or knock them unconscious but that's your choice to make. Its perfectly possible to complete this game without killing or knocking anybody or anything unconscious.\n\nThe story is also very well written however the main story doesn't start until a few levels into the game so you get time to take in the world around you and see a tiny bit of it, time to master the controls and learn how to play.\n\nSmall story segments are given to you here and there that may tell you things you need to learn about your objective or the environment; two guards having a conversation, a dropped scroll or book on a bedside table. Exploration of the open-ended levels is rewarded either with loot to steal or with tiny story segments.\n\nSpeaking of loot and gear, you'll need to get exploring and collect it. The more loot you collect in one level, the more money you will have to spend on gear for the next. Gear such as Water Arrows to put out torches, Rope Arrows to climb or to find alternate entries into buildings, Flash Bombs to temporarily blind pursuers, Moss Arrows to silence your footsteps over loud surfaces or Noisemaker Arrows for a quick distraction.\n\nThe game does have it's flaws; the sometimes confusing level design can make it hard to navigate some levels, a small amount of voice-acting isn't that great, the slight overuse of the undead in places and the character models haven't aged very well but the art design, atmosphere and storytelling still hold up today as some of the best ever encountered in a game.\n\nMods are out there to update the graphics and textures if you want to use them. The game is very mod friendly and there are plenty of user-made fan missions out there to keep your inner taffer happy for a long time. You can also find help on setting up the game on your PC here:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113158282\nIt may be a little rough around the edges but it changed the way I look at games forever and not many games do that.

Each building feels like it was designed to serve a real purpose, not just to be a linear game level. The backstory is deep and immersive and the motivations behind the steampunk-versus-magic factions are morally complex.\n\nOne of the all-time great classics. Well worth a purchase.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the engine hasn't aged well. Even with the recent patches, this game requires a bit of tweaking before it runs without mouse lag at the correct speed in widescreen mode.

Aside from a few annoyances (there are far too many zombie/spider filled levels, which negates the use of stealth entirely), this is still an incredibly rewarding and polished experience.  Expect to be challenged, of course.  Death can come very quickly if you don't have any patience, and this is late 90s level design at it's most prevalent so expect to get lost a few times in the surprisingly large maps when you start.  There is no hand-holding here.  On a final note, I find the atmosphere in these early Thief games nothing short of stunning, and certain sections are pretty damn chilling to play through, thanks in part to the sound design.\n\nSo for taff's sake, get on the case and play a part of videogame history already.","March 2, 2014","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The series is credited with being one of the most influential upon the stealth game genre, and rightly so.\n\nUnlike most first person games, Thief doesn't give you powerful weapons or superhuman abilities. You feel vulnerable. Seeing a guard frightens you; your heart skips a beat when you hear footsteps behind a closed door. And this tension - the knowledge that making a mistake can alert others to your presence or even get you killed - is precisely the appeal of the game. Don't think you can just overpower the guards and carry on, either. You may be able to kill one guard without dying, but you'll probably take a lot of damage in the process, and there's no health regeneration. But, good lord - pulling off a successful heist without being detected is so. damn. satisfying.\n\nThe level design is fantastic. The environments range from city streets to ancient ruins to haunted chapels to demonic realms. Seriously. And most levels are very large, so you won't be left hungry for places to explore. You don't have a compass, marker or radar to help you navigate, so you will have to rely on a map and your ordination skills. Some may disagree with me, but I feel this adds immersion that is absent from most modern titles. You need to look around and "get a feel" for an area - as you would in the real world when going somewhere for the first time. Learning the patrol routes of guards is vital to avoiding them, and you need to factor in environmental elements such as lighting, noisy floors, obstacles, water and more when planning your route.\n\nTo survive this harsh world, you have a wide variety of tools at your disposal (think of a larcenous form of Link, only better). You have a blackjack to knock enemies out without killing them, and a short sword for... well, you can guess. Lockpicks can be used to, err, pick locks, but the process takes time - time in which a guard may happen upon your cloaked figure hunched over the chest or door handle. The bow can shoot arrows of which there are many different types: broadheads for shooting things in the head, water arrows for extinguishing fire, rope arrows that function like a grappling hook for reaching high areas...\n\nThere are few criticisms I can make of this game. The graphics are dated, so if that really bothers you then you may wish to pass up on this title. I personally have no issue with this. Sometimes the player character (Garrett) can have difficulty traversing poor terrain geometry, with results that are more irritating than entertaining. Some game mechanics are inconsistent and may cause confusion for new players if they don't go out of their way to learn them thoroughly. For instance, fire and gas arrows travel in a straight line or some reason, whereas all other arrows follow a parabolic trajectory (affected by gravity). That said, none of these spoiled the experience for me - they were just occasionally a little annoying. And lastly, some levels involve the undead (yes, there are zombies...), which cannot be killed like normal guards. If you are not prepared to just run from your enemies, then these levels can become walls until you are skilled or lucky enough to overpower them. I'm just saying - this is a game about sneaking, not killing.\n\nTo summarise, Thief is an excellent introduction to the stealth game genre (if you can overlook the dated graphics). Its mechanics are well-balanced and interesting, and its open level design allows you to approach a problem in many different ways. There are plenty of secrets to find, and the varied environments are always refreshing. The lack of information in the form of objective markers or a radar forces the player to pay attention - listening is as important as, if not more than, looking - and with this comes incredible immersion. Or course, some players may be put off by this if they lack the patience to plan their approach to a situation, and sneaking past hordes of the undead isn't as fun as it sounds. But if you can step back from modern action games, if you can try different things when your attempts to sneak past enemies keeps failing, then you will find this game immensely enjoyable (and get a real adrenaline kick when things work out perfectly!) Thief is a game of sneaking and planning, and if you can do these then you find much enjoyment.","March 8, 2014","true","75.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So many other games until then were focused on killing as many enemies on the screen as fast as you could, but Thief was novel because it was focused on remaining invisible, undetected, and most importantly, non-lethal.\n\nI honestly have yet to play any other stealth game that has dedicated the same kind of attention to stealth mechanics as Thief 1 and 2 have. This game takes into account how fast Garrett is going, what material he is walking on, whether something wrong has been noticed, how illuminated you are, what weapon you have out, whether you are crouched or upright, and what direction you are attacking from, in terms of whether a guard or horrifying creature will notice you, and whether your blackjack's hit will be effective.\n\nThe amount of tools you must utilize is also quite astounding, ranging from at least five different types of arrows, your lockpicks, your potions, your weapons, and of course, your wits.\n\nThe sound for the game is absolute pure euphoria; a simple review alone doesnt really do it justice. You really need to hear to believe, and not just through a YouTube Let's Play, but by actually playing the game and putting on a good pair of earbuds or headphones.\n\nThis game has more tense nervewracking gameplay in one hallway than many other "stealth" games have in an entire level or several levels.

Perhaps nostalgia is partially to blame for my love as I purchased the game when it was originally released as well as it's followup Thief 2: The Metal Age and Thief: Deadly Shadows. Thief introduced some of the most well known stealth mechanics still found today such as light/dark with indicators, leaning to avoid detection, smart AI that listen and search for you, and tools to incapacitate and confuse rather than kill your enemies. Add on top of this a three teired diffculty system that not only increases the number of enemies on the map, but also the objectives you must complete, and the AI's intelligence and ability to detect you and Thief shows us what a true stealth game can be if enough effort is put into design rather than art.","August 18, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only problems I encountered with the game is that its too confusing to get to somewhere, and also the first time I got it, it was poorly optimized, so I highly recommend if you are using an up-to-date PC, to download an unofficial patch which fixes some of the problems like cut scenes not working, bad resolutions and poor quality. But set aside all these problems, and you have a perfect stealth masterpiece.\n\nStick to the shadows at all costs!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

There are a lot of hurdles to overcome for your experience - The game must be patched to run. The cutscenes still won't display. The graphics are horrendous. The controls are awkward. The locations get a little too nonsensical. The gameplay demands a lots of quicksaves...... Do not expect to be amazed when you start playing. It won't be very fun right away.\nThat being said, it is a testament to just how fantastic this game is, that it can have all these drawbacks and still be a truly great game. Give it some time and a couple of missions in your reward will be, that somehow, without you realizing it, Thief started to sink into your bones.\n\nYou learn how to master the controls, and begin to feel deft at dodging from shadow to shadow. You end up feeling like you taught yourself, you actually learned during the course of the game, how to slink forward, dart out, and whisk away your prize like some kind of master. You creep around as alert as you can, and don't notice it directly, but the enormous levels, the twisting passages, the touches of detail, the remnants of notes left behind, and (most of all) the sounds of the world begin to revebrate and leave you a small piece of a large, strange world, full of secrets and powers beyond your understanding. You don't do it consciously, but you begin to fill in for the graphics. You begin to guess at the mysteries and stories of how these places came to be. There are times when the game environments and the game mechanics rudely interrupt your experience, but most of the time it is a perfect blend that draws out a far richer and more salient experience than most of the games I have ever played.\n\nI never played the two older Thief games before this year, and although I like exploration and stealth, those are my only two biases that might affect my opinion. I highly, HIGHLY, enjoyed it. The expectations I had for this game did not coincide with my actual experience, but it more than redeemed itself by far far exceeding my expectations in other regards. I had no idea ambiance could come through so strongly with such limitations in graphics, sound, AI, and clunky controls. I also hold great respect for it for respecting my intelligence. It did not hold my hand, nor was it devilishly difficult to figure out what to do. Yeah, I wandered around lost and unsure a lot, but there was nothing that was unenjoyable about doing that. The game encourages you to do so, and there is a lot to discover (and steal) while you unlock the greater picture of the mission.  I played slowly and patiently, but I missed a lot of content and could easily play it again for a new expierience. (and probably will)\n\nTo summarize:\nGameplay started awkwardly and unfun, but became solid once you are familiar with it.\nSound is not something I care about, but was used masterfully to make this game the excellent piece of work it is.\nGraphics are a pain, but the world starts to fill itself in with more than visuals before your mind.\nStoryline balances out to solid after averaging out the complaints and the compliments.\nThe age was a detriment, I won't understate that point.  Even taking that into account, I enjoyed it immesely despite having no history or nostagia-borne fondness it to smooth over my perception.\n\nI highly recommend this game, given that you are patient, don't care about action, do care about a game's background details, and have time to properly become involved in experiencing an entire mission at a time. You could not find a better game for stealth, exploration, atmosphere, memorableness and sheer uniqueness.","April 14, 2013","true","38.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am happy to see that it is now able to be incorporated into the Steam Library of games. To this day my daughter, who spent many hours on "dad's" lap watching TDP with her sippy cup, is still a fan of the Thief series. Obviously this game has a lot of memories, and also a lot of meaning; so I won't even try to be objective...\n\nThief Gold is not an enormously fast moving game, so if you are the type of player that wants to "knock 'em all dead" and hurry up and finish, I'd think you would dislike Thief Gold. It takes time. Waiting out guards, finding loot, and at times failing and dying. If you're not familiar with Thief Gold, you may want to save often.\n\nThe graphics are not bad for '98, and keep in mind that you don't fix up a '67 Thunderbird to look like the modern Mazda version of Thunderbird today. Thief Gold is a piece of gaming history. A landmark for patience and problem solving in the gaming world.

Glad I did and extremely happy that years later I was able to get it on Steam, and it being Thief Gold at that. I had followed all the games that came out after I had got the first one, but moving from overseas back to the states, they got lost :( so being able to have them available whenever through steam is nice. Only one I did not get was the newest Thief that came out not to long ago. Being an original fan of this series, the new one did not appeal to me personally.\n\nIt's a stealth/some what horror game, where you do your best to remain in the shadows and not be seen. At times you may get caught and have to fight, but the main goal is to get what you are looking for, get in wihtout being seeen, and then get out the without being noticed. Also collecting treasures and goodies along the way. The music fits the mood nicely, and depending on which one in the series you are playing or the level, you may come across some pretty weird, eerie stuff along with interesting steampunk style looking contraptions.\n\nOne of My favorite things in this game was the passages that are apart of the animated clips before and after the missions. Especially from the Woodsie Lord or the hammerites. Shows the weird but interesting creativity behind the makers of the game.\n\nI feel if you ever played this way back in the day, its worth having for nostalgia, or just because you liked it so much.\n\nFor those who have never played it, or played the new one to find out about the old ones, you might not like it so much. The graphics are rough and at times there might be glitching. Sometimes its funny glitches. On some missions I even ran through the end or goofed off with guards chasing me because the way the run or things they say looks hilarious.\n\nI'd suggest if you feel you might be interesting in this game, check on some play throughs of it that are available online first, to make sure it might be something you'll like.\n\n\n","December 17, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Virtuoso1/recommended/211600/","Virtuoso1","Virtuoso1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Virtuoso1/","63 products in account","If you are a younger fellow looking at this game and thinking, "I don't get it, why is this game talked about so often? It sucks!"  Let me explain a few things to you.  For the time this game was created, it was a masterpiece.  The reason this is such a well renowned game is because this was the first stealth game to give the player a first-person perspective and was also the first game to introduce light and sound as gameplay mechanics.  Thief set the benchmark for all first-person stealth games to come after it (similar to what Ocarina of Time did for action RPGs), which is why it will always be known as one of the best games of all time.\n\nSound design is great!! This game is best played with headphones. You can hear the heavy-footed guards walking on the other side of doors and you can distinguish between different surfaces which helps for determining where the guard is.  Sound echos through hallways as you would expect from these old, large, midievil buildings.  Some may complain that the guard's sensitivity to sound is unrealistic, but try to sneak around your house silently.  Steps are surprisingly hard to silence.\n\nLight design is spot on.  Emphasis is on dark corridors and although you think it may be rediculous that a guard can walk right by you when you are in a dark area and not see you, if you watch a guard walk into that same area, it is quite difficult to see them as well when they are dressed in shiny armor. The main character, Garret, is wearing all black, so it is no wonder they don't see you!  That being said, there are moments of super unrealistic AI responses, but these are not so often that you will be bashing your head against the wall at the stupidity.  Afterall, this game was made in the 90's.\n\nSword fighting mechanics are more realistic than most modern games.  It may be considered clunky by most, but you try swinging a massive sword!  I like that you have to aim where you are blocking rather than just holding the button to block every attack.\n\nNow, on to the poor aspects of the game.\n\nThe AI is inconsistent.  Sometimes they will be extremely sensitive to things they see and hear and other times they will be oblivious to the majority of these things.  You can be fighting an enemy at one end of the hall and the guard at the other end suspects nothing. If they find a dead body they look around for a little bit and then walk away as if nothing is wrong.  They also don't respond to doors seemingly magically opening and closing.\n\nOnce you pick up an object, you must throw it and cannot place it down carefully with no sound.\n\nAiming of the bow is also pretty accurate. Although the arrow soars through the air quite slowly, the difficulty in aiming makes it extremely satisfying to land a killing shot with the bow. Anyone who has dabbled in archery can appreciate the realism of this mechanic.  However, landing that killing blow is extremely difficult.  Guards can take 3-4 arrows to the body and still continue approaching you.\n\nThis game is a buy for anyone who has the patience for the issues that have become more apparent to us through time.  You should pick up this game if you want to appreciate the game for the time it was created rather than how it stacks up to modern stealth games.","November 4, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Making the cold, smokey thief setting shine through the chunky wall textures and styrofoam people creatures.

I didn't know the simple joy of extinguishing a torch and clubbing some guard unconscious before scrapering with an entire mansions worth of loot in my pocket.\n\nThief Gold despite it's age and need for a patch (which is easy to download from the looking glass studios Forums) is a stella experience. It is a well paced game with hints and clues to the story scattered through out this richly created world. The first missions get you to grips with the mechanics of the game with all the gadgets and weapons at your disposal.\n\nGarrett is a great playable character, always there to crack wise at certain people or situations to lighten the mood in those slightly stressful missions. In fact there are so many great characters, from the Blackjack fodder to the prisioners.\n\nWhat I will say is that there are some missions that feel more of a chore than others, especially those concerning the walking dead. These unkillable things were the bane of my play through. It did during those missions become more of a hack and slash type game, despite Garretts terrible combat ability.\n\nOverall though I would highly recomend Thief Gold as a gateway stealth game.

Garret is the perfect and original thief archetype: Ganancious, egocentric, quick-witted and very, very skilled. Trained by the Keepers, Garret was meant to be an agent for the organization and help to keep order in the city through subterfuge, but he eventually decides that his skills are best employed to steal from others and make a good living out of it. Even though all that Garret ever wanted was to alleviate the rich from their burdens of gold and gems, he finds himself forced to be much more than that when a chain of events place himself at the eye of the storm. The struggle between Order, represented by the Builder, and Chaos, represented by the Trickster, is about to reach its pinnacle and Garret will be right in the middle of it all.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much flawless. Changing the keymapping to your liking is probably a must, since some controls are not as intuitive for not following modern patterns. Once you're accustomed to it, you'll soon find yourself immersed in the single most stealth-driven game that ever was and, hell, probably ever will be. Don't you ♥♥♥♥ing dare using your sword on this game unless there's a immediate threath to your life. Thiefs like Garret never kill and are never seen. If you play the game on expert (which is exactly how the game should always be played), you'll be required to see and do everything without ever killing a human being. That is stealth right there. Walk in the hard wood instead of the carpet and your steps will alert guards. Remain in the shadows with your sword out and the blade will shine and give you away. Shoot an arrow off its target and everyone will hear it hitting the wall. This is how stealth should be done, no quick running around no-scoping teleports and instant magic kills (I'm looking at you, Dishonored). All you have in your inventory are some lockpicks, a blackjack and a few different arrow types, like rope arrows for reaching hard-to-get places or water arrows for squishing out torches. That being said, you should probably know that there will be combat, since there are supernatural creatures walking the world and some of them are very, very violent. This is the reason you carry a sword around.\n\nGraphics are a little outdated, especially on the resolution support department, but mods can easily fix that. All in all, with a little setup time and a little getting used to, you'll be playing the game like a pro and enjoying every second of it one or two hours after buying it, trust me.\n\nGameplay - 10/10\nSoundtrack - 7/10\nGraphics - 4/10\nContent - 8/10\nChallenge Level - 9/10\nReplayability - 6/10","August 17, 2015","true","28.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's a fact, but even after all these years that brief experience with this game stuck with me. Just from what little I experienced back then I quickly realized that Thief was far more engrossing and complex then most games at the time of its release and now that I've purchased it and finally played through most of the game up to the time of writing this review, my mind has truly and completely been blown by its level of depth.\n\nThe stealth tactics you can make use of, such as water arrows for putting out torches and fires, moss arrows to muffle the noise you make as you slowly walk/crouch towards unsuspecting enemies, rope arrows to more quickly complete objectives or work your way around a tight situation, hiding bodies, etc. all make this an unforgettable experience.\n\nThe level designs are pretty complex and extremely atmospheric and there are also some fairly challenging environmental puzzles to solve at times too. Even the voice acting and ambience totally sets the mood for your quest for loot and other more notable goodies as you complete objectives.  Oh yeah, and then there's the strong horror element (some of the ambience plays a role here too, as it perfectly sets the mood for those creepier moments) relating to some of the objects you acquire in the game and enemies such as zombies, spiders (including giant ones), skeletons (well, at least 'a' skeleton that tried to kill me at one point) and also demonic and ghostly-enemies.\n\nThief is one of the better gaming experiences from an earlier generation. Even after all these years, it still stands out in the crowd and remains one of the best stealth experiences you'll ever have in a game, bar none!\n\nUPDATE (8/8/15): Just beat the game, and if I've learned anything from the many trials and tribulations I faced furing my quest (besides how to properly steal things while being all stealthy and whatnot) it's that Constantine is a major ♥♥♥♥♥♥!","August 7, 2015","true","22.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is the only game that has really balanced stealth with good combat if you get yourself in a jam.\n\nThe game is really old though, so the graphics might take some getting use to, it reminds me of when video games were introduced depth and perception and not a 2D side scroller. The controls are messed up like no other in here though, and-from what I can see- there is no way to change it. It's not that they are stiff or stuff like that, it's just they placed the commands in the most awkward postions on the keyboard.\n\nI've never really understood the story because, as old as this game is, it just throws you into a level and expects you to know what's going on so when something happens I kind of misunderstand and it takes me a minute to realize what just happened. To understand the story you mostly have to read what you are going to do on the current mission, and why.\n\nBut what makes up for it is the gameplay and the stealth in this game. Few games today can actually have good stealth and still manage the game with decent combat if you gor yourself in a pickle, Thief puts that right on the mark if you have to run and hide, you can do it. If you need to fight your way out, you can do it.\n\nOverall score: 80/100","August 8, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played it back when it it first came out around when I was 5 or 6 (1998-1999) and even when I go back I am surprised by how advanded the software is on such an old game. The second one is amazing as well. The third one, Deadly Shadows, .... ehh give or take, I mean it is a Thief game and if you care for story get it, I loved it regardless of it's somewhat shoddy gameplay. The newest one, the reboot (forth game), is pretty good as well. Although I will admit it has it's downfalls like being too close in stealth systems to Dishonored, and having a slide system (almost Dishonored teleport system with limitations), and it is still an amazing game, but doesn't provide the same backstory for Garrett. In the old games (this one in particular) there was a reason Garrett was a thief and also how he became a master thief, but in the reboot it is lost.\n\nIf you played the new one and are curious to how to old games stack up BUY IT! If you never played any of them but love stealth games BUY IT! If you have have never played a Thief game and have never played a stealth game or are not normally interested in stealth games BUT IT! I promise for $7 you will not be disappointed. This game is worth much more than that due to quality, but for as little as it costs you will never feel guilty you bought it.\n\nI will admit, the graphics quality is subpar in comparison to today's video games, but if graphics quality means little to you and you care more for gameplay and story quality BUY THIS GAME!","July 2, 2015","true","75.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is kind of the opposite.  I'm sure Thief is a great game, but it has the misfortune of being compared to Dishonored nowadays, which is similar in terms of gameplay with the added benefits of being faster-paced and nicer to look at.  Yes, Blink breaks the game in half despite being a core mechanic, but breaking a game in half is, in my opinion, the most fun you can have with a game.  But back to Thief again:  I don't know if I can say for sure that this has necessarily aged poorly, since I've played a number of games with similarly obtuse lean-forward-button mechanics, but rather that these games (DX and SS2 are the first to come to mind) haven't necessarily been improved upon while it seems to me that Thief actually has.\n\nSo what merits does it have?  The setting is unique and I wish I could have gotten more into it.  Garrett seems really cool and I might pick up TDS just to see what these parts of the series have to offer.  But this feels to me like I'm playing a fossil.\n\nOf course, if you can get over that hurdle, I'm sure there is something great to be found here.

Anywhere I didn't see games devoted to theft with such bright plot where are bound paganism, a brotherhood award, the greedy nobility yet, to indulge and simple street guys who left the main hero of game - Garret. The most important quality in game, however I think and for other representatives of troublemakers too. As fine it is realized here: it is necessary to move slowly, on silent surfaces, for example a grass, boards or carpets, thus to look for places with a dense shadow and if it isn't present that to nestle on walls, or to squat round the corner.\n\nThe GUARDS are CLUMSY: The guard can't call the worthy opponent of the thief. These idlers are too careless, clumsy and silly. Even if they will hear you, first can think that it mice, either a fireplace, or a copper peep. In the dark they are blind at all so it is possible to make surely roundabout maneuvers for a back of the victim. In a situation when the policeman will notice you, he of course won't run to give the alarm, and will go to act heroically to punish the thief, in this case we will be able always to give it the worthy answer, behind Garret's shoulders always a huge arsenal from arrows (simple, water, with a rope, gas, fiery), a sword, a bludgeon, potions of life, water breath, a bomb and of course a compass.\n\nI absolutely accurately see an appeal of developers from Looking Glass Studios to decrease in violence in game and in life. Game encourages theft, not a robbery and murders. At the difficult levels of game, murder are forbidden at all and game overo'm are punished. Mirnyi, innocent inhabitants and servants, it is so easy to calm with one blow bludgeons, as well as guards. With the zombie conversation short, is evil spirits and the evil, and it is necessary to fight against it!\nWe will sum up the results: Theft it not such the big evil as within game and life, it was and will be always, only in that as it to call a question, and under what look a tax. A banal example it is possible to give the taxation. Let the state steal from us in a type of tax and we will steal gold candlesticks from rich lords of the game Thief.\n\nAll series of games is excellent is: Thief, Thief 2, Thief: Deadly Shadows.

Wasn't a deal breaker though, I just watched them on YouTube.\n\nThis game is great with stealth and the avenues you can take to complete a level.  You can rob a guard to get the key to a room.  You can use your rope arrow to climb up past a wall to get to another area that unlocks that room.  You can eliminate the guard, although a fight with the guard is not advised.  They can hit hard, as they should.  This is a game about stealth, not to fight with every guard you come across.\n\nParts of this game do get dull when playing, like exploring large caverns with zombies walking around.  You can sneak past them but they aren't that much of a challange compared to sneaking past guards and stealing items.\n\nIf you are big into stealth games, I would highly recommend this game.

Only playing the occasional MMO or whatever my friends were playing.  I bought an Xbox One soon after it was released.  And the first game I bought for it was Thief.  A reboot of a series I had never played due to never having a PC of my own, but had heard of it numerous times.  I played the livng crap out of it and had a great time.  But I was curious as to why what I thought (and still think) was a stellar game recieved constant criticism and was panned by fans of the original Thief.\n\nAbout a year later, I finally got around to buying my own PC.  And I thought "What's a classic game I haven't been able to play yet?  Oh, yeah!  Thief!"  Without hesitation, I bought it and started it up.  And boy, did it not disappoint.  Excellent atmosphere, sprawling levels with excellent visual and sound design, tight controls, polished gameplay mechanics, and to top it all off, and intriguing story.  I also recommend playing it on hard, but only if you're willing to spend three hours on one level.\n\nNo waypoints, no walkthroughs, no regenerating health, no enemies that give up after ten seconds of searching...  This is a stealth game for only a true Thief.  And I'm loving every second of it.","May 6, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The light-based stealth here was very advanced for its time, and the fantastic art style backs it up well. Several difficulty options add objectives for each level. Options, in terms of equipment and infiltration, are largely left up to the player. However, it falters a bit in several levels, where it seems to play in a far more linear fashion. In these instances, the stealth mechanics, varied arsenal, and occasionally helpful maps feel like an afterthought.\nThe biggest problems are the bugs. Sloppy hit detection, cutscenes that don't play (which often contain valuable pointers), unpredictable AI, and disappearing objects sometimes make it a chore to play. However, the good stealth and area depth more than make up for it.","May 8, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Use darker areas to your advantage to sneak by enemies, aided with a wide arsenal of arrows and your trusty club, blackjack. The light crystal, unlike other similar objects in other stealth games, shows you the degree of how hidden you are, rather than show you if you're visible or not.\n+ Large, non-linear level design.\n+ Difficulty. Prepared for a challenge? Expert will test you if you're a professional thief. No killing, more loot.\n+ Your state of mind after listening to hammerites whistling that DAMNED tune for hours.\n+ Stephen Russell's voice as Garrett.\n\nNegatives:\n- Outdated looks. This can be fixed to some degree with graphical mods.\n- Large level design can get you stuck at times.\n- New players could find the controls to be uncomfortable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewidgets/recommended/211600/","thewidgets","Cat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewidgets/","209 products in account","I came to Thief late.  As much as it's praised, and that praise is well deserved... it does suffer from a bad control scheme and some of the problems of retro games.  You should rebind your keys immediately, because you KNOW your hand is going to be reaching for WASD.  This is an easy fix, but it does need to be done right from the onset.  But the bigger problem is that the physics have some serious issues.  They were standard, normal issues for all games of the time.  Younger people who can't remember gaming in the 90's, are likely to get severely frustrated with these issues.  I get frustrated with them MYSELF.  It shouldn't take six tries to jump over a one-foot ledge, but it often does.  You shouldn't fall to your death because of the lack of the game's responsiveness, or because your character's toe was in the wrong place and prevented you from getting up on the ledge, but you do.  We used to take these things in stride because it was the best thing we had.  So if you're less than 25, new to gaming, or frustrate easily, you should probably stick to modern games.  But if you're 25+, or if you can take your lumps with old game mechanics issues (die horribly a hundred times, get ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and come back to it later when you've cooled off, and do it on the first try... you know that's how it goes every single time) you'll love this.  The story and narration are great.  I can't wait to go through the whole series!  You do have to keep in mind that this is from 1998, but I would still recommend this to anyone.  Even if you don't enjoy the gameplay, this is one of those games you hear about constantly, and having first hand experience of a classic game is the best thing.  It's like seeing Casablanca, or playing the Ocarina of Time, for a more game-centric comparison.  When you're looking at its flaws, view it critically, like an old horror movie with cheesy effects.  Let it sit heavily on your mind that it was the best they could do at the time, and don't judge it against modern game standards.  Judge it instead, on the merits it had, compared to other games at the time.  By that standard, this game's amazing.","August 6, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has a very dark and eerie atmosphere to it. I like it's old-school feel, too. I would like if the game would let you play using an Xbox controller, but it seems it doesn't support it fully.\n\nRecommended if you like stealth, going around stealing things and knocking out gards, as the game's title obviously implies.","February 7, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

I'll start with the good. It is surprising that a game from the 90's was soo deep with gameplay. There is hiding in shadows, different sounds on different surfaces, big levels, and hiding bodies. Quite complicated and intricate which is nice for an older game. It is fun playing the original game that inspired sneaking around as a new genre. Then there are the problems. With the different surfaces, is is poorly implimented. If you walk on tile or wood or other things, you automatically make a sound, which is unrealistic. While it would make more sound than carpet, you can still be silent on tile. I would use the walk button and slowly inch out on tile while crouched, which in real life would be silent. But since I stepped on tile it automatically alerts the guard the instant my foot touches it. It  is poorly done and not realistic. Sometimes it wont make any sound but the guard will get alerted, which can be confusing.","November 9, 2012","true","30.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/211600/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","Continuing along with some older games and series that I've wanted to play for years, I now play the original Thief game (without having played any of the others, so I am going in order) after just playing System Shock 2, which I loved. Unfortunately, I did not love Thief, nor did I really like it, though I came in with high hopes as I knew that the same developers made System Shock 2.\n\nFirstly, I don't mean that the game is inherently bad in many ways. In fact, the majority of the game's design aspects are actually very well done, except for one, which killed the game for me: the level design. Before I get there though, I will first go through everything else I thought about the game, on the positive side:\n\n+ The story of the game was very interesting, even just starting with the first cinematic, which got me excited about the game actually going somewhere.\n+ Garrett is a very likable character and had his own unique attitude, unlike a good amount of protagonists (e.g., the one in System Shock 2 had no character to himself).\n+ The graphics of the game were decent and didn't bother me, though some things were badly distorted and the mansion in The Sword was ugly.\n+ The mechanical design of the game is great. I love all of the different items you can use, including intriguing things like the Moss Arrows. The fact that game properly organizes the stealth depending on the material you are walking upon is good, as some current games don't do such a thing. Simple things like directional combat when swinging the sword is good, which again most games don't do nowadays. And changing the difficulty and indirectly changing the objectives of levels is a great idea to add replayability, extending the levels.\n\nBut sadly, none of the above things helped me get over the level design, which was abysmal. The first level was a generic mansion with nothing special about it, but I was like "Okay, just a way to get you into the stealth." The second level was just as generic, as I didn't find the zombies or caves interesting, and the prison was boring. The third level started making me really dislike the design.\n\nAt that point, I realized that the levels were mostly generic, giant mazes. Labyrinths, basically! Really, the third level was "unrealistic" in terms of size and really killed my mood. You're walking through the same-looking caves and crypts over and over, in circles. Even though I got through eventually, it was just random waddling and being bored. Most of the levels turned out to be this way. The levels are generally split up into different areas, but all of the rooms or places in a given area usually look the exact same in design. The only levels I ended up enjoying even remotely were the Haunted Cathedral and Strange Bedfellows because of atmosphere.\n\nI enjoy stealth games greatly, and I didn't get impatient with the levels because you should take things slow. I'm fine creeping around as needed in such a game. I just got terribly bored and annoyed because most places took forever to find out how to actually get around simply because they were artificial expanses that had no character to them. Occasionally finding notes added some of that, but for the most part, it was all just so boring finding your way through. I know some people will ask if I was bored because I wandered around repeatedly knocking people out, but that was not the case. I was fine with the gameplay and I tried ghosting some levels anyway. It is just the design and layouts that I disliked and ruined everything for me.\n\nI mean really, they are just expanses of nothingness... the crypts, the thieves guild, the mansion in The Sword, so on. I loved System Shock 2, and I love other stealth games like the Deus Ex, Metal Gear Solid, and Hitman series, and Dishonored as the most recent example, in which I went through the entire first playthrough not hurting anybody or being seen. But this game's world design made it so boring to play, even though I really was interested (and still am) with the story.\n\nAnd you have the exact opposite with the last level in terms of approach. You go from incredibly open places to the most linear level ever... and just as boring. Fighting the enemies didn't interest me anymore at this point, and in fact, I ended up beating the level in less than 8 minutes (not counting waiting for the ritual at the end) because I simply just jumped along the way, evading all enemies. The only reason it even took that long was because of the water stream.\n\nBut after the final level, the final cutscene was still very interesting... So I'm hopeful that the next games get better in their levels. I guess I will find out.","February 13, 2015","false","8.6"," 20 of 51 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","20","51","0","4"

At least I had to (playing on AZERTY keyboard). They were utterly broken when I first tried them . Note the game does not support controllers.\nBe aware that Thief Gold is not a "turnkey game" in this regard.\n\nBack to the game itself, now.\nI must say I was impressed by all the stealth features Thief had right back in 1998. It's hard to deny the game had a MAJOR impact on gaming. Also, it's not that ugly, and the story and voice acting are pretty decent.\nHOWEVER, I couldn't bring myself to love it. Not even like it. I found it really tedious to play, and the biggest flaw in my opinion is the fact that you have no real map of the levels, thus resulting in you getting lost for hours inside maze-like corridors and caves. If only I could orientate myself, I'm sure I would have finished the game, but I found it too much of a chore to stay interested.\n\nSo yeah. Great legacy, appealing game, but eventually too boring. If a mod is released to correct this, I swear I'll try it again.","December 2, 2015","false","5.2"," 2 of 16 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","16","0","0"

It's especially bad here since the combat system is so clunky and broken. Blocking with your sword only works when the game feels like it, and the hit detection is terrible. So combat should be avoided as much as possible. Sneaking up on a guard and knocking them out works most of the time, but other times they'll hear you even though you're moving slowly on carpet. Sometimes you'll get stuck in the middle of a well lit hallway and hear a guard coming that you can't possibly avoid.

Thief is ♥♥♥♥. Thats the truth it might have been good in the 90's but know it doesn't hold up for many reasons to numerous to name so here a few cons and pros of the game:\n\nCons\nGraphics: The graphics are old thats the best way to say it but to be honest graphics quality doesn't really bother me but i know a lot of people are quite into their graphics so thats why its here.\n\nMap: I have nothing wrong with map screens if they have some sort of sanity put in them but Garrett god bless him decided to draw them by hand badly so the fun of a non-linear world is ruined by having no way of navigating it.\n\nCombat mechanics: Unlike most stealth games nowadays where there is a focus on action over stealth which is good because it gives variety and change to the genre but what makes a stealth game great for me personally is choosing how you would like to carry out your task. Basically whether you want to go in guns blazing or be more sneaky in your execution, Thief doesn't give you this option as the combat mechanics are really bad and trying to fight the guards is like trying to beat a dark souls boss while armed with a wooden stick.\n\nPros:\nNon-linear map: With reference with my map problems this is feature is sort of ruined but i am still going to add it because maybe you can decrypt Garretts map and get enjoyment out of the exploration of these massive maps.\n\nStealth mechanics: Brilliant, top of the range, amazing.. All words you could use to describe the stealth mechanics: Different materials make varied sounds either loud or soft forcing you to be more careful and thoughtful when you are sneaking through an area, The detail thats gone into the lighting and shadow casting is amazing for such an old game and it really adds to the dark grimy feel of the game but also makes for great stealth moments.\n\n\nIn conclusion. I do not recomend Thief as compared to the stealth games we have now a days (Dishonored and Hitman for example) and i know a lot of people are going to disagree with me but know they are doing it because they are filled with nostalgia and nostalgia can only be felt in people that played the orginal thief so if you are looking for a expansion on the orginial game with the same mechanics and atmosphere then go nuts but, if you are like me and have not played it then i would avoid this game as it doesn't hold up to games like Dishonored (my personal favourite stealth game) and Hitman.\n\nP.S: Feel free to type as many hate comments as you want i am bored and i could use an inane arugument to liven things up.","March 2, 2015","false","1.9"," 3 of 27 people (11%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","11","3","27","2","19"

I beat this a long time ago and recently bought the steam version. Ok now Thief is often heralded as one of the best game series of all time. And I will say its a mighty fine series but its had a fair share of stumbles. See when this game first came out it was like the coolest thing since Mario, and that was the first game in the series really didnt have a standard to follow. It was the first of its kind. I mean a game that is built around avoiding enemys? Pfffft blasphemy. But apparently it gained such a following that they made Gold edition. *gasp* More thief content?! See the original Thief had 2 levels cut from it and you know, I can see why they where. And this next statement applys to the entire game. The level design is completly nonsensical. They progress like massive labirynths and tombs, not compounds for the rich. Another gripe I have with the levels are the sewer portions. They focuse on combat and trust me that aint the games high point. If im gonna play a stealth game im going to play a stealth game not resident evil. And overall I see Thief 1 the same way i see Zone of Enders 1. The sequels are much better but if you like the first game cool beans play it. But for a defenitive Thief experience play 2 or 3 not this one.","April 8, 2014","false","0.2"," 13 of 51 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","13","51","0","5"

I remeber when Thief: The Dark Project (1998), Thief II: The Metal Age (2000), and Thief: Deadly Shadows (2004) were released, but add them to the list of other great titles that I neglected for, instead,  endless hours of Ultima Online and Everquest.  Had I given these titles a shot back then, I'm sure that I would have been amazed.\n\nHowever, I think my three days of playing through (not completely) these titles earlier this month came, unfortunately, about 8-10 years too late.  As someone who has aged with the medium over the last 30 years, I can see how amazing these games would have been in their day.  But, much like if I were attempting a first play through of the original two Fallout games (~1998), or my beloved X-Com: UFO Defense (1994), I can't get past the graphical deficiencies and absence of other elements one takes for granted in modern games.\n\nThe positives:  Great story.  Great voice acting by Stephen Russell portraying anti-hero Garrett.  Ground-breaking stealth play.  Amazing AI.\n\nThe negatives:  No third person view.  Dated graphics. Problems running on modern systems.\n\nSome games age well.  Civilization III, for example, is as fun to play today as it was at its release in 2001.  Unfortunately, some don't...\n\nIf you were a fan of the titles back in the day, pick them up for your library when they're on sale.  Otherwise, if you're considering a first-time playthrough, consider waiting until the reboot drops next month (2/28/14).","January 26, 2014","false","1.2"," 5 of 70 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","5","70","0","3"

In a time, when the majority of games were simple "kill everything that is in front of your gun" and "you'll survive almost any amount of gunfire aimed at you" it made you weak. Alerting more than a single guard to your presence almost certainly meant your certain death. Using stealth and guile however, you can dispose of any number of guards. This game invented the genre of stealth based games that would follow a few years later (I'm looking at you, Splinter Cell). For me, Garrett is the coolest anti-hero ever.

The steam version has compatibility issues along with outdated resolutions. Great game though. Thief 2 is better however, but the 1st is definitely a classic in its own right with a creepy and moody atmosphere. But it fails in one critical area and that is the thieving. My main issue with it, there isn't enough of it in the first game. Pretty soon the game instead goes from excellent theft themed stealth game, to Garret zombie, raptor, demon hunter. Having a few supernatural beasts do add plenty of spooky horror elements, adding to the atmosphere, but they over do it. The cathedral level can burn in stealth game hell. That mission was annoying, unescecary, and frustrating.\n\nMy gripes with the game though are with a few exceptions, minor. This game is a masterpiece, along with 2 and deadly shadows.

A lot people hate the combat in this game because it's too hard. The gaurds take about ten hits before they die. And to me, that's a good thing because thieves don't master in the way of the sword, but in the way of stealing. ombat would be a difficult task for a thief.

Because I now know that I never really understood stealth games or how to properly play one until I played this.\n\nIf you can get past the old graphics and sometimes clunky movements (it's actually really nice for a game from 1998), the game has some really nice mechanics that make it pretty unique. For example sound and its relation to your surroundings and movements in the game really play a big part in how stealthy you are. The setting and the story is also quite interesting.\n\nAnd unlike a lot of games that are being released in current and recent times, this game does not hold your hand. It'll teach you the basics of sneaking and moving around, and then leave you to fend and figure things out for yourself. Your character is not O.P'ed. And by that I mean even though you're given a sword in this game, Garrett can't fight for ♥♥♥♥. Which, as bad as that sounds, is great because I think that actually really enhances the gameplay and atmosphere.\n\nThis game is definitely replayable.\n\nUsing the thief patch that is available online is definitely recommended when playing as it fixes certain glitches and allows for slightly clearer graphics and options.","August 11, 2014","true","39.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For starters, you may be used to backstabbing enemies in other games, such as Dishonored, which was inspired by this game.\n\nYou would be better off unlearning that instinct, as this is a game that emphasizes the fact that you are a thief.  Not a "Rogue" from D&D, and not an Assassin from Assassin's Creed.  Garrett is no swordsman, carrying his sword more for self-defense than necessity.\n\nThe swordplay is intentionally awkward, as they originally developed the engine for another game they had planned, but discovered it was too difficult to use.  Then they realized they could apply it to a game where the player character isn't expected to be a good swordsman.\n\nAs far as stealth mechanics go, you will learn to love the shadows.  Garrett is practically invisible while in the darkest shadows, and thus you will find yourself flitting from shadow to shadow, like a true thief, while fearing the light that exposes you to your enemies.  You will also learn to pay careful attention to the sound you make, as guards have ears and will pay attention to sounds you make.\n\nBeing a thief, however, Garrett is squishy.  And on the highest difficulties, he considers himself a professional - that means no murdering.  This is what sets Thief apart from other games - it discourages simple murder, and encourages you to get around obstacles instead of cutting your way through them.  This is a simple thing that Deadly Shadows and Thief 4 have neglected.\n\nThe graphics are dated, but this can be mended by the HD mod, which improves the quality of the textures.  However, if you can overcome the graphics, you will find a rich and rewarding experience.\n\nAs far as the plot goes, well,, it is slow to start off with - Garrett takes the first chance he gets to escape from the Keepers, and tries to make his own fate outside of their influence.  The plot of the game doesn't kick in until part of the way in.  More impressive than the plot, however, is the atmosphere.  You are in the !@#$iest steampunk city in the entire fictional universe.  The rich are corrupt, the poor are sick and hungry, one religion's word is law, and another religion is trying to kill everyone.  Even the bears suffer (if you eavesdrop on a conversation in the first proper mission of the game).\n\nEven if you are a new player, I would recommend playing the game on Expert.  Expert is where Thief truly shines, as it requires the most gameplay out of you.  It isn't just a flat upgrade in stats, you have more objectives you are required to complete, objectives you might not have ever known about on any other difficulty.\n\nWhat are the bad parts of this game, you might ask?  For starters, the controls are outdated.  You can remap them, but you have different keys for "walk forward" and "run forward", and you WILL be using both.  Thankfully, the game doesn't use TOO many keys, so just remap them to your comfort level.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of stealth games, I would DEFINITELY recommend Thief.  If you are interested in starting a stealth game, I would recommend giving this a try, too.  If you hate Stealth games, why are you reading this?\n\nIf you want a Thief game where you play as a Thief and not a kleptomaniac Assassin, this is the game for you.","August 12, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to say that it's bad, the story and dialogue is actually one of the strong points. The weak points were in the controls and I suppose some of the stealth mechanics. Jumping was far more difficult than it should have been, as well as climbing. I'll give stealth mechanics a bit of slack though since even top developers today still can't get it right. It does make for some hilarious bugs at times though!\n\nNote: I never played any of the Thief series as a kid. I recall getting one of them with a video card I bought way back when though I had no interest in the game at the time. So I suppose you could say this review isn't biased by nostalgia. I would highly recommend installing the TafferPatcher mod for this game as it completely overhauls the textures and some of the rendering engine.","August 16, 2014","true","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Levels are huge, exploration is huge (no invisible walls), and the tools/arrows you have are large and varied. Top it up with a spooky, tense soundtrack and you have a real gem.\n\nIt's not all great: graphics are ofc 1998, enemy AI isn't perfect (enemies don't notice patrolling guards go missing or torches going out), the Steam version doesn't show cutscenes (which is what Youtube's for), you backtrack a bunch, item menu is a bit clunky, but all these minor setbacks don't stop it from being a great game.

I didn't find much use for separate run and walk keys -- I remapped keys to the "wsad" pattern, with "w" for run. When I need to walk slowly, I use "shift", works just fine.\n2. The game itself works OK on Vista (64bit), but without cutscenes. Pressing "Intro" button yields nothing too. I found lack of story/narrative to be quite disquieting so I started looking for a solution.\n3.

The Real Solution for Thief Gold on Vista and Windows 7 is to set "Run this program as administrator" flag on THIEF.EXE (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\thief_gold\THIEF.EXE --> Properties --> Compatibility tab), this brings cutscenes back (don't bother with "Run in WinXP SP2 compatibility" mode, it doesn't cut the mustard).\n4. You can use resolution higher than 800x600 if you manually edit both cam.cfg and ddfix.ini (TFix boasts that it enables this to be done via in-game Video menu, but I didn't bother to verify).","December 17, 2013","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The steam version has compatibility issues along with outdated resolutions. Great game though. Thief 2 is better however, but the 1st is definitely a classic in its own right with a creepy and moody atmosphere. But it fails in one critical area and that is the thieving. My main issue with it, there isn't enough of it in the first game. Pretty soon the game instead goes from excellent theft themed stealth game, to Garret zombie, raptor, demon hunter. Having a few supernatural beasts do add plenty of spooky horror elements, adding to the atmosphere, but they over do it. The cathedral level can burn in stealth game hell. That mission was annoying, unescecary, and frustrating.\n\nMy gripes with the game though are with a few exceptions, minor. This game is a masterpiece, along with 2 and deadly shadows. It was a pioner in stealth gameplay and a fun adventure in its own right. It created a memorable character and made pc gamers like myself, cream thier pants.

There is no other series out on the market that really puts you into the shoes of a masterful thief like this one does. I love the stealth and planning required in this game. You are often dropped into the maps with little hint on what to do, but there are usually multiple ways to go about completing a level which is great. It certainly does not hold your hand like modern games do, and because it is old it also runs perfectly on computers and laptops not made for gaming.\n\nIf you love the stealth aspect of the game, then higher difficulty settings will work better for you and aso give you more gameplay content to complete. If you can't help but kill some guards/civilians, then the normal difficulty setting is best for you. But the game is still hard even on that mode haha! I definitely recommend learning how to use arrow ropes properly because they will be your best friend in a lot of the later maps/levels.\n\nThe only problem I really had with this game is that for some reason to cutscenes wouldn't run on my pc, which was a minor inconvenience because I had to go watch them on youtube. This may not be the case for everyone, but after looking it up I know I'm not the only person who had that issue. However, cutscenes aren't too important if all you care about is the gameplay itself.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 9.5/10.","January 8, 2015","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphically speaking, it's nothing an N64 couldn't handle, sound-wise, it feels like someone opened a can of stock "swoosh" sound effects, and after playing it only for a few minutes, I found myself very disappointed indeed. It seemed very bare-bones from the tutorial. There's not even a run button, and the controls are laid out pretty awkwardly. Overall it's hard to jump right in, but then I started to break the surface tension and I realized that underneat the surface of the water was... was a metaphor I'm putting way too much effort into.\n\nAs it happens, a lot of what makes Thief old is what makes it good. I think this is best exemplified in the map system, chiefly because it's actually a freaking map. Most games don't give you maps nowadays, they give you radars and blip points and arrows and "go-here-if-you-want-to-win"-type things. It makes everything feel very soulless; Thief manages to get around this by giving you the bare minimum. It's pretty neat how this is actually how you would imagine Garrett would put a map together. The game gives you the tools to progression, and you have to interpret them. You never quite know what's going to be around the corner. It's a much better approach than "oh, please, chauffer me to the nearest mundane objective so I can move into your next playground and do the same thing all over again." Cough, Hitman Absolution, cough.\n\nThe amount of effort that has gone into the levels is very nice; it's easy to immerse yourself into the world. You're given a few details and have to fill in the pieces. Sure, it's dated, but at the end of the day it's a hell of a lot better than almost every stealth game released since... since 1971. Yes, I dare say this game is better than Tennis for Two. Couple that with a fantastically snarky protagonist and a nifty steampunk setting and you're left with a stealth game done the way it should be. This game makes Hitman Absolution cry. Get it.","March 8, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In honor of it's release, I am ignoring it entirely, preferring to watch GhostRobo lets-play it and compare it to this, the Thief Gold Edition. Right off the bat, I nearly broke into tears. Not at how well-rendered the worlds were (not very), or how good the voice acting is (not), but because this game is the epitome of something that most modern games are apparently deathly afraid of; having a completely stealth-based game. Most games have certain stealth aspects that you can choose to integrate into your game experience, or forced stealth sequences that your character uses to get his recently stolen items back. Thief is something different, you're a wisecracking medieval pickpocket who turned to his pickpockety ways in order to live in the city that was apparently forged to have conveniently shadowed areas right next to things like guard posts and enough loose change laying around to fund my bottomless pit of desire for nice TF2 weapons. Without stealth, it's hard to beat the game legitimately, but there's something special about it, it's still better than all the Assassin's Creed games are, and ever could be.

For starters, you may be used to backstabbing enemies in other games, such as Dishonored, which was inspired by this game.\n\nYou would be better off unlearning that instinct, as this is a game that emphasizes the fact that you are a thief.  Not a "Rogue" from D&D, and not an Assassin from Assassin's Creed.  Garrett is no swordsman, carrying his sword more for self-defense than necessity.\n\nThe swordplay is intentionally awkward, as they originally developed the engine for another game they had planned, but discovered it was too difficult to use.  Then they realized they could apply it to a game where the player character isn't expected to be a good swordsman.\n\nAs far as stealth mechanics go, you will learn to love the shadows.  Garrett is practically invisible while in the darkest shadows, and thus you will find yourself flitting from shadow to shadow, like a true thief, while fearing the light that exposes you to your enemies.  You will also learn to pay careful attention to the sound you make, as guards have ears and will pay attention to sounds you make.\n\nBeing a thief, however, Garrett is squishy.  And on the highest difficulties, he considers himself a professional - that means no murdering.  This is what sets Thief apart from other games - it discourages simple murder, and encourages you to get around obstacles instead of cutting your way through them.  This is a simple thing that Deadly Shadows and Thief 4 have neglected.\n\nThe graphics are dated, but this can be mended by the HD mod, which improves the quality of the textures.  However, if you can overcome the graphics, you will find a rich and rewarding experience.\n\nAs far as the plot goes, well,, it is slow to start off with - Garrett takes the first chance he gets to escape from the Keepers, and tries to make his own fate outside of their influence.  The plot of the game doesn't kick in until part of the way in.  More impressive than the plot, however, is the atmosphere.  You are in the !@#$iest steampunk city in the entire fictional universe.  The rich are corrupt, the poor are sick and hungry, one religion's word is law, and another religion is trying to kill everyone.  Even the bears suffer (if you eavesdrop on a conversation in the first proper mission of the game).\n\nEven if you are a new player, I would recommend playing the game on Expert.  Expert is where Thief truly shines, as it requires the most gameplay out of you.  It isn't just a flat upgrade in stats, you have more objectives you are required to complete, objectives you might not have ever known about on any other difficulty.\n\nWhat are the bad parts of this game, you might ask?  For starters, the controls are outdated.  You can remap them, but you have different keys for "walk forward" and "run forward", and you WILL be using both.  Thankfully, the game doesn't use TOO many keys, so just remap them to your comfort level.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of stealth games, I would DEFINITELY recommend Thief.  If you are interested in starting a stealth game, I would recommend giving this a try, too.  If you hate Stealth games, why are you reading this?\n\nIf you want a Thief game where you play as a Thief and not a kleptomaniac Assassin, this is the game for you.","August 12, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's also a decent Thief Gold HD Mod out there. But Haters Gonna Hate, so i'll keep focus on the review.\n\nSo here comes my 'old fart story': I remember, when a friend told me about this "new game" and after school he showed me the demo he got from a magazine. I never played a single demo level so many times and i couldn't wait to get the full game. Long story short, it was a great game back then!\n\nFast forward to the new millennium and games with brilliant graphics but (mostly) mediocre gameplay. Nowadays i rarely play games, but when i stumble over a teaser for the new Thief, i checked Steam for the old trilogy and downloaded it without hesitation. What can i say ... i still love it.\n\nThe game is just awesome and the missions are still brilliant (even my 'steam record' says 0.1 hrs, i played 5 missions on expert level so far) and a lot of fun to play. I'm know, that not every one can play 'slow games' like Thief, so if you're a shooter-loving action-junkie, you probably won't get happy. This game is about waiting in dark corners, sneaking around and being patient.\n\nThe atmosphere is the best part of the game, so when you play the game while watching TV or browse internet-porn, you won't have much fun either (well, depends what porns you find). But if you have the right setup (dark room & headphones) and the right attitude, you can enjoy one of the best games of all time (and probably the best 'stealth game ever').\n","March 22, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphically speaking, it's nothing an N64 couldn't handle, sound-wise, it feels like someone opened a can of stock "swoosh" sound effects, and after playing it only for a few minutes, I found myself very disappointed indeed. It seemed very bare-bones from the tutorial. There's not even a run button, and the controls are laid out pretty awkwardly. Overall it's hard to jump right in, but then I started to break the surface tension and I realized that underneat the surface of the water was... was a metaphor I'm putting way too much effort into.\n\nAs it happens, a lot of what makes Thief old is what makes it good. I think this is best exemplified in the map system, chiefly because it's actually a freaking map. Most games don't give you maps nowadays, they give you radars and blip points and arrows and "go-here-if-you-want-to-win"-type things. It makes everything feel very soulless; Thief manages to get around this by giving you the bare minimum. It's pretty neat how this is actually how you would imagine Garrett would put a map together. The game gives you the tools to progression, and you have to interpret them. You never quite know what's going to be around the corner. It's a much better approach than "oh, please, chauffer me to the nearest mundane objective so I can move into your next playground and do the same thing all over again." Cough, Hitman Absolution, cough.\n\nThe amount of effort that has gone into the levels is very nice; it's easy to immerse yourself into the world. You're given a few details and have to fill in the pieces. Sure, it's dated, but at the end of the day it's a hell of a lot better than almost every stealth game released since... since 1971. Yes, I dare say this game is better than Tennis for Two. Couple that with a fantastically snarky protagonist and a nifty steampunk setting and you're left with a stealth game done the way it should be. This game makes Hitman Absolution cry.

I didn't find much use for separate run and walk keys -- I remapped keys to the "wsad" pattern, with "w" for run. When I need to walk slowly, I use "shift", works just fine.\n2. The game itself works OK on Vista (64bit), but without cutscenes. Pressing "Intro" button yields nothing too. I found lack of story/narrative to be quite disquieting so I started looking for a solution.\n3. As always, there were a lot of bull$hit solutions proposed on the Internet, like TTLG/TFix/etc, but IMNSHO you shouldn't tamper with Steam version using 3rd party patches that may contain every sort of malware while no guarantees whatsoever. The Real Solution for Thief Gold on Vista and Windows 7 is to set "Run this program as administrator" flag on THIEF.EXE (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\thief_gold\THIEF.EXE --> Properties --> Compatibility tab), this brings cutscenes back (don't bother with "Run in WinXP SP2 compatibility" mode, it doesn't cut the mustard).\n4. You can use resolution higher than 800x600 if you manually edit both cam.cfg and ddfix.ini (TFix boasts that it enables this to be done via in-game Video menu, but I didn't bother to verify).","December 17, 2013","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In honor of it's release, I am ignoring it entirely, preferring to watch GhostRobo lets-play it and compare it to this, the Thief Gold Edition. Right off the bat, I nearly broke into tears. Not at how well-rendered the worlds were (not very), or how good the voice acting is (not), but because this game is the epitome of something that most modern games are apparently deathly afraid of; having a completely stealth-based game. Most games have certain stealth aspects that you can choose to integrate into your game experience, or forced stealth sequences that your character uses to get his recently stolen items back. Thief is something different, you're a wisecracking medieval pickpocket who turned to his pickpockety ways in order to live in the city that was apparently forged to have conveniently shadowed areas right next to things like guard posts and enough loose change laying around to fund my bottomless pit of desire for nice TF2 weapons. Without stealth, it's hard to beat the game legitimately, but there's something special about it, it's still better than all the Assassin's Creed games are, and ever could be. Proceed to light your torches and grab your pitchforks, Ubisoft fans.","March 29, 2014","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You also have an arsenal of trinkets and usefull tricks to distract enemys, darken certain areas, and even create better flooring to walk on.\nThe combat feels alright, there are a few different types of opponents and you have plenty of options to either deal with them or simply not let them notice you.\nFinal word of advice, the cutscenes before each mission don't actually work for me, im not sure if this is because I got it on steam or because of a problem with my computer but I kinda just have to youtube them... oh wells I guess.","January 16, 2014","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Originally Thief was known as Dark Camelot and intended to be an action RPG type of game and you can see throughout this game where they recycled content from that original game - ie medieval influenced missions.  it later morphed into Dark Project when they found that the stealth aspect (championed by Paul Neurath) was a lot more entertaining and that a game involving stealth and thievery would be a better option.\n\nRather than being a straight re-issue of the game it was an early form of what we now know as GOTY editions. It includes 3 extra levels: The Mage Towers, The Thieves Guild and Song of the Caverns.  In addition to extra missions it also tweaked the standard missions some minor tweaks in most and then a couple of levels receiving reworking notably The Sword (added more area - ie Little Big World), Undercover (story changes), The Lost City (enemy and story changes) and Down in the Bonehoard is retextured.  Furthermore Thief Gold moves the version up to 1.37 from T:DP's final version of v1.33.  On the old discs you also got a preview of Thief II and of course the additional mission the Blooper Reel (Lord Baffords Manor featuring entertaining bugs and humorous content)\n\nAt present the cut scenes do not function on some systems, notably Windows 7, there are various work arounds available - they can be found over at ttlg.com (file is called Tfix_1.18c) or if you so wish you can always Youtube the Thief cut scenes.  I highly recommend you watch the cut scenes, not only do they advance the story and reveal a lot of twists and turns related to it but they are also beautifully crafted and remain a joy to watch.\n\nThe concept of Thief is simple, achieve the mission objectives by the use of stealth.  Stealth in this game pertains to use of shadows, sound and movement.  To aid you in this you have a light gem in the lower section of the screen that indicates the amount of light you are currently exposed in.  Sound is highly important and was one of the first games, if not the first where sound was just as important as what you could see.  Footsteps on varied surfaces, the sound of patrolling guards and ambient noise all add a rich and extra layer of gameplay.  You need to take these elements and work within them or bend them to your favour to achieve your objectives.\n\nThe game is set within The City, a steampunkish type era, like the Victorian era on the cusp of industrialisation.  The City itself is moody, bleak and dangerous, the perfect playground for the adventurous. There are several factions within The City all vying for control, the mysterious Baron of the City remains aloof, a figure of power and control but not involved directly.  The ambience of The City is beautiful and it's success is largely due to the presentation of The City, both aurally and visually. The story that unwinds also fleshes out The City.\n\nComparisons can be made to Dunwall from Dishonoured and Dishonoured does indeed play like a Thief game and has that ambience, albeit the focus is on assassination and not on stealth and theft.  Dunwall though is the victim of politics that goes up to the highest level, The City feels more alive though.   There is no apocalyptic plague sweeping the streets and the highest power is not overtly tyrannical but the various factions do give "layers" to The City, it feels like it has more depth and soul than Dunwall ever had, it is an entity in itself.\n\nThe visuals are nothing exciting but they are effective enough.  The sound though is truly a thing of sublime beauty.  This is the first game where it was essential to have sound enabled and if possible to have a dedicated sound card (that again has kind of died out thanks to integrated sound on motherboards).  From the fabulous sound ambience to the classical Loot sound it is all very stylised and very integral to the Thief experience.  It must be said that the talents of the voice actor for Garrett, Mr Stephen Russell truly stand out as one of the greatest in gaming. He gives Garrett the very jaded, near misanthropic character that makes the game feel so immersive.\n\nGarrett feels like what you would expect to be a product of hard life within The City it is conveyed wonderfully.  It is wonderful to hear Garrett go into his internal monologues during missions, throwing story, character and enjoyment at you.  Be warned though after sneaking through a level only hearing footsteps and ambience you may jump off of your chair in fright the first time his voice unexpectedly booms out at you.\n\nThe difficulty levels change objectives and throw in variables such as not killing anyone and collecting a certain minimum amount of loot. At the easier difficulty levels it can be easy to roll in and kill all the enemies in a level, but by far the biggest challenge is to play on the Expert setting and try to adhere to the rules of Ghosting - ie don't let anyone see you, leave things as you found them (except for things you need to loot to achieve the objectives), don't knock anyone out even relock doors you pass through etc.. By and large the rules of Ghosting are self-imposed, a fun challenge to yourself, but a rewarding one.  Consider the missions (levels) to be a big playground at your disposal.\n\nThe controls are standard controls for the era and you may find you will want to tweak them to match what you are used to playing today - ie alternating strafe and lean keys for instance and changing the walk and backwards buttons etc.  Combat is straightforward - use your bow to snipe targets or to shoot a variety of specialty arrows - water arrows to douse torches, moss arrows to soften the noise on surfaces, rope arrows to climb to other areas, fire arrows to destroy things, broad head to kill enemies/make a noise, noisemaker arrows to create a distraction etc..  The Sword play is simple, space to block and primary attack to swing the sword.  Hold it down for a stronger strike. By far the most useful tool though is the Blackjack.  This item is used to render guards unconscious.  Slip up behind a guard raise your blackjack and then bring it down upon their head.  Then get rid of the unconscious body - be aware that placing a body near a fireplace or in even a small amount of water will probably result in death to the unconscious party - bad if you are trying to achieve a no-kill objective.  So while dumping that body into an unlit fireplace may seem great, it won't be if a servant comes and lights it up :P\n\nAt the time of release the original Thief was described as a sneak 'em up (as opposed to shoot 'em up) and it is the precursor of all stealth games that you see today.  The graphics have not aged well, mods can fix that if you so choose and the controls can be quite archaic. But the story remains as beautiful as ever and there is a great deal of satisfaction to be garnered from this game. The reboot of the series, Thief, is to be released soon and while the reboot doesn't follow on from these stories - it certainly seems to take ideas from the series.\n\nIf you enjoy stealth games, games with an interesting story and enjoy a challenge, then Thief: Gold is a game for you.  It does look dated now but it remains as enjoyable as ever to play.  Make sure you apply the fixes to get the cutscenes working (and improved resolution options) to really improve the gameplay experience for you. Tweak the controls as you need and you should find yourself become immersed in the depths of The City very quickly.  From the first time you pickpocket a guard of a key, hear that chiming loot sound or even your first close shave with your heart pounding in your throat you will be hooked on the game.  It really is a gem of gaming.\n","January 23, 2014","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't find much use for separate run and walk keys -- I remapped keys to the "wsad" pattern, with "w" for run. When I need to walk slowly, I use "shift", works just fine.\n2. The game itself works OK on Vista (64bit), but without cutscenes. Pressing "Intro" button yields nothing too. I found lack of story/narrative to be quite disquieting so I started looking for a solution.\n3. As always, there were a lot of bull$hit solutions proposed on the Internet, like TTLG/TFix/etc, but IMNSHO you shouldn't tamper with Steam version using 3rd party patches that may contain every sort of malware while no guarantees whatsoever. The Real Solution for Thief Gold on Vista and Windows 7 is to set "Run this program as administrator" flag on THIEF.EXE (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\thief_gold\THIEF.EXE --> Properties --> Compatibility tab), this brings cutscenes back (don't bother with "Run in WinXP SP2 compatibility" mode, it doesn't cut the mustard).\n4. You can use resolution higher than 800x600 if you manually edit both cam.cfg and ddfix.ini (TFix boasts that it enables this to be done via in-game Video menu, but I didn't bother to verify).","December 17, 2013","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike modern stealth games which give you the option of fighting your way through mobs, you almost always want to stay hidden and strike from the shadows. Mobs usually take quite a few hits to go down and your character Garrett, although an adequate fighter in his own right, is quite squishy and will usually go down really quick. That's not to say that the direct combat method should be avoided, it's actually quite doable, however, the clunky combat system, questionable collision detection and lack of an aiming reticle makes direct combat more trouble than it's worth.\n\nThe stealth mechanics I thought was innovative although can be quite laughable at times. Thief incorporates a cover system that allows you to conceal yourself in dark, shadowy areas. A "light gem" indicator tells you how visible you are to the mobs around you, however, a flaw with the system is that enemy vision AI is dependent on the light gem, so you can literally stand right in front of a mob and as long as your light gem is indicating that you're hidden, they won't notice you and will walk past you as if you were invisable. Sound also plays a part in stealth with AI responding to noises you make such as footsteps or the impact of a thrown item against a wall. Different floor types can affect the way your footsteps sound. Your gadgets are mostly based around stealth are actually quite creative. Water arrows lets you douse torches to darken a room, moss arrows lets you create soft patches on the ground to walk on to dampen your footsteps, etc. Level design is organic and open ended similar to Deus Ex, giving you more than one way to reach your destintion.\n\nIf you can get over the outdated graphics (and if you're a real gamer, you should) you'll find that Thief still manages to hold it's own even by today's standards. Solid gameplay, well written story and the atmospheric soundtrack all blend well to create an immersive experience. The game is lengthy enough to keep you playing for quite a while. It's challenging but not unfairly difficult and the lack of a mini map, way points or instant checkpoints shouldn't detract you. It's actually a nice throwback to a time when video games didn't hold your hand as much as it does now. Completing it is very rewarding, especially if you're patient enough to play through and immerse yourself in the whole game and sadly, patience is a trait that most gamers nowaday lack.","July 20, 2013","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Half way through the game, I can definitely say it's the best stealth game of all time and one of the best games ever.\n\nIf I could narrow it down to one reason, it would be the atmosphere.  The atmosphere created by the sound, setting, and visuals, all coupled with the tension from knowing at any minute someone might spot and kill you, is unmatched even today for a game like this.  There's a real challenge in Thief, especially if you want to play non-lethal.  There's multiple routes through each level, and there's no hand-holding, giving the player great freedom of choice, but also making it easy to get lost or stuck.  That's really the only negative I can think of.","December 30, 2014","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this game because it is a classic in the same way as System Shock 2 and Deus Ex. Two games I also like. Yes, this game is old. I had to find a mod on google to play the game in widescreen. Character models are hilariously lumpy. Textures look grainy if you get too close to them. If you insist on having state-of-the-art graphics (that your computer can't even fully run) in your games, then you will hate Thief Gold.\n\nHowever, if you can tolerate the graphics, you will find that they actually enhance the feel of the game. It's a unique feeling to see a new kind of enemy and still have no idea what it is after its killed you more than five times. The shadows and lighting are primitive, but if you are playing a stealth game and need you hide in the shadows, you should be glad that the shadows are so dark and clean-cut.\n\nGameplay is very fine. No other game encourages stealth by giving you a combat tutorial that shows how broken the combat actually is. If you were like me, you'll play the first few missions way too aggressively and end up being chased by soldiers everywhere the whole time. As the game gets harder though, and you stand even a smaller chance against each enemy, you'll be able to use the sneaking mechanics the right way.\n\nWhat you will be able to quickly recognize in the game is how much it doesn't explain. Just google what each type of arrow does and you'll thank me. The only other things that could be frustrating are the mission objectives. If you've played Goldeneye 007 you should understand. Some objectives are so vague that you must just explore the whole level until something happens.\n\nExploring levels is very enjoyable though. Each level is different in setting and theme. There are mansions, caverns, streets, tombs, towers, etc. Level design seems very simple at first, but the later levels get more complex, I think at times rivaling the GoldSource Engine in complexity.\n\nMost levels are either sneaking past guards and getting loot, or exploring monster-infested caves for plot items. Both are enjoyable. The sneaking ones are generally more involved but more frustrating. I think there is a nice balance.\n\nOverall, the game is surprisingly enjoyable. If you can appreciate older games, give it a go. If you are worried that it won't hold up as good as you remember when you last played it ten years ago, give it a go.\n\nThe game is not the greatest compared to everything else out there, but its high status is deserved as Thief Gold is a gem of FPS history that went on to inspire every other FPS after it.","December 31, 2014","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are there, but for some reason, the steam version doesn't want to play them. Google T.Fix or look for it in the guides for this game and that will solve the problem. It's not too hard to download and use.\n\nI didn't like this game at first. I just wandered the streets of the first level and I tried to fight the guards. Then I quit because I was frustrated that I had to start over and I didn't know where to go or that I should save often.\n\nThen I gave it a second chance and remembered it's a stealth game. Customizing the controls helps a lot. This is one of my favorite games now. I actually like the sequel a little better, but this game is still good. It's old and you can count the polygons on just about anything you see in this game, but the story and gameplay are good or at least interesting.\n\nI was chased by guards in a casino. I stopped to spin the roulette things, ran, and I killed myself with a mine I planted.\n\nI tormented a guard by jumping from a ledge to a ladder, making him climb stairs...then I threw a bag of flour (or something) at him and he died.\n\nI knocked out a guard and threw him down a well and killed him. Later I knocked out a different guard and threw him down stairs for fun because the bodies slide funny. I think he survived, but I didn't check. It doesn't seem to matter if kill the guards after you knock them out. I still need to try to kill a guard with the body of another guard.\n\nI was at a point where I hid from everything. I'm now at a point where I will rotate saves and knock out everyone or fight everything...unless it's undead or the final boss, then ♥♥♥♥ that. Especially the zombies and Haunts and you're out of holywater or fire based weapons.\n\nAlso this game made me hate monkeys.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about this game is the cutscene thing and that the maps are a little confusing at first so you can get lost if you've never played it. If you don't save or die, it'll restart the whole level unless you can load a save. Also steam will not save your save files if the game is uninstalled or if something happens to your save files. I've had to replay this and the sequel at least twice. I didn't really mind though. It's better than the remake...and cheaper.\n\nalso you can kill people with flour bags.

In a time, when the majority of games were simple "kill everything that is in front of your gun" and "you'll survive almost any amount of gunfire aimed at you" it made you weak. Alerting more than a single guard to your presence almost certainly meant your certain death. Using stealth and guile however, you can dispose of any number of guards. This game invented the genre of stealth based games that would follow a few years later (I'm looking at you, Splinter Cell). For me, Garrett is the coolest anti-hero ever.

And in order to avoid any spoilers... well, let's just say things get complicated.\n\nThis is the first game in the Thief series and the extended edition of Thief: The Dark Project.  It includes all of the original game content and features three new missions adapted to the original storyline along with full voice acting and new graphics.\n\nTLDR Highlights:\n+++ Stealth Gameplay and Utilities\n++ Voice Acting\n+ Improved (but still old) Graphics\n\n-- Slow Start/Story\n- Wonky Hit-boxes\n\n= No wonder it's such a beloved classic!  The old graphics might turn some people off, but if you can get past it, then I highly recommend playing this one.\n\nReview:\nPROS -- The main feature of this game is also the very best thing about it:  stealth gameplay.  I also believe this game is the first to use first-person 3D stealth, which is honestly pretty amazing considering how good it is!  Near the beginning of the game, I was trying to hide in the shadows but it wasn't dark enough thanks to some torches.  Now, this is my very first time ever playing this game, so at first I just made do, thinking this game was far too old to have useful mechanics like removing the torches or, better yet, putting them out somehow.  Sure enough, I found water arrows in my inventory and was able to shoot them at torches to put them out and create more shadows!  There's also rope arrows, noisemaker arrows, moss arrows (to create a quieter surface to walk on), not to mention a blackjack and the need for multiple kinds of lockpicks that somehow made me feel like I was actually picking locks even though the mechanic is extremely simple.

This is most likely caused by the pacing of the story.  Some of the first missions were cool and all, but I didn't really feel a sense of purpose.  Sure, there would be little cutscenes that gave me an explanation as to why I was going to this place and stealing that item, but it was lacking in the "big picture" department.  In fact, I started to get bored enough that I almost quit playing.  Fortunately, I stuck it out because the story really gets ramped up by the end.  It sucks that it took so long, but in the end I felt that it was totally worth it, and I can't wait to play the sequel to see what happens next.\n\nA much, much smaller issue for me was the hit-boxes when attacking or knocking out the NPCs.  Sometimes I could hit them from a few feet away, and other times I could be right on top of them and miss consistently (maybe hitting somewhere through and behind them).  This wasn't a huge problem, though, because you get a feel for it and the distance required.  Just a by-product of being an old game perhaps.\n\nOVERALL -- I've been hearing about this game for a long time, but especially around the time that the new Thief came out not too long ago, and it's been on my list of games to play just as long.  Honestly, I'm very glad I finally got around to it.  It got a little slow there for a bit, but it was worth it.  No wonder it's such a beloved classic!  As long as you can get past the dated graphics, then I definitely recommend playing Thief Gold.","March 17","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is easy to understand but hard to complete. Yes, you have a map, but in the map you don't know where are you any you need to use your instinct. The IA is good and you never will make it easy if you've never played the thief.\nThere are several weapons and many kinds of arrow for each occasion. For example the sword (only be used if you chase), the Blackjack (that you will use to knock out the enemies) and different types of arrows for any occasion such as an arrow with a rope to climb, the arrow water to extinguish torches, the arrow with sleeping gas to stop the enemy  etc.\n\nThis game is a 9.5/10 in my opinion. Is just perfect but the game but the game does not have any checkpoint so if you die you'll have to start over from the beginning of the level and you'll have to save the game manually or by pressing F11.","December 25, 2014","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A dark and rainy day, as if it was made for gaming. I finished the demo after 2 hours. I explored as much as possible.\nAnd played it through again after finishing.\nThe day the game finally came out I stood up early and was at the shop an hour before they opened to buy that game. I was not disappointed.\n\nSince that day I have played "Thief: the dark project" more than 30 times. No other game ever made me so addicted. I made 1-2 speedruns for my own, explored the hell out of the game, played every difficulty. I love beeing a stealthy thief... Even my brother still plays it, though most old games he defines as "ugly junk".\n\nOk, enough of being a fanboy. Let's go to the core of the game.\n\nTechnical:\nYou are right if you think that this game is looking old. The game was made in the late 1990s and you can see that games developed quite much since then.\n(Thanks to a quite active modder-scene several mods have been released that make the game better looking.)\nIn my case I don't care about that, because the game lives by a fascinating atmosphere, not by it's graphics.\nThe sounds are amazing for the time being released. It is quite interesting how "surround" the sound is. And well, this game is the example for "footsteps". Listening to them you can define how far an enemy is, how loud you are and how much attaction you will get. So leave your stepdance-shoes alone and take the "sneakers"...\n\n\nGameplay:\nThe controls work quite good, the stealth system is the best I've seen in a game so far.\nYou should use the shadows (It has some reason the subtittle is "the DARK project"), avoid noise, steal as much as you can and never be seen by the guards. Else the game will be quite short... So stay in the dark.\n\nYou will see it takes a lot of patience for this game. Looking for gaps in the patrols, seeking the dark corners of a house, most time hidden. If you love modern shooters do me a favour and buy them, but not THIS game...\n\nThe "hud" of the game has a small bar, that shows you how visible you are. A revolutionary concept in it's release. Did I mention: "stay in the dark"?\n\nLoot is essential to buy stuff for the next level. Every worthy thing you steal will be sold and the money will be added to your funds. Buy a moss-arrow? Go for it. Buy some flash-bombs? Here you go. You need an water arrow to put out torches? You're welcome.\n\nStory:\nWell, I won't spoiler anything here now. You are a thief in the "middle ages". Stay in the dark and steal as much as you can. The rest you will see...\n\nTo come to an end:\nA great game (in my case THE greatest game of all times) worth buying it (even after so many years).\n...\n...\n...\nDid I mention: Stay in the dark?","December 10, 2013","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And in order to avoid any spoilers... well, let's just say things get complicated.\n\nThis is the first game in the Thief series and the extended edition of Thief: The Dark Project.  It includes all of the original game content and features three new missions adapted to the original storyline along with full voice acting and new graphics.\n\nTLDR Highlights:\n+++ Stealth Gameplay and Utilities\n++ Voice Acting\n+ Improved (but still old) Graphics\n\n-- Slow Start/Story\n- Wonky Hit-boxes\n\n= No wonder it's such a beloved classic!  The old graphics might turn some people off, but if you can get past it, then I highly recommend playing this one.\n\nReview:\nPROS -- The main feature of this game is also the very best thing about it:  stealth gameplay.  I also believe this game is the first to use first-person 3D stealth, which is honestly pretty amazing considering how good it is!  Near the beginning of the game, I was trying to hide in the shadows but it wasn't dark enough thanks to some torches.  Now, this is my very first time ever playing this game, so at first I just made do, thinking this game was far too old to have useful mechanics like removing the torches or, better yet, putting them out somehow.  Sure enough, I found water arrows in my inventory and was able to shoot them at torches to put them out and create more shadows!  There's also rope arrows, noisemaker arrows, moss arrows (to create a quieter surface to walk on), not to mention a blackjack and the need for multiple kinds of lockpicks that somehow made me feel like I was actually picking locks even though the mechanic is extremely simple.  All of this and more are what make the game fun.  Master them, and you'll look be running around like a Master Thief in no time!!\n\nSince I never played the original version of this game, I can't compare how the voice acting now compares to how things were then, but I can say that I'm very impressed with it in Thief Gold.

As someone who played this when it first came out, there are play styles which are not rewarded in-game, but are infinitely satisfying: steal all the loot, use nothing which could be found later (water arrows, noise arrows, etc) and knock no one out.  The aftermath is that everything valuable is gone from the house, there are no clues, and no guard saw anything...do this and you aren't a thief - you're a shadow!","March 18","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally found the game quite long.  Each level is just as the other (These levels can be massive!!!), walk into a building/area, each unique to one another, just to find that there a multiple ways to complete most of the quests.  For example, steal a key from a guard, open the front doors, overhear a guard talk about a back entrance, or find a hidden passage which you heard from a diary within this environment.  The possibilities are endless!!! I highly recemend this game also because it is such a revolutionary title.  This game is the first game to apply lighting and sound to the stealth franchise.  Great consept even though the story may be lacking and the dialog sound terrible. The combat is perposefully bad since this game highly supports the idea of stealth and making sure npcs do not even realize your are there.  I personally highly recemend this game to anyone who loves playing classic games, who loves taking their time and thinking things through, who just wants to play a revolutionary game, and wouldn't mind to get their butt kicked in the process through this games purposeful difficulty.","December 21, 2013","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which you should want as the cutscenes are pretty badass for a sixteen or more years old game. Gog's version is either completly or more up to date than Steam's and you don't need to hassle yourself figuring out how to update it yourself. Also the controls are pretty hard to get used for someone who never played this when it was first released. I'd also recommend remapping the controls to something you may be more used. I use ASDW for moving, Shift for fast walk, C for crouch, Z for lean forward, Control for speed toggle, space for jump, and keep the rest the same.\n\nDon't let my hours fool you.

Buy this, and you will not regret it.\n\nA note for those playing on Win7x64: you will need to install a patch to fix the game so that videos and other things work correctly on Windows 7 or higher.\n\nhttp://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=134733","December 31, 2012","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
