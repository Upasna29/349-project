A simple strategy played with toy soldiers that somehow just reels you in. Very easy to pick up, yet it also provides a great challenge. You have three campaigns you can do, each with their own special perks in them. You also have the ability to control airplanes as well as sniper towers and tanks to help yourself out when things get a little overwhelming. It's a fun and quite frankly adorable game with a humorous story and loads of action.

I Hate Tower Defense. However, I loved this game. It is a new spin on the tower down Tower defense. You have the ability to take control of your turrets leading to hours of fun by hitting groups of infantry with a massive howitzer shell. The match starts you with a few seconds to a minute to prepare then the whistle is blown and both sides infantry charge. You have the ability to take control of the default defense, a Sniper tower, which provides a great overview, and chances to pick off pesky stragglers. On top of that, you have the ability to control authentic tanks, each equipped with a main cannon and Nossles on the side that fire gas or flames, or control Fighter-Bombers to shoot bomb enemy planes, Barrage balloons or bomb enemy formations. You can even control authentic looking Bombers with forward and backward facing machine guns. The bomber is equipped with a massive amounts of bombs that replenish after around 5-10 seconds. Great for taking out columns of infantry...or enemy artillery positions. That's right. On some missions, the enemy will have tower defense just like you, making building yours or destroying there's a lot more difficult.\n\nNow let's get to the boss. This game has some interesting bosses, that keep in the time period. Some are failed products, some are only concept some are straight out of the developers minds.\n\nWith 10 hours plus, and I still haven't beat the other campaigns, this game is always fun, whether replaying old levels on Elite, where turrets you control only fire to playing just for fun, this game will be hours of fun.","November 23, 2014","true","13.9"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

A Great Strategy game, its entertaining and will always keep you coming back, The Game is challenging at some parts but it's Comedy and great gameplay keep you coming back, It's Plastic Soldiers are Hilarious and Are worthwhile to just watch as you Burn them, Blow them up, Shoot them down, and Even gas them. It's added feature in which you Get to Control your Placements directly adds to the fun, In most levels it gives you either a tank or a plane/bomber. These are a fun addition to Tower Defence gaming. However there are some parts where The Inner Console in this comes out in but not to much. Co-op is also present as you can play both locally and Online.  Keep in mind this game isn't really one of those you will spend alot of time playing, Its more of an every once and a while Game. Like if you want to play it in between as a break from all the serious Games. it pulls off the WW1 aspect amazingly\n\nFor me I give it a 9/10, a great game and and I'd reccomend it to anyone who likes strategy games and Tower defence games, it is also an amazing game for those who like the genre of WW1 Games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/98300/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Toy Soldiers, is a single-player tower defense game released in 2012. It was developed by Signal Studios and published by Microsoft. The game is set in World War I, which I believe is historically factual, and allows you, the player, to play as the British and Germans in the two main campaigns, and the French in the smaller third campaign. The idea of the game is you defend your Toy Box from enemies of waves. This is an very simple and neat independent game fit for the casual fan. This review will cover the campaign and level design, the gameplay, performance, the issues, and other minor details.\n\nThe campaign has four campaigns. The first is the main original campaign featuring 12 missions. You play as the British that defend your position against the attack Germans and their units. The second campaign is 12 missions and encompasses the same maps as the first campaign. The only difference is after the completion of the first campaign as the British, you play as the Germans that attempt to retake those positions in a tower defense manner. The third campaign is 3 missions and you play as the French defending against the Germans. The fourth is an additional 3 mission campaign that you defend against the Germans, which have alien-like units. The campaign's basically recount battles in World War I with backstory, meaning there is no original story. This is nothing bad as it is refreshing to have a game set in WW1. I particularly enjoyed the first and third campaign. The first campaign was very good primarily because it was original and enjoyable. For instance, the campaign had a variety of level designs that fit the historical aspect. The third campaign was fun as you were allowed to play as the British with different level designs. As you can tell, I highly liked this game as two campaigns out of three had various levels. Furthermore, the second campaign was sound, however it became very boring as it progressed that I did not finish it because it featured the same maps as the first campaign. While it was refreshing to have night battles and have it be more challenging, I found it highly repetitive. Also, it continued based off the first campaign. For instance, the first campaign required the British to defend against the Germans. The second campaign required the Germans to retake those British-held positions from the first campaign and then defend against a counterattack. I found that to be thoroughly well done. Lastly, I do commend the layout of all the maps, as it added to the game.\n\nToy Soldiers featured beautiful artwork alongside light-hearted animations of characters, which captured the overall bubbly feel of the game despite being set in WW1. Furthermore, the game allows you to control the units you build. For instance, I took screenshots in the battles and I had an artillery unit that I controlled and when it shot, one of the little troopers fell off the platform and had to climb back up, which was funny. The game features playable aircraft and tanks. This is a brilliant and immensely fun feature because one wave will have aircraft, so instead of having Anti-Aircraft units defend against the aircraft, you can launch your airplane and dogfight. It is limited to an extent as these aircrafts are not scripted to attack you, rather always attack your toy box and units. The controlling of units fits with the destruction graphics, as buildings, walls, trees, so forth can be destroyed, adding a layer of realism into the game. There are features in the game that I felt could have been expanded on or features that could have been added in the game. For instance, the first wave of every map has an army of your soldiers running onto the battlefield and attacking the enemy units. While this makes for a very cool visual, I felt this could have been expanded upon, just to add some variety into the gameplay. Furthermore, I assume the playability of tanks and aircraft was to counter the limited number of units in the game, as there were only five units in the game with three upgrades. I do somewhat like this approach as playable aircraft and tanks mix up the gameplay of the game, but maybe one-two more units would have benefitted the game. Lastly, the game would have highly benefitted from a feature that is normal in the tower defense genre, the ability to choose what soldiers our units should attack. For example, I should have the ability to 'tell' my mortar team to attack the last units in its range. I felt this slightly hurt the game.\n\nThe game has a very nice soundtrack that expresses the nature of WW1 and the music within the years of WW1. Within the game, the soundtrack does frequently glitch when controlling units and through the animations. This is nothing too damaging, though it can get annoying.\n\nI had very little performance issues with the game. For the most part, I had a solid 60 FPS. Only one occurrence I dropped to 55+.\n\nThere are some minor issues with the game other than the ones already documented. Things that made the game much more harder was the bug where I could not build a unit on a very important placement. Moreover, there was no saves while in battle, which is very annoying, as things like crashes and little mistakes in-game would have required you to start from the beginning.\n\nToy Soldiers is a simple and nice game. It features fun gameplay elements and enjoyable campaigns. It correctly executes the little things that spice up the game like the animations of soldiers, the playability of aircrafts, and the soundtrack of the game. This game is good, but it has potential to be even better by fixing the issues, expanding on the core gameplay, and differentiating the second campaign. I played most of this game in 10 hours, though I would say with finishing all campaigns and achieving the extras like achievements, a person can probably get up to 20 hours with the game. At $9.99, I would recommend this game, however, I do not because there is a sequel titled 'Toy Soldiers: Complete'. The Complete edition has Toy Soldiers and the sequel Toy Soldiers: Cold War, and more and is priced at $15. I totally recommend skipping this and buying the Complete edition.\n\nCampaign: 7.5/10\nGameplay: 7.75/10\nSound: 7/10\nPerformance: 10/10\nReplay ability: 6.5/10\nOverall: 7.75/10\n\nThanks for reading my review!

Broken barbed wire, shattered wood and dead lifeless plastic scatter the land, with the distinct sound of airplane engines roaring up in the grey skies. Machine gun fire snuffs out the cries and moans of mutilated plastic. Then megatron crushes the laser ship that the french had, and if you thought that wasen't enough, a giant dog 50 times the size of any man comes crashing down, chewing up soldiers like they were beef jerky. This is the First World War.. kinda.\n\nYou play with plastic sets of Signal toys to wage war with your imagination. (like so many of us did back when we were young) Allied forces fight against the Germans in famous battlefields, with seriousness and sillyness mixed together to take the edge off while also keeping you interested.\n\nIt's set up as if you are a child playing with a friend or by yourself, playing out battles with plastic soldiers and tanks. I use to love doing this when I was a child, making the sounds with your mouth and using your hands to simulate explosions.\n\nYou mostly defend using stationary towers. You sometimes have to attack positions to take new locations. You can only place certain towers in certain areas and money is required to buy, repair and upgrade each enplacement. Money is earned by destroying units, placements and getting combo kills on units. Larger zones allow for flak to take care of those pesky planes and blimps and artillery to destroy vehicles or large groups of infantry. Machine guns, mortars and gas are the 3 smaller enplacements and they are deal with more of the smaller and weaker enemies like infantry, calvary and rifleman. All of these towers can be upgraded 3 times, each time giving them different statistics, good and bad. Each level will give you options on what and how to build to complete the job at hand.\n\nOn certain missions, you also get to use different vehicles, like two different tanks, one with gas and a cannon and the other with flamethrowers and a cannon. Two different planes are also given to you: a fighter with machine guns and limited bombs and a bomber with smaller machine guns but unlimited bombs that regenerate over time. All these vehicles can be destroyed or left and will respawn after a short delay. A sniper tower is also usually there, allowing you to take our enemies before your towers even have range.\n\nThere are 12 levels with several different difficulties, each increasing the health, damage and amount of enemies on the battlefield. After completing a level, you will be giving a score and rank according to how well you played during the mission. This is determined with how much money you had at the end of the level, how much time you saved during rounds and the difficulty you played on. There is also a side mission in each level, that gives you a ration item which appears in the showcase. These can be completed by finishing the requirements (like getting a 25x combo with explosives)\n\nA survival mode is also present for when your done the campaign or just taking a break between levels. It allows you to see how long you can survive waves of enemies before you are overrun.\n\nAbout 10 hours of gameplay between survival, campaign and achievement hunting. Unless you are okay with replaying the same levels with different play styles, there isn't a ton of replayability, but it really worth the time and money.\n\nPersonal Rating: 4.5/5","February 25","true","18.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Got the game for next to nothing on sale. If you're familiar with old tabletop wargames using miniatures, the title pretty much tells it all: You get a set of toy soldiers and other units from WWI era. The tanks have a little key on the side and look vaguely like old tin toys. I have a great fondness for these things, but that's me. I openly own and admit my admiration for tabletop wargamers with meticulously well-painted miniatures. It's fine for what it's supposed to be, but don't expect actual tabletop warfare of that nature. This is more of a romantic homage without the bits that really appeal to adult fans of the hobby. Still, it's not awful, just not for everyone. You get more of a tower defense game with specific points where you can place specific units. You can climb in and take over a given unit to improve accuracy and excitement, or you can just allow matters to run their course. You probably really need to get in there and fight to win. Strategic aspect of this game is very low, at least on easy. I'm not interested in playing this on a higher difficulty because I really don't see it being anything more than what it is: Arcade action with toy soldiers and various era-specific units. If you have a romantic interest in this type of thing, maybe check it out for a dollar or two. I like it okay, but I won't be playing it a lot. I'd rather play actual tabletop miniature games than this to be honest.","August 29, 2014","true","2.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The rule is simple protect your toy box against atacks of planes, soldiers, tanks, big bosses and others nasty things with MGs, cannons, aa guns etc. which you can buy and upgrade. You can take direct control over your "turrent" or if its boring for you on some maps you can control tank, sniper or planes. This all gives a lot of fun, driving over enemy wave of infantry with tank, making kamikaze atack with plane. If you look for a challenge there is "do it all by yourself" (literally) mode where turrents wont make a shoot without your direct control.\n\nBonus: When you see 40 toy soldiers killed by 1 upgraded cannon shot, more killed by MG and last of them finished by flames or chemical weapon you realised how World War 1 soldiers lifes was ♥♥♥♥ed.","June 14, 2015","true","15.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

Toy Soldiers is a tower defense strategy based game revolving around WW1 based action figures fighting to the death to either destroy your base, or defend it. Your mission is to defend your base, or Toy Box from the enemy. Your Toy Box will take damage if an enemy troop reaches it, and if enough troops make it to your Toy Box, you loose the level. Along with numerous variants of troops (soldiers, tanks, planes, ect) you have a variety of turrets to deploy as well. From artillery to machine guns, to even gas, finding the perfect set is sometimes challenging(I Recommend using a healthy diet of Machine Guns and Mortars with a pinch of Artilery). For every enemy killed you gain money for upgrading turrets and repairing them. Your turrets will attack automatically, but you can control them to kill enemies while earning boosted money drops and damage. There are numerous maps to play through and a total of 3 campaigns to smash though, each having bosses and funny moments. For someone whose never heard about this fun and cool game, I HIGHLY recommend this game. 9/10","August 30, 2014","true","1.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Some levels also allow you to take control of a tank/aircraft/sniper.\n\nThere's a good range of difficulties, from Casual to "Elite".\n\nMy main criticism is that many levels allow for the cheese of slaughtering freshly spawned units before they 'launch', giving silly amounts of money.","March 31, 2013","true","23.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not the greatest of games but does provide a little fun and would appeal to a younger generation.\n\nI recommend this game precariously. I would only buy it on sale.\n\nThe game's pretense is a tower defense where when the game starts soldiers begin to charge at the enemy, as well as the enemy begins coming towards you. You are able to build different WW1 "defense" towers which are howitzers, machine guns, or artillery. What is cool is you are able to control these units independently. For this reason I bought the game. Towers can be upgraded and a sniper tower is always at the players disposal. The objective is to protect your toy box from invaders. Levels at the end sometimes have giant bosses (like this huge howitzer moving thing) that you have to take down.\n\nThe one issue though is that you cannot send or control the initial units that charge at the enemy or defend your towers. Rather they charge blindly and die, and cannot be re-used or re-trained or re-built. I find this is the games greatest downfall.\n\nAlthough recommended by me (but not officially on steam), I'd have to give it a max of :\n\n\nRATING : 6.5/10","January 5, 2015","false","1.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zagrava/recommended/98300/","zagrava","Zagrava","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zagrava/","335 products in account","There's no better premise for a tower defence game with a bit of driveable vehicles than a game played with actual toys and miniatures. It also gets the period extremely well, and by period I mean Modern, not actual war. There are some levels that do remind you of how horrible it actually was but overall it's just gassing them tin Kaiser soldiers for jolly ol' fun (yes, there is a gas brigade miniature).\n\nThe gameplay mechanics themselves are pretty standard fare but you can take manual control of any tower or a tank/plane  provided the level has one, plus there is a combo system only working in manual control. The highest, Elite difficulty, has any tech work only if you have it on manual; but that just seems more suitable for the types counting seashells and putting them in straight lines, so I skipped it.\n\nIn total there are 18 levels (12 original + 3 in DLC1 + 3 in DLC2), NG+ and a survival mode. That seemed enough for me, especially for the chump change I bought it.\n\nGrafics do show its age, since it's Xbox 360 game and all, but they still seem rather nice-looking, in my opinion. Music was also OK but nothing too special.\n\nBottom line, if you want a good WW1 tower defence game, this is just for you. HOWEVER, devs seem to be combining previously 360-only sequel and this game in one nice package. It's in Early Access now but you know how Early Access can be so decide for yourself.\n\nP.S.: There is NO GFWL forced on you: you can choose between two versions (Steamworks and the one you'll never play) on launch. Don't worry about that.","January 4, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The graphics are great and the maps rather large. A good balance and Strategy is need but overall it can be repetitive at times. About 7 hours in and i've completed the main game yet there are two more modes playing as the Germans and a Survival mode for extra replay. You get 4 towers all with three upgrades.\n\nMy only problems are the max supported res is 1680 x 1050 and no graphical options. In others words a pure console port.\n\nA great game, very cheap and well worth the price.

This adds a little hands-on action to the game so you don't get bored.  As you get better in the game, you'll often find that you need to think and act quick during some of the more intense moments.  The PC version includes two expansion packs, and a set of new maps are unlocked after you finish the normal campaign.  Add in a survival mode and this is a very good value.  FYI...

Do you crave for more WW1 themed games instead of all this modern warfare rubbish we get fed every single dang day? Maybe this game might interest you...\n\nToy Soldiers is a game about little army men duking it out on various gameboards, one side having to defend themselves against waves of the enemy using tactical placement of machine guns and artillery, as well as deploying early tanks and aircraft to help weakin the attacking force until they can no longer charge your HQ. At first, it might not sound like much, but once you start playing you fall in love with this well made game.\n\nFor one, WW1 is the perfect setting for a tower defence game, considering the infamous nature of the war. What also helps set this apart from other TD games is how much more "open" it is when it comes to dealing with enemy waves. In most TD games, enemies march in single file, which honestly is a rather underwhelming display of power and tactics.. While in a way, they still march towards you in a line here, it is a much looser, more widened line, making it feel more like an enemy army is charging at you rather than a big cluster of random thugs effortlessly walking towards your base. Also unlike other TDs, in some maps you have to go on the offencive in order to win the day, which caught me off guard when it happened and amused me quite a bit when I was given control of an early tank and sent to take ground for my defending force and expand my influance on the battlefield.\n\nThere is plenty of content to keep you busy for a fair few hours as well, so your money doesn't go to waste should you invest in this title. I wish I could go on, but I don't want to drone on and on about all the good things about the game. The only problem this game has is that it might not work on all computers, due to it being a port of an Xbox game.. But if you can get it to work, it is a lovely game to play, and if you love the first World War, I do suggest you get this delightful title if you can afford it.","October 31, 2014","true","17.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A game where you can actually command your units. It doesn't look all that bad either, but there's way too much bloom in it. The game itself can be finished in roughly 4 or 5 hours and after that you can play the DLC, of course.\nAlso, a fast forward button would've been nice to have because units move at a fairly slow pace.\nAnd the game doesn't support really high resolutions (2560x1440), which is a shame. I thought this would be fixed with a patch, but unfortunately that never happened.\nStill, a good game !\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","June 9, 2012","true","9.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But I just didn't feel a sense of progression or purpose behind the levels. It just feels like I'm roughly doing the same thing each time I play.\n\nThey try and spice it up by allowing you to control towers and aircrafts, but this didn't really do anything for me.\n\nIf you really like tower defense games, give this one a go and you might like it.\n\nFor me, I just didn't really connect with it.","May 17","false","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is one of the greatestt WW1 Strategy-Turn-Based game. I love the option of you being able to go into your weapon you planted. The AI aren't sometimes the brightest but they get the job done. I usuall just go into the option so I can use the weapon. I had a couple dollars so I though of buying this. I ended up buying it on Steam of course because I knew it was going to be fun. So when I started it up, I just played for hours. I had tons of fun. I must say if your a kid and your parents don't like "bloody" games, Well then get this they just blow up into little Toy pieces of there "toy" body. To be honest I must say it does look old timey, so it matches perfectly with the WW1 setting, also I might have to add that the toys look very much like toy figures. Well that's all I really have to say about this game. Just buy it. I bought this on sale for $2, but if I had to pay $10 I would, this game is all worth it.","January 1, 2015","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you liked playing those 2D "shooter" flash games on Newgrounds in 2007 where everything acted like a point-and-click-adventure and the enemies were stick figures created in microsoft paint, then this could be the game you have been searching for.\n\nThere are two glaring problems with the game:\n\n1. It isn't fun.\n2. Every redeeming feature present in this game has been done better several times over in different games.\n\nPROS:\nThe marketting for the game was great.\nThe graphics are quite nice.\nThe menu controls are great.\nThe cut scenes are nice.\nThe idea behind the game is solid, the execution is somewhat lacking.\n\nCONS:\nThe in-game controls are not fantastic. It's a strange day when almost the entire gameplay exists with you sniping things, yet it really has to be used with a gamepad controller.\nThe levels are repetitive.\nThe game seems more confused about what it is supposed to be than I am....\n-Is it a tower defence? Well... kind of? Except building towers is negligable when all you do is sit in a zoomed in sniper scope shooting infantry. So it's not a tower defence game. If you were into tower defence with high levels of interactivity many better games exist - think dungeon defenders, etc. If you are more interested in building and layout then browser games are far better than this.\n-Is it a First-person shooter? I guess not... not really? It is true that you spend most of the game zoomed in through a sniper scope picking off enemies walking slowly towards you in straight lines, however it would have to be the worst FPS game of all time if it fell into the category. Controls are sloppy, you are in an immobile turret, enemy hitboxes are off, the game pace is incredibly lethargic, you click the mouse and the person falls over, blah blah. So no, it is not a FPS, not one from this millenium.\n-Is it a story-telling game concerning the war? No. No sir.\n-So what is it? Who knows? Apparently popular on xBox live it got ported to PC and now on the eve of 2015 still costs $10.00AUD despite the fact I was probably the only person who ever bought it and will ever review it.\n\nIf you like tower defence, buy a tower defence game interactive/not.\nIf you like FPS buy one of those, hell, buy a text-based adventure game and it would probably be mnore up your alley.\nIf you find fun to be repulsive and boredom to be zen then look into this game.","December 15, 2014","false","0.6"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","4","12","0","2"

Spectacular! Fun! Exciting!\n\n... but everything changed when you started taking control of your units... The tower defense game quickly turned into... something else. You start as a normal tower defense game, placing artillery and machine guns. Then later you are forced to pilot planes, and take hold of a sniper rifle to get the job done yourself. All of which defeats the purpose of a tower defense. You're basically playing call of duty at that point.\n\nThe worst part about this game is the absolutely intrusive "Windows Live" enforced login, which sometimes makes the game impossible to play.

Most games get around this by adding the defense aspect to another genre like FPS or RPG like action beat em' up.  But this game not only manages to keep the core gameplay of a tower defense the focus while adding fun and exciting ways to assist your towers is a sensible progression befitting the WWI theme.\n\nTaking to sniper turrets and flying biplanes, this game give you much to do rather than just monitor turrets between waves of vicious attackers.  Even the attackers change to real fun historical threats which leads to a lot of puzzle solving in how to tackle your latest challenge.\n\nHighly reccomended, and I'd like to play the expansion sometime where you play through many different eras up to the cold war.","December 29, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a relatively short game, but totally fun and that is coming from a person that normally does not like tower defense games, due to their repetative nature. It's even somewhat educational for those that know nothing about this conflict. The scenes of the battles, while not representative of the actual historic battlefields, are none the less, named after real events. The soldiers and weapons have a basis in reality too.\n\nMy only compaint would be that, at least for me, the controls were not fully explained. I had to figure out some of them by trial and error, which lead to some frustrating moments in the heat of battle.\n\nI bought this game on sale, but it is very well worth the regular price, which is very affordable.

If there is one thing missing from todays game titles then its a decent amount of world war 1 games. Enter toy soldiers. This is an interesting tower defense type game set during world war 1 in Europe. Although you are playing on what is supposed to be a toy game, it feels very much like world war 1 during the trench warfare. You have a limited number of bases where you can place various weapons such as machine guns, mortars and cannons. The enemy, as in other tower defense games attacks in ever increasing waves. You have to protect your toy box (the core) from being destroyed. Each of the weapons will act on its own but at anytime you can take over them and target the enemy yourself. The more enemies you destroy the more currency you earn and therefore are able to place / replace more weapons. At the end of each campaign battle you unlock more authentic WW1 weapons to use in the next fight. The enemy attacks you with soldiers, cavalry and armour. The barb wire slows soldiers who die as they crawl through it. The tanks on the other hand just roll over them and if you don't place your weapon bases carefully its curtains.\n\nIf you like boys toys, WW1 and tower defense games then this is a must.","August 29, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a TD but it also has a first person aspect, and a surprisingly large aspect of strategy.\n\nOn a less gameplay note I also like that since everything is made out to be a toy it isn't as gritty as WWII games tend to be. There is no blood, torture, concentration camps, or really anything that would make someone uneasy. On the contrary, there are things that make quite the opposite effect. Things like desk lamps illuminating the battlefield and war machines that would be completely infeasible in real life.\n\nAll in all, I strongly recommend this game.","August 30, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's pretty much an arcade game and most gamers will easily pick this one up. There's no learning curve and even the flying and steering as well as aiming is quite casual. I bought if for a few bucks and it's fun enough.\n\nThe A.I. is very accurate with the turrets and it's often more efficient to just let the computer do the defending while the player jumps into the vehicles to mop up or to take over some of the turret platforms. The A.I. however has a specific range for each turret and will only fire when enemies enter that range.  If done in manual control, most of your turrets can fire across the map and mow down the enemy before they can even gather up for a proper assault.\n\nThere's not too many variation with the turrets though. I found the flame/gas/spray turrets too short range and inefficient compared to the machine gun. I mostly wind up with howitzers, machine guns and the occasional anti air gun depending on the level.\n\nLike I said the game doesn't really require you to put too much thought into it.  Enemies are quite fragile and even vehicles can die to machine gun fire after some effort. The only difficulty comes from the bosses/mini bosses being bullet sponges.\n\nA cheap game for some casual fun.","September 25, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a relatively short game, but totally fun and that is coming from a person that normally does not like tower defense games, due to their repetative nature. It's even somewhat educational for those that know nothing about this conflict. The scenes of the battles, while not representative of the actual historic battlefields, are none the less, named after real events. The soldiers and weapons have a basis in reality too.\n\nMy only compaint would be that, at least for me, the controls were not fully explained. I had to figure out some of them by trial and error, which lead to some frustrating moments in the heat of battle.\n\nI bought this game on sale, but it is very well worth the regular price, which is very affordable.

Apart from the setting embracing a "old 1900's" toy soldier skin, you play out the levels in theme boxes, if you look at the out of bounds zones you will see the lamps and table that the game has been set on which adds an interesting atmosphere. You can build all sorts of WW1 trench towers, from machine gun nests to gas and, if upgraded, flamethrower bunkers. What I really enjoy about this game that engages me beyond normal tower defense games is that there are tanks and bi-plane spawn zones that you can activate and become part of the fight, the same goes for the towers. You can, say, take control of an artillery piece and use the cannon, subtle note, if you hold down the left click instead of just click, you can guide the shell, to an extent, into its target which is really enjoyable. I would totally recommend this game to any tower defense player and even to some fence riding players since it grabs a bit of hybrid and control that keeps, even me, engaged in the battles!","June 22, 2014","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do you love reading about the Great War? Do you like strategy games? Do you like FPSs ? Do you like WWI dogfights?\nIf you so, then try out 'Toy Soldiers.' This is a gem of a game. It's officially a tower defense game, but it really is a whole lot more. It comes off with a unique and  comfortable feeling to it - I was reminded many times of Battalion Wars on the Gamecube. Loading screens are toy soldier (miniature) boxes and the battles take place on dioramas- like a little kid is playing in his bedroom.\nPlayers fortify certain areas with machine guns, Ack-Acks, howitzers, and other weapons as enemy soldiers, tanks, and planes (in a bonus stage even flying saucers and Feudal knights) assault your lines, attempting to reach your toybox. If so many get in, it's game over (never had it happen personally- but close [down to 1]). To help, players can assume direct control over any of said defenses, turning it into a awesome arcade-style gunning game. If that doesn't tickle your fancy, just plan your defense and watch the battle play out, or maybe personally take control of a tank or aeroplane to counter-attack the enemy lines. The starting campaign follows Great Britain, but a German campaign is unlockable (for den Kaiser!).\nThe sound of the game is perfect. Period music is played in the background of menus, creating a very nostalgic (yet happy) atmosphere. I really wish they offered the soundtrack. Sound effects are all spot on (from what I can tell).\nThe game is also very clean. No blood, swearing, etc., so it can be played by all gamers at any age. If soldiers are hit they burst apart into toy pieces (springs, cogs, etc).\nThis is a great game. If on sale, grab it. If not on sale, still grab it.\n\nThe safety of the toybox depends on you.","June 22, 2014","true","44.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well presented with the battlefield being spread out in front of you and your toy box behind. Your toy box is the enemy toy's target.\nOne of the unusual aspect of this game is that you can manually take control of the turrets, the gas/flamethrower, machine gun, mortar, anti-air and howitzers, all of which you can build and place yourself. On some battlefields there is also the option to take over vehicles or sniper towers! The zoom on snipers is amazing, and the power of a plane flying overhead under your control is extremely good against a lot of targets.\n\nVery good game, great fun. The only problem I have with this is that it's Games for Windows Live *sigh*\n\nWhy would a publisher release a game on Steam and have G4WLive on there too?

Although the basic gameplay in Toy Soldiers is identical to other tower defense titles, what really makes Toy Soldiers stand out is both the World War I atmosphere and the ability to individually control any one of your placed structures in a first person manual mode.  This not only gives the gameplay and extra level of depth, but allows you to watch the battle unfold first hand as well as adding in the twitch element that most tower defense games lack entirely.  These two elements are both so well done that Toy Soldiers definitely stands head and shoulders above most of the similarly priced competition.  Although the Steam Overlay is supported, unfortunately the game only supports resolutions up to 1680x1050, which results in a less than sharp picture on a widescreen monitor.  Minor flaws aside however, Toy Soldiers is a must have game for anyone who is a fan of the genre.","April 27, 2012","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the vehicles are authentically modeled with a bunch of extras that are quite different but keep in tune with the engineering capabilities of the day.\n\nThere is a Space Invaders-esque mission path which is totally different unit-wise, but it is still fun to play.\n\nWhile the graphics aren't the best, this game does hold a decent replayability factor when you crank up the difficulty.  For what it is, it is a very enjoyable game.  Since there are so few games in the WW1 genre, it is a must have.

What separate Toy Soldiers from other tower defense games is the ability to individually control your "towers" and various vehicles to earn combo scores and more money. And it is quite hilarious to take the bi-plane for a dogfight, bomb the enemy with heavy artillery or man the sniper tower and view the battle up close..\n\nIt IS an Xbox LIVE arcade port, but don't let that scare you away. The port is really well made, runs smoothly and you can hardly feel it used to be a console game.

It is a TD but it also has a first person aspect, and a surprisingly large aspect of strategy.\n\nOn a less gameplay note I also like that since everything is made out to be a toy it isn't as gritty as WWII games tend to be. There is no blood, torture, concentration camps, or really anything that would make someone uneasy. On the contrary, there are things that make quite the opposite effect. Things like desk lamps illuminating the battlefield and war machines that would be completely infeasible in real life.\n\nAll in all, I strongly recommend this game.","August 30, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I started playing this after a years break because my first playthrough I couldn't really get into it, and found it boring.\n\nWhether, or not this is your kind of game genre doesn't matter. This game is really fun, and has great detail of thought, and creative structure put into it. It takes a while to grab a hold of your heart, but over time it really becomes addictive.\n\nThe game has a WW1 set-up, pitching little toy soldiers against each other in a minature 'toy battlefield'. You have to set up a variety of defences to guard your base (A toy box) from incoming enemy ranging from infantry, tank, and air units. With each kill brings a small amount of money you can spend to buy more defences, or upgrade current defences to a higher tier. The goal of each mission is the same - Allow no, or few units pass into your toy box. If a certain number of enemy pass into your toy box, then you lose.\n\nThe animations on the soldiers, and great detail on each of the levels really what makes this game special. It's a small little gem that helps pass time. It Isn't made for the hardcore gamer, but I believe It's a game anybody can try, and love.\n\nA great game with a little price tag gets a lot of respect from me.","January 29, 2015","true","44.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this game not only manages to keep the core gameplay of a tower defense the focus while adding fun and exciting ways to assist your towers is a sensible progression befitting the WWI theme.\n\nTaking to sniper turrets and flying biplanes, this game give you much to do rather than just monitor turrets between waves of vicious attackers.  Even the attackers change to real fun historical threats which leads to a lot of puzzle solving in how to tackle your latest challenge.\n\nHighly reccomended, and I'd like to play the expansion sometime where you play through many different eras up to the cold war.","December 29, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Can get annoying at points and some levels are extremely easy and then some look impossible and you have to sign in to or sign up for Live but quite nice I supposee. But overall, great game and I love the WW1 and toy soldier feel to the game and the fact that you can actually take control of the machine gun, AA gun etc which makes the game so much more enjoyable. A great game for £5! But would be nice if they're would be an online side to it, would make the game so much more better!","May 16, 2012","true","37.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I discovered it this holiday and couldn't put it down for a full day and night. It's an easy game to pick up but not easy to master. The later levels get pretty brutal. The balance of difficulty was spot on for me.\n\nToy Soldiers is a unique type of tower defense game. Unlike most in the genre, there's no pre-determined path for your enemies. It's an open battlefield and you have to plan for it, filling your weak spots as you go. It also allows you to take control of any one of your units. That alone really immerses you in the game. In later levels it even gives you your own tanks and planes to pilot.\n\nThe WW1 theme is done incredibly well. The era just seeps through its pores, from music to loading screens to shouts on the battlefield. And I like watching the infantry units striking poses during battle that I'm familiar with from the actual toys. The boss fights take this up a notch. When they roll out at the end of the levels it makes you feel like you're in a period movie, oozing with melodrama and larger-than-life enemies.\n\nIf you're a fan of tower defense or the WW1 era, absolutely get this. The rest of you still have a good chance of finding something to like, as well.","January 4","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
