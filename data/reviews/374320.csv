We continued on throughout Undead Settlement together despite my wariness of him and he helped me take out all the mobs in the surrounding area. After a while, I became accustomed to fighting alongside my newfound friend and started turning my back to him knowing full well that he would protect me to his last, dying breath.\n\nWe were a team. The best of friends, and nothing could stand in our way. He may not have been a Warrior of Sunlight, but Solaire's legacy thrived on within him. Jolly co-operation resumed until we neared the Curse-Rotted Greatwood...  And it was then that I decided to take yet another chance and summon a second Mound-Maker to see if we could rally him to our side.\n\nThe plan seemed successful at first. But it wasn't long before I noticed some suspicious patterns in the phantom's movement, and his interest in my backside became a significant concern. My anxiety was proven justified when the phantom took a swing at me with his greatsword and missed.\n\nMy loyal protector raised both his hand and his middle finger at the attacker, before charging forward with fury the likes of which none in Lothric had seen. He made it his personal duty to end the traitorous life of the one who would dare attempt to strike at me, and before long the violent fool was fleeing from our jolly wrath. He rushed up a ladder and leaped across rooftops before finally dropping a harmful distance to the ground, giving us an opening to attack. My companion launched himself from the rafters and his flowing cape waved majestically in the air as he readied his sword and plunged towards the infidel who would dare spit on the tenets of co-operation and sunlight.\n\nThe valiant protector lunged his sword deep through the attacker's back before he could escape, the weapon grinding through bone and flesh and rendering him a lifeless husk. I dropped down following this, and we waved and spun our capes at one another in excitement and victorious glee.\n\nBut this was the end of our time together. We gave each other one final wave before my friend's body started to fade away as he was whisked back to his own dimension.\n\nIt hit me I'd never see him again.","April 16","true","131.3"," 7,668 of 7,988 people (96%) found this review helpful 3,805 people found this review funny","96","668","7","805","456"

Taking place in the land of Lothric, you will encounter grotesque beasts of the unknown, epic bosses, the most beautiful environments and a lore deeper than any ocean. If you are tired of hand-holding games where the game seems to shove tutorials in your face even to end-game than this is the game for you.\n\nDark Souls is NOT a HARD game.One of the reason that I hold Dark Souls in such high regard is not because of the difficulty but rather the fact that it doesn't treat the player as if they're a child. The game will punish you but know that it doesn't mean the end, rather every death you face is nothing more than a stepping stone to a greater success, a hard earned success is honestly the greatest feeling ever. You will learn new skills and eventually adapt, the game knows you aren't stupid and will treat you like you are; a human, something a lot of games these days are sorely missing.\n\nDifferencesAgain, Dark Souls III feels more like a sequel to Dark Souls I than II ever did. Borrowing things from all their previous games you will see happy changes to the overall game. Fans of Demon Souls will be happy to know that the hub world shares an uncanny resemblance to the Nexus as well as the Maiden. Extremely well designed bosses inspired from the creatures of Bloodborne and its engine as well as Dark Souls II's accessibility to the series.\n\nPositives:    CAMEOS! Returning characters will make appearances.\nExtremely well optimized.\nKeyboard and Mouse controls aren't that bad.\nThere is now no permanent health loss when dying.\nAmazing soundtrack that will soothe your ears.\nExtremely well designed boss fights.\nFull of amazing locations to explore.\nGreat level design.\nRewarding difficulty.\nPlaying CO-OP with a specific player is very easy now.\nStances. Combat has been reworked for the better.\nNo more Soul Memory.\nInteresting NPCs, to encounter and converse with.\nPVP is better than it ever was.\nClasses don't lock you into anything, you can make your build into anything you want, e.g. magic user.\nWorld fits together nicely in a way that makes sense.\nOpen world, areas are massive.\nApproachable systems, deep and very easy to learn and master.\nMage builds are rethinked, they aren't as broken and overpowered like in Dark Souls II.\nMatchmaking is a breeze.\nThis is NOT the final Souls game.\nBACKSTABS ARE BACK! At the very least better executed than in Dark Souls II.\nYou can easily switch between OFFLINE mode & ONLINE mode now.\nNegatives:    Though rarely, at the moment there is a few framerate hiccups but other than that PC version is very well done.\nSomewhat noticeable pop-ins.\nThe world isn't inter-connected like in Dark Souls I which may upset some.\nCAMEOS! Though I've written it as a plus, some may dislike it as some may think of it as lazy where From could've very well created new and interesting characters.\nNot necessarily a negative but having an unstable connection while online will bring you back to the main menu.\nIs this game worth it?Yes, very much so! Though I am biased, this is truly an amazing game. It doesn't matter if you are a veteran, new or old, Dark Souls III takes the best part of all of From's previous games and makes it even better. It surpassed my expectations, even more it completely destroyed what I should expect from a game. All upcoming games, Triple A especially take note, this is how you make a game. This is a true game.\n\nThank you kindly, Alex for giving me the chance to play this wonderful game.","April 14","true","87.8"," 708 of 804 people (88%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","88","708","804","30","76"

Solid 60fps in all areas.) and the game has not crashed, bugged, glitched, trashed my frame-rate, cut my audio or done anything else that is being stated by some users (I'm not claiming that it's not happening, though).\n\nWith that being said\n\nDark Souls 3 is probably my favorite Souls so far when it comes to gameplay. Combat is fast (not as Bloodborne, but just enough to make things more interesting), fluid and thrilling. Enemies are faster, more aggressive and smarter, too. This time, you have Weapon Arts, which are different skills and movesets for several weapons in the game, that when used, consume Focus Points. Yes, the Demon's Souls Mana bar is back. The level design is SO GOOD this time, although it's not as interconnected as Dark Souls 1, it's big to the point of making you feel lost.\n\nI haven't completed Dark Souls 3 yet, but thus far, it has been one of the best experiences I had since The Witcher 3 came out!\n[EDIT] I took around 20 hours to complete the game and kill all the bosses. Didn't do the NPC quests, tho. I was on a solo run. I'll update this part when I get all the achievements.\n\nI 10/10 recommend Dark Souls 3. And for those having several issues with the game, I hope From Soft releases a patch soon, so that all of you can enjoy this great game!\n[EDIT] After complething the game I still 10/10 recommend the game!

Quit the game for 30mins or more, then come back and try again. Or try again the next day.\nDont cheat and DONT lookup on the internet for guide, maps, tips or weapon location, et cetera.\nI know Its tempting to googling for all the secrets and hidden paths, or location for all items and armors. But leave that for your 2nd playthrough.\nThe less you know, the more you gonna enjoy the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Varaladis/recommended/374320/","Varaladis","Varaladis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Varaladis/","228 products in account","To preface this, I bought and played the japanese version on ps4 to completion already.  I cleared the game 4 times on 3 different character builds, and have invested around 85 hours so far.  This is my opinions based on that.\n\nThis is honestly my favorite game of all time.  I love the souls series, and with over 1300 hours put into the other 4 games, this has instantly become my favorite of them.  If you take 35% Demon's Souls, 35% Dark Souls, 15% Bloodborne, and 15% Dark Souls 2, then combine them into one, you will get Dark Souls 3.\n\nStarting off, what the game takes from Demon’s Souls is the tight, sprawling, atmospheric level design, as well as many other references, callbacks, and influences.  From the original Dark Souls, you have incredible bosses, music, NPCs, visually stunning vistas, and interesting lore.  This game feels more like a sequel to Dark Souls 1 than 2 did, with direct references to the game, as opposed to 2's way of saying that "something happened long ago".  From Bloodborne, take the detailed environments, visually impressive graphics (thanks to a new engine), and a dash of enemy and boss designs.  Finally, from Dark Souls 2, take the massive quality of life changes, that make the game more accessible in a positive way.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent gameplay, with a combat feel and speed similar to Dark Souls 1 and Demon's Souls.\n\n+Tons of content, with over 150 different weapons, a wide array of armor sets, and solid amount of spells.\n\n+Extremely detailed and varied world, with attention to level design and smart world building.  Like Dark Souls 2, the game covers a lot of horizontal distance.  However, the world fits together in a way that makes sense.\n\n+The levels are also massive, with some single areas taking up as much space as multiple areas from other games.  There are many paths, shortcuts, and secrets in these giant levels.\n\n+Approachable systems, such as a very simple yet deep upgrade system, where weapons can be upgraded to +5 or +10, and infused with a element or scaling path, similar to Dark Souls 2.  However, the paths are much more interesting, such as a strength scaling, quality scaling, luck scaling, and many other paths, in a very Demon's Souls-y way.\n\n+The return of exclusively using estus to heal.  No more lifegems or blood vials.  There is a Dark Souls 2 system of upgrading the estus, however you start with 4 charges instead of 1.  Divine blessings still exist but are very rare and you can only carry 1 at a time.\n\n+I was personally not disappointed by a single boss, area, or enemy in the game.  There was no drop in quality like Dark Souls 1, lackluster areas like Dark Souls 2, or annoying, tedious grinds, like Bloodborne.  There was a smooth difficulty curve that increased as the quality of the areas and bosses did, all the way to the end of the game.\n\n+Mound makers is one of the coolest covenants in a souls game.  The way they work is to leave your white sign, however when you are summoned you are hostile to the host, summoned phantoms, invading phantoms, and enemies.  Your task is to kill a phantom of any kind, so they act as a sort of wild card.  Every encounter I have had with mound makers has been a fun time.\n\n+The matchmaking, at least on ps4, has been incredible.  Very similar to the speed of dark souls 2, but with the password system of bloodborne.  Multiplayer with friends is very fast, and can be done immedietely after the tutorial boss.  The pvp also takes a 2 hit combo system from dark souls 2, where it's relatively impossible to get stunlocked to death unless you get ganked.  Backstabs are also a non-issue, unless possibly the other player has a horrible connection.\n\n+Amazing soundtrack, one of the best in the series.  So many good songs.\n\nHowever, there are a few problems that some may have with the game:\n-Magic is pretty hard early game, other than maybe pyromancy.  When trying to play a mage, you have a lot more stats to focus on, and it takes a very deep investment in faith or intelligence for spells to get really strong.  I played a magic character as one of my characters, and I constantly struggled with whether i wanted to upgrade int for better spells/damage, attunement for more mana and spell slots, str/dex to get a better backup weapon, and health since you start with extremely low health.  The cast speed also feels really slow, and you can't cancel casts.  With an increase in aggression, and low health, starting as a spellcaster is very challenging for the first third of the game.  It is doable however, and by the end of the game is very viable and will hit very hard.\n\n-Encounters take a very ambush-y and gank-y approach to them.  This is not a bad thing for me personally, but I know a lot of people dislike this method of approach, and there is a lot of it in Dark Souls 3.  With magic being as slow as it is, it makes playing a mage even harder than it already was.\n\n-The world is not interconnected like Dark Souls 1 is.  There are no inter-level shortcuts and areas with multiple entrances and exits.  This is a non-issue for me, because the level design was so good that it didn't matter to me.  However, I know that one of the biggest draws for people regarding Dark Souls 1 was how the world was connected.  So this will be a negative for a lot of people.\n\n-There is a lack of interesting covenants to take the place of the ratbros or gravelords.  Most of the covenants have a typical function.  Coop, invasions, or protection of a host/area.  This is a let down, as the weirder covenants were some of the more fun covenants that existed.\n\n-This is one of my biggest negatives, but also not a big issue in the grand scheme of things.  There are 2 returning covenants in the game that perform the exact same duties.  The blue sentinals from dark souls 2 and the blades of the darkmoon from dark souls 1.  I really do not see the point in having both of these covenants.  The way darkmoons should work is to use the eye orb to invade the world of sinners who invade other players, and let blue sentinels do the guarding of the way of the blue members.  This just feels incredibly lazy, redundant, and a massive oversight into the possibilities of the coolness of the darkmoons.\n\n-Probably the most objective negative is with some weapon variety.  A lot of weapons have copy pasted movesets, with only the weapon art to differentiate them, and sometimes not even that.  A lot of weapons are objectively worse than others for this reason.  Boss soul weapons are also disappointingly underwhelming.  However each weapon class is very fun and different, so even if many play the same between weapon classes, there is lots of types to play with.\n\nThose cons aside, this game is incredible.  I highly recommend it, whether you are a fan of the series or not.  It takes all the best parts of the other games, mixes it into a nice dish, and adds its own twist to make it stand above the sum of its parts.  I was blown away, and it surpassed my expectations, which were already extremely high.  I hope that the multiplayer lasts a long time, as I will be playing for years to come.","April 11","true","134.6"," 910 of 1,123 people (81%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","81","910","1","39","31"

Really hyped, really excited. I enjoyed every second i played this game. The graphics, the map layout with its shortcuts and stuff, the difficulty and the story.\n\nBut then, at around 56 hours, i got a "warning" For using invalid data. I said to myself: What? Must be a bug, did not use anything to cheat or to alter my data. But the warning remained there, and each time i was thinking more and more bad stuff that could happen. I searched online and found literally thousands of players having the same problem. Reddit was on fire, steam group was on fire, even some journalistic websites reported this issue. I started searching for a clue as the majority of these people were banned after a while and i did not want that to happen to me. Was it a program that is conflicting with the game like Shadowplay or the Elite Xbox Controller app for windows 10? Was it msi's oc app or Discord which both have built in overlays? Was it the cheater i once summoned for the Aldritch Boss fight?\n\nSince then, i did not play the game in fear something would happen. My gaming experience from this is totally ruined. I periodically check the game message in the starting screen and then log out again. This is just outrageous for a game worth 60 Euros. The company has yet to release a statement, customer support does not give replies and everyone is in the dark.\nTl;dr: Despite the fact that this is a beautiful game that lives up to the hype, due to the fact that they are banning random people for no reason i can not recommend buying this game.

While I will continue playing this game even after completing it; I wanted to give you guys a proper review.\n\nProsEnvironment is breath taking, and puts the earlier Dark Souls games to shame in comparison.\nFar more interesting enemies than humans in armor, including bosses.\nNostalgia is strong with this game, and you'll love every reference thrown your way.\nAI improved dramatically, so enemies are going to give you a challenge.\nWeapon variety is great, which also applies to armor.\nArmor cannot be upgraded, so wear whatever you want. Fashion souls is back!\nIf you love exploring, this game will consume you. Easy to get lost in.\nSo many shortcuts, secrets, illusionary walls, you'll always stumble on something new.\nCo-op is easy to access, and hardly any problems with the server.\nCharacter creation offers a ton of options for making your character stand out.\nEach weapon has a special ability, making each one unique on it's own.\nNPCs are really developed, and don't stay in one spot. They're also very likable too.\nQuests are back, so you can go back to certain areas and activate new events.\nIf you like horror films, this game has some nightmare fuel for yah.\nCan now get your flask out during a fight without searching through slots (hold down on down depad).\nReplayability is a solid option for sure. You'll most likely have multiple playthroughs.\nEnemies don't despawn, so you can grind to your heart's content.\nYour covenant changes the kind of invader you are (sunlight makes you a golden red phantom).\nSoul Memory is gone, so get as many souls as you want for upgrades / items.\nFour endings to earn, each offering a strong impact to the story.\nConsHeavily influenced by Bloodborne's mechanics, so most enemies are fast & furious.\nEnemies don't really have a stamina limit, so they can spam their combos for awhile.\nLack of spells, hexes, miracles, and pyromancies. They're all cool, but not many to be found.\nPvP is sluggish, inferior to Dark Soul 2's PvP which was fun and balanced.\nCertain enemies can't be beaten unless you have certain items or do certain tasks.\nGame can feel short if you don't take the time to explore any optional areas.\nUntil you reach more than half way into the game, weapons are hard to upgrade.\nToo many ambushes, which leaves you less surprised when it happens again.\nMost enemies have higher poise than you, so you're going to be dodging / blocking more often.\nGame is more demanding with graphics than Dark Souls 2, so you might need to turn certain options on low.\nCertain areas make the FPS drop, or lag so be ready for that.\nTends to crash now and again, depending on what you're doing.\nCovenants are weak, and not satisfying to rank up in.\nInvasions / invading isn't fun because again PvP is sluggish, wonky and poorly done.\nNPCs can die easily from anything, so an enemy can kill them during mid conversation.\nEmber is hard to find, but luckily helping hosts gives you one per successful mission.\nNPC enemies / invaders deal more damage, have more HP & poise than you. Unfair.\nCan lose the chance on getting items / armor if particular quests failed.\nGreatswords and weapons alike are either weak or OP, there is no middle ground.\nGame rewards you for being aggressive & spamming over thinking carefully like previous games.\nLuck is useless due to the fact you can grind enemies without them despawning.\nConclusionIs Dark Souls III worth getting? YES. It's an excellent game and despite there's a lot of issues I have here and there with it, they did an excellent job making this game spectacular. NPCs are engaging & very interesting, bosses along with nearly every enemy possess unique designs, almost all the weapons are handy in doing something useful, co-op is very enjoyable to be a part of, scenery & the setting is absolutely beautiful (even in the areas meant to look ugly are appealing to the eye), and each build is going to be fun to experiment with. Granted, it's a shame that the game wants you to play it like you're in Bloodborne instead and most of the enemies are way to hostile & fast for their own good, but otherwise this game is a solid 8.5 out of 10 for me. Worth full price, plus we haven't even gotten the DLC yet! Hope you guys were able to get most out of my review, and please feel free to ask me any questions about the game!","April 15","true","173.8"," 293 of 388 people (76%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","76","293","388","18","38"

It wasn't always like this. While From Software have been making these kinds of games as far back as the PS One with the King's Field series (a series I unfortunately never got the chance to play) it wasn't until a niche title know as Demon Souls debuted on the PS3 that they really started gaining traction with the modern gamer. Demon Souls wasn't even a proposed western release at one point with the Sony funded game. In fact when the game was shown to Sony heads they hated it believing that the audience for such a game would be minuscule (considering how babied of late we as gamer's have become with quest markers pointing us in the right direction and elaborate and very clearly detailed stories that require very little attention from the modern gamer). Oh how wrong they where. While one could still consider Demon Souls niche it wasn't until the multi-platform release of Dark Souls (a game that built upon Demon Souls foundation and improved it) debuted to rapturous applause from gamer's and critics alike. Dark Souls launched at the same time time as another RPG behemoth Elder Scroll: Skyrim. While sales figures favored the trusted and more well know franchise, personally 2011 best RPG in my opinion was From Software's Magnum Opus Dark Souls.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=669247486\nThe intervening years between the first Souls game and the current iteration, unsurprisingly called Dark Souls III, have been good to From. For one thing the games fan base has certainly grown exponentially. While Dark Souls II might have been a slight misstep (it is my least favorite in the series but don't take that as a full blown negative because it still ranks up there with some of the best games released) I can happily report that Dark Souls III is an excellent return to form for the series, especially those of us who preferred the first versions interconnected world. As far as the series goes Dark Souls III actually emerges victorious as my favorite Soul's game in the franchise.\n\nI am by no means what you would call good at these games. I certainly haven't dedicated hours upon hours honing my craft playing the PvP experience so for me each new Souls game is really an exhausting trial by fire, or ember in this case. Dark Souls III is no different in that regard. While it might seem slightly more welcoming to the new comers, especially the first few boss fights, there is a very steep up-curve around the midway mark that often had me crying out in frustration (and I mean actual crying). Personally I found Dark Souls III more challenging than the previous two but I think a lot of that has to do with the slight adjustment to play-style this latest version adopts. Where the first two where choreographed and meticulous dances of death, Dark Souls III wastes no time showing you just how aggressive it can be. I am told this is a spill over from the PS4 exclusive Bloodborne, another From Software title released exclusively to the PS4 early last year. Having never played Bloodborne (I don't own a PS4 and don't see that changing anytime soon no matter how badly I would love to experience the game), I initially found the games aggressiveness quite alarming at first as I struggled through the first few areas trying to play the game like I would Dark Souls 1 or 2. I did soon eventually realize that that strategy was no longer cutting the mustard. That being said this isn't Bloodborne 2 and Dark Souls III is still very much a Soul's game thankfully.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=673008483\nWhere Dark Souls III really shines is that it never allows you to hit a level of complacency, which unfortunately the first two in the series allowed. Once you had hit on a killer build the first two in the series became exponentially easier. Also, once mastered, the art of back-stabbing or parrying became the crutch for many upon which foundations where laid. Sure you can still back-stab and parry to your hearts content but the game introduces a continuous series of new enemies - particularly in the form of Red Eyed Knights and NPC invaders that force you to literally adopt different strategies and with immediate effect lest you forfeit your game life. These enemies are incredibly ferocious and leave very little open windows of opportunity with which to strike so time is of the essence. It is also vital that you take these enemies down as quickly as possible because they can really become a nuisance the longer you wait to cull them. Back-stabbing and parrying these enemies is not so easy this time around as they move with lightening speed and hit with brutal force.\n\nLatter bosses, namely Dancer of Boreal Valley, The Nameless King and the final confrontation with the end game boss, the Soul of Cinder, can also be incredulous challenges. Attacking head on with a vastly larger array of move-sets they become a little more difficult to telegraph and can be very trying and frustrating experiences for the solo player. The fact that they move at such a frantic rate unleashing volleys of aggressive blows I can see new comers and non-veterans of the series becoming incredibly frustrated during these encounters. Thankfully most of the bosses allow the player to summon in NCP phantoms to aid in the battles but unfortunately some don't (as the above mentioned - unless I missed a story arc). If you really are struggling at any point you can invite one of the many players into your world to aid you. Doing so does mean you will have to go online and possibly incur the pain (or pleasure) of being invaded by other players. Personally I don't care for this mechanic at all as I prefer my games not being spoiled by others but that is the risk you are going to have to take if you want any form of assistance.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=668625972\nGraphically this is the best looking Souls game to date. Levels are crafted with meticulous care and the world is often one of stark beauty vs grimey ruin and delapidation to explore. Dark Souls III world feels more connected like the Dark Souls I and this is a big positive for me. I enjoy climbing towers and ramparts and being able to see areas I still need to approach or areas I have previously traversed. Considering the games beefy minimum specs the game ran perfectly fine on graphical hardware below the minimum spec. In fact it ran so fine I was getting a constant 50 FPS in most areas with the occasional drop here and there but nothing too noticeable that it detracted from the playing experience. I did encounter the strange bug where the game would continuously freeze at bonfires but apparently lowering the lighting setting to low in the menu resolved this. I was also very fortunate not to experience any kind of crash for the full duration it took me to complete the game.\n\nIf Dark Souls III truely is the final chapter in the series, From as alluded to this on a few occasions, then it's definitely the jewel in the Soul's crown and an incredible way to bow out of the franchise. Dark Souls III hits some very high notes and almost plays out like a greatest hits compilation (right down to the Demon Souls hub) and any Souls fan should be delighted with the outcome. Highly recommended!\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","April 28","true","134.4"," 436 of 596 people (73%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","73","436","596","22","43"

I wouldn't recommend it. Atleast not right now. For you see, the devs went overzealous with their anti-cheat system, so much that it bans legit players for no reason. Of course some might think that it is a small price to pay for getting rid of cheaters and hackers, right?\n\nWRONG!\n\nThis does nothing. In fact players have been using hacked weapons to softban legitimate players by giving them more souls than they should have, thus the anti-cheat system labeling them as cheating. All it took was a few slashes and poof, you're banned. Hard to believe, right? Well, go ahead and google it and see for yourself. The one responsible even streamed the whole thing for a couple of hours, soft banning lots of innocent players. Also, lets not mention the other dozen of possible reasons why you might get banned, such as: crashing due to the game's lightning effect bug, going offline advancing in the story and coming back online only for the game to think that you cheated and got more soules than you had before going offline, using a controller program so you can use your favorite controller, just to name a few from the stop of my head.\n\nSo yes, as awesome as the game is... don't buy it. Not yet, not until the devs fix the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat system they made and start unbanning all the legitimate players.\n\nEDITED: 5/8/2016\n\nI felt like I should correct one of my mistakes, in my anger I failed to explain properly that getting softbanned by a hacker isn't instant and for that I apologies for the misinformation. When you get hit by the hacked weapon you can get rid of the surplus souls by suiciding twice which seems to work and might give some measure of relief for those that might fall victim to such people.\n\nEven so I can't and won't recommend the game, not until they fix this.","May 2","false","108.4"," 252 of 334 people (75%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","75","252","334","10","16"

It  takes place in the same world as the previous titles(though now in Lothric), and includes all the expected puzzles, traps, bloodthirsty enemies, complex/beautiful environments and secrets you could ever want. Dark Souls has a brand new engine this time around, the same as that of Bloodborne; you can really feel the difference in smoothness and graphic quality.\n\nPositives:\nThe legendary difficulty is back(they patched it in before release).\nThis installment easily has the most in-depth fighting system of the series.\nThe lore and narrative are still puzzles in their own right, and there's a lot of it.\nThe game is on par for PC options.\nMost areas will run at 60fps if your computer is within spec. The game is beautiful.\nSoul memory is GONE! WOOO! Also, enemies won't disappear after you kill them a bunch.\nThe boss design, as usual, is on point. They are all unique, scary, and challenging.\nThe soundtracks are amazing, they come to life in the game's best moments.\nThe game start-to-finish without doing any side stuff takes an average of 30 hours.\nThe level design is miles ahead of Dark Souls II, you'll notice that immediately.\nVeterans of the series will be familiar with most systems, like sliding into a new comfy chair.\nCombat has been entirely reworked, down to each individual weapon. Dual-wielding is viable!\nClasses don't lock you into a playstyle, choose what you want and build on it. You can respec too!\nPVP is better than ever, especially with the new covenants!\nOnline functionality has been expanded.\nBased on the ending, this is probably not the final Souls game\nNegatives:\nThe world is kind of linear in some areas, but it's not very noticeable.\nThere are a few framerate and graphical issues. Some areas are worse than others.\nThere is noticeable pop-in.\nSome grinding is neccesary. (May not be a negative for you!)\nKeyboard and mouse controls are just okay(using a controller is highly recommended)(Yeah, that's it. Wow.)\n\nSo is it worth it?\nA thousand times yes. This game takes the best of the previous games and expands upon them. The Souls formula has been entirely reworked, and outfitted with the new Bloodborne engine to deliver a beautiful, polished product. Veterans should feel right at home here, as everything they know and love is in the game waiting for them. Those new to Dark Souls will have no problem using this game as an entrance to the series, as this is really, truley, the ultimate Dark Souls experience.\n\n(Did you like this review?

To help people make an informed decision before buying the game. You should always read multiple reviews, not just one.\n\nIt's with a heavy heart that I write this review. It is of course my personal opinion. As a player with several thousand hours between Demons souls, Dark souls on PS3 and PC, Dark souls 2 on PS3 aswell as on pc, Dark souls 2: SotFS on pc, and Bloodborne on PS4, I feel I am obligated to write this. For the record, this review will change if the current state of the game improves, but as it stands, the game is not worth buying. While yes, it is a souls game, it is in a poor state.\n\nI'll first start by saying that I never played the japanese version, even though it released almost 3 weeks early there. That of course would allow for some sense of reassurance that many of the major issues with networking and balancing would be sorted out by the time of full release. Unfortunately, that's not the case. When the game fully released, the first area of the game after getting to the main hub was in essense broken. For whatever reason, the game made it almost impossible for a lot of people to see summon signs of friends while using the password system. The system that is supposed to make sure that those summon signs were the only ones visible to you and your friends. However, without a password, tons of signs were easily visible. Even if they were useless in the sense that 70% of summon attempts would simply fail and say "unable to summon phantom". So, 3 weeks early and the networking for the first area doesn't even work properly. Alright, moving on to the next area, summon signs without passwords still refused to work on a regular basis, and STILL DO at the time of my writing this. However, passworded signs would show up.\n\nThis brings me to the next glaring issue, there are multiple covenants in the game that are dependant on automatically being summoned for an area to defend it or to defend a player who is already invaded. These covenants were next to useless when the game released as they would never send you to defend the area associated with your covenant. Thus making it that much harder to aquire the covenants items required to rank up to aquire certain spells and rings that are necessary for the acheivements. Unless you want to farm trash mobs for an hour+ to get your covenants drops. That's right, FromSoft was kind enough to add a method of grinding for the covenants that negates even needing to use them. Seems to me they knew that their networking was so broken that they made sure to add an offline method of doing covenants. Before anyone says, "Well they put it there so people can play offline and still do all the covenants and such." I doubt that someone so concerned with collecting all the items and such would play offline.\n\nAnother interesting thing, is that the armor stat "Poise" (it's in armor pieces stat pages, on the character stat page and there's a ring dedicated to boosting poise) is turned off in the config files for players. However, NPC's still have it. It essentially makes actual defense stats more important than anything. Unless you use certain heavy weapons that have infinite poise while using a light attack. It makes trading with heavy weapons an impossibility if you're playing PvP as hitting them before their attack connects does not stun them and leaves you completely open for a full hit, which WILL stun you and give them a free second hit before you're able to roll away. And again, before anyone says "git gud", keep in mind I typically keep my builds lightweight and even use the carthus bloodring to improve my i-frames while dodging. Not being able to interrupt someone simply because their weapon is bigger and happens to give them hyper armor while swinging puts myself at a major disadvantage regardless of any factors.\n\nWhat else... Oh, the mind numbing difficulty of the game... I'm kidding of course. As far as souls games go, Dark souls 3, is objectively the easiest and most forgiving. Not only are most of the larger, tougher enemies either stun lockable with the help of a phantom, but the larger ones can be viceral attacked after connecting a few hits on them, usually killing them. Also, the difference between New Game and NG+ is negligable. I've completely the game 4 times already, both NG and NG+ and have been horribly dissappointed with NG+. The enemies are hardly any tougher, as you're character is already fully geared by the time you get there and just getting more powerful. Not to mention the signature addition of random dark spirit invaders and red phantom versions of normal enemies that would appear in NG+ in previous games, all the way back to Demons Souls. It's not a new concept, and it kept NG+ fresh and exciting. The ONLY thing to look forward to in NG+ over NG in Dark souls 3 is +1 versions of rings. And I've heard that the only thing in NG++ is +2 rings. It's a massive disappointment for more hardcore players like myself that liked the added challenge of turning a corner and running into a skeleton or hollow on steroids that hits twice as hard. It takes a lot of the hardcore "YOU WILL DIE" mentality that's been a trademark for souls games away and instead changed it to "YOU WILL FARM".\n\nI suppose another small thing to note is that large portions of the game feel highly unpolished and rushed. Some areas are breathtakingly beautiful, while others are full of large portions of texture and mesh completely missing, leading to literal holes in the world. Not to mention the weird graphical errors people get where everything goes wire mesh and turns bright shades of purple and green. Or players body texture clipping through armor when you hold a specific type of weapon as a specific gender. Or the fact that on full release, bonfires were one of the most dangerous things in the game, as they would cause a graphics driver kernel crash if you're lighting setting in the options menu was set to anything above low. A real kick in the ribs to players with high end pc's capable of running the game at max settings but being forced to tweak on setting to avoid crashes. Or the fact that after shutting down the game and restarting it, the game had a tendancy to reset the lighting setting to the recommended, detected setting without your knowing, causing crashes that you thought you'd fixed. Another thing of note, is that the game runs like trash on console. It does not play at an acceptable framerate on PS4 compared to pc. Looking at one, then the other, the difference is almost physically sickening.\n\nAs stated above, this is my personal opinion, and this review is subject to being edited if the game sees improvement. I wish I could recommend it, but I simply can't, and it pains me to say that. I hope you found something useful or helpful in my review before making a purchase.

Dark Souls 1 was my favorite, only due to the dark feel and story.  While I enjoyed Dark Souls 2, my biggest complaint was that it never felt like it had any direction, or purpose to follow. Dark Souls 3 fixed that issue, while going back to Dark Souls 1's dark gothic atmosphere. While also bringing in so much awesomeness into the combat system, with the new stances and weapon arts, the game requires a lot more planning to break enemy shields and blocks, and PvP feels more indepth.  Dark Souls 3, is easily my favorite of the 3 games. However, I will say that if you're coming to Dark Souls 3 for the PvP, and expecting a change in the latency, you will be disappointed. There are still huge delays when being invaded and having to fight someone. Another thing which bothers me, while not a major thing, is if you summon someone into your world for help, you WILL be invaded shortly after, which kind of sucks when all you're trying to do is kill a boss or something, the good thing is often you are 2v1, and can easily dispatch the invader.\n\nEither way, I give the game a 9/10, would be 10/10 if the latency issues were addressed.\nIf you enjoyed ANY of the previous Dark Souls, you WILL love this one.","April 17","true","69.8"," 76 of 98 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","76","98","5","2"

I would say the same on the level design, with a central hub and many huge areas connected between them. Slightly more linear than Dark Souls but larger than Bloodborne and waaay more complex than Dark Souls 2: wherever you go there are plenty of secrets and treasures, without considering the amount of creatures, NPCs and missable quest.\n\nIt's the perfect conclusion to a great saga.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bestchromena/recommended/374320/","bestchromena","Chrome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bestchromena/","56 products in account","Hi. I 100% finished the game. Here are my thoughts.\n\n+Game seems more challenging than DS2. Normal mobs seem tougher than the Covetous Demon, Dragon Rider, the Last Giant and many of DS2 bosses combined.\n+Soul Memory is gone. Back to DS1-style matchmaking\n+Not locked to 30 FPS. Cough, DS1, Cough.\n+Connecting to others/playing with friends is even easier than before. Password system works wonders.\n+There are many feature/quality-of-life improvements. There are too many to list them here.\n+Keyboard/Mouse control works great. I never liked using controllers. Are you reading this, DS1?\n\n-New Game+ and beyond rewards nothing new in terms of enemy placements. Enemies are slightly stronger (hardly noticeable) but otherwise, the new playthrough is exactly same as NG. Rings are only slightly better. Except Gold Serpent Ring +2. It's amazing,\n-Terrible frame drop when loading new areas. If your computer isn't Lord Skynet, the game will force you back into the main menu for low FPS. You'll need to restart the game to continue online.\n-If you have just enough stats to wield a weapon in two hands, your status page will not display the true AR chart. Mildly annoying.\n-It takes ages for you to be summoned as a Blade of the Darkmoon or as a Watchdog of Farron. You'll end up doing a lot (like literal days of farming without lengthy online sessions) of farming/grind just to max these covenants out. (If you're interested in getting all achievements)\n-You can tank (partial parry) a hit and immediately continue to parry again. A single reposte will usually kill you because everyone online is a Hornet Ring wearing, twinking asshats.\n-Online player character models sometimes just don't load, becoming completely invisible (but can be locked on).\n-Sometimes, enemy character model won't even have an animation. Leading to hilarious/frustrating duel.\n-There's no Guard Break mechanic from DS2. It takes multiple kicks to break a Greatshield. A smart greatshield user won't let you kick multiple times.\n-40% of invaders are Estoc R1 spammers. The other 40% is impregnable greatshield users. The 10% is Iron Flesh/Sacred Flame glitch users who insta-gib, defenseless people. The last 10% are the noobs that need to git gud. In summary, Iron Pineapple is the bane of all things nice in DS3.\n-Poise still doesn't work like you want it to. Instead, hyper armor is granted to heavier weapons when swinging. Heavy armors will take heavy stat investment with questionable returns.\n\nThat's all I can think of at the moment.\n\nTL;DR version:\n\n+It's better than DS1 and DS2.\n+It's easy to play with friends.\n-Frame drops. If your PC sucks, then you're gonna have a bad time.\n-Online PVP will kill you little on the inside, unless you're a PVP veteran from previous Soul games.","May 6","true","295.2"," 83 of 110 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","83","110","6","4"

However, FROM SOFT has ruined the game for me.\n\n1. Softbaning. According to the anti-cheat software shoving its head up its ♥♥♥ I, and many, many other players, have been softbanned for no reason. CO-OP does not really exist for me any more, and apparently the invaders have given up on trying to get me as well. I'm basically playing a single player version of a multiplayer game because of some formatting error. On top of all that I deleted my main character because I thought it would fix the error message. So there goes 30 hours of my time, FROM, I hope you're happy.\n\n2. Glitches. This game is riddled with glitches. Some of them allow enemies and other creatures to hop around the screen and attack you at lighning speed in seconds. It was not a framerate issue, it just happened for me. My game would sometimes give me delayed responces as well. Sometimes I would try to roll, but it would not happen. I did the most logical thing and tried to roll again, and I just ended up rolling twice. It was NOT a framerate issue.\n\n3. Online Play. I'm not going to lie. My internet connection is not the best, but I get a decient ammount of bandwith that I have little to no trouble with playing other games in multiplayer mode. Most of, if not all, the games that I invaded orwas summoned into had Lagasaurous-Rex teir lag. Players would SLIDE across the screen in their idle position whilst making damaged gasps and attacking sounds. Enemies and BOSSES would revert to these stances whenever my host was attacked by them. It was incredably easy for me to backstab every enemy due to the extreme lag on FROM's servers. The worst part was the invaders and the bosses.\n\nInvaders would do the same thing as the host while attacking in their idle position. invasions turned into a spam fest because no one could tell what the others were doing.\n\nWhen bosses became like this I could not be damaged. I don't know if it was the fact that the boss was nowhere near me due to lag or the fact that an animation had to hit me to damage me. I don't know. However, the fact that this happened is outrageous for a game.\n\nConclusion. Don't buy this game until it has been fixxed. Otherwise you may be banned for no reason, thus limiting the game, become frusterated when glitches ruin your fun, and generally become confused when everyone is in their freaking idle position.","April 27","false","50.5"," 95 of 132 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","95","132","2","2"

Even the complete removal of all game data after receiving the warning, was no guarantee that you wouldn't get penalised (by design, FROM claims, and contrary to everything the "warning" message said or implied.)——\n\nWhile I had fun exploring and collecting everything, I have absolutely no desire to do it again. Since, let's face it, this game isn't all that deep once you have seen everything at least once before. The NG+ cycles are uninspired and unchanging. PVP is the real endgame and I'm barred from it as I write this.\n\nI wouldn’t have bothered if rebirth wasn't a thing, if having a character with all gear to choose from didn't have a tangible benefit. Which is another gripe I have with the game (only 5 rebirths per cycle, no forgoing of SLs, you can't re-roll the starting class) but that is another issue, and one I would begrudgingly accept if everything else worked as it should. Which currently it doesn't.\n\nGet your ♥♥♥♥ together FROM. This is just disgraceful.\n\nUpdate 2016-05-02: Do not bother with Bandai Namco support. I finally got a reply out of them, after a few emails. It was a generic, canned reply saying that I should be patient. Yes, I am patient. Very patient. You have to be, if you are forced to do PVP on the shadow server. Talk about adding insult to injury.\n\nUpdate 2016-05-09: I opened a ticket to see if that works better than email. I linked this review and received a reply within 24 hours, asking me several questions. I answered the questions, but nothing has happened since then.\n\nUpdate 2016-05-13: I don't even care anymore. Praise Steam Family Sharing.\n\nUpdate 2016-05-17: Put in an edit about the warning/ban system as some new information has surfaced.

This third (and supposed to be the last souls ever) boost overall what has been done in the past, for me at least raising the bar for fans and newcommers alike. Many will buy this game not fully getting that's basically a hardcore game, pretty much old school in the way that is meant to reward you for your hard efford, the game have 1 set difficulty and you will have to struggle, maybe coop with friends and try countless times until you get the grip of it, eventually you'll understand the mechanic of the game and you will die in ocations but in the end this is a really amazing journey within a story that i still don't fully understand, before i forget this is an Action RPG game, third person and for new ppl this is NOT something to take it lightly.\n\nFirst steps: At first when you start to understand what's an unkindled, a hallow, a lord of cinder, you will start playing a souls game, you will admire beautiful landscapes, amazing scenes while playing and cutscenes that are really well made until you get frustrated by being killed by any single enemy alone in the game, yet with perseverance comes strenght, you will succed if you keep trying, you will see the amazing many places this game have (tho linear, really restricted) and the amazing bosses and INCREDIBLE soundtrack, the gameplay for me was made to use a controller rather that the keyboard but that's up to you and one final thing, optimization has been done really good but the game's frames drops sometimes so it would be nice a patch to adress those issues.\n\nFinal note: i have so much to say about the souls games and this one in particular, i might update this review later, for me this game it's a bit expensive at the moment but if you're looking for a challange then this is a great game. I'm happy i've got this one.\n\nMetascore: 82/100 "Give it a try, if you don't mind losing your souls, unkindled one :)"","May 4","false","89.6"," 247 of 378 people (65%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","65","247","378","11","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamesear/recommended/374320/","gamesear","Gamesear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamesear/","31 products in account","Ever since I got my hands on Dark Souls 3 I was simply transfixed. All of my waking hours have been spent in an endless pursuit of souls to further grow my collection of fancy weapons, and despite praising the Sun I don't remember the last time I've seen it. I have become something alike the hollows that roam the land, utterly consumed by Dark Souls 3.\n\nAt this point its fairly well known that Dark Souls 3 is good, but I don't think simply 'good' does it justice given that I am currently thinking long and hard on whether Dark Souls 1 is still my favorite game of all time. So what exactly makes Dark Souls 3 so compelling, and how does it match up against the entirety of the extended Souls family?\n\nThe first thing one will notice with Dark Souls 3 is that its an evolution of all the concepts found in previous games, with the biggest influence coming from Bloodborne, what with the numerous dilapidated hamlets, dirty villagers driven mad by things far beyond their understanding, and a constant oppressive aura that spreads throughout the majority of locations. The combat is another good example as its much, much faster than what you might find in Dark Souls 1 and 2, while still retaining that slow, methodical pace we've all come to love about the Souls series.\n\nNaturally, since we as the players get better character handling, faster dodge-rolling, and overall superior combat mechanics, the monsters get their own set of upgrades as well. They are far more aggressive than in previous games, able to chain multiple attacks in order to punish you for expending your stamina, and most importantly, a fair bit smarter than the bunch that precedes them, though they still have issues grasping the concept of doors.\n\nAs for the encounter design, I believe Dark Souls 2's catch phrase fits here rather well: Prepare to die! After seeing players stomp all over their games for a couple of years now, FromSoftware have stopped pulling punches, and have designed enemies and locations in such a way that they will often punish the unwary traveler, while simultaneously greatly rewarding those that think outside of the box.\n\nWhile Dark Souls 3 may be a brutal mistress, it does love you, so almost every time it horrifically murders you, throws you off a cliff, or has rats gnaw on your kneecaps, it also gives you a bonfire shortly afterwards, both as an apology, and as a reward for a battle well fought. The end result of this sort of level design is that I never felt ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off after dying, instead I would keep all of my anger bottled up within me for the 30 seconds it took to run back to where I was, promptly go medieval on whoever killed me, die again because I was reckless, and then finally decide to try and approach the situation like a sane person.\n\nBut perhaps the best encounter-related feature of Dark Souls 3 is that the dreaded puzzle bosses, ie. bosses that require you to deal with secondary mechanics besides simply fighting them, are for once interactive, and most importantly, fun to do. My favorite example of this is a boss fight that occurs relatively early in the game against a Wizard that is weak on his own, but is capable of spawning powerful illusions from the crystals he throws around everywhere. Instead of simply smashing his face in like you would with Pinwheel from Dark Souls 1, you will need to actually deal with the crystals by choosing on the fly which ones to destroy, and which ones to ignore as you endlessly pursue a boss that likes to run away and laugh at you.\n\nThe final thing I want to mention is the exploration as the open-ended levels from Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne are back with a vengeance. There are secrets and side-areas almost everywhere, so much so that despite considering myself an obsessively thorough explorer I managed to completely miss one boss, a fact that a friend who never even touched Dark Souls 3 pointed out to me when he noticed a hillside path I managed to completely gloss over. Worst of all for my sanity, I've found exactly one secret wall, which is just enough to let me know that they exist, and that I've probably missed dozens!\n\nClosing Thoughts\nThere is so much more I want to talk about, but this review is already running long, so allow me to simply end with this: After playing Dark Souls 3 non-stop for the past week, the only thing I am currently looking forward to is playing even more of it. After all, I have to go back and beat the living daylight out of the damn knight that has managed to best me over a dozen times now, because as everyone knows, if you don't beat someone at first, you keep throwing bodies at them until you do!\n\nIf you're interested in a more detailed review, I welcome you to either check out the written version I've done:\nhttp://www.gamesear.com/reviews/dark-souls-3-detailed-review-from-a-long-time-fan\nOr the video review that backs everything up with some pretty pictures:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LNPxb7yxtQ","April 11","true","43.3"," 306 of 476 people (64%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","64","306","476","54","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gatsu_88/recommended/374320/","Gatsu_88","Gatsu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gatsu_88/","234 products in account","I've played all of the Souls games, including Demon's (although never finished it to the very end). Ever since I first played Dark Souls years ago, I fell in love with the franchise. It was the first Souls experience to me. That game showed me that games can still be very challenging, with amazingly well made fantasy worlds including all sorts of nightmarish creatures. Dark Souls 3 continues the epicness the earlier ones had. I love this game, even if some moments felt impossible or quite frustrating lol. It has much of the same old gameplay mechanics from previous games, but with new additions too and the combat is mostly fast-paced.\n\nI feel like it's a great mix of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, without the dash-dodge of BB. The world itself in Dark Souls 3 is amazing in my opinion, not as well made as the perfect design in Dark Souls with those upper and lower journeys, which is the best in the series. But it's still really cool and you can basically go visit every place you see in the distance eventually. That's one thing I love about these games, to feel like you actually are in this huge unkown mysterious world. As previous games, DS3 doesn't hold your hand. You have to figure out where to go, how to fight enemies and bosses, learn their weakness and patterns to win and death will teach you again.\n\nThere were few areas or enemies which I didn't like so much because of reasons, but that is a part of these games. I do love how DS3 pays tribute to DS1 in few ways, but I won't go into more detail about that.\nThe soundtrack is soooo fantastic and introduces many cool songs, which fit well in the intense boss fights to make them even greater :D.\n\nNew monster design is mostly amazing, as I said it reminds me of Bloodborne with certain opponents. Also some of the monsters feels like, as if they were taken inspiration from Berserk manga again as the creator is a fan of it, which is of course really great.\nI have to say that the boss design and fights are some of the best I have ever encountered, there are many memorable ones and at least 3 were really tough to me. One of the bosses felt a bit disappointing because of the way to defeat it, but was still so cool. I think I did every boss fight as solo, except one. And when you do it alone, the feeling and adrenaline rush is so much greater.\n\nThe last boss of DS3 could very well be the hardest fight I've ever fought in games and I loved that, even harder than Artorias of DS1. Part of it could be because having a different build than in previous games so it honestly felt impossible, I dunno. But oh boy...it was just insane and such a thrilling fight. Lots of suffering, but eventually when you survive alone these kind of encounters, that feeling of victory is so good. I don't think many other games give that satisfaction and this is one big reason I love the Souls games. Fighting alone in the dark places, against a gigantic or just ultra aggressive bosses is simply one incredible feeling.\n\nThe multiplayer is similar to DS1. When you summon friends for co-op, they can help you on the road a long time or help kill a boss which is nice. Not badly done like in DS2 where you disappear after killing a couple enemies.\nI've read many being disappointed with the game, like having connection issues or getting banned for no reasons. Which sucks. But I personally barely had any issues as my Chloe in my 60h+ journey, there was perhaps only 5-6 times when I couldn't enter boss fog door to help a fellow player after he summoned me. Because of connection lag, but that's it.\n\nWell it seems I ended up writing more than I first planned :). I say Dark Souls 3 is definitely a worthy send-off to the franchise, as it is informed to be the last one. An epic dark journey and amongst my most favorite experiences ever. I recommend this to those who want to experience challenging and really cool gaming moments. For fans of Souls it's a must.\n10/10","April 29","true","67.3"," 81 of 113 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","81","113","6","12"

The world around you is always changing; you will travel across many landscapes, each of which will surprise you with widely different experiences. And you'll encounter countless NPCs, from minor enemies to major characters, each with their own variances, distinct backgrounds and unique personalities.\n\nBut "Dark Souls 3" is very mature; it doesn't hold your hand and show you how to play or where to go. And with a game this extensive, it can be very easy to miss most of the aforementioned details. For retuning fans and/or generally experienced players, this only makes the game that much more fun as it encourages you to venture earnestly. For newcomers though, it can make the game seem very bland at the start.\n\nEven more so, the combat system in this game, whilst fluent, is very comprehensive making it difficult to grasp. But you can always invite a friend into your world, or any other player(s), to help you out. So, with a bit of patience and tolerance, I doubt not that this game can capture just about anyone. And you won't have worry about competitive gameplay until you near end-game, if you can make it that far.\n\nTo conclude with, Hidetaka Miyazaki, the director of the Dark Souls' franchise, has confirmed that this game would be the last of its series. Would it not be fair to assume that he'd want to go out with a bang? So expect great things to come for this game in the near-future.","April 16","true","162.2"," 80 of 114 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","80","114","4","3"

Really it could. But there are some things that are done way worse than they were even in the least loved by DkS community DkS2.\n\nNo Poise, or as official statement says: Poise wroking "as intended". As it is it's ruining the game. Get staggered in your heavy armor by simple rat jumping at you. Get staggered by any weapon on first attack. This essentially what makes Estoc spammers so obnoxious for many of players, and that's also what makes Straigh Swords so strong (paired with damage and low stamina usage). How FROM made Poise work in DkS3 is laughable, and can't really be considered a proper poise. It affects iFrames recovery for iFrames you lose from getting hit on your rolls. So logic is: get heavyer armor - improve your rolls iFrame recovery, amazing. It is such a situational and meaningless mechanic that it could be just as well not present in game. For proper explanation on how "intended" Poise work you can google reddit post.\n\nWeapon movesets. After DkS2 you would expect to see cool, diverse and unique weapon movesets. WRONG! Welcome to next-gen DkS game, where all weapon categoryes have 2 movesets on average for all the weapons. Boss Soul weapons? Nope, same boring and sometimes even bad movesets.\n\nWeapon arts - while some are OKish. some are just disgustingly bad. Scythe weapon art in particular - about same windup as fully charged heavy attack, but way less damage and requires FP. Landing "headshot" adds a little more damage, but it still does way less than charged heavy, having same windup and readability. Greatswords have same weapon art as straight swords mostly (so ye, same weapon art for 2 weapon types).\n\nWeapons balance - a lot of weapons are just plain better than others. Same goes for some weapon classes.\n\nRecent "April 28th" patch that arrived on May 9th in reality, with 0 responce from Bamco or FROM on the matter in all days inbetween or any sort of apology for delay after. Only PC was affected, consoles were fine.\n\nA big step back from previous game in itemization. In past games you could get all weapons or armor you could see in game, with extremely few exceptions. In DkS3 there are quite a  number of unobtainable armors and weapons you will never get, some of them were just cut and are still present in game data.\n\nAbsolutely same NG+ and on. One of few things DkS2 did right was NG+. It added not just dull "more hp, more damage" difficulty, but also new enemy placement and harder boss fight mechanics. Here it's just +X rings that you can loot.\n\nDarkmoon Covenant/Blue sentinels - broken by design. With removal of sin mechanic and blue eye orbs - good luck getting any action as bluebro on SL meta level. Lots and lots of ppl have this issue, at SL120 you are literally not getting any summons for DAYS. Good luck having fun in this covenant. This is clearly much more of design failure than buggy client/implementation - why would they think that anything good can come out of leaving Blues with only 1 option to be summoned, and that option being pigeonholed even more by requiring hosting players to use Way of Blue AND have area boss not defeated. So pretty much we have huge crowd of eager blues and almost literally no hosts available, because by that SL/weapon upgrade ppl usually have area bosses defeated, or/and they just never use Way of Blue.\n\nRegional matchmaking - absolutely useless. On PC game has 2 regions - Japan and not-Japan. So pretty much all this matchmaking does is filtering out Japaneese players (which is actually yet to be confirmed) if you happen to have it on. Other than that - Australian players will get matched with European players or NA players just as likely as players that are actually are in the same region.\n\nPatchnotes quality - average patchnotes for DkS3 look like this: "We did some tweaking to Axes, changed Swords a bit, and did some other stuff we do. Also some adjustments were made to Rapiers. Go ahead and guess what we actually did."\n\nIf not these issues - it would indeed be the best Dark Souls game. In current state - I would recomment to stay away and at least wait for sale, or untill Poise is added back into game and covenant issues are fixed. I really doubt FROM will ever do anything about weapon problems I pointed out (maybe only in DLC) as well as do anything about patchnotes making sense or apologise for the April 28th patch and complete silence on the issue.\n\nI was really hyped with the game at first and would give it 10/10 at launch. It toned down really fast though, as I started seeing a trend among weapons and unobtainable stuff, then when I by 200th hour of gameplay didn't get summoned as Darkmoon even once (summoning as sunbro worked just fine tho, invasions too), and then April 28th was the last straw.\n\nFROM dropped the ball AGAIN and they need some healthy criticizm, low ratings and negative rewiews to realize that they got to get their sh*t together and start making game awesome as it was with other parts of DkS. I really hope that ppl will start giving negative rewiews and low ratings so FROM actually has to put some effort into fixing the game and their community management.\n\nEDIT: For ppl wondering what was April 28th patch - it was supposed to fix Darkmoon summoning, which it failed to do once it arrived at much later date anyway.\n\nAlso updated poise part with recent official statement in mind, merged my additional comment in.","May 10","false","249.7"," 67 of 93 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","67","93","2","4"

It has a lot of callbacks to prior Souls games.  At first it seemed like a big improvement over DS2, homage to DS1.  Playing through it until the end revealed a lot of gameplay issues and lots of bugs.\n\nFor bugs, there's the ice-skating effect when you summon people online, you even see people's ghosts do this.  That is, there's no animations played, they just move/slide around.  I'd assume this would complicate PvP quite a bit, which I don't partake in personally.  There's numerous issues summoning phantoms, where you try to summon only to have it fail after a short or long while.  There's an issue where once you summon phantoms for a boss behind a fog wall, they will not be able to join, leaving them to have to leave the game and you to re-summon them if you die.\n\nFor gameplay issues, there's issues with poise not working at all on you.  Getting staggered by rats in full armor where you cannot stagger other enemies that are wearing nothing.  There's numerous skills/abilities/spells used by enemies that go through walls.  There's the ability to kite things back to doorways and cheap kill them since they won't go through.\n\nThere's various other one-off bugs and gameplay issues as well that are fairly numerous at this point.  The gameplay issues will most likely never be remedied, the bugs...well maybe eventually but on to my next point.\n\nAs of writing this review, regulation version 1.06 which was to be deployed on 4/28/16 is still not deployed on the servers, and there's no word as to when it will be.  There's also a hacker using a hacked weapon to soft-ban people preventing them from enjoying the online experience and thus ruining their game, and preventing a refund since it's most likely been over 2 hours/2 weeks from point of purchase.  I guess Namco/From deciding to use their own anti-cheat software which is the culprit in this, which is not working as intended.  Again, Namco/From do not seem to care at this point.  It is probably for the best that this is the last in the Dark Souls series, as the series has attracted the lowest common denominator, becoming a mirror for the world it has created.","April 30","false","70.0"," 56 of 75 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","56","75","0","0"

It is one of the best in the Souls series. The scenery is beautiful, the lore is interesting, and the bosses are some of the best in the entire series.\n\nSo why am I giving this product a negative rating, you ask? Well let me answer that question with a question to FROM Software.\n\nWhy the HELL is poise TURNED OFF? That's right. It's fully programmed into the game, but it is disabled. It's displayed in the menus as a character stat, but the game treats all players as if they have ZERO poise. This is not a design choice. This fundamentally BREAKS the game.\n\nLet me put this in perspective for you. There is a ring in the game called the Wolf Ring. In other games, it boosted the pleyer's poise. In this game, it does the exact same thing, except POISE DOES NOTHING in this game. It is disabled. Literally a useless stat. Not only does this break the gameplay, but it is clear that it was meant to be in the game until release because there are items that are advertized as GIVING YOU POISE. Some of the armor in this game has the main strength of having high poise. There is a greatshield with the benefit (STATED SPECIFICALLY IN THE ITEM DESCRIPTION) of giving you a significant poise boost. With all due respect, what the ♥♥♥♥, fromsoft. Fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game.\n\nI will replace this review with a positive one if this issue is ever resolved. It just baffles me how this could happen in the first place.","May 4","false","57.2"," 123 of 189 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","123","189","8","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cAusecArnAge/recommended/374320/","cAusecArnAge","Venom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cAusecArnAge/","103 products in account","Im going to start off by saying this is a review of the games PvP/PvE aspect and the feedback the community has gotten from Fromsoft. If you are only playing this game for the story and are not interested in any of the semantics than I whole heartedly recommend this game to you.\n\nGoing to start off with a series of pros and cons.\n\n-PROS-\n-Gameplay is very fast paced and fluid, I have never had a problem with my movement being stunted or interrupted at all\n-Weapons are very diverse and there are alot of choices this time around, albeit a bit less than Dark Souls 2\n-Every weapon has a very satisfying moveset that really feels like the hits impact and connect\n-Enemies are very memorable and so is every bossfight\n-The levels are very diverse and the final boss was the best boss I have probably ever fought in a videogame.\n\nNow here comes the cons.\n\n-CONS-\n-Incredibly vague patch notes that literally say nothing in terms of information, ie "Performance adjustment for Greatsword" what did you ♥♥♥♥ing adjust???\n-Magic requires a huge stat investment to even consider being viable, Im talking 40-60+ Int/Faith to even START doing any type of damage, and even then the spell "Farron Dart" doesnt even 1 shot the starting enemies, it takes TWO. And not to mention that anyone with half a brain can dodge a spell in PvP.\n-Straightswords are literally the best weapons in the game, there is no point in even using anything else because anything other than a rapier or a straightsword is a complete waste of time and effort because unless you are incredibly consistent at parrying you will ALWAYS get R1 spammed down.\n-Invasions are also a complete waste of time considering that Estus is virtually unpunishable unless you keep CONSTANT pressure, the host has 30% more hp and TWICE the Estus flasks and literally infinite phantoms (Coop players) to summon and just wittle you down until you finally die, and at that point if you do somehow manage to kill all of them, the host will just disconnect. Not to mention that you can't even use the games enemies to your advantage because Seeds of a Giant Tree (Items that turn enemies hostile to invaders, they normally are not) are so ♥♥♥♥ing easy to get.\n-Poise is completely non existant, allowing someone who is wearing a greatshield and the heaviest armor in the ♥♥♥♥ing game to get staggered by an enemy with a ♥♥♥♥ing dagger, when Fromsoft was asked about this, all they had to say was, “The poise stat is working as intended and is not ‘turned off’ as some fans have theorized,” a spokesperson for Bandai Namco told me. “The stat works differently than in past games and is more situational, which seems to be the reason for the confusion.” Even though the stat is literally DISABLED in the games code.\n-Straightswords have literally twice the hitbox than the visual length, and can hit you from what seems like 10 feet away when they are clearly swinging at the air. And no, Im not talking about phantom range, Im literally talking about the hitbox. Outranging even some Ultra Greatswords in length.\n\nIn short, fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game FromSoft.","May 11","false","182.0"," 73 of 106 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","73","106","6","0"

With a Soul Level of 116. Spoilers from here on.\n\nIn short, it's a great Souls game. It feels very focused in most aspects. Changing covenants is easier, armor upgrades are gone, stats are trimmed down, the world feels tighter, grinding for upgrade materials wasn't necessary. I also liked the slightly improved weapon infusing system. There is now a more clear way to infuse weapons with each "elemental" and still have stat scaling while there are "simpler" infusions available of each kind for better base damage output but no scaling at all. Sounds complicated when reading but it's the easiest upgrade system so far. Another mechanical change is that the camera and player movement feel more similar to Dark Souls 1 which I prefer over the feel of Dark Souls 2.\nI enjoyed the pacing and focused design. Reminds me of Demon's Souls.This more focused design also shows itself in the world and bosses. There are fewer bosses and the game generally felt lighter and shorter, seeing DS2. It by no means lacks content though. Especially compared to Dark Souls 2, the world feels more believable and cohesive. The areas themselves are also better designed and most importantly to me, offer much better boss encounters than its predecessor. This makes me most happy as the bosses in DS2 were for the most part lackluster. I thoroughly enjoyed almost each and every boss for their unique designs, unique behaviors and unique flow of battle. Interestingly enough I had the by far easiest time so far in any Souls game with DS3. Not sure if it stems from the experience in the series but on the other hand I've heard of friends with tales of horror about certain bosses which I managed to down on my first or second try.\nIn terms of music Demon's Souls and Dark Souls offer more haunting and memorable tracks but there were several nice ones here that caught my attention. Abyss Watcher and Prince Lothric boss fight music namely. The cast of NPC and the questlines were well done with some personalities being nice additions to the Souls series.\n\nTo my understanding this will be the final entry in the Dark Souls franchise, so it was nice to have references and nods to the whole franchise, starting way from Demon's Souls. I enjoyed reading weapon, armor, spell and item descriptions, vaguely hinting at the players past achievements but the throwbacks don't end here, by far they don't. The blacksmith is the very same Andre of Astora from the first Dark Souls which surprised me since this is taking place apparently a long time after the events of the first game. While him being the single only major identical NPC, I still would have liked it more if he at least was a descendant. Ah well, it was breaking the immersion a bit.\nThere is a fine line between recognizing heritage and recycling and for the most part it's thankfully the former but having seen all the content, there are areas where I would not blame someone for using the word "recycled". Anor Londo is actually not one of those though as it was a very small area, basically a run-up to a boss, so I was absolutely fine with its appearance. Most of all it did not feel like a cheap copy-paste but made sense in the lore and world. Time passed, so it was decaying and crumbling, very well done. Sadly though the existence of Silver Knights was not only done beyond a little nod but felt copied. They added few new attacks but they were the same old Silver Knights with the same old gear, not even brittled or broken to show signs of time! That was a big immersion breaker and I did not enjoy facing them which only became sadder at the amount. The area could have become much more memorable and impactful by making the Silver Knights wear broken, torn-apart armor, maybe even broken weapons and slower, less lively behavior. The way they are depicted though is not well done.\nLater on when you end up in the Untended Graves there is an interesting "Aha" moment upon realizing it's the starting area but that gets replaced by a "Why" moment when you realize it's not that the original area changed its tone and time but this is a parallel world/different area?! Dynamically changing the area from a certain point in the game would have been better. You fight a variant of the same boss and later on fight Black Knights. Similarly to the Silver Knights with almost no differences to Dark Souls 1 but worse as the location does not make much sense. Shame.\nThankfully these "recycled" occurrences were not too much, so I could forget about them once hitting subsequent areas which did not have these issues at all. All in all, I am glad that the Dark Souls franchise is ending as I want to see FromSoftware build a new world with different mechanics, different ideas without expectations & shackles that come with a franchise.\n\nFrom a technical point, Dark Souls 3 has network issues which I have not encountered in previous games. Frequently summoned players become glitched, lacking any animations and just glide which makes for a subpar multiplayer experience. Same happens to the player as a summon in that no enemy or boss has any animations which made for several severely anti-climatic boss fights where this issue obviously occurred for multiple summons who could hammer on a glitched boss without any repercussions. It's not the majority of the multiplayer experience but happens more often than is acceptable.\nOther than that the game shows stutter. It was only mildly annoying and never became a major issue for me thankfully. What did bug me were the load times when browsing through the inventory. The larger images take a second to show which annoyed me.\n\nDespite the lengthy criticism, the positives outweigh them by a landslide and the ups are much, much higher than the lows. Dark Souls 3 is a very good Souls game and stands tall on its own with many of the most memorable and enjoyable areas and boss fights in the whole franchise. I am eagerly awaiting new content, so I have a reason to play more of this gem of a game.","April 21","true","122.7"," 66 of 96 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","66","96","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/374320/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","Dark Souls III is one of those few games that I love dearly, but can’t recommend to everyone because of a number of different issues that bring the experience down. Fans of the series can possibly interpret my review as an overall positive experience, but new folks will need to consider the game more carefully. Hopefully, some of my gripes have already been addressed by developers. Let’s begin with the performance.\n\nDark Souls 3 continues the tradition of having areas that drop frames. It was a mostly stable 60fps experience for me, but dropping frames didn’t do me any favors when I was carefully timing my movements. The frame drops weren’t restricted to one area either. I had this problem over the entire course of the game. Some areas in the later portion of the game were really horrid. What also made me really sour was whenever I lost connection to their servers, I’d be booted back to the title screen instead of just going into offline mode. I’ve seen this happen during a boss fight. I also had a few crashes, but they were rare enough to not be a serious problem. Finally, I joined a significant number of other players’ worlds as a friendly phantom only to not be able to enter the boss’s fog door. For reference, I am using a GTX 970 and an i7 4790K with 8 GBs of RAM and Windows 7.\n\nThe combat in the game is very familiar if you’ve played the previous games, but the weapon variety and weapon skills help spice things up. Wielding a weapon with both hands lets you use its weapon skill which can be anything from a special parry, firing three arrows rapidly, summoning lightning, having a new strong attack combo, a quickstep, or even giving yourself a temporary attack buff. Having more tools to handle a situation is a plus in my book and this game’s implementation of it gives melee players an incentive to put the shield away. Weapon skills being available on every single weapon made combat feel much more entertaining, especially when the boss weapons have some of the boss techniques on them. I didn’t engage much with spellcasting since I heard it required a lot of specialization. Pyromancy is still very accessible for characters, powerful, and looks great. The magic buffs in general are also well worth the effort to acquire for melee characters.\n\nHowever, the combat has significant flaws. Poise doesn’t do what you would expect. Poise didn’t keep me from being staggered by attacks and no matter how much poise I stacked, even the weakest hollows could stagger me without much effort. Because of how poise works in this game, heavy armor doesn’t feel like it’s protecting you as much since stun locks can still happen. I believe some spells and definitely some weapon skills can increase your poise to prevent stagger to allow uninterrupted attacks. For example, the Black Knight Sword has a skill called Perseverance which says “Raise sword… to temporarily boost poise. Damage reduced while activated.” When this skill is used, you can avoid any staggering effects and attack without restraint. Notice how it says it’s raising poise, yet any poise gained from any wearable equipment cannot avoid being staggered. They should have renamed the stat because of how confusing and misleading it is to have two different kinds of poise with very different effects. From what I read, regular poise has to do with vulnerability frames (not i-frames) with rolling. I suppose that’s what they want from players, more rolling.\n\nThe second major problem with combat is how the walls interact with players and enemies. You’ll soon discover that as you try to attack through a solid object, you’ll recoil from the impact. This recoil can occur when fighting near pillars or walls and makes sense when it happens. You don't have Kitty Pryde's phasing abilities. On the other hand, enemy attacks will ignore walls and strike you for full damage. I’ve only seen enemy phantoms and two very large enemies recoil from trying to attack through walls or objects. One of those large enemies threw a chain axe through about 14 feet of wall and managed to hit me. There were far too many instances where enemies could attack through extremely thick walls or obstacles and still hurt you. I wanted tough, but fair, not this nonsense. I’ve even seen some enemies shoot projectiles through walls. I don’t understand why enemies are allowed to ignore solid matter to such a degree. I don’t remember if the other games had this enemy behavior, but it’s really obvious in this installment. At least the boss combat is pretty good.\n\nThe boss fights in DSIII are very well paced and are much more memorable than DSII. There are less bosses which appears to have resulted in higher quality fights with unique and interesting movesets. The overly humanoid setup of DSII didn’t make a comeback for this title. I enjoyed most of the fights and found myself pleasantly surprised at what the bosses brought to the table. Sometimes, the fights can change in a way that I’ll not spoil here. I liked how they were designed, both mechanically and visually.\n\nSpeaking of visuals, Dark Souls III is the best looking one in the series. It’s a gorgeous game with gorgeous views. The environments also tie together pretty well. You can’t exactly travel to all the places by foot, but if you can see it, you can probably go there. I greatly enjoyed how you can constantly see places that you’ve been to in the background which gives a good sense of progress and where you are in the world. Seeing what’s up ahead and thinking “Oh man, do I get to go there too?” is another thing that DSIII does very well. Here’s an example of what I mean from very, very early in the game:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=677462346\nI’d also like to point out that there’s no impossible elevator à la Dark Souls II.\n\nMultiplayer is fairly pleasant, but From Software’s approach to handling cheaters doesn’t seem like the best approach, mostly because of how the innocent are soft-banned along with the guilty. Be sure to never, ever accept an item from a stranger, but unfortunately, sometimes that may not even be enough. In addition to that issue, some of the covenants have difficulty finding hosts. The game’s matchmaking seems too restrictive which doesn’t make sense since it’s capable of scaling players down to the host’s level. If you go and reach a high level with a character, be prepared to have a really difficult time reaching certain covenant ranks. The password matchmaking is quite good and allows friends to easily play with other friends.  Just make sure you both spell the password exactly the same. I spent a large portion of my time engaging in jolly cooperation. I also did deliberate pvp which was also a good deal of fun. The multiplayer functions mostly and it’s fun, but it carries the risk of contracting a digital STD. No one wants to be soft-banned unjustly. Yeesh.\n\nWhew, here are some other things that affected my time with DSIII: I’ve seen my friendly phantoms die to an invader after I finished watching a boss intro cutscene, the patch notes for this game are vague to the point of being almost useless, the camera will sometimes work against you if you’re too close to a wall, and the game has plenty of nods to the previous titles that sometimes turn into full body spasms.\n\nI really enjoyed Dark Souls 3, but hoo boy did I also grow frustrated with the game. I uninstalled and reinstalled it several times before finally keeping it uninstalled. I just grew tired of the problems it has, but I do acknowledge that there’s still a great game in there to be experienced. It’s just a darn shame that they went with the decisions they did that prevent the game from reaching its full potential. I was almost done with NG+ too. If you can look past its issues, prepare to buy.","May 21","false","106.5"," 49 of 71 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","49","71","4","8"

Poise, for some odd reason, has been turned off, giving way to faster weapons being better and weapons that give super armor.\n\nThe Covenants were made easier to switch between as you can just "equip" them but are even less interesting and have some design flaws (Like Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon basically being the same thing).\n\nThe world design is much more linear now, while not a concern of mine, it can be for a lot of people.\n\nAnti-cheat is basically non-existent and is a joke.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kanaev/recommended/374320/","Kanaev","Kanaev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kanaev/","444 products in account",""Greatest hits" album of Souls series and Bloodborne. Instead of creating something new, this game uses a lot of locations / ideas / NPCs / enemies from other games in one bundle.\n\nPVE might have been the best in the series, if not for the lack of poise. The fact is that a meagle rat can interrupt you. You get staggered after a single hit by anything.\nThe combat is still great, if you play as a light weight dodger with fast weapon. If only players had some poise. Enemies DO have it, after all. The system is in the game.\n\nEnemies themselves are cloned in several locations. It's a little bit annoying to see enemies from the first two locations well past the big chunk of the game, but with new "look" and lore, pretending to be new enemies without any connection to their counterparts from earlier. There's still a good variety and they differ in their behavior and form.\n\nLocation design is fantastic! They look great and designed well, with good looping for shortcuts (the game does suffer from "does not open from this side" disease though) and enemy placements. And they're bigger than locations from previous games. You would often look from the high place and see a lot of places you have visited or would visit. Simply gorgeous.\nIt would seem at first that the world is interconnected like it was in Dark Souls, but, sadly, this is not the case. The game is very linear with very few branching paths to different locations.\n\nAnd one of the hidden locations is a relighted version of one from the main course of the game. There's not a single unique enemy in it, the boss is one of the previous ones with added aggression. And they put there unexplained fanservice items which do not fit in with the lore. The location looks and feels great, but it's still a damned reskin.\n\nBosses. It's hard for me to judge their difficulty, each boss feels good, that's for sure. Two of the bossfights might go in the top ten boss fights out of all FromSoft games for their sheer feel. And this game contains the best last boss.\n\nPVP might have been the best in the series. It did so many things right this time around. So many things... But it suffers from the same problem as PVE - lack of poise. Every weapon stunlock. Meta is to spam R1 into oblivion.\n\nParries are harder and much more punishing for mistiming. Which is good, but that also means you can't parry spammers and the first hit stunlocks you so you get hit two-three times always. Aside from overpowered Caestus (it allows to parry like in Dark Souls (on reaction) and has incredibly fast recovery animation, which let's you roll away from attack even if you missed a parry) and they brought a system from Dark Souls II where you can't parry heavy weapons (running and rolling attacks excluded). So they really hit a nice spot with parrying in this game. Time to nerf caestus recovery animation (i.e. - prolong it).\n\nThey also "fixed" backstabs. It has a starting animation now, like in DSII, but in DSII even with this animation backstabs were often glitchy and unfair. In this game out of hundreds PVP matches I was backstabbed once and it was my fault (got greedy on attacking one player and his buddy caught me mid animation), while I backstabbed countless parry spammers (besides caestus - recovery from parry is not immediate and with a bit of prediction of a parry you can easily punish players for spamming).\n\nBack to weapons. Light weapons are a meta, since stun-locking and fast attack speed. Are heavy weapons dead? Not entirely.\nThey brought back an amazing system from Demon's Souls called "hyper armor". When you swing a heavy weapon, at some point in the swing (differs for different weapons) hyper armor activates and you can no longer be staggered out of animation. So you still get hit, but your attack is not interrupted and you can hit your opponent as well. It's incredible. The problem is - hyper armor does not start immediately, so you can still be thrown out of heavy attack by a poke from a dagger while wearing full Havel's. It's still much easier to win with light weapons. The only way you can die from heavy weapons is if you make a mistake. They reduced stamina consumption for rolls, so it's really not that hard to dodge forever. In the end heavy weapons are a gimmick and with them you're hindered against good players by quite a lot. Still winnable though.\n\nJust a small note - range. There's almost no phantom range! Unless you have a bad connection to your opponent - you can have a hitbox porn where weapon only hits you by the length of it's actual model. No bs with double range for pokes like in DSII, which ruined PVP for me there. Now it's always depends on connection. And most of the time connection is good.\n\nInvasions. FromSoft really wants weak players not to suffer? But why? There's already such thing as "offline" for those who dread being invaded.\nIf you're running by yourself - embered, don't summon anyone and don't use a dried finger - high chances you won't get invaded at all (two covenant areas are exceptions). Until you "touch" online by summoning - you're mostly safe. So invaders mostly invade co-opers and gankers. Which puts them in quite a pickle. It's still doable 1 vs. 2 or even 1 vs. 3 (this games allows up to six players in one session. With max three white summons), but if you get to a tryhard gank - your chances are slim.\nPhantoms (whites, reds, blues, purples, whatever) get half amount of estus flasks they have while being in their world. There are no other replenishing healing items. You can have a single divine blessing of siegbrau on yourself and that's it (all spares go to the botomless box). So From finally did it right with healing items both for PVE and PVP. You also get back one Estus flask for every enemy phantom killed (so for red this means if anyone at all dies, since reds are not allied with each other). Semi-same system in PVE, where you get a flask after some number of mobs killed.\n\n\nIn the end it's a great title. But it's a rehash of the previous games, so I don't feel it's possible to rank it very high. It's above Dark Souls II, that's for sure, but is it above Dark Souls and Demon's Souls? No. At least not for the returning player. Because we have already seen everything in it before playing. It was done good before and this game failed to improve ideas, only to copy them.","May 27","true","165.8"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulmyr/recommended/374320/","soulmyr","Soulmyr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulmyr/","204 products in account","I have mixed feelings about Dark Souls 3. On one hand, it's not obviously bad in some places like Dark Souls 2, but on the other I don't know what this game is trying to be. It has elements from all 4 Soulsborne games that don't go well together. It's definately an enjoyable game, if you're into the Souls series, but also disappointing in some ways.\n\nLet's start out with the positive side of Dark Souls 3:\n+The game looks gorgeous, no question about that. Probably the best looking Souls game on PC to date.\n+The world is huge and well connected. Not quite as well connected as DS1, but you can see other areas from your current area (like seeing the Bell tower from Sen's Fortress) and there are no weird Earthen Peak -> Iron Keep situation.\n+It is easier than every to play with friends with the new password system (although I've seen people say it doesn't work)\n\nNow let's talk about what I don't like in Dark Souls 3:\n-My main problem with the game is the change of pace. Enemies are a LOT more agressive this time around, with seemingly infinite stamina and long combos. It gets particularly bad mid to late game when enemies get a ridiculous damage and health boost. The game essentially punishes you hard if you do anything other than roll and mash attack. Tanking is pretty much pointless (you can't even upgrade armor) and magic users are at a serious disadvantage compared to previous games since their casting speed is so slow and scaling is so messed up early to mid game that you'll be spending more time swinging a sword than casting Soul Arrow. I heard scaling gets better around 50 INT/FTH but I don't care enough to get to that point.\n-There is a LOT of reused content in this from all previous Souls games. I don't want to spoil it, but there are more recycled characters than new ones. Same could be said about the armor and weapon sets. There is an area that is LITERALLY ripped straight from Dark Souls 1. I know the official explanation is some time distortion ♥♥♥♥, but really it's just lazy pandering. I can bash Dark Souls 2 all day, but at least it had more original content than this\n-Covenants are kind of half baked. People have been reporting that some don't even work properly.\n-This is the THIRD game on PC that still has ♥♥♥♥ing Xbox prompts. Why is no one complaining about this? Some people actually play with a keyboard and it's not even that much effort.

On one hand, it's not obviously bad in some places like Dark Souls 2, but on the other I don't know what this game is trying to be. It has elements from all 4 Soulsborne games that don't go well together. It's definately an enjoyable game, if you're into the Souls series, but also disappointing in some ways.\n\nLet's start out with the positive side of Dark Souls 3:\n+The game looks gorgeous, no question about that. Probably the best looking Souls game on PC to date.\n+The world is huge and well connected. Not quite as well connected as DS1, but you can see other areas from your current area (like seeing the Bell tower from Sen's Fortress) and there are no weird Earthen Peak -> Iron Keep situation.\n+It is easier than every to play with friends with the new password system (although I've seen people say it doesn't work)\n\nNow let's talk about what I don't like in Dark Souls 3:\n-My main problem with the game is the change of pace. Enemies are a LOT more agressive this time around, with seemingly infinite stamina and long combos. It gets particularly bad mid to late game when enemies get a ridiculous damage and health boost. The game essentially punishes you hard if you do anything other than roll and mash attack. Tanking is pretty much pointless (you can't even upgrade armor) and magic users are at a serious disadvantage compared to previous games since their casting speed is so slow and scaling is so messed up early to mid game that you'll be spending more time swinging a sword than casting Soul Arrow. I heard scaling gets better around 50 INT/FTH but I don't care enough to get to that point.\n-There is a LOT of reused content in this from all previous Souls games. I don't want to spoil it, but there are more recycled characters than new ones. Same could be said about the armor and weapon sets. There is an area that is LITERALLY ripped straight from Dark Souls 1. I know the official explanation is some time distortion ♥♥♥♥, but really it's just lazy pandering. I can bash Dark Souls 2 all day, but at least it had more original content than this\n-Covenants are kind of half baked. People have been reporting that some don't even work properly.\n-This is the THIRD game on PC that still has ♥♥♥♥ing Xbox prompts. Why is no one complaining about this? Some people actually play with a keyboard and it's not even that much effort. Modders have been doing it since DS1.\n\nMaybe I'm just tired of the Souls formula at this point, but at it's current state Dark Souls 3 is not as fun to play as Dark Souls 1. It's certainly better than Dark Souls 2 but that's not really saying much.\n\nI would advise you to wait for the inevitable GOTY edition which will hopefully fix the gameplay issues I have with the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/michal_sivek/recommended/374320/","michal_sivek","Sivek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/michal_sivek/","1402 products in account","DS3 feels like it was created to be, at the very least, an extended stopping point for the series.  With three games in less than five years, I imagine FromSoftware is going to let this series sleep for a while and DS3 serves an excellent stopping point, though there's still a couple of DLC left, and no developer does significant DLC better than FromSoft.\n\nI'll touch on some of the main aspects of the game.  As you already probably know, fast travel is in from the start, a la DS2.  Unfortunately, this means world connectivity is DS2-styled rather than DS1.  Fortunately, the level design is outstanding.  The levels are consistently smart with shortcuts, enemy layout and secrets and there's even a couple of cool optional areas.  There are very few signs of the time crunch that plagued later DS1 areas and there's a lack of the some of more uninspired area design choices of DS2.\n\nI've seen some complaints about the number of bonfires, though it didn't really feel like an issue while playing the game and is mostly inflated by each boss area getting a bonfire after beating them, so you end up with a few post-boss bonfires that are very close to the where the next section begins.  It feels like FromSoft decided to add bonfires for each defeated boss late in the process so the player never runs into a situation where they die before they can use their souls.  Still, there a number of bonfires that grouped close together, but they're more there for convenience sake rather than making areas easier.\n\nThat ties into another aspect of the game, the return of the level-up mistress and area hub in the style of DS2.  Some people really like having everything in one place that's basically a "safe" zone, but I find it takes away from the game's atmosphere and a nuisance to have to fast travel to a hub to level-up or upgrade weapons.  For me, it hurts the sense of adventure and isolation of an area to have to return to the hub so often, especially mid-level.  The hub characters you interact with most also have extremely limited dialogue, so you don't get much from interacting with them.\n\nNext, bosses and enemy design is great both visually and mechanically.  Very little DS2-style large humanoid that rotates on its axis!  Most bosses have multiple phases and they're easily the best designed group in the series.  There's only a couple of duds and they're not nearly as poor as the weaker ones found in the first two games. DS3 is also much better at denying players from simply circling to the right against random enemies.  The first encounter with a knight will punish the player for doing this and force the player to adapt different tactics since the enemy AI is significantly improved at dealing with this type of behavior.\n\nIt's probably the most difficult game in a fair way in the series.  I probably died more in DS2 but that's largely because of some poor enemy layouts that favor extreme leashing and quantity of enemies rather than a "true" sense of difficulty.  I don't ever try to kite stuff in these types of games so maybe my experience in fighting large groups of enemies varies widely from yours, but DS3's multiple enemy challenges are very well-done and the best in the series.  It also has the best difficulty curve in the series, with each new area and boss being just a bit harder than the previous one and this lasts practically the entire game.\n\nVisually, enemy/boss design is outstanding.  There a number of times I was impressed with how even the most generic of enemies either looked or acted.  There are just some great looking enemies.  Environmental design looks amazing too, with a couple of vistas that are stunning to look at, with one reveal in particular probably serving as the most impressive looking intro to an area in the series.\n\nIn short, DS3 is an great game, and while I don't think DS2 is bad (more disappointing than anything), this feels more like the type of sequel that the original deserved.  Though DS1 is one of my favorite games ever, if the the quality of DLC is up to par with the rest of FromSoft's games, I could see DS3 ranking right up there with it.  Definitely recommended to anyone slightly interested in the series, or to those that were kind of turned off by DS2.","April 24","true","93.5"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","31","46","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/374320/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","388 products in account","Dark Souls 3 is pretty cool, I guess.\n\nYou play as an Ashen One, a champion destined to defeat the lords of Cinder and link the first flame, a sort of beacon that keeps the light in the world while at the same time keeping the darkness at bay.\nI think.\n\nAfter beating up a large man with a coiled sword in his stomach and a very angry tape worm living inside him, you find yourself in a temple called the Firelink Shrine, which is looked after by this cute lady that has a very long list of chores for you to complete while you're out. The Firelink works as your home of sorts, it's the generally safest place and all of your friends live there. But it doesn't have a couch or broadband internet, you could probably sit in one of those giant chairs that one of the lords of Cinder used to sit in, I guess.\n\nI can't really go into much detail about the plot without spoiling a lot of things, so instead I will dance around talking about it like I'm playing the floor the lava.\n\nDink Rolls 3, like it's predecessors, is an action RPG in the same vain of games like Blade of Darkness and Crusader: Might and Magic. While making your character, there are a multitude of options outside of just making them look like Gargamel from the Smurfs. You can choose where this character comes from, which doesn't do anything but change the general back story and appearance, but you also get to pick a starting class. In the long run, and much like a communist state, class doesn't really matter, but it can be used to give a head start to whatever stats you actually want to level up during the course of the game.\n\nCombat handles almost like two mustached gentleman having a boxing match, unless you're fighting one of the many monsters that lie in wait, in which case in turns into you hoping that it doesn't try to eat you with its horrific chest mouth. Your characters left and right arm are assigned by default to the triggers or bumpers on your controller or to your mouse. You can also lock on to your enemy so you can strafe around them and you don't end up being smooshed because your shield just so happened to be pointing the wrong way.\n\nThere is a surprising amount of diversity to the combat, you can play as a shield bearing knight or SHOTGUN WIZARD to be sure, but the equipment and stats really help how you shape your play style. You can just go it as a knight or mage, sure, but weapons are assigned to your hands rather than your character itself like other RPGs. Putting a staff or a charm in one hand and a sword in the other will allow you to cast spells as well as whack anything that gets too close, just like using a shield in both hands will let you block doorways for others and giggle at them like the massive jerk you are.\n\nDrake Souls 3: Hotline Bling also has this neat online feature like it did in the other Souls games. Others playing the game can leave messages that can warn, inform, or screw with others. The game will also leave blood stains on the ground to show you where other chumps had died so you can either avoid the danger or stand in amazement at how some people can get killed in this game. But most prominent, and arguably most important, is the coop and PVP features in the game.\n\nWhile embered, which is this games equivalent of having humanity, you can find summon signs on the ground that allows you to summon others into your game. This other players will help you defeat the area and it's boss in return for an ember upon success. Or more than likely they'll be killed in your place so you can trek on while they make a splat on the floor. Kind of like a Loony Toons episode.\nBut maybe you aren't going to be a helpful little ghost that beats up monsters for others. Maybe you want to be... THE BAD GUY!\n\nThroughout the game you can find these little red orbs, or one big infinite red orb if you do something for someone. These red orbs allow you to invade other peoples world as a red phantom. As a red phantom, you must kill the host player in return for a few rewards. You don't even have to kill him yourself, actually, you can just have the world do it for you. Though be warned, because that can backfire through another of the games items I'll leave for your to discover.\n\nAll these online features really work to enhance the general experience of the game. It makes the lonely journey not feel so lonely now that you know there are others on the same crusade as you are. It can also work as a motivator showing you that it's not as hard as you thought if others could do it.\nThere are also these groups in the game you can join called Covenants, which work as a sort of guild system for the online community. Each Covenant has their own thing going on as well as their own goals.\n\nThe world of Dan Souls 3 is fairly large and expansive in it's own way. While the world of Dark souls 1 was like a ball where everything is connected, the world of Dark Souls 3 is more like a branch, with a main road that breaks off into a plethora of curious locations. There's always this sense of wonder and treachery when you embark on a new quest through a dangerous area, something that the second game seemed to lack since none of the areas didn't seem all that connected. Like how the top of a windmill led straight to hell.\n\nGetting immersed into Dark Souls 3 almost makes you feel like a Witcher, if that makes sense. While you can just go through the game and reach the end, there is a lot of reward for exploring and finding secret areas and dungeons that you may have not had to visit during your journey. You learn about the world around you by paying attention and scrounging for lore through various NPCs and items you obtain along the way. The items and equipment you pick up each have a description ranging from just the use of the item itself to the origin and history of the character it may or may not be related to.\nThey don't seem all that important, but sooner or later things begin to click and you start to understand the world around you a little bit more.\n\nThe boss battles is where Dark Souls 3 really shines, some of them are lame, sure, but most of them feel like a climatic end or halfway point of your expedition into a dungeon or a cave or a castle or whatever. Bosses are fast, vicious, and hit hard, forcing you to think on your feet. They challenge your reflexes and decision making skills and you feel like a true hero when you manage to make a boss look like a fool by dodging all of their flashy and powerful attacks.\n\nBUT\nShould you play Don King Souls 3: Screwing Mike Tyson?\n\nIt stands as a nice end to a series. As much as I would prefer if From was known for their games about robots dashing at one another aggressively, I can see how Dark Souls became their most venerated series. It's a game that I can see pulling people into the series and making them interested in the previous games in the series.\n\nIs it crushingly difficult as some people make it out to be? No, but it's challenging, it expects a certain amount of competency from the player and doesn't want to just hand things to you. Its kind of lame to see articles and videos floating about on the internet of people who's entire job revolves around playing video games wishing that the game had a easy mode just because they were unwilling to learn and adapt to the games mechanics. Which is why you should listen to me, Dirk.\n\nDark Souls 3 is the kind of game that expects you to actually sit down and play the game, be engulfed in it's dark and foreboding world, learn and connect the pieces that make up it's lore. Is it the best RPG ever made? No, and if you didn't like the other games in the series, I doubt you'd like this one. But is it a fantastic game? Definitely.\n\nDark Souls 3 gets 5 heavily armored camping trips out of 5 and the Dirk Dickbutt stolen Oscar award of approval.","May 9","true","77.8"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","75","21","28","13","2"

It's definitely the most fine-tuned and visually striking souls game to date. The base-game is superb, there are a few secret area's that are rather large and diverse, and the items and weapons are sharp, interesting, and nicely balanced... for the most part (ESTOC-BESTOC). Armors are varied and tend to mix well together, I would have to say, fashion souls is now better than ever.\n\nThe bosses are amazing, all of them. The first boss is a great introduction to the games difficulty and mechanics. A specific optional boss is honestly one of the best souls fights of all time, and one of the most challenging.\n\nLore is one of my favorite aspects of a souls game, and this game has some very very interesting characters and bosses, my particular favorite being Aldrich, the devourer of gods, he's a total scumbag.\n\npvp is definitely the thing that needs to change the most. There are hackers who are causing concern for players, but before you post a negative review, might I recommend a counter-measure, or at least, a fail-safe to prevent irreversible damage. Backup your saves !!! It's as simple as that. Sure, it's a nuisance, but it's more preferable than losing your character completely. I can assure you, from is not ignoring it.\n\nI'd like to remind you, pvp was pretty bad in Dark souls 2 when it came out. Only after many updates did it become balanced and fun - give dark souls 3 the same patience, there are new mechanics and changed concepts -- it'll take some time, but it'll be fixed.\n\nThis game is not as bugged or as laggy as so many people seem to claim. I run a 960 on high and get 60 in all areas of the game - note, I do run a higher end processor, so your fps may vary. I don't know if From is offering a fix for other, less optimized cards, but I can assure you, this is not a half-♥♥♥♥♥ effort for a port, the devs have discussed with the community the problems and bugs people are experiencing within the game, and their acknowledgement alone means they're willing to work on fixing these problems.\n\nThis game is worth your time, Fromsoft is a pretty good developer - if you don't want to risk buying due to the lag or PvP problems, give it some time, it'll fix itself out over time.","May 7","true","84.5"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","31","47","0","0"

I can easily say that this is currently my GOTY.\n\nSTORYDark Souls 3 takes place in a transitory place, revolving around the first flame and the cycle of fire and dark. You play as a protagonist whose goal is to find and return the five Lords of Cinder to their thrones at Firelink Shrine in order to link the flame again. The protagonist is known as an "Unkindled," a being considered less of a being than an Undead who is made from the remains of an Undead warrior who failed to link the flame and, as a result, burned their bodies into ash.\nThe game does not have direct storytelling: no one spills what is happening to you, there is no quest menu, and the few cutscenes that you watch do not usually feature any dialogue. If you want to understand the story, you must examine the environment, read the description of each item, and go on the Wikia page to comprehend the lore.\nI honestly love this type of apporach, since you can easily avoid any type of story and just focus on the gameplay. But I find it near impossible that a player doesn't care about the backstory of the places that he visits or the enemies that he fights.\n\nGRAPHICSFirst of all: the game has frame drops that are always between 30 and 60FPS, but it never ruined the gameplay and it was barely noticable most of the times.\nThe design of each area is gorgeous and rich of details: beautiful vistas, gothic cathedrals, burning villages, poisonous swaps... Exploring this decaying world is a joy, also thanks to the excellent enemy design inspired (mostly) by Bloodborne, without feeling derivative. The bosses that you fight are also intimidating and full of different movesets that change mid-way through the fight.\nCharacter creation has been improved, with basically the same editor of Bloodborne, but I recommend using the preset characters without many changes, unless you prefer to have an hilarious purple knight with green hair, red beard and a constant grin on his face.\n\nGAMEPLAYI highly recommend playing with a controller, even though the k/m controls have been improved. The gist hasn't changed: you can equip swords, spears, knives, shields, magic and many more in each hand, and you can use certain items. The Estus Flask recovers your HP, while the new Ashen Estus Flask recovers your FP (used for magic and special attacks), and the both fill each time you visit a bonfire, which works as Fast Travel and Respawn point.\nEach time you die, you lose your souls (that are both currency and XP), and you can recover them by going back to the place where you died, otherwise they'll be lost forever. There are Estus Shards and other items that can be used to improve your character's stats and items. You can go back to Firelink Shrine, which acts as your HUB, where you can talk to multiple NPCs and buy new items and upgrade weapons.\nThere is also the multiplayer component which makes the game excellent: you can summon other players to help you fight bosses and get through difficult areas, or you can summon Dark Phantoms (who can also invade you while playing) to engage in some PvP.\nThis is easily the perfect Souls game: everything has been improved, the combat is a bit faster (though not as fast as Bloodborne), and playing is just way more fun than in the other Souls games.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game is extremely challenging: every enemy that you encounter has the potential of killing you, and you must focus on each encounter to avoid getting hit. The boss fights are the hardest part of the game, but the true achievement of the developers is that they never feel impossible and unfair. If you die, it is your fault only: maybe you didn't dodge at the right moment, maybe you used too many Estus Flasks earlier, but it never is because a boss is designed to be nearly impossible (except for the Nameless King, screw him).\n\nSOUNDThe sound effects and the noises of the monsters are great as always. The voice acting is a bit over-the-top most of the times, with the famous sarcastic laughter at the end of almost every NPC conversation. The soundtrack that plays only during boss fights is top-notch: it makes each encounter feel epic, and at the same time it also scares you and makes you feel as if all hope is lost.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThe game is going to last you for a long time: there is PvP, coop, and multiple New Game+ modes that will keep you entertained, as well as secret areas and bosses to fight.\n\nOverall, DARK SOULS III is an excellent video game, and, in my opinion, the best game in the franchise.

I dread the moment I see I'm invaded by "Git gud kid" whilst trying to run an area in NG+ whatever. The hitboxes feel so unaligned and the length of weapons seems to feel as a downside rather than an upside of holding a larger weapon. Combined with the awful connectivity, even with cross region play disabled, you just might aswell let them kill you as it's almost guranteed everyone is min/maxing to an absolute peak.\n\nDid I forget to mention they broke poise aswell? when asked what they plan to do, they stated, "Poise is working as intended" when it literally has no benefit. thank's for this riveting information!\n\nDid I forget to mention possible invaders are also hacking? Any items they drop modify your game data in such a way it's possible to get you permanently banned from the game. So they can invade you and you get banned, SIGN ME UP!\n\nI wouldn't bother purchasing this game until changes are made that actually make it more reasonable for those who are interested in getting into PvP or plan to just PvM whilst getting invaded can hold a chance against someone with a similar skill level on a even playing field.","May 14","false","78.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","1"

Some people are experiencing none/few of these problems, but many of us are. The game behind these issues is amazing, level design and graphics are fantastic, enemy AI seems notably better, they can attack from thier sides more accurately. So far my only gripe with anything gameplay related is the horrid weapon balance, and dual wielding weapons has left me fairly unimpressed compared to DaS2.\n\nBugs & performance\n-Firstly, getting a controller to work with this game is a nightmare. spent 5 hours tinkering and playing with 3rd party programs to get it to work, had to unplug nearly every usb appliance connected to my computer as a quick fix. Im not the only one, because the forums were flooded this morning with this issue. Just soured my experience right off the bat.\n\n-Poorly optimised, I have a 5960x OC'd with two brand new 980 ti's, 32 gb ddr4 ram. Im struggling to keep ~45 fps. Odd dips to 30 or even single digits. I know im fairly fortunate to have the setup I have, but I cant even imagine what people with mid-lowish end PC's are experiencing. Crashes galore. Just terrible PC optimisation, if any. EDIT: getting slightly better performance on one card, after reinstalling drivers numerous times. Still getting massive fps dips and stutters. Some people are sailing through this with no problems, bit of a coin toss.\n\n-When playing with others, I get huge dips in frames and sometimes the sound will drop out for a few seconds, the odd time it has cut out permanently. Have to restart the game to fix it.\n\n-Something is going really wrong with online features and summoning. I have great internet that has never dropped or suffered any measurable lag spikes, but fist me sideways, summoning anyone into your world leads to 1 frame per 4 seconds, then a brief 2 second return to normal, continiously repeating this trend. Wasted all my embers summoning 2 allies and then everyones game essentially freezing while the whole group gets ganked by ai.\nPlent of cheezy deaths due to stutters in the game, right when your about to roll a bosses attack, but the game froze for that half second and wouldnt take any controller input. salt.\n\n-There is a huge problem getting summoned phantoms to pass through the fog gate for bosses, roughly 60% of the time there is no prompt to enter the boss room to follow the host in.\n\n-Some odd instances being sommoned to another world, and all the AI and other players are just floating around like nuns. Ai can hit you but you cannot see their movesets, just the enemy model scooting around. Have to just leave those sessions.\nEDIT: probably around 70-80% of the 100 or so pvp encounters ive had, have been against a player model that floats around not moving limbs, and where they are on screen is nowhere near where they are in game. Words cant even... its like they looked at the two areas they really needed to improve on from previous games (tightning up the online & balancing the weapons) and did the complete opposite.\n\n-Seperation crystal (item used to send friendly players back to their world, and disband a group) is broken. After reaching a new bonfire I wanted to explore solo, but the game wouldnt let me send them on their merry way, and I could not exit out of the game. Ended up pulling the ethernet out of the back of the computer, but that didnt even work! Alt f4 to get out of game, not sure how or where my character will end up because of this. An annoyance for myself, and im sure frustrating to others who were made wait around for an extended period of time only to get kicked. Has happened on 3 occasions, out of maybe 11 seperate attempts.\n\n-Phantom cant be summoned! :( 6 out of 7 attempts to summon an ally will not work. Not gamebreaking or anything, but just leads to a lot of time hanging around, some people will leave because you cant summon a second phantom in a reasonable timeframe, not for lack of trying. Matchmaking set to regional only, internet speed 50 down 5 up.\n\nGameplay\n-PvP class/weapon balance is all ove the place. Light class and roll, was nerfed hard. Just something that irk's me, probably wont bother others, but that was the agility and maneouverability I liked to play at with claws or daggers. Certain weapons that really lacked in DaS2 have become even worse, less movesets/ fast weapons locking you into animations for an extra 3-4 swipes (claws, whips, fists, and to a lesser extent daggers) also any mages ive come across while using a sword is a free kill. PvP is limited to rapier's, greatswords, swords, utchigatana and the odd parry shield user.\n\n-Dual wielding weapons seems worse than DaS2. They have added one unique special ability to each weapon, which is cool, but seem to have sarificed power stance mode from the previous DS. Using dual manakin sabers, whips, shotel's, whatever in the last game, completely changed your style/movesets/weaknesses & stregnths. I dont understand why they couldnt have even copy pasted some of those movesets into the game, instead of having weapons that cant combine at all.\nWhips/daggers/swords I have picked up so far dont seem to combine, and the moves for each seem to be a few almost unnoticable variations of an R1 attack. Was really hoping to see more in depth moves and the need to vary stances/fighting styles for different enemies or PvP. On a positive note though, the bow seems to be slightly better, and the special attacks really shine with this weapon.\n\n-There is no PvP covenant like DaS2 (not counting rosarias fingers), where you could essentially 1v1 someone without either invading or summoning phantoms. I would like to see something like this return, so that 1v1 fights are on equal footing and without the phantom appearance. Every time I have been invaded so far, even if im on my own/ or we signal to the invader that well fight 1 at a time, I get some a**hole who wants to lead me all the way through every enemy in lothric half way to mordor, insted of just fighting 1v1. Seed of the tree of a giant is also very rare (item that allows AI to also react to the invader of your world), I think you can get one every 30 hours or so.\n\nThe game behind these problems has been awesome, the maps and enemies are fantastic. The bosses have some great movesets, From have really improved upon the AI. There is a great dark souls iteration here, but these problems are issues I would consider game breaking, for the most part, I think its unacceptable to see such alpha bugs pop up in a release. The only other time I have experienced such poor performance in an online game, was the initial release of Bf4 on console. Im not saying it needs tweaking, which would be fine, Im saying it is 90% unplayable over days worth of different attempts.\n\nI will wait and see how From handle this, if they can fix these issues in a reasonable amount of time, I will change my review to positive. If these are the sort of bugs or issues you can stomach, you will have a blast playing this game, just a heads up if your on the fence about it. I would just hold off until the first patch or two, so you dont ruin what would otherwise be a great experience.\n\n\nEDIT:  Again some peoples controllers are working straight away, but there are heaps that are having major issues, you only need to look at the forums. Having tried, input mapper, Ds4, both an xbox one & ps4 controller and other programs, it must have been something to do with the game. I could test and use the controllers for other games, but for some reason the game wouldnt recognise it, even when manually mapped with ds4. Currently only works if everything except for my keyboard is manually disconnected from my computer.\n\n@HaddockA If i need a build guide ill hit you up","April 12","false","402.3"," 190 of 345 people (55%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","55","190","345","17","35"

These games are a generation apart in terms of graphical power requirements.\nDark Souls III uses much more complicated geometry,Better lightning effects, Higher texture resolution,Higher shadow resolution, Improved enemy AI and more.\n\n\n+Great graphics and art design, Attention to detail is as good as ever and really helps to captivate and immerse you into the gameplay. Mobs are also very detailed and feel like they belong in their respective area.\n+Some of the best boss designs/Fights of the series.\n+Amazing soundtrack, Boss music is epic.\n+Rewarding gameplay, Tougher and smarter mobs.\n+Seemingly infinite replayability from the sheer amount of equipment and build variety the game offers. Co-op gameplay and PVP with many covenants designed around it.\n+Possibility of 6 players total in online play.\n\n\n-Network lag and online hit detection needs some work.\n-Game kicks to the main menu if the online connection is lost regardless of what you're doing.\n-Poise system could use some rebalancing as it's almost irrelevant in it's current form.\n-No steam cloud support\n-No current known anti-cheat in place\n\nOverall I see this as a great addition to the Souls Series and an excellent game in general.\nHighly Recommended\n\nEDIT: Also something I would just like to put to rest is the illogical argument people put forward about this game being like BloodBorne as a bad thing.\n\nFirst of all sony asked From Software for a new game as they needed an exclusive IP for their console the PS4 and thus Bloodborne was.....born (kek).\nSo it really isn't suprising that BloodBorne shared a lot of simmilarities with the Souls series considering it was made by the same developers and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki.\nIt's a shame that BloodBorne is exclusive to the PS4 But it's still an excellent game from the guys at From Software.\n\nSo saying "This game sucks, It's too much like Bloodborne" is a completely illogical thing to say  because both games are great. And if both games are great, Saying one is bad because it's too much like the other is an absolute nonsensical argument.","April 15","true","141.0"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

I didn't bother buying the next generation of consoles, as I much prefer PC gaming.  For the first time, I bought a Dark Souls title on PC with the assumption I'd be able to play with keyboard/mouse.  I didn't realise the PC version is just the xbox version copied and pasted.\n\nThe in-game control guides all refers to the xbox controls which aren't really any help to a K/M user.  After some experimentation, I found most of the controller keys, though they are poorly positioned with some controls (Bumper buttons) not available at all and there doesn't seem to be any option to rearrange key-bindings.\n\nDue to the lack of control/key-binding options, along with the the disaster of screen rotation when moving the mouse, (glitches out of control in combat) the game should be considered unplayable on mouse and keyboard setup.  Most cross console/PC games are playable on a keyboard/mouse and have guides/tips translated to their respective systems.  Dark Souls 3 doesn't.\nThis wouldn't worry me at all if it were mentioned in the minimum/recommended system requirements, but while it's not, I can't recommend this game to PC users.","April 22","false","1.1"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

First, I love the Dark Souls games.  I feel they surpass most games in sheer artistic value and atmosphere and their ability to draw you into the game and make you care for it.   The art design guys should all get medals and baubles and goodly things.   I specifically wanted to give a not recommended vote here as a gesture and demonstration, because I think for an established franchise like this, that makes very good money, it's sheer laziness and unacceptable to refuse to make a decent PC port, with 2016 frame rates, and not forcing me to find a mod somewhere and use some crazy key binding so I can do some basic moves like jump attack or kick with my keyboard and mouse.  It's not like you haven't seen the comments EVERYWHERE since dark souls 1, come on, don't be cheap, don't be lazy, make it right.  Be a stand up game developer guy; say hey, we sell a lot of these games on Steam for the PC, so let's do it right, yes many play games with controllers even on the PC, but many don't, so let's give people an actual choice.  If some kid somewhere can make a mod to make this work, so can you.  Or better yet, pay the guy some money and buy his programming wizardry from him and put it in your game if you can't figure it out.   Now here's what I mean by lazy... the game recognizes I'm playing with a keyboard, because that's what I have in my settings.  So I'm walking around through the intro, where they have signs on the ground that tell you what buttons do what... and it's press triangle, press left bumper , press O, seriously?  It's that hard to change the message so it matches the actual device the game knows I'm using so it can give me the correct keys?  Heck I can do that for you and the only programming I took was some Basic and Pascal in College.  Give me 10 hours and a box of Twinkies and a connection to the net and I guarantee I can  fix that for you.  In conclusion, great game, and I WILL love it.  It's successful, and it deserves to be.  But be a standup developer guy, take a bit of that money, and make the game right for ALL the devices.  Thank you.  But yes, people should still buy it.","April 12","false","35.1"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","24","39","3","3"

I personally glad for the Game lived up to the Hype. And yet, Gameplay feels more like Dark Souls 1 with the Bloodborne built-in graphic engine with no power stance skill (DS II feature) and non-upgradable Armor set in-game, require Skill over stats, leveling on this game it's only 1/3 way to Git Gud, the rest are majorly depending on your Skills and weapon usage.\n\nit's true gameplay last around 30 Hours, i had completed the game around 28 Hours,  and i had feeling this is shortest Dark Souls game in DS Franchise.\n\nClass: Deprived\nWeapon: Broadsword+10 (Except Yhorm)\nLevel: 161 (I used level cheater due to busy work day and increased VIT for avoiding Phat ROLL)\nMagic: Homeward Cast only (No Other Sorcery/Miracles Used)\nStyle: Solo Mode (No Co-op)\n\nGame features really beautiful Orchestra Music Soundtrack, especially on Bossfights and Main Menu Theme.\n\nGame also required beefy rig in order to run it, let say GTX 960 with 4GB graphic memory is at least for 1080p constant, i'm encountering stuttering issues especially when entering Road of Sacrifices and Slow loading textures when passing through area/door, but it seems recent patches has fixed this issues [1.05].\n\n+ Epic Bossfight in-game (Epic way to die in-game too!)\n+ creatively well designed enemies AI (Movement and Attack)\n+ returning elements from DS PTDE\n+ Atmospheric and Beautiful world of Lothric\n+ Beautiful Soundtracks in-game\n\n- Gameplay feels too short for A-RPG genre (30 Hours long) for first run\n- Plenty of Shortcuts, world seems smaller.\n- "Does not open from this side" door bruh.....\n\nDespite in short of lengthiness, still this is really the best Dark Souls yet... and it's final one according to Miyazaki (The Director), reported on working new title IP recently.\n\n"PRAISE THE SOUP"\n"PRAISE THE LADDER"\n"SPOUSE AHEAD"\n\nDEATH-IN-GAME/10","April 29","true","30.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","3"

I wish I could say this game is totally worth the money, more than anything else. I truly wish I could recommend this game to others, but sadly I can't and doubt I ever will be able too, which sucks because this game honestly is amazing. However, a select few in the "community" have brought it upon themselves to ruin the game for others via softbans, whilst they go unpunished. Not to mention the fact that around 60% or so of the people you'll come across in PVP are min/maxing like crazy and take the game way to seriously, you'll come to hate the "You have been invaded by ***" message. Because you know it'll most likely be an unfair fight.\n\nNot to mention that the game itself, since the most recent "Patch" (if you can even call it that), has made this game near unplayable. Constant freezing, constant FPS drops and fluxuation and hackers as far as the eye can see. It really is depressing to see not only an amazing game like Dark Souls III, But the entire Dark Souls series suffer due to some of the same problems. (Hackers / Cheats being the main problem).\n\nIf Bandai Namco would actually do something about the hackers and actually making the game playable again, then maybe (hopefully) I could recommend this game to others. If you haven't bought this game yet, then take some advice from me. Don't waste your money on this game yet.\n\nTo sum up if you can't be bothered to read.\n\n+ Beautiful Graphics.\n+ Boss Fights are unique.\n+ Boss designs are cool as ♥♥♥♥.\n+ Soundtrack is amazing.\n+ Gameplay is challenging at times (In a good way).\n+ Sense of achievement when you defeat a boss.\n+ An actual achievement when you defeat a boss.\n+ THE MULTIPLAYER ACTUALLY WORKS.\n\n\n- Hackers ruin the enjoyment of the game.\n- Random FPS drops.\n- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths.\n- Ganking.\n- The current state of the game as a whole, is ♥♥♥♥ed.\n- Doors don't open from this side.","May 14","false","113.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

It has fixed lot of the issues i had with Dark Souls 2, such as lack of shops to sell items to, better hub zone, faster combat, better graphics and better multiplayer system, without stupid soul memory system.\n\nDark Souls 3 is actually still rather hard game, but i slightly feel there is more casual elements (Or perhaps the word is convenient) to it like making the game more linear rather than this giant hub where you try to decide where you start (Like in DS2).

However, it's also the most troubled version of all the Souls games.\n\nYes.. We're talking about hackers. Now, it's nothing new with hackers on the PC platform, however what's been going on with DS3 lately is ridicolous. I'd like to refer to my thread at the steam discussions for more information about this.\n\nThe atmosphere and general sound, is amazing. Especially the atmosphere. Have you heard the Firelink music? It's awesome, go look it up on Youtube. Now, now. I'm not much in this game for the sounds ofcourse, as it's the gameplays (and partly the graphics?) that really matters to me.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, and is challenging like you'd expect from a Souls game. I personally don't feel like it's the hardest there's been, but that may be because it's not my first Souls experience anymore. What I find most astounding, is the online play (except for the mentioned hackers and modders), which consists of you, and other people being able to both invade, summon and being summoned into other worlds as phantoms. My 64 hours in this game, is mostly consisting of PvP. The variety and fun you can have, finishing a PvP build, and then wrecking havoc in other host's worlds is really great.\n\nNow, is the PvP balanced? No, and you probably wouldn't be able to name one game which has perfect balancing. however, From is doing a good job at trying to patch, when someone finds, and exploits an insanely good combo/weapon.\n\nThat's it. Not a great review, but I don't really have more time to write this now.\n\n\nOne last thing: Please for the love of god, don't pick up items from a person whom you find highly suspicious, or have seen hack. This may get you banned. To combat this ridicolous anti-cheat, do regular back-ups.","May 11","false","64.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This would eventually result in the player recieving an "Invalid Game Data" message upon start up. Backing up your save file and restoring it did not always guarantee that you would be safe from being banned.\n\nThis means that a huge wave of legitimate players, who payed full price for the game, were softbanned and now have their online experience gimped because of these hackers. Softbanned players are esentially thrown into a shadow server where they are forevermore bound to play with other hackers and softbanned players.\n\nWhile this issue has supposedly been fixed with regulation 1.06, even this latest Dark Souls III patch gave rise to new issues.\n\nA massive amount of players have reported that they are experiencing 1 - 2 second freezes approximately every minute since regulation 1.06 rolled out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatsprettynito/recommended/374320/","thatsprettynito","Blight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatsprettynito/","177 products in account","Why do I recommend this game?\nOkay so I've played lots of this game already, over 200 hours. I've 100% completed it, and I've done the same for all previous titles not including Demon's Souls because screw you Fromsoft and your Pure Bladestone.\n\nSo I'm a fan of the series, it's safe to say, and Dark Souls III hits the mark for me really well. If you liked previous titles and you want more of the same, this game has it, you will enjoy it no doubt.\n\nMy only complaints right now are small, and there's one huge issue with the game regarding online play. I'll get on to that after I talk about the game a little.\n\nThe lore/story\nSo I started the game with very little knowledge about what to expect, and I also started alongside a bunch of friends who also bought the game. We all played our first characters solo though, so we could get a better feel for the bosses and learn the game a bit better. Without spoiling anything, this game has fan service from previous titles, and some of it is purely there to get a reaction from returning players. That was kind of a disappointment for me, but as I played on and kept reading item descriptions, some of the returning locations/items/NPCs actually made sense within the world itself. For that, I was happy. The story this time around is again, more of the same, but that is not a bad thing. I love the rich lore in Fromsoft games and I love how much love is put into item descriptions and NPC dialogue, something which you can choose to ignore or dig real deep into it and learn all the secrets about the lore.\n\nThe bosses\nThe bosses are amazing, I really enjoyed a lot of the bosses, with really only two of them lacking in my opinion.\nI did not like the Wolnir or Deacons of the Deep boss fights. I didn't like Wolnir's mechanics but overall was a VERY cool boss in design and concept. I didn't like the Deacons either, because well, it's a typical Fromsoft multi-enemy boss fight.\n\nAnd now... the bad part\nThe fact is (and no one likes admitting this) Fromsoft are bad at multiplayer. There's always issues surrounding the multiplayer and it's always been an issue in the previous games, and now this one. I'm not talking about balance and overall functionality, I'm talking anti-cheat and their stance on banning people. In Dark Souls: Prepare to Die edition (the first game, on PC that is) had NO anti-cheat whatsoever, so cheaters where rampant and nothing could be done about it, other than playing kiss chase off of a ledge for the hacker to die from fall damage. Fromsoft were very unexperienced in PC titles and they did a bad job of Dark Souls 1. It wasn't terrible though, because the mod DSfix cured that game. Dark Souls II was the same, it had no proper anti-cheat. Except this time around it had soft bans. The way someone was selected for a soft ban is simple, they monitored the servers and players for any suspicious activity and if they spotted something out of place and they could confirm it to be cheating. You were soft banned, but... they didn't tell you that you had been banned and you had to email Bandai Namco just to find out if you were. Obviously this system has its flaws just like any other anti-cheat system, but the big problem is the hackers were still everywhere and softbans didn't really help.\n\nFast forward to the release of Dark Souls III and this game has had almost the exact repeated problems, except people are being softbanned for rediculous reasons, like playing in offline mode or picking up an item that they didn't know was cheated in using a third party program.\n\nAt least you get an error message when there's invalid data. All you have to do is use a backed up save. What if you don't? Enjoy playing offline.\n\nTo close out, all I'll say is it's the best Dark Souls to date, in my honest opinion. The issues regarding multiplayer can be solved over time, and once they are, this game will be a hell of a game.\n\nTL;DR\nThe game is good. Has some multiplayer issues regarding softbans. Good lore. Good Bosses. I recommend.","May 12","true","220.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","3"

With Hidetaka Miyazaki back as the director for the game, one last time, Dark Souls III is the glorious conclusion we all deserved for the long-running epic and challenging third-person dark fantasy RPG saga. After the events of Dark Souls II, the world emerged in darkness. The fire fades, and now, only embers remain...as the world walks into ruin, you, the Ashen One, come back to life as the bell tolls and the Unkindled rises from their graves. You are in Lothric, where the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converges. The Lords of Cinder are powerful beings who were successful in linking the First Flame. You, the Ashen One, must bring them all lback to their thrones so you may link the First Flame again. This task will lead you to a great journey that won't be easy. The game has few cutscenes, and the story is told through dialogs and descriptions for items, armors, etc. The lore is epic, full of mysteries and with lot of cool characters. The game tries to be more open for new players and has more explanation than it's predecessors, a bit more cutscenes and the main story tries not to be too complex. But outside of it, there's a lot to see, including lots and lots of references to Dark Souls I and II. There's easter eggs and tributes to them everywhere, from locations to items, and even bosses. Fans will not be dissapointed. The game has different endings and questlines from different NPCs. Everything, from questlines to the story feels more dynamic. The graphics are really amazing. The scenarios have their own life with next-gen graphics and well crafted aura around them. Light, objects (that are breakable), the sky, the design, castles...everything is beautiful. And some locations are the most beautiful of the series with jaw-dropping architeture and atmosphere. The gameplay is kind of different. Now it's more intense, faster, more dynamic, with a mix of Bloodborne on it. And it's completely awesome. The game is even more enjoyable. The combat is on it's prime, with all-new weapon arts and magic bar return (Demon's Souls!). With faster enemies too, and bosses, it makes PvE perfect and PvP a dynamic as ♥♥♥♥. No more previsible attacks or "backstab souls", but everything feels more unique. The Bosses are remarkable, no more useless boss fights without charisma like Dark Souls II, but unique boss fights, including some of the best in the series, with epic soundtrack. And oh, the soundtrack is the best of the series by far. The final boss theme can make long-date fans drop a tear. The covenants are cool, and one of them brings more chaos to PvP/PvE creating unique fights. The character customization is the same as ever, with some limited things. There are lots of classes for you to pick up with your own personal style. The Co-op is better than ever, with no Soul Memory and password for everyone to play together, not matter the Soul Level. The difficult is just right: not as difficult as Dark Souls 1, but harder than Dark Souls 2. The PvP is very good. The game is shorter than it's predecessors, but more detailed. There are less boss fights too, besides the fact that they are amazing. The level design, something that I found out to be terrible in Dark Souls 2, is back in all it's glory in Dark Souls 3. The inter-connected world will make you "Wow" with some design choices. Not only amazing, but also the best in the series: for me, the level design of Dark Souls 3 is even better than Dark Souls 1's. The game has some bugs, but no big threat to your fun. Oh, and there is no more upgrades to armors. I don't know why it was removed but it would be a cool addition. Some little things apart, it's the best in the series.\n\n\n+Beautiful next-gen graphics\n+Immersive dark-fantasy world\n+Epic and stunning scenarios and locations\n+Epic lore\n+Unique atmosphere\n+Different endings and the conclusion to the saga\n+Lots of unique weapons, armors, items\n+Weapon arts\n+Faster and dynamic gameplay/combat\n+Perfect PvE combat\n+Characters and questlines\n+Classic challenging fights\n+Covenants\n+Better Co-op system\n+Epic Boss fights\n+Good PvP\n+Absolutely amazing level-design\n+Very fun to play\n+Best soundtrack in the series, really epic\n+Dark Souls 1 and 2 easter eggs and references\n+High level of detail\n+Big immersion\n\n\n-Some bugs\n-No upgrades for armors\n-Shorter than it's predecessors\n-Less boss fights than it's predecessors\n\n\nDark Souls III ends the Souls series with high class. Faster, beautiful, more dynamic and well crafted, It's the ultimate evolution and perfect mix to From Software's acclaimed RPG series.\n10/10","May 27","true","62.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cardboard8/recommended/374320/","cardboard8","burg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cardboard8/","131 products in account","DISCLAIMER: If you intend on playing this game offline, I recommend it completely, apart from the performance issues and occasional crashes. Now, onto the meat of this 'review':\n\nDo you enjoy invading and having a fair chance against 3+ people?\nDo you enjoy partaking in balanced, skill-based PvP combat?\nDo you enjoy being able to invade gankers and solo hosts an equal amount?\n\nBuy Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin. You'll find none of the above in Dark Souls III. It's sad to say, but it's true.\n\nThe game prioritizes hosts with phantoms when you invade. But not JUST hosts with phantoms, mind you; the more phantoms they have, the more likely they are to get invaded. I have done well over 300 invasions across a few different characters, both in early and late-game areas. I have invaded a grand total of two people that didn't have phantoms with them.\n\nNow, this wouldn't be so much of a problem if FromSoft didn't ♥♥♥♥ up so many other parts of the online.\n\nYou see, to be invaded, you need to use an ember. This gives you roughly ~30% extra health, meaning anyone invading you will be at a disadvantage in max health too. However, phantoms also only get half the health that the host does.. both white/gold phantoms and reds.\n\nSo not only do red phantoms have to deal with hosts with 30% more health, but they have to deal with hosts with double their estus, and white/gold phantoms with equal numbers of estus uses to themself. Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous, but that's not even the worst of it.\n\nThe game uses a basic two-hit system, like Dark Souls II. Players have no poise, meaning a dagger will stagger a person in full Smough's just as effectively as it would stagger someone wearing nothing. Combine this two-hit system with the fact that there's no working poise for players, and you get.. gankers stunlocking invaders to death with no chance to roll out of it.\n\nI believe that Dark Souls II got the PvP absolutely perfect. You invaded solo hosts as much as you invaded gankers. The host could heal when you invaded them, but you and white/gold phantoms couldn't.. apart from miracles that took ages to cast. The advantage that gankers had over invaders was numbers, and even that was a massive advantage if the gankers weren't braindead idiots.\n\nTo conclude this, I guess I'll sum up my thoughts on the game: Dark Souls III is a fantastic game (and franchise) with deep lore and fun combat. However, the online has been hindered severely due to FromSoft casualizing it. You're free to say that they 'balanced' it, even though gankers already had an advantage in Dark Souls II. However, you'd be completely and totally wrong. FromSoft wants to get more people into the game, and they care more about the 3 friends who buy the game to ezmode the game in co-op together than they care about the Souls veteran who buys the game for fair and enjoyable PvP. They make more money that way.\n\nI hate to say it, but this game's community has grown far more immature and childish with this release. If FromSoft realizes how badly they've screwed over invaders and balances invasions, I will change this review to positive.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the ♥♥♥♥ing Estoc and Dark Sword.","May 14","false","118.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Imagine a strong mix of Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1 with that weird Bloodborne look and combat speed, with Dark Souls 2 drooling in the corner.  I forget my point, anyway:\n\nI'm gonna compare 3's aspects to the other two Dark Souls games because ♥♥♥♥ You, Okay?\n\nPC Port/Performance:\n\nTrash, but playable, and better that DS1's Port (Just barely). A real shame after DS2/SotFS's port was so good. With low/Medium setting; Framerate flutters between 45-60 constantly, lowest I've seen it was about 30 during the Dancer's 2nd phase when she sets ♥♥♥♥ on fire and starts spinning like an Autistic Child.\n(DS2 > DS3 > DS1)\n\nDifficulty/Challange:\n\nThis feels like the Hardest, but thats because the combat speed is faster and all enemys are super aggressive for some reason. Basicly, imagine a DS1 enemy, but he's on Cocaine and injected adrenaline into his ♥♥♥♥♥, oh, and he thinks you stole his Waifu Body Pillow. Real foaming at the mouth ♥♥♥♥. Anyway, they also have very fast, hard hitting attacks with like 12 attacks in a combo, and they take a 3 meter step forward during each attack. Basicly: ♥♥♥♥. Bosses do this too, I'm looking at you Pontiff Sperglord and Booty of the Boreal Valley. Like seriously guys, chill the ♥♥♥♥ out.\n(DS3 > DS1 > DS2)\n\nPvP/Cancer:\n\nFirst of all, invasions are ♥♥♥♥ed. Invading is basicly asking for a 1v4, were you have -25% of your health, half your Estus Flasks (Yes, everyone gets Estus Flasks, its much worse than you think.), and any of the Gank Squad you injure will run away to heal. 'But Walrus, I can heal too?' You have a max of 7 Flasks, they have (5+x3) + 10+. In short, if you don't OHK the Host, you're Dead.\n\n'What about Poise?' Poise? What is that?\n\n'What about Weapon Balance?' Working as Intended - From's offical statment 2016\nThe meta is Estoc and Dark Sword R1 spam, how fun. 80% of people also seem to have a Ceastus offhanded and a Hornet Ring hidden in their Vagoo (I equip it too to OHK Estus Chugging Hosts, sue me).\n(DS2 > DS1 > DS3)\n\nWeapon Arts:\n\nSome are okay, like the Longswords Guard Break. Others... Looks at Farron Greatsword make you spin around the floor like a Downy Orangutang having a sugar induced stroke. They're meh.\n\nLore:\n\nIt's okay as far as souls games go but the amount of Fanservice and DS1 ♥♥♥♥ Riding is stupidly prevelent. Hell, I made fun of DS2 for making not so subtle refrences to 1, but ♥♥♥♥ me, 3 doesn't even try to hide it or be subtle. Oh, HERE'S ♥♥♥♥ING ANDRE FROM DS1. He should be long dead, why is he here? BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU WET. Thats true, but I need a real reason. Silence Okay...\n(DS1 > DS3 > DS2)\n\nWaifus/Boobs:\n\nI feel like there's little choice here. The Firekeeper is okay, but a cheap knockoff of Bloodbornes Doll Waifu. Not many Boobs ethier other than maybe Rosaria almost Nip Slip. The clear winner here is the Dancer of thr Boreal Valley, because of her butt. Rated D for Dayum. I'll stop now.\n(DS1 > DS2 > DS3)\n\n\nAlso, this is how I picture each Game in my Head:\n\nDS1: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=558435611\n\nDS2: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658268082\n\nDS3: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=680820330\n\nI may have some sort of mental Problem.\n\n\n\nAnyway, 'Is Dank Souls 3 good Papa Walrus?'\n\nIts okay, probably the Hardest, worth a try.","May 31","true","103.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","8","10","5","12"

Ive had a good time playing it so far.\n\nThe reason im leaving a bad review is because of the multiplayer this game has, its pretty ♥♥♥♥ing bad.\nWhen i try to summon my friends their Summoning sign wont ever show up, ive watched numerous guides on this game in terms of co-op and multiplayer.\nWhen i wait too long to find my friend i just end up beeing invaded, and with me really hating the PvP aspect of this game, i easily die and lose the ember ive worked so hard to aquire. The fact that infinite embers doesnt exist either doesnt make the game better in any way.\nIve littarly lost the will to play this game, as i cant play with friends.\nIve also like to add i have completed the game and me and my friend both made new users to try and play with each other. They really should improve the online co-op aspect of this game. So its easier to play with friends, instead of beeing invaded 24/7 and playing with random pebs that only sit back and relax while you fight super hard to progress.\n\nEdit: Me and my friend was going to go phantom and help each other though the game so we made new users to run the game co-op style. It ended up with me getting invaded 2 minutes after i had summoned my friend, i would have been alright if the invader was a newly made character like my own or if the game was balanced enough to have people of equal level invade. But when i make a new character go and play co-op with my friend, and after 2 minutes getting invaded by a guy with the Dancer of Boreal Valley gear. I say this: ♥♥♥♥ this stupid game, playing offline is good and all, but the way invastions work in this game is rediciously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you dont have any friends you can buy this game. If you want to play with friend, dont buy this game. Its a huge waste of money if you think this game is balanced.","May 6","false","83.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","9","12","3","2"

When my character is new sometimes the new start can be fun but I am very quickly reminded how tedious this game can be. The vast majority of the enemies are not challenging but rather an annoyance. It starts to feel like they are just there to slow you down rather than being a fun fight.\nI've gotten really tired of running through the same areas in souls games. I'm tired of Poisoned swamps, of reused characters, or art assets being copy pasted it's just getting boring guys. None of the enviorments feel fresh to me, it just feels like a big ol copy of the previous souls games and that isn't fun.\n\nAdd onto that the people who are getting flagged for cheating without good reason as well as the crashes that people keep experiencing and I have a very hard time recommending this game. I try to think "What in this would justify the price?" and I can't think of anything.\n\nGranted as I say that i've noticed that i'm at 108 hours already with the game not even being out for two weeks. One would think that would mean the game is enjoyable. To a certain extent it is but usually i've treated the game as a background thing, something to do with my hands while I listen to a podcast or something. When I sit there without something something else going on I am bored out of my mind. Same thing with Civilization when I don't have something else going.\n\nIn brief , the game is kind of boring, it is not anywhere near as hard as people make it out to be if you have a good shield, the art is lazy, the locations are boring, the anti-cheat is banning people without reason, the magic is pretty damn weak ( save for pyromancy) and it's just more of the same. So I guess if you really want more dark souls there is that. If I hadn't had a friend  buy it for me I think I would be a lot angrier than I am now.\n\nOh I almost forgot, the pope outfit is a saving grace in this game.","April 24","false","140.0"," 29 of 50 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","29","50","5","1"

You would expect to see improvements for this great idea that was in DS2, but instead they didn't, they even went step backwards.\n- LAG, LAG, LAG and poor FPS - not really a secret, google it and you'll see tons of people with good machines having issues with performace.\n- absolutely too many ambushes through the game, they got seriosly obvious and annoying\n- there is pretty much no poise in game, regular mob with rusty dagger will stun you\n- miracles are totally useless aside from healing (sunspear does about 600 damage to pontiff knight with 70 points in faith and fully upgraded talisman with S scaling in faith. A shameful display!\n- you can't buff or infuse most of the weapons\n- mobs don't have stamina at all\n- mobs still hitting you through walls\n- multiplayer is terrible and I'll explain more below\n- parry/riposte is pretty much broken (you can one shot kill bosses, so you can imagine what happens in pvp)\n- you have an option to change appearance, but can't change gender (doesn't make sense to me)\n\nAt this time I cannot recommend the game. I can only recommend it for those that only want to do one playthrough while playing offline. First playthrough is good and fun for the most part. Next ones are just the same like I mentioned. Nothing changes, the only thing to go for are achievements. DS2 had better ng+. It was not super awesome either, but the idea was nice and I expected DS3 to improve it further. Nope, screw that.\n\nMultiplayer is terrible. Pvp is unbalanced as you can expect for a non pvp game. There are a lot of cheaters running around and recording themselves cheating and exploiting and no one does anything about it. They get views and likes on youtube like it's a good thing they cheat. Even if you don't face a cheater there is absolutely no variety in pvp, you will fight same cheesy builds again and again.\n\nSome convenants are almost non existant, you don't get any action at all. In 100+ hours since I wear Blue Sentinels sigil I didn't get summoned a single time.\n\nOnly thing that was improved with multiplayer was adding the ability to summon someone with password, which lets you play with your friend no matter what level you both are. Also, soul memory is gone.\n\nIf they fix performance, bugs and lag and make some good DLCs, then it's going to be great, but right now you feel like you're playing the game because you're a fan of the franchise, not because this particular game is that great.","May 7","false","184.6"," 29 of 50 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","29","50","3","0"

POISE - Every Enemie in the game has poise. Some have more, some have less and some you can even stagger if you roll against them. This is totally fine and is indeed a good mechanic, there is just minor oversight to it that ruins the whole gameplay. You have none. No matter what the game tells you and tries to make you believe poise would be a thing for player characters, it is not. You get staggerd by every minor hit and get comboed to death.\n\n2. COMBOS - Enemies have attack patterns and when you learn them you eventually "git gud" at this game. There is again just one minor problem. Seemingly endless combos. I have counted and came across quiet a few enemies who did quiet fair damage and were able to perform a combo of 6! This is ridiculous. You do not even have to be caught in one of those it is just the fact that enemies seem to have endless stamina when it comes to attacks, just as they would not use any of their stamina to perform them. Still you can cause a guardbreak to them through attacking their shields (if they have any).\n\n3. SHIELDS - They are not good for blocking anything, because of above mentioned endless combos. If you are not good at parrying or plan on becoming so, or do not plan on using a greatshild, do not bother to throw them all away.\n\n4. PARRYING - I seriously do not know what is wrong with this mechanic in DARK III, but it feels very broken. I often get partial parries and take all the penalties of that (partial health and higher stamina loss), but still parry the enemie and can perform a counterattack. And this ca. 50% of my parries. the rest are actual parries or I miss them. Maybe I am just off, but then again, why get a partial and the parry at the same time?\n\n5. ARMOR - Armor is worthless. It makes nearly no difference in regards of defense nor in poise (due to its abscence). the only serious difference is if you wear armor, or not. It just does not matter which kind, how heavy, how much poise or how much defense it says it gives to you. Thus, making the stats of any armor almost useless, it all breaks down to fashion souls. take what you like and do not give a ♥♥♥♥ about defenses.\n\n6. ENEMIES - Well, there are enemies, that are quiet difficult to defeat, but only if you are not dealing high enough poise damage to them, or get staggerd because you have no poise. There are no "special" enemies, just annoying ones that are hard to defeat because of their artificial difficulty. For example, there is a enemie type that drains your health in an enormous tempo, just by looking at you. And they not only take the health out of your healthbar, they take the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing. So there is no chance for you to heal and keep going. You HAVE TO wait for your healthbar to return, until you can continue fighting or you WILL die if you are not fast enough. This mechanic is sick and shows us where Dark Souls has come to - complete garbage -.\n\n7. BOSS ENEMIES - Nothing much to say about them. They are not necessarily uninspired, but very plain. No real intense fights with them, nor any big challenges. If one is hard to defeat, call a summon and get done. You will not miss any spectacular bossfight.\n\n8. COVENANTS - You can change your covenant at any given time, due to the fact that there are now items that symbolize the bond to your covenant. There are no real good rewards and as far as known, only two covenant tiers for every covenant. One tier for turning in ten and a second for turning in 30 covenant items at the shrine, or leader. The only real interesting covenant is the one (not saying any names here, because of spoilers) where you can decide to be a good or a bad phantom.\nAbsolutely dumb is also the mechanic, that you now get the item related to your actual covenant, if you invade as a red phantom and kill the host. This is just a poor excuse for not giving you any, specialy valuable and strictly strained reward for ranking up in the individual covenants.\n\n9. NPCs - They have at least questlines. Some are quiet interesting to pursue and some are not. But I did not experience any major twists.\n\n10. Weapons - Mostly copy pasted from previous Dark games. Just a few exceptions and not really worth mentioning here.\n\n11. Magic - Never used and never plan to do so. Until now it seems to be pretty useless.\n\n12. PVP - Quick weapons outplay almost everything, because you can be staggered by everything and ganking is still what people love the most.\n\nIn the end I do not recommend this game to anyone. Atleast not for that much money. If you want to take part in the Dark series, stick with DS I, still by fare the best of the series, sadly.\n\nI do not speak english as my native language so do not hate on that.","April 28","false","91.2"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","20","33","0","0"

That's the way I felt the first few (7 or so) hours, they really made a bad impression on me: bad items you can get in the early game, locking away second/third tier upgrade material until you progress to certain points in the game, and then the plethora of "Door does not open from this side"  messages made me look at this game in disgust, since it's such lazy design in comparison to the other two. Also, this game follows the trend of making animations super broad, which can lead in unreadable and frustrating fights.\n\nEDIT: Also, the port is ♥♥♥♥ if you don't have high specs and you expect to not get banned.

It's like fast Dark Souls. The first boss had my heart in my throat, and it's genuinely exciting.\n\nWhy the negative review then?\n\nI attempted to play this game for around an hour after I unpacked the preload. The game crashed three times because Windows ran out of memory - I have 8GB RAM and a 970. Grow up Windows. The game has crashed when I look at bonfires several times, as well as when I travel to the first proper area and when I tried to invade there. It's crashed opening doors, and just fighting random enemies in the beginning area. It's even crashed my entire GPU about four times. Trying it again now, I cannot even start playing - it crashes on the initial loading screen after pressing Continue in the main menu. Other people are having severe FPS issues.\n\nThis is happening to a not-insignificant portion of people. This port, at least on release, is utterly and completely horrendous, and is plagued by the worst issues I have ever seen. Even the original Dark Souls at least ran for the most part.

Where to start?\nI am a newcomer to the Dark Souls franchise. From time to time I would stumble upon video or gif of Dark Souls games, but I didn't understand anything. Only thing that I knew is that these games are hard. Well I bought Dark Souls 3 and I see why others are hooked. So many secrets, hidden areas and mistery lore that even the biggest Dark Souls fans still try to figure it out. You will be hungry for more and more. Which area is next? What will it bring to you? Which boss is there? What is the lore of this area/monsters/boss? A loot in the distance, how to get to it? Is it maybe rubbish or some cool armor? So many questions.\n\nCreatures are interesting and well designed. Each area has unique feeling and the combat system is top-notch. Just amazing.\n\nIf you are a newcomer to this game, don't be afraid. It is challenging and sometimes hard, but if you get stuck remember to Google some info about the boss fights or some tips for hard areas. Also, I am playing with mouse + keyboard so controller is not essential.\n\nAnd after you beat the game you will be happy and content. But what about other classes? What about hidden quests that you missed during the first playthrough? Or that cool weapon that you didn't use? This game has an amazing replay value. I wouldn't even call this a replay value, because you will learn something new each playthrough.\n\nOh and PvP? Yes there it is, but I'll leave it to you ;)\n\nAs for problems, there are still some performance issues, mostly crashes that can be frustrating. I hope they fix this in future patches.\n\nThis is really a GOTY. Must buy!\n\n9.5/10","May 28","true","67.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

TBH, PVP right now is cringy and it sucks. It's full of r1 spamming players or people who spam parry on the spot 5 times in a row. Poise also does nothing, so wearing heavy armour is either for the purpose of more damage protection (no point anyway since rolling is basically far better and gives you I-frames) or for the cosmetic appeal.\n\nThe animations are from DS1 for some reason; I don't know why they didn't just use the better looking stances and animations from DS2.\n\nWeapon-arts are barely used and when they are it comes from dual-wielding weapons that have riduculous locking spins that are hard to escape from.\n\nPVE is still easy, most enemies can be backstabbed or cheesed by running around them constantly, and the amount of enemies or RIGs that have been copied and pasted is riduculous.\n\nAlso people ♥♥♥♥ on DS2 for its boss fights but this game is no better, and for greater insult, Miyazaki copies stuff from DS2 and he barely worked on it and most of the DS community ♥♥♥♥♥ on DS2 as being the worst. Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nOverall DS3 to me is a 6/10. It's fun to play but don't expect to have your mind blown unless you absolutely love Miyazaki.

Dark souls III also lacks the NG+ red phantom occupation that made Dark Souls II so much more fun to play through a second time.\n\nEquipment upgrading is streamlined. You can no longer upgrade armor, but shields and weapons are still upgradable. DSIII spams you with a variety of upgrade stones, so any non-unique/soul weapons can be gemmed up for any character build. Want to use a giant hammer with your dex character? Just toss a Sharp Gem in that thing, and now it scales with DEX instead!\n\nThe covenant system has been simplified in favor of an item-equip method for changing between them. A welcome change, in my opinion.\n\nI-frame management (dodge ability) has changed back to the system from Demon's Souls. Adaptability has been removed, and now your I-frames are entirely dependent on your equipped weight percentage.\n\nPlaying with friends is easier than ever before! Summoned phantoms scale to your level in damage and defense, Soul Memory is GONE, and so is that annoying ring-based co-op system. Now you just enter a multiplayer password in the options menu, and you'll only see phantoms with the same password.\n\nThe fidelity of animations seems to be improved. Baddies track you better during strafing manouvers, bosses have an easier time keeping their focus on you, and there is plenty of fast and furious fighting to be had again this time around.\n\nReally, where darksouls III falls flat is in the breadth and quality of it's content. The game as a whole feels lifeless and gray compared to previous titles. Not to mention short, and much easier than it really should be. Beating the last boss left me saying "That's it?"\n\nGone is the terrifying filth of the Tower of Latria, the splendor of Anor Londo, and the GIANT SWINGING AXES of Sen's fortress. You can't go on adventures in any paintings, and there are no giant rusted copper knights with heavy green adornment, or fields full of crystal monsters. All of those memorable, difficult fights from previous games like the Armor Spider, the dragon you have to kill with the huge crossbows from Demon's Souls, the rickety wooden bridges that swing to and fro, the slums filled with backstabbing thieves and the damn demon-headed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with his super cheezy dog minions that they put WAYYYYYY TOO EARLY IN THE GAME GOD DAMNIT!\n\nYOU COULD GO TO HELL IN DARK SOULS. AND THE UNDERWORLD! WITH THE ENDLESS ASH LAKE BENEATH THE EARTH!\n\nI mean, ♥♥♥♥. Look at what they did with the dark souls II DLC. The castle of ashes? Collecting allied knights to help you kill that dude in the arena of flame? The evil ♥♥♥♥er in the bottom of that one place with the two swords who was SUPER tough? Entering the samurai dude's memory through his flaming red armor? That was AWESOME!\n\nIt has all been replaced by hordes of foot-soldier hollows, one or two beastly worm creatures from Princess Mononoke, and knight spam. All of that in a monotone brick castle. Oh yeah, and you can dunk your head in wax. Cool.\n\nFrom Software has made the most technically complete Dark Souls title, and left out all of the content. This game feels almost like a tech demo compared to their previous entries in the series.\n\nI hope they pick it up with a totally awesome suite of DLC, because it has SOOOO much potential.\n\n","April 30","false","64.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

You can find hundreds of articles espousing the genius and perfection of the souls series, but the reality is that series is in decline. The lore is eyeroll worthy garbage, the gameplay is DaSo II without poise, the content is 95% rehashed items, spells and animations. The absolute worst aspect of this series is the netcode, and despite the fact that DaSo II actually improved it by degrees it is now worse than ever with new critical bugs and unworking pvp covenants. Like every souls game, the community ignores all issues with multiplayer because griefing is addictive. I feel sorry for you if you weren't able to play this game in the first week, as you will now be subject to idiotic 'fight clubs' and summon abuse - things that completely take the tension out of pvp and hand it to the scrubby trash that still play this rapidly aging game. The ideal time to PvP was early game, before chugging estus and before ♥♥♥♥♥♥ builds. I really enjoy sunbros, helping people out, but per usual there is no actual need to help anyone past the first two weeks when everyone can flawless the bosses alone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darksoulslove/recommended/374320/","darksoulslove","ilLusionO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darksoulslove/","119 products in account","This is my personal opinion\n"I expect nothing and I'm still let down." describes how I feel about this game and here is why:\nI have played a whole lot of Dark Souls 1 and 2 and some bloodbourne on console and have been a huge fan since. First of I have to say the game plays amazingly fluent in PvE. Hitboxes are great, rolls feel really smooth. The bosses are some of the most memorable fights in the entire series. Although I genuinely dislike the artstyle of bloodbourne and Dark Souls 3, I have to say the game looks great, not amazing but great.\n\nSince release of Dark Souls 2 I became a massive Pvp enthusiast. Despite great flaws Dark Souls 2 offered endless motivation: a sheer endless amount of builds, weapon variety, great possibilities to outplay your opponent and much more. I feel like Dark Souls 3 misses out on so many of these things. Backstep invincibility frames are gone, power stance is gone, arenas are gone. This game feels like a downgrade in terms of online gameplay to me.\n\nFurthermore most of the weapons feel the same. Movesets are mostly the same and nothing extraordinary. Weight makes no difference for stamina recovery or invincibility frames which then gives no reason to use light weight armor at all. Also NG+ is another disappointment. No new enemies, no new armor or weapons, only upgraded versions of rings. So no real motivation to go into NG+ at least for me.  As for now one of the most core mechanics of the series is simply turned off: Poise. Wearing heavy armor used to give your character poise which resulted in you not being stunlocked by light attacks. Now that this is turned off you can get stunlocked by a rat even when wearing heavy armor. Bandai namco is denying that this feature is turned off and are simply saying: "works as intended".  In other words there is little to no hope this will ever get fixed. Dark Souls 2 has been a complete mess the first months after release too but not like this. Despite insanely broken weapons, spells, mechanics the game was still fun. I can not say this for Dark Souls 3. I want to love this game but I can't.\n\nAll in all: If you are looking for singleplayer, this is your game. But in terms of online gameplay and PvP this game blows as for now. Maybe it will be fixed, probably not.","May 12","false","89.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

There are still major lag spikes for some areas, most notably I've run into a lot of giant lag spikes in Firelink Shrine when I warp in that seem to happen completely at random and very rarely result in the game crashing. Online play has gotten a lot better than it was before the patch, but there are still problems summoning phantoms sometimes and there is still a bug where phantoms sometimes won’t be able to enter boss rooms after being summoned and get stuck on the other side of the fog gate.\n\nPvP seems very refined in this version and there are very few instances where attacks seem to hit when they shouldn't. Red sign PvP is also very active and it's very easy to find a summon or be summoned through it. However, invasions and other online play such as the Dark Moon Blades or some of the other automatic summon convenients are a bit trickier. It seems like it's somewhat easy to be summoned by these convenient at levels 30 and below, but after that summoning almost never happens. I am currently around level 90 on most of my characters though, so it might become easier once I hit 120.\n\nSome other downsides of the game include many of the sorceries and miracles being very weak. Unlike the other stats intelligence and faith get most of their scaling above 40 instead of the softcap being at 40. Not only this, but with the addition of mana you have to sink more points into attunement to raise your mana pool and, most importantly, need to sacrifice estus slots in order to carry ashen estus, which refills your mana. That combined with the fact that casting also uses stamina means that any kind of caster build has to reach pretty high levels before it becomes decent and anywhere close to sustainable. It is nice that mages are not as overpowered as they have been in the past, but it feels like From made them just a bit too weak in a lot of areas.\n\nLast, NG+ is pretty mediocre so far. The first couple areas of the game are extremely easy in NG+ and the fact that there are no new enemy placements (as far as I can tell) make it rather dull. I'm assuming they're going to do the same thing they did with DS2 and release something similar to a Scholar of the First Sin version with these features added.\n\nUnfortunately, even in NG the bosses seem to fall a bit flat. Some of the bosses, like Abyss Watchers and Nameless King, offer very interesting and challenging fights, especially the first time around. However, it seems like too many of the bosses rely on gimmicks to kill them. It can be fun the first time around and I applaud From for trying something new, but it does get old, even after just one playthrough. To me it felt like the bosses were lacking in a lot of respects and it really doesn't seem like there are actually that many. Hopefully some of this will be remedied once the DLC comes out and adds more content. Once that happens I think DS3 will feel more like a complete game.\n\nOverall though this is a great addition to the Dark Souls series. It gives players even more of a challenge than previous games and refines the gameplay nicely. If you can't wait for more Dark Souls then I would suggest you get this. However, if you're not burning up inside to play more then I would recommend waiting until the DLC is released and whatever Prepare to Die or Scholar of the First Sin edition they end up releasing comes out. Once that extra content is added I think it will feel like a much more complete game and hopefully resolve some of the other issues the game currently has.","April 13","false","101.7"," 53 of 97 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","53","97","4","1"

It was designed and built for a controller and you can tell. I haven't had issues in-game in terms of control, but the interface interaction is definitely sub par.\n\nHaving said that... This is my favorite DS Game to date. Combat is faster (but not as fast as Bloodborne), fluid, precise and perfectly balanced between anticipation and quick thinking.  Also the introduction of mana in the game and weapon skills ("Weapon Arts") adds another flavor and managed aspect to the title.\n\nThey've taking a lot of lessons learned from DS1 and DS2 and applied them here: Big interconnected world... but not as maze-like complex as DS1. Great Netcode and PC Performance. The Art style and graphical quality is insanely good and really benefits from the new engine.\n\nOverall a VERY VERY good game.

A die-hard fan of all the souls games and a very happy buyer of a PS4 solely for Bloodborne. This game hits all the right notes in gameplay, tone, music and nostalgia. It takes a lot from Bloodborne; most notably, the weapons all have something special to them.\n\nThe weapon art system gives a third dimension to every weapon and creates differences between weapons of the same type. The unique weapons and boss weapon are also exceptionally unique.\n\nThey've also included just about everything I wanted from Dark 1 and 2. A few minor items I would've loved and at least one boss throwback to DS2 would've been nice. Of course, DS2 isn't remarkable, it's simply great and I would've liked a reference to a boss I've killed dozens of times. But all that being said, the amount of time armor, weapons, locations and simply lore implications made me throw my hands up in the air is incredible. All the new stuff is great as well and harkens back to what makes Souls special in the first place.\n\nDS2 was easy, DS1 was difficult and I'd say this game is hard. Hard, but brought down to challenging because the best part about this game is how tight and convenient everything is. Things just work and little touches they added simply to speed things up are great. The obtuse nature is not gone, but refined to making it only frustrating on your own accord. Those little touches are great, but the big touches like how easy it is to co-op and put work into your covenants is fantastic.\n\nThe game is just perfect and all I could ask for is more. It's a great length, but boy do I want more of this. Even if it doesnt amount to much, I just want more of a reasons to never stop playing this game.\n\nNow, adddressing the performance. For me, I have a beefy pc and it's okay. It's 99% of the time between 58-60fps but there have been strange instances where it would drop below, to even 24fps. But these instances occured only a few times in my 67 hours and not during crucial moments. Same goes for crashing; I crashed twice, but it only happened when I was literally just standing around for awhile.\n\nIn a couple months, this game will run great, just like with the insane Bloodborne patch that improved performance greatly and lowered loading times from 45 seconds to 10.\n\nDo I recommend this? To a souls fan, I cant recommend it enough. To someone going in blind, you'll love it, you may miss out on a lot of references but the curiosity and fascination remains because its all just so interesting. Play 1 and 2, play Bloodborned if you can and then be ready for the grand finale!\n\nI know this is suppose to be the final Dark game, but please, say it aint so or provide DLC until I die!!\n\nps ADD AN ARENA\n","April 17","true","113.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

The main menu is great but the rest simply doesn't work.\n\nThis game is killing my PC, and it's a high-end PC, I didn't even know so much errors could appear just playing a game. Nvidia errors, Windows errors... grammar errors, it's even worse than the early days of Dark Souls II, it was badly optimized but at least it worked, well... most of the time. This doesn't.\nEven if they'll fix it this behaviour starts being unacceptable to me, I'm tired of the Dark Souls games never properly work on PC, and as a PC user I'm offended, they keep asking my money now to do their ♥♥♥♥ing job later. They really don't deserve all the money they make with these games considering how they treat us.\nIf you decide to sell your console game to PC users, and you sell it at the same price, you simply can't offer a worse product, and "This is a port" is not an excuse, it's actually a double standard between Console and PC users. The first time it happens it could be a forgivable mistake as long as they fix it, the second time I can still try to believe in their good faith and forgive their porting problems, but not the third time, now I start to think they just don't give a ♥♥♥♥, it's a routine, and it has to stop!\n\nLEARN YOUR ♥♥♥♥ AND MAKE YOUR GAMES WORK TILL DAY ONE!\n\nBut if you really need to play this, well, it seems great for what i could play and see, surely better than Dark Souls II, maybe even better than the previous. I just suggest you to wait for the patch which will fix the game.\nProblem is it's becoming a routine: releasing the game when it still doesn't work - taking the money - making a patch to fix it after a while - and - this - is - not - ok.\n\nDevolpers should have more respect for the people who make them successful.","April 13","false","3.4"," 35 of 63 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","35","63","7","0"

It has a little too much Bloodborne in it for me to like, but that's just a preference thing. That doesn't matter anyway, because the release of the game just isn't finished, let alone playable. If you can get past the awful experience that is installing the game, you probably won't make it past the title screen, and if you do, you likely won't get past the first bonfire. I managed to do all these things, and now my game crashes completely every 5 minutes or so for a multitude of reasons.\n\nWhen invading phantoms get close to me at all, I crash.\nUsually when I stand over a summon sign, I crash.\nWarping from firelink usually makes me crash.\nLoading screens take about 10 minutes and rarely don't crash the game completely.\nIf I manage to play the game for too long and it doesn't crash, the graphics begin to "decay" so to speak. I start having weird problems, such as flickering lighting from bonfires, enemies turning into pitch black blobs of pixels, all landscape turning black, etc. Right before the game crashed about 5 minutes ago, if i would turn and face a certain direction the screen would go black completely until i rotated the camera. How does this stuff make it into an official release of a game? It feels like i'm playing an Early Access game, except i paid $60\n\nI'll change my review once the game is finished (patched)","April 12","false","9.2"," 23 of 40 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","23","40","0","0"

The game also looks a lot like bloodborne with a lot of enemies looking like they got pulled straight from bloodborne, also the environment is very, very similar to bloodborne.\n\nIf it weren't for the title this game would be more bloodborne than Dark Souls, which isn't neccesarily bad for someone who hasn't had the chance to play bloodborne, but it's worth noting.\nLevel design is really nice so far and the AI seems very good, combat in general is more fun.\nThis makes it all the more frustrating that it doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work.\n\nAlso PvP is absolute ♥♥♥♥ in DS3, there's already insanely overpowered weapons (e.g. spamming the rapier) and the netcode seems to be worse than previous titles.\nAlso as for co-op, phantoms can only use their estus flasks once, which is ridiculous and forces you to get a healing miracle as a phantom.\n\nEdit: There's areas in the game where you can summon 1 phantom max, but can get invaded by 3 people at once + 2 miniboss enemies and 2 strong ♥♥♥ NPCs.","April 13","false","17.8"," 24 of 42 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","24","42","4","9"

If you play Souls games primarily for PvP then disregard my review.\n\nJust going to sweep aside the issues of crashing that everyone else has touched upon and simply say the game isn't as fun and the locations are not as inspired as previous Souls games (unless you really enjoyed Blighttown from DS1 or the Valley of Defilement from Demon's Souls, then you'll LOVE DS3).\n\nI really want to enjoy DS3.  I really do.  I just can't.  I loved Demon's Souls, loved DS1, and I even liked DS2, but something seems missing in DS3.\n\nI feel like FromSoft made this game with PvP folks in mind (and if the other reviews are any indication they succeeded) and the regular adventure and story suffered for it.\n\nNow to have this review flagged as unhelpful by review trolls who have already played DS3.","May 5","false","11.5"," 50 of 92 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","50","92","0","0"

My Longsword, the very sword I had been buried with, never had it failed me. Not even once, I could always rely on it. But now? My strength to hold the blade fades, it fades like I've seen so many people fade before me. The heavy sword slips from my grip. I couldn't even hear it hitting the ground, so thick was the layer of ash surrounding me.\n\nI had done it.\nThe final test, I passed. How I knew this was the end? I didn't really, but the serenity I felt was proof enough. I was at peace, or maybe I was just too tired to really feel anything anymore. Slowly, so very slowly I sat down. Next to the Bonfire, that I knew was gonna be the last one I was ever going to see. I stared into the flame that was dancing at it's base, and for some reason, it gave me closure. Yes.\nThis was it. I was done.\n\nWith the fire dancing before me, my vision began to fade until only darkness remained.\n\nThe REAL Review.\nWell, where do I start? I guess I fully recommend this game.\nIt feels like they took the good of both Dark Souls 1 and 2 together and made this game. Not to mention the few Bloodborne Elements due to them running the same Engine. The game feels great, from the very first moment I knew I was playing a Dark Souls and nothing else.\n\nThere is also a lot of fan service in form of NPC Armor that re-appears in the game, but I didn't mind that very much. I felt downright nostalgic even, I guess they really got me with this kind of fan service.\n\nBut I had my fun with it, and I am sure I am gonna stick around this game a lot longer trying out new builds etc. Back to the roots, but without taking steps backwards, is how I'd describe Dark Souls III.","April 25","true","108.0"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","15","25","2","0"

Health potions are Estus Flasks, and maximum health increases through Vigor instead of Vitality, which increases carry weight capacity for some reason. Magic potions are Ashen Estus Flasks, and the player is an Ashen One, which means undead, but not the same kind of undead as friendly NPCs—though still just as perfectly alive-looking—and not the same kind of undead as the enemies, who are Hollows, but the player can become Hollow. Also, being slightly on fire increases max health by thirty percent, but then murderous, red ghosts can appear out of nowhere and start rolling around. And while that’s only the tip of the crazyberg, don’t expect Dark Souls 3 to explain any of it. Its tutorial level consists of splashing about in puddles and reading brief descriptions of console controls before a 15-foot, armored death machine slaps your face right off your head.\n\nAnd it never gets any clearer. What little is explained in game is done so in maddeningly esoteric dialog, so instead the player must minimize the screen over and over and over to try and make sense of what the game is saying through other people. This is a tremendous weakness. It is said that this confusion is intentional, but that does not change the fact that consistently having to leave the game in order to understand it is an outright failure. I wouldn’t blame anyone for being discouraged from playing Dark Souls 3 due to its clunky, unintuitive nature, but I would strongly urge them to stick with it. Because once the online community helps make sense of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that the developers wrapped this game in, it is revealed to be a very enjoyable experience.\n\nIt’s a 3D action RPG dungeon crawler reminiscent of the old school Castlevania series. It’s also deeply beautiful, with sprawling labyrinths of gothic architecture, and plenty of overlooks from which the player can gaze across a jungle of towers and crumbling stonework. The visual presentation is simply masterful, and enemies are no exception. There are so many variations, each with multiple attacks/abilities, and all of them well-crafted, whether curious, creative, or often downright unsettling. Though it seems with so much careful attention to visual detail there was less room for sound design. There is very little music in the game, most of it occurring during boss battles, and most of it entirely forgettable.\n\nExperience points are replaced with souls, which double as currency, and leveling up is as simple as spending an incrementally increasing amount of souls to improve a single stat point by one. Souls drop on death (along with all enemies respawning), but can be recovered should the player return to where they died, so long as they do not die again before collecting, in which case the souls are lost forever. In this way, every bit of progress feels fought for and earned, and the urge to explore is weighed against the caution of large numbers of souls; it is a very compelling balance. The ability to leave messages on the ground for other players allows for a sense of camaraderie as the player is warned against impending ambushes, or alerted to hidden treasure, and also empowers a group of spirited preteens to write, “try jumping,” at the edge of every fatal cliff.\n\nThe story is an absolute joke. There isn’t one, not in any real sense of the word. Narrative is delivered to the silent protagonist from the various NPCs in an awkward Shakespearian dialect, and so many of them speak in a disinterested monotone followed by disjointed laughter. Motivations are left in the dark, character development is nonexistent, and characterization is incredibly poor. Even after seeing the brief ending and watching all the others online, I could not tell you what’s going on in Dark Souls 3, and truthfully, no one can. It’s all just speculation, which again is said to be intentional on the part of the developers, and again, is an utter failure. But that’s ok; this game does not need story to function. It’s not about that so much as it is exploration and gameplay.\n\nGameplay is hack and slash through and through. An arsenal of medieval weaponry, both practical and ridiculous, is lootable or purchasable, with competent design and upgrades allowing even weapons found early on to remain effective until the very end. While there are some clearly superior weapons, Dark Souls 3 seems to largely favor personal style over a narrow power progression. It is possible to specialize in magic as well, but while there are many useful defensive and utility spells, offensive spells often overlap in usefulness, if they are lucky enough to be useful at all. It is more likely that one or two spells found very early on will remain primarily used throughout the entire game, making magic much less varied and interesting than weapon focused builds.\n\nDefensively, players are able to block, parry, dodge, or rely on their armor. Blocking, which requires any shield, eats through stamina and will leave the player staggered without heavy investment in gear and stats, but is very reliable in terms of execution. Parrying, which requires specific shields or weapons, will stun an enemy, allowing for a powerful riposte attack, but has a very small window of execution, combined with the fact that attack timing is different, not only for every enemy, but for the multiple attacks available to each enemy, and not all enemies can be parried. Dodging is just free invincibility. It takes stamina, but can still be performed infinitely with no stamina left. It requires no specific equipment, nor stat investment, can reposition the player for flanking, and every attack can be dodged. Armor is… really more for looks than anything. Sure, there are different absorption values attached to different armors, but enemies hit so hard, always staggeringly hard, that being hit at all is not sensible. Just pick what makes you feel pretty and keep dodge rolling; it’s simply the superior defense.\n\nBosses should get some special mention for Dark Souls 3. Many games today eschew traditional elements of boss battles, but Dark Souls embraces them. Bosses should be difficult; they should hit hard; they should be intimidating, preferably with multiple forms, and these bosses are all these things… if the game is played solo. It is fairly simple to play co-op with others online, or even NPCs, which utterly trivializes bosses. There’s no downside to playing with others; it’s just a way to completely strip the game of difficulty. But even when playing alone, the invisibility spell trivializes any non-boss encounter. Truthfully, I was disappointed with the ever proclaimed difficulty of this game. Having now beat it myself, I can’t help but sigh at all those mewling articles online demanding that Dark Souls 3 have any easy mode, when in fact it needed a hard mode.","May 24","true","120.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arumantis/recommended/374320/","arumantis","Mateo (MattGiersoni)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arumantis/","420 products in account","SPOILER FREE REVIEW\nDark Souls 3 is the third and most likely final installment of the Dark Souls series. It's a beautifully crafted goodbye letter to the fans. The game is set in the land of Lothric, presumably hundreds of years after the events of Dark Souls 1 & 2. The world is enormous and very diverse, albeit more linear than the land of Lordran from Dark Souls 1. The areas are quite large,  filled with multiple pathways to explore. Fans of the first game will be pleased to see the return of shortcuts, a vital feature of the world design largely missing from Dark Souls 2. Both of these characteristics make the world of Lothric more like its DS1 predecessor, and personally, I quickly forgot about the linearity. The areas are fun to explore, their geographical positioning makes sense, and they follow the rule "if you can see it, you can probably go there."\n\nThe story is written really well. It's full of mysteries and interesting things for the player to uncover. There are plenty of NPCs, most of them likeable, and their questlines are intriguing. As always, a lot of them are hard to find, and difficult to complete on your own during the first playthrough. The game contains a lot of references to both DS1 and DS2. Fans of the lore will surely get some answers. A few of the throwbacks serve merely as fan service, but the vast majority of them have purpose, and will make more sense after your first playthrough. There's a valid reason for their existence, but it's a spoiler free review. It is a sequel after all, probably the ending of the series, so no wonder plenty of things make a comeback.\n\nWhen it comes to graphical fidelity, Dark Souls 3 is the most beautiful souls game. It is largely thanks to using the same engine as Bloodborne, a game equally as stunning. The graphical options are nicely customizable, and you can notice the changes right away, without having to reload. The game's maximum framerate is 60fps. At launch, many players experienced crashes and poor performance, but most of these problems were fixed. While it's still not perfect, the game runs well, even on older hardware.\n\nVisual design is as always, top-notch. The world feels very believable, atmospheric, every single element looks amazing. The clothing in particular is the best in the series. Cloth and capes actually move, and your entire set gets more and more bloody as you progress through an area. There is plenty of armor and weapon sets to choose from, both old and new. Dark Souls 3 contains 100+ weapons, 80+ spells/miracles/pyromancies, and over 60 full armor sets. All of them look and feel great. There's plenty to choose from. You can build your character any way you want to. There are 19 bosses, with small exceptions, all of them are epic, and the fights are memorable.  The game itself is full of secrets, secret areas. Illusionary walls work the same way they did in DS1. You have to hit it or roll through it, either's fine. It's definitely more intuitive than pressing buttons against every wall like in DS2.\n\nGameplay is now more refined, and a bit faster than DS1 & 2. Enemies are more aggressive, and tanking hits is much harder now, especially in early game. Dark Souls 3 introduces a new mechanic called "weapon arts." Besides a normal moveset, each weapon has a unique ability/alternate 2-handed moveset. The addition of "weapon arts" gives even more flexibility to the way you play. Every weapon feels viable, and great to use.\n\nSpells, miracles, and pyromancies look awesome. Thanks to the return of the mana system from Demon's Souls (now called focus points or FP), magic users no longer have limited uses on their spells. A new item, Ashen Estus Flask allows you to regain your FP points. You can now split your number of Estus Flasks in any way you want to. For example, if your current maximum flasks number is 8, you can assign 6 of them for healing, and 2 for FP restoration. It is a neat little system, and makes magic even more viable and fun to play with.\n\nThe online component is the best in the series. There are 8 covenants you can join, each with its own purpose, and backstory. The password system known from Bloodborne makes a return. You can now create a password, and share it with your friends. Then you will only be able to summon and play with people who use the same password. This makes co-op and online play with friends much more pleasant and easier to set up. Maximum of 6 player can be at once in a session. Due to the lack of a designated arena, many players use specific locations to create so-called "fight clubs." The host summons phantoms and invaders to battle each other with a specified set of rules, made up by all parties involved. The overall player count is extremely large, and you will definitely have no problem either invading or helping people/cooperating.\n\nFinally, let's talk about the soundtrack. As usual, very few areas have their specific themes. That's the nature of the souls games, you need full awareness of your surroundings. Boss themes is where the sound aspect of the game shines. The music is epic, and contains some of the best themes in the series. If you are super sensitive to spoilers, avoid listening to the OST outside the game. Song titles spoil the names of bosses.\n\nTo me, personally, Dark Souls 3 is the best game in the series. It combines the best elements from all games, and makes them even better. Every game has its flaws and this one's no different. NG+ does not have too many changes, and one or two bosses weren't that great. Otherwise, there is not a lot to complain about. FROM Software still has its magic touch, and made a true masterpiece. Thankfully, that's not the end. There's still DLC to come, first one planned for fall. Judging by the level of quality of Bloodborne's DLC, I'm sure the additional content for Dark Souls 3 will be phenomenal. I strongly recommend this game. Now it's time for me to get all achievements and make plenty of new characters. See you in Lothric, and don't forget to Praise The Sun! \o/","May 13","true","111.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I started playing the series on PS3 (demon souls) and i never finished it as I was still scrub at that time and had no idea WTF IS THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT. I returned to the series with dark souls 2 and to be honest I liked it. Someone once told me Dark souls was superior so I borrowed the game and gave it a shot. and I liked both.\n\nNow we have the third and final game of the series, and gosh it is amazing. I was so excited for the game that it really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off when certain people get to play 3 weeks earlier, and items location starts to pop up on the net. Trying to avoid spoilers as much as I could but well, internet is the internet. But at least there wasnt much spoilers after Abyss Watchers since there was an embargo. Which is nice..ish Still sucked that you couldnt play till 3 weeks later.\n\nNow to the actual gameplay\n\nIt plays wonderfully on my GTX 970. No random crashed. Combat is fun. I'd say its a combo between bloodborne style with dark souls 1. A lot of weapons to choose from. So all builds are viable builds. Except estoc.. cause ♥♥♥ estoc.. pffff\n\nCons\n\nHackers... well we know this would happen on any PC game. Sigh. \\n\nI'd give this game a solid 9.5/10. I take 0.5 away cause there's 3 ♥♥♥♥ING POISON SWAMP AREA. Its like miyazaki just go and like.. hey you know what would be better than 1 poisonous swamp area? 3 POISONOUS SWAMP AREA.

The gentle heat of the bonfire brings with it an aura of tranquility that only the Unkindled will ever truly understand. There’s panic within the calm, but panic is omnipresent on your journey; the stone from which your labyrinth is constructed. Mind foggy, you stare into the crackling flames, trying to piece together how you got back here. You died of course, but cursed ones such as yourself always come back; ‘what got me?’ is the question on your mind. You ponder this matter; it was something blunt. Yes, blunt; and incredibly heavy for that matter. It felt cold, as death always does, but more so than usual. Ah, there it is, clarity; that accursed watchdog from Irithyll had done you in. He’s a fast one despite his stature, and certainly unlike anything you’ve faced prior. That mace of his is quite menacing and, though it looks unwieldy, he definitely swung it with ease. A fearsome competitor, a warrior befitting the title ‘Heir to the Fire’, but not enough to keep you at bay. You steel yourself and meet the entry to his domain, determined to make this your final visit. With a solemn step, you part the fog; the fire of battle ignited within.\n\nREVIEW\nDark Souls III\n\nGENRE\nAction RPG\n\nThe love-child of everyone’s favorite masochistic enabler, From Software, Dark Souls III is the culmination of a series-wide effort to break the record for broken spirits and controllers alike. From the humble western fantasy of Demon’s Souls to bloodsoaked eldritch horror of Bloodborne, players far and wide have learned what it truly means to be brought to your knees. And so it’s time for the main line’s third, and supposedly final, installment to bring its best to the table. With refined combat, improved matchmaking, and a return to form in terms of branching paths; can DS3 make a name for itself among its eternally infamous brethren, or will it fall into step with its predecessor Dark Souls II and be known forever as the mark of a dying franchise? Objective questions like that can’t be answered or assured by the likes of me, but I can make certain one thing; you’ll die. A lot.\n\nAllow me to commune with the spirits that be and channel my inner VaatiVidya to discuss the story of this game. In DS3 you are one of the Unkindled, undead souls unfit even to be cinders. As one of the Unkindled, you are cursed with the dark sign; forcing to forever wander the lands, unable to die. [Sorta.]  Against what has been ordained, the Lords of Cinder have not returned to their thrones; making it your job to hunt them down and bring them back by force; though things can’t always be so simple. Considering the fact that you literally crawled out of the ground; you’re a bit of a chump, and victory won’t be comin’ easy. The High Wall of Lothric wasn’t built in a day, and so too must the warrior be slowly chiseled from the base. By spending souls, you can progressively upgrade your character and weapons to make yourself more effective, but beware; with death comes loss of souls. If you die, you’ve got to retrieve your souls or lose all that progress, and dying on the way back causes you to lose them forever. So, prepared to die and equipped with a sippy cup of Sunny-D, some blue juice from wannabe Oscar’s corpse, and that wonderfully hideous face of yours; you begin your quest to become a lord-slayer.\n\nCombat feels satisfying. Whether it be with a hefty greatsword, a grand lance, or just a good ol’ mace; you can be sure that your attacks will feel meaty and effective. Straight swords sadly take dominance over all other weapon types as of now,but  their boring playstyle will hopefully persuade you to peruse your other options. Almost all weapon types have been rebalanced to be not only viable, but interesting and fun to use. Weapon arts add a whole ‘nother level of complexity to the system, and their addition is heartily welcomed into this veteran’s playbook. Boss weapons almost always have a flashy, devastating attack; though they’re hard to land. Other weapons arts would include stomp, perseverance, and spin attacks, but most weapons just have the ‘stance’ ability; which allows you to take an offensive form to deal massive damage. None of these abilities can be accessed without the use of focus points, however, a returning feature from Demon’s Souls. It’s basically mana.\n\nBoss fights and level design are equally fantastic this time around. Boss fights are all very fun, but none of them are really anything new to the series. Each has two phases and, though it seems interesting at first, it eventually becomes very, very tiresome. I will say, however, that I think the final boss may be the single best Souls boss in the entire series, but that’s just me. Each level is varied and interesting, each with their own set of enemies and hazards to keep you on your toes. My personal favorite would have to be Lothric Castle, one of the final areas. Multiple elevators and hidden doors weave in between the level to conveniently connect important spots and save you time. Each time you find a new shortcut, it’s like a breath of fresh air; a great burden lifted from the weary shoulders of a traveler. The lowest point would have to be Anor Londo, a cesspool of all the things horrible with Souls level design. Giants playing dead wake up to assault you whilst priests shoot high-damage fireballs at you from afar. At the same time, two pseudo-human enemies charge after you with quick, powerful weapons; and it’s still not over yet. Anor Londo is also home to the Alrich Faithful, the Bellkeepers 2.0. Two of them can invade you at once, instantly bringing you into an unfair fight, and I’ll be damned if they aren't guaranteed to fight like ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Thankfully the area is short, but that didn't stop it from leaving a horrible taste in my mouth. [And the faint taste of swedish meatballs, strangely…]\n\nBut here comes my biggest gripe. [Brace yourselves, folks, this one might shock ya.] This game is way too easy. Not easy for video game standards as a whole, but easy for a Souls game. Outside of my first run of the game, which was obviously blind, I rarely died to anything. Boss fights are a breeze; they’re no longer dudes in armor, but they’re barely a threat in most cases. Enemies have predictable attack patterns with easily noticeable tells, and the only thing that might really kill you is stunlock. With little-to-no skill, this game could easily be beaten by anyone, you’ve just gotta learn from your mistakes.\n\nHere’s the thing though; Souls games have never been about the difficulty. It was never about it being the ‘hardest game of all time.’ It was never about how much you’d die, how hard you throw your controller, how furious you’d get. It was about the environmental storytelling, it was about the little details you’d pick up from item descriptions, it was about the lore behind the characters, it was about the silent bond formed through cooperation with a summoned ally. Dark Souls isn’t the hardest game of all time, and it was never meant to be. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying they’re cake-walks; they’ll definitely kick your ♥♥♥ if you don’t learn, but that’s just it. It was, is , and always will be a game about the reward of overcoming adversity by learning from your mistakes. Much like you would in life, you’ll make mistakes. You’ll stumble, you’ll do the wrong thing, you’ll take the wrong path, but you’ll learn from those mistakes. You’ll pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and chuckle as you keep on keepin’ on. Who’s plotting against you, who’s there to help, what threat’s just around the corner? No one knows, life’s not a fair game. At any moment, we’re prepared to die, but with the knowledge of the past we can better face the trials ahead. Dark Souls is the game of life, so chin up; you learn something new every day.","May 28","true","141.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kokyalord/recommended/374320/","Kokyalord","SWATTAH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kokyalord/","182 products in account","So many issues with this game.\n\nFirst off poise is disabled for armor and rings, just straight up non-existant. It exists for certain weapon arts but beyond that its completely useless. What makes it worse is that fromsoft says its "working as intended" so we probably wont see a fix for a LONG while.\n\nSecond, weapon balance. Estoc and Dark sword completely dominate pvp and phase out other weapon classes like greatswords. Why use a big heavy sword when you can r1 spam with an estoc/dark sword and do twice as much damage in the same time span as well as stunlock them to infinity because poise is disabled? Also there is pretty much no counter to people who two hand greatshields, sure you can grab them with sacred flame but if they have half the brains of the average player theyll roll away. So they can just tank behind the shield and bash you, as it blocks all forms of damage. Another issue is fist weapon parrying. Why use percise timing to parry when you can just spam the parry button because they have virtually zero cooldown?\n\nThird, covenants. Blue sentinels and the blades of the darkmoon are literally the exact same thing. What happened to how it used to work? Instead they just have to wait until a way of the blue player gets invaded, and good luck with that because NO ONE is a way of the blue at high soul levels.\n\nFourth, MAGIC. PLEASE BUFF MAGIC. For the love of god its terrible in pvp unless you are some ♥♥♥♥ing wizard in real life. Sorceries have terrible tracking and relatively low damage unless you pump EVERYTHING into magic damage, that means equipping magic increasing items and setting intelligence to 60+, oh, also I forgot to mention that INTELLIGENCE DOESNT START REALLY SCALING UNTIL 40-60. That means if you don't have that much invested into it, your spells will be extremely sub-par. So magic users are forced to go big or go home. If they buffed the damage, casting speed, tracking of spells as well as making it so intelligence scales like EVERY OTHER DAMAGE STAT, maybe magic will have a good chance in pvp.\n\nFifth, fromsoft themselves. I have serious doubts on if they will fix ANY of these glaring issues. They have developed a habit of creating the most cryptic of patch notes with such great examples: "adjusted spell fp consumption" "adjusted the following weapons". CAN YOU JUST SAY WHAT YOU ♥♥♥♥ING FIXED. Plus the general attitude theyve had towards stuff like poise adds to my doubts.\n\nOverall, the game is a great successor to the previous games but gets seriously dragged down in pvp AND pve by these issues. People need to realize this isn't a perfect game and if they want it to be, they should all give it a healthy dose of criticism to get fromsoft's attention, because as long as the community sees this as a "perfect game", they'll just sit back and let the money flow in.","June 4","false","173.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Good job on that one, the MP is so much more enjoyable.\n\nThe only thing I do not really like is the level capping since the game has a build in difficulty system for when you go NG+ or higher so it would be pretty do-able to change difficulties when summoning verry high leveled players, but this could be an endless discussion caus there are always down and up sides.\n\nI also saw some environments and models back from DS1, which was a nice feeling back to thoose days but I did expect more new models/bosses to be around but I aint complaining at all.\nThe game doesnt feel that long either but this can be on the fact that I summon a lot of friends, progress goes way faster that way.\nCurrently I am in NG+ almost at the end and I will replay it again on NG++, that should say enough on how much I like this game :-)\n\nI do recommend it for others to buy aswell and enjoy this game!\nBe aware if you loose a couple times from a boss, it can become annoying or irritating, taking a break is that best thing I could recommend and try again another time.

I love the Dark Souls series and playing this game gave me the same joy I had when I played Dark Souls 1 for the first time. The tense moments got my heart pumping and made me excited. The reason I mention this is because I have been scared to play the game anymore.\n\nThe reason why is because of the rampant hacking problem that has been plaguing this game since launch. Ever since I have heard of what hackers could do and how they could get you banned and character deleted even though you didn't do anything is a atrocity to this brilliant game. And if you don't go online, one, you are missing a huge part of the game, and two, this is the fault of From SoftWare/ Bandai Namco's refusal to do anything to fix it. Why should we have to worry about all of our hard earned progress being lost because some guy felt like being a ♥♥♥♥. What doesn't help is also the fact that the actual hackers and cheaters here are not punished at all. Some guy literally streamed himself hacking the game and ruining peoples characters by getting them banned and nothing was done to him. He is still playing the game and his character has not been deleted. From SoftWare/Bandai Namco, this is ruining your game and is making people leave. It is also reducing the amount of sales you could possibly can get since people are scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of their character getting deleted and getting banned cause hackers are running rampant. Please do something about it. Since I won't be playing this game anymore, I will not be buying the DLC that will inevitably come out. I suggest you do the same in till this problem has been solved. And if you are looking to buy this game, don't. I suggest you also wait.

The result is the most polished and least obtuse offering so far, removing some of the needlessly cryptic aspects the series has had while maintaining a sense of narrative mystery and remaining jammed with obscure secrets. Dark Souls 3’s biggest weakness is that its formula is no longer as fresh and unique as it once was. Veterans of From Software’s last several games will know exactly how to approach Dark Souls 3.

I figured I might give her a more updated game, so I introduced her to FL Studio 9 Producer Edition. Unfortunately, she had not experienced the first 8 installments in the series, so she was completely lost in the series. Other games like Daemon Tools and LinkedIn were simply too expensive, regardless of how good gameplay they might have.\n\nHowever, then I discovered DARK SOULS™ III. This is basically the dream game for any 2-year old. It has everything she's been looking for. Regardless of what she might say, my daughter is an extremely skilled gamer and masters every game like the elitist she is. Some games like Spotify and Samsung Galaxy S7 were simply too easy to master; she beats world-level competitors for these games on the daily. On the other end of the spectrum, she couldn't even beat the final boss to games such as Skrillex and Aquafina. The skill required for DARK SOULS™ III is the perfect balance between Samsung Galaxy S7 and Aquafina, if I am to be perfectly honest.\n\nThis game has kept my little one year old girl occupied from the day of her conception to the very present while I am writing this. She is currently ranked in the top thousand players in terms of elo rating, and she has some of the best gear I've seen in the whole Call Of Duty franchise. DARK SOULS™ III also offers some of the most breathtaking downloadable content available for any game I've seen. The only game that even rivals DARK SOULS™ III in terms of downloadable content would have to be Hotel Mario, but I will save that review for another time.\n\nHowever, no game is without its faults, and this game has more than I have ever seen in any film across the Federated States of Micronesia. Where do I even begin? First of all, the game is clearly optimised for the GameBoy Advance system, so the resolution scales horribly on my six 8K monitors. Secondly, the game simply CANNOT run on my Windows 2000 machine, which severely limits the portability of this game for me. Additionally, a normal QWERTY keyboard will put a hardcap on the framerate, which is actually a huge issue being that I stream with a high-speed camera.\n\nRegardless, I hope to see more Bloodborne installments in the series. Great job, Valve! You guys have really outdone yourselves this time. If more good news keeps coming like this, hopefully my wife's unborn child will survive the second coming of Christ.\nAve, True to Caesar.","April 19","true","166.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","6","8","7","0"

Will update review if FROM adresses the community regarding banning players for playying the game normally.\n\nEDIT: 5/11/16\nTo random people that see this review and find my word untrustworthy. I highly suggest browsing the net and looking for yourself, Bandai Namco/FROM literally state online in multiple outlets that they consider any code injection a breach of EULA and therfore bannable. Specifically including controller emulation. Thus the only recourse is to buy a 60 dollar xbox controller rather than use the controllers that most budget gamers already have.\n\nTo reiterate, FROM / BN are BANNING people from the online elements (read "a huge portion") of the game for using off brand controllers with a controller emulator rather than an overpriced games for windows controller. They KNOW that thats all that said people have done (upon examining their accounts supposedly) and they just state to said people that "no one has ever been un-banned once banned".\n\nThats ♥♥♥♥♥ customer service on top of shoddy programming, and I for one view that as an insult. If i could refund this ♥♥♥♥ i would. Instead, i muck through in solo play. Till they deside to ban me from that too for using a ps3 controller knock off.","May 7","false","35.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

That being said, I feel as if I'm far enough into the game to where my opinion won't change by much, if at all.\n\nI previously made a joke review indicating that this game was a poor man's Bloodborne, but now I'm starting to think that really is the case. Coming into this game with Bloodborne fresh in my mind, I can't help but think Bloodborne was the more interesting game. I'm not saying Bloodborne is a flawless gem, it has quite a few problems itself (Blood Vials, linear for a little too long, limited multiplayer design, etc) but in the long run BB was a much more satisfying game.\n\nIn terms of world design, the game is alright. It's very consistent, although that's probably due to the game railroading you down a certain path up until you reach Road of Sacrifice. The game is incredibly linear, but not DaSII levels of linear. It opens up forks, however there's nothing quite as open and expansive as the first DaS, or the choices you had in DeS with the hub location. It tries to mix the two and it's not bad, but it could definitely be better. Something that ruins the experience of DaS3 is the awful enemy placement. Every single other encounter feels like some cheap (but manageable) ambush, and it stopped being fun pretty quickly as you were expecting it.\n\nEnemy design is pretty good, some shoddy hitboxes with some of the bigger beast enemies, but overall solid. Nice to have more than just oversized humanoids in giant packs that aggro together.\n\nIn terms of bosses, the game starts out okay with the first boss and then it drops in quality afterwards up until about Farron's Keep, from then it's hit/miss until the first three lords are reclaimed. Everything so far after that moment seems solid, and I hear good things about every upcoming boss save for one last gimmick fight. DLC may bring in some actual good boss fights as well, as per usual. But the earlier boss fights in this game are pretty dull gimmicky encounters.\n\nThe stats are completely ♥♥♥♥ed in Dark Souls III. Apparently poise in it's current form is actually a bug, but removing health from Vitality and splitting equip load from Endurance, why? Who thought this would be a good idea? Why are swords even more viable than UGS or any weapon that tends to be slower and consume more stamina?\n\nPvP seems to be better, although that's something that tends to depend on the community. And knowing the community the Dark series harbors, no thanks. Good efforts though, as BB was pretty questionable with it's latency and hit detection. This is more of a personal vendetta against the community rather than the devs. I'm sure From put lots of work into it, no matter how imbalanced this series will be.\n\nThere are more points that I kind of glossed over, but these are the bigger parts of the series in my opinion. While there are some really well done moments in this game, the series feels as though it should be a sum of it's parts. Having all good bosses while the rest of the game was a bore wouldn't have saved it honestly. Everything in this game feels mediocre. Especially when compared to Bloodborne's fine tuning, this felt somewhat rushed out. About on par with the original Dark Souls since that game seems to go downhill past the halfway mark. Maybe the DLC will save the game, it's always been the best part of each game. Maybe my overall opinion will change once it releases and I've finished the game.","May 9","false","46.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

First off a main statue of the game, "poise" is missing so expect to get stunlocked by just about everything. Secondly the meta pvp of the game is absolute trash. Essentially if you do not spam, then you will be killed by someone who does. Granted this has been a reoccuring problem in the souls series, but without poise the issue is worse. The boss fights, with the exception of some two bosses or so, are terribly deigned. Character design has been watered down for beginners, with over powered starting classes. Other aspects of the game have been watered down as well, for example, there is a bountiful amount of bonefires. The most in any souls game actually. NPC's are forgettable, as well as their questlines. The lore behind this game seems to be the weakest and most obserd in the series. Leveling up is a pain as the only way to level up is to go to the firekeeper, similar to Dark Souls 2. There is an obserd amount of hackers that will edit your profile and get you banned. Way too many issues for a game to be called complete, and should have been fixed prior to. I am an avid From Sotware fan, but their recent titles have seriously changed my mind.

These are the resons why personally I was dissapointed in this game. I've finished it and built full subjective opinion about it. So here we go.\n\nIn general:\n- I'm a big fan of Dark Souls 1. This game is very different. If you like DS1 - you might not like this game.\n- I don't like Bloodborne visual and game tempo. This game looks like Bloodborne and enemies are as fast as in Bloodborne. If you like Bloodborne - this game might work for you.\n- The game does not feel like Dark Souls. If it was not named Dark Souls, it would feel much different, but i built my expectations basing on previous games.\n\nSystem:\n- No cloud saves, though even DS1 has this function.\n- I've experienced quite a lot of crashes using bonfires.\n- Stattering after picking up some drop or killing some enemies.\n- The game is not playable on keyboard, because all controls are shown for 360 controller.\n\nGame Mechanics:\n- Hit and block tactics from DS 1 is replaced with Bloodborne R1 spam and roll. I've played the whole game without a shield, with 1 handed sword, and never felt uncomfortable. Every boss is abused by timed rolling and hit&run tactics. Uselesness of shields comes from fast enemies who spam a lot of attacks. It breaks your block and sucks all your stamina, opening you to another attack spam. Remember hollowed pigmies in DS1, who would sometimes go in rage and spam you with non-stop attacks? Now every enemy attacks the same way all the time. I mean it - all the time. It felt like they don't have weight and stamina anymore.\n- Awfull hit detection. There is often no visual reason of being hit, like the sword of the enemy would not even get close to player, but you receive full damage, especially happens on bosses. You can get hit through walls and obstacles. This kind of mistake in unforgivable for a game, based around fighting.\n- Nonreusable locations. The game feels like a corridor that goes in different directions. The whole world is designed in horizontal projection, comparing to vertical in DS1.\n- Often bonfires are placed right after another, with none enemies in between.\n- Questinable bosses, like the giant or a dragon. Not going to describe what happens, but they are not interesting to fight.\n- However, movement is much better than in DS2. Can't say it is better than in DS1, because it is different.\n\nVisual:\n- This game looks like a DLC for Bloodborne, that is all i have to say. The whole world is grey and yellow, making it quite boring for me after collorfull DS1. Color correction makes every location look the same.\n- Due to optimiztion limitations, the game is often greedy on backgrounds. And you can clearly differ backgound area from player accesable area.\n- Lookalikeness of the whole architecture. If you've played DS1, you've most likely noticed how often you'd look around and see places you've been minutes or hours before. Forget about it in DS3, because everything looks the same and blank.\n- Copy-pasted enemies from previous DS and from Bloodborne.\n- Anor londo from DS1 - very small and boring version\n\nStory:\n- This is basically copypasta from DS1 and DS2.\n- The game does not feel like Dark Souls anymore. You have direct task from the beginning, and there is very little of mystery left. There is no derpessive atmosphere, no feeling of danger, you don't feel yourself helpless or forgotten. You are a HERO now. You are a hunter. You go forward and kill more and more. This may be a good hardcore slasher, but not Souls game.\n\nAnd in the end - my personal opinion on this game: the worst Dark Souls game so far. Zero new experience, tons of reusage of old outdated material, awful enemy design and awfully broken fight mechanics. It is clearly that the creator has ran out of ideas.","April 13","false","86.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Some people said this game would be linear but that is pure bs. The game is full of optional paths and open areas and imo has some of the best level design fromsoft has ever done.\n\nThe thing I wanna talk about in ds3 the most though is how amazing it is to have the proper boss design back, something I loved about the first dark souls was how every boss is a new and surprising challenge, going from the giant lardass asylum demon which you have to try and run around, Taurus demon which you have to bait and drop on / roll through between its legs, gargoyles and then a gigantic ♥♥♥♥ing dragon mouth beast. In ds2 I was so disappointed with 99% of bosses following one of 2 formulas;\n1. A two legged central character with a "1point" hitbox, that used pivoting attacks which you were forced to always roll through rather than avoid or walk around like you could in the other souls games (Pursuer, dragon rider, Vendrick, glass knight, flexile sentry, dragonslayer, the rotten, smelter demon, Velstadt and Najka.\nor\n2. just a bunch of copy pasted "multiple enemy" garbage meme boss types, like the rats, gargoyles, sentinels, skeleton lords, double dragon riders, magus and congregation.\n\nThere are exceptions to this, like the slightly interesting demon of song or the ancient dragons, but the rest of those exceptions are pretty widely considered as garbage bosses, and dont even try to tell me you thought Old Iron king or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sif rat were good. DLC has one or two bosses that might be decent although I think theyre pretty overrated, but either way the gank squad, smelter demon v2, cat and cat v2 drag it down.\n\nTherefore its such a huge relief to see that every boss I've played in ds3 so far has been something new and diffrenet much like in ds1, just with even bigger and more amazing surprises, mechanics and designs that seperate them from the rest. The only problem with the bosses is that they have very small health pools, making it easy just to walk up to the boss and start hacking away, tanking many of their attacks since you wont run out of healing and making it pointless to spend time to trying to figure your way around its unique and complex moveset and develop new strategies. This was the case for me even though I avoided upgrading my weapon as much as possible and put almost all levels into vitality and endurance.\nBloodborne's DLC bosses were amazing fun when they had a giant health pool and would take around 40-50 tries to complete, and I imagine many of Ds3's bosses are also a lot fun when you are weaker, since they also seem to have unique and interesting movesets.\n\nSo yeah, this game is amazing, and I recommend not upgrading your weapon until you deem it completely nescessary. And do not do bosses in coop, just dont. It takes away so much of the satisfaction and fun in doing them. If the bosses in ds3 were ♥♥♥♥ and you wanted to finish them in as few tries as possible I could understand mimaxing / coop, but luckily theyre not, and they are definitely worth spending some time on, :)","April 18","true","99.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mooacnx/recommended/374320/","mooacnx","Miporin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mooacnx/","737 products in account","TL;DR - The concept is good. I love how the game conveys that this is ‘Dark Souls 3’. The gritty atmosphere, and the lore behind it, is attractive and interesting. However, the overall gameplay is a bit of disappointment. IMHO, the game is good for only the ‘FIRST’ playthrough.\n\nPvP / Invading / Dueling is kind of nice, on paper, really, but it is actually kind of broken, when it comes to real thing.\n\nBe warned, your first playthough can takes from 10-60 hours depending on your playstyle, however, your following playthrough can be finished much faster. (3-5 hours)\n\nFeel likes more reading? Continue below:\n(I won’t be mentioning about what is good already, but the disappointments)\n\nPvEI wouldn’t dare say that the game can be described as hard, nor challenging, but instead, imo, punishes those who blindly rush in thinking that they can slash their ways through the mobs.\n\nI am certain that you will be sent back to the bonfire for a few times in each ‘newly’ discovered areas/encounters, but once you learnt about each of them, you can easily control each encounter, then after that, comes down to how you perform for each fight.\n\nDespite what I mentioned above, here is a big ‘BUT’, they are all coming down to one single problem. The badly designed AI.\n\nLet’s say, you masked your approach with a spell (silencing your steps), you melee one mob from the group, the nearby members will notice you (if they are actually nearby). However, if you change your approach, getting close enough to shoot with arrows/bolts, and then pull it away from the group. Not a soul will notice that his/her friend is missing.\n\nAgain, you are facing one trouble-some beast on the small bridge (for its size), you decided to pull back from the bridge area hoping to get away from the beast, then found out that it won’t follow you off the bridge area, and decided to stand and stare at you in the face, you then attempt to get into melee range, and bash away with your half-upgraded weapons, surprisingly, it stare back at you, doing nothing, but backing away until you get on the bridge again, allowing you free hits.\n\nOkay, you are on the narrow cliff, you saw a guy rushing down toward you at full speed, so you decided to dodge his attack. As he got close enough, he began charging toward you with his weapon at full-strength, you saw this opportunity, and rolled to the side, looking back to get ready for this guy. He’s not there anymore, but off the cliff into his own abyss.\n\nThese are some examples. There are many cheap ways to end the tough encounters, that you will find out during your playthrough, which is kind of sad.\n\nJust for your knowledge with the right equipments/setups, you can run through the whole things (not a completed one, but met all critical paths) in just a few hours, as you can just dash past everything to reach the boss.\n\nPvPIt is kind of pointless, imo. It is nice on the paper, but the actual thing is not. I am not talking about the rule, nor the honor or that kind of stuff, but the design itself.\n\nDuring my playthrough, I can hardly find Invaders that are not lagging, these can be resulted as weird hitboxes, not correctly displayed weapon ranges, delayed reactions, warping, or even ranged critical attacks. Trust me, facing likes 10 of these in a row is not fun. It is good when it works though. It just that, imo, the devs seem to forget to put in the factor that, not everyone is in the perfect conditions for these thing.\n\nLet’s say, instead of the player invaders, it should be likes AI invaders, but takes the stats/equipments from other actual players, and make PvP into some kind of arena match. These would do a better job in handling smooth gameplay for more people than what it currently is, imo.\n\nI will be updating this later, If I feel right to do so.\n\nedit: typos","April 30","true","77.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

The exploration and big dramatic boss fights remind me of something like Zelda Ocarina of Time but if they added the difficulty of Zelda 2 in there. It’s a really cool world to explore with a vast variety of enemies, character builds and weapons to play around with giving the already pretty long game a ton of replayability. Other than the PVP multiplayer, bonfire placement and a few bugs it’s a fine game and a great ending to the Dark Souls series. I’m considering getting back into playing Bloodborne now as well since my attitude towards the Soulsborne games has changed for the better with Dark Souls 3. If you’re looking for a varied, very challenging game then this is the right choice for you.\n\nFor my full review check out the video here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km9BLRb20s4","May 1","true","40.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

My experience with it was a nearly perfect one from the perspective of performance and stability.  I had no crashes and maintained a solid 60 frames per second throughout essentially the whole game.  Controller support is functional right out of the box without needing to go to Durante for a fix and you just need something like DS4Windows to use a Dual Shock 4 controller.\n\nThe weapon, monster and boss variety is great but the zone visual variety is a bit lacking when compared to the other souls games.  Most zones are tied together nicely and the ones that aren’t can be easily teleported to with short load times, at least on the PC version which is what I played.\n\nAll in all, this is a game that is absolutely worth playing.  It’s worth buying at full price and is a must have in the game library if you enjoy 3rd person action games.  It’s also pretty damn good for working on your hand eye coordination.  And with any luck, From Software will give us some great DLC content in between now and whatever their next dystopian psychologically horrific game happens to be.\n","May 3","true","59.7"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","1"

The Online Balance isnt quite fixed yet but Fromsoft has begun to fix some of the more broken weapons. Gameplay is MUCH faster paced in some Boss fights and areas than other Souls Series games. If you dont want to pay the full 60$ pricetag it would definitely worth it if it goes on sale for anything less after they have fixed all the bugs and crashes.\n\n-SIDE NOTE-\nI run the game on an i7 5820k, 16 GB RAM, and use a GTX 970 SLI setup so i may not have as many crashes as other PC users.

Granted, I've played a large amount of every souls game that has been released which I also highly recommend you check out (Demon Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, Bloodborne). Taking my time and looking for optional areas, it took me about 20 hours the beat the game. A fair length I would say, and due to the fact that many will not beat it that quick I'd say that is more than fair.\n\nVisuals\nThe game looks great, using the Bloodborne engine it is a clear graphical upgrade from DS II. In some areas the game actually reminds me of Bloodborne a fair bit, some extraordinarily so. I suspect it has something to do with the fact that Miyizaki was working on this game at the same time as Bloodborne DLC, but regardless.. In short I see no issue with the graphical fidelity personally, and the port this time is a big improvement from DS I.\n\nHowever, I am aware of some users having issues with bonfire crashes, and odd framerate issues. During my third playthrough, I played through my friends game via coop. During this time we did not encounter these problems, however we do indeed run very high end PC's. Another friend of mine, runs a lower end PC. And he did indeed run into the strange framerate issues. However, he has since stopped having this problem. Patched perhaps?\n\nGameplay/Online\nGameplay is about what you would expect from Dark Souls. Unlike Bloodborne if that is the only game you've played, the Dark Souls series has a slower paced combat, allows the use of shields among other things. Plenty of weapons to find and choose from, as well as many varying styles of gameplay are supported. One change is the Weapon Art system. This system uses a new blue AP bar under your health, which will allow you to use certain special abilities that weapons have. Whether it be a Stance, Buff, or Special Ability. I feel this was made with online in mind, along with the way that spells work in this game. Spells now use that blue bar as well, and has replaced the Spell Count in Attunement with simply improving that bar instead. If you use that bar for spellcasting you'll be referring it as your mana.. basically.\n\nBoss fights in this game I feel are exceptional. It more or less rectifies the issue I had with DS II bosses being too much "guy with sword" fight. While I agree that "guy with sword" is cool, I feel that more variation improves the experience. I'm not sure many people will disagree with that, especially if you've played Bloodborne or have gotten to a certain boss past the first Lord of Cinder in this game.\n\nOnline play is about as easy as it can get, barring some unforseen issue that may sometimes occur. (Gotta be careful where you put your sign down). If you are looking to play with a friend, simply put a password on your network settings and you should be good to go with your summon signs. Invading has a few twists now and again with different covenants. You may also choose to play offline as well. Only complaint is that Blue Sentinles at the moment is rather useless late game, no one is using Way of Blue during their second playthrough I feel.\n\nI am also aware of the fact that some users are being banned for seemingly no reason right now. I do not know why this is, or what is causing it. My best guess was another Steam reviewer stated that some people are able to invade your world and forcibly edit your stats or whatever. Regardless, FromSoft needs to protect their consumers and fix this issue. At this time, if you are not trying to coop with a friend of your and have no real interest in pvp, I'd recommend playing OFFLINE.\n\nI may edit this as time passes, but I feel this game is spectacular and absolutely worth the price. If you are a fan of the Souls series you will enjoy this game (you probably already are) and if you are new to the series I'd very much recommend this game on it's artistic value and engaging gameplay. Give it a go!\n\nAlso the soundtrack is breathtaking, truly a masterpiece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","April 23","true","97.1"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","17","30","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jab2565/recommended/374320/","jab2565","Jab","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jab2565/","994 products in account","Over the last few years, From Software has grown in reputation thanks to the series and being one of the most challenging on the market. The previous Dark Souls I felt stepped away from what made the series great and left From Software in a position to recover with Dark Souls III. With 3, we have a mix of old and new designed to push (and punish) players further.\n\nUndead Again:\n\nAs with previous games in the Souls series, you are an undead being cursed to wander the land until you eventually become hollow or insane. Upon awakening, you are given a quest to return the lords of cinder to their throne; this entails wandering a very big land and dying a lot. Just like the other games, there is a deep story hidden behind the lore, but I'm going to leave that for someone more versed in it to talk about.\n\nThe basics of the Souls are on full display here: Using a skill and timing-based combat system, you're going to be fighting enemies of all shapes and sizes while looking for shortcuts and the ever vital bonfires for checkpoints. As with Dark Souls 2, bonfires automatically allow you to teleport to them once found; allowing for quick travel to and from.\n\nGone is the controversial adaptation stat that affected invincible frames, and the game is back to keeping them consistent across characters. There are a few new base changes to the gameplay to give players more options. The first is that your eastus flask which is your only source of healing is now split into two. You have one flask for healing and one flask for recovering flame points or FP. FP is used for using spells and special skills that are unique to each weapon type.\n\nThe skills are a holdover from Bloodborne and are meant to give you more options in combat, and allow melee-focused characters a reason to boost their FP up.\n\nYou can assign how many of your total charges to the different flasks, and of course upgrade your flasks to restore more with each swig.\n\nPrevious games had a mechanic built around living and dying in the game: From the complex and level altering light/dark tendency in Demon's Souls, to a simple measurement in the previous Dark souls.\n\nIn Dark Souls III, you can use ember to earn a flame which gives you a higher max health and puts you in a position to summon help or be invaded as long as you don't die.\n\nYou'll need all of these, as Dark Souls III continues the difficult tradition of the series.\n\nSwinging a Sword:\n\nThe Souls series is known for having very challenging and rewarding combat, thanks to diverse enemies and boss fights. Dark Souls III definitely takes things up a notch in both areas. Regular enemies are more varied and a lot more dangerous this time around.\n\nThe reason is that enemies are faster, more aggressive and have been given more combo chains for their attacks. In previous games, an enemy would attack at most two or three swings in a single chain. Now, they will attack with more swings in a single string and their strings are more varied.\n\nFor instance, enemies may perform three swings that look the same, but have two or more different combo endings to them. They also have more attacks, including those designed to punish players for using previously effective strategies.\n\nI've ran into enemies who knew how to get around circle strafing or attack you if you keep swinging too much.\n\nBosses are also more varied and remind me of Dark Souls 1 in terms of variety and different solutions to beating them. Just like before, you can summon characters to help you or be summoned to recover your flame and get some souls in the process.\n\nFrom a moment-to-moment standpoint, Dark Souls III continues the greatness of the series, but there are some issues hiding under the surface.\n\nHollowed Out:\n\nDark Souls 3 has all the good elements of previous Souls games, but it also has all the bad as well. The camera continues to have trouble with not getting stuck while fighting larger enemies and the increased speed makes it hard for it to keep up.\n\nOf the three games and Demon's Souls (haven't played Bloodborne yet,) this one takes the cake for roughest start for new players. Unlike Demon's Souls that had a great beginning to run things by the player, you are thrust within minutes into your first boss fight and expected to learn or die.\n\nWhat makes Dark Souls different from Demon’s was the fact that the world was open-ended; allowing you to explore different sections that were still connected to the world's geography. Dark Souls 3 feels somewhat limited in this regard. The starting areas have a sameness to them and the connectivity between areas has been downplayed in favor of just shortcuts within each area. While this is better than the confusing world of Dark Souls 2, it doesn't beat Dark Souls 1 for world creation.\n\nAll the problems that have been inherent in the Souls series is back: Unhelpful camera, enemies attacking and glitching thru certain obstacles and each other, camera still getting stuck when fighting large enemies and so on. While people may have gotten used to them, it's still a mark against the game by the fact that nothing has been done it seems to try and fix them.\n\nThe new concern at the moment has to be the technical issues plaguing the game and some underlining mechanic issues. There is a bug going on that causes massive framerate lost, stuttering or simply game crashes due to the lighting.\n\nIt happens at specific points in the game which makes it all the more frustrating that it wasn't caught. And of course, people have been having connectivity issues with joining games. There are also issues on the console versions as well; hopefully From Software will get those straighten out.\n\nAlso, there are some points to discuss with the underlining mechanics and changes of Dark Souls III. The short version is that there are several mechanical changes that impact poise and armor, and their impact on both PvE and PvP. Unfortunately, they're way too big to get into detail about here, but that will be saved for a massive post coming to Game-Wisdom soon.\n\nLight the Fire:\n\nFrom Software continues to make subtle improvements to the moment-to-moment gameplay, but still is having trouble with the overall problems and concerns of the series. As with previous games, you're either going to love it or hate it for its ramped up difficulty and challenging fights.\n\nIf you're new, I would still suggest either Demon's Souls or Dark Souls  to get your feet wet (maybe Bloodborne, but I haven't played it,) as Dark Souls III really feels like it was designed for someone with one of the games already under their belt. For me, I find the game at the moment lands too much on the side of being cheap with its mechanics to really enjoy fully. Just like with Dark Souls 2, expect a second post on Game-Wisdom talking explicitly about the gameplay to come soon.\n\nAnybody worried that this would be a continuation of Dark Souls II, fear not, Dark Souls III is clearly better in every aspect, but to compare it to one, well, I got a "few" words to say about that in another post.\n\nFor more content on Dark Souls III, you can watch my depraved run on the Game-Wisdom YouTube channel.\n\nCheck out Game-Wisdom[game-wisdom.com]where I examine the art and science of games","May 3","true","105.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I enjoy it greatly, and hope others will. I don't want to glorify this in the wrong way, as it means different things to many.\n\nI feel that before I get into this review, I should give some elaboration on hardware. I can run things at a consistent 50-60 frames at low/medium settings (Textures and effects high, lighting low because of several bugs). This is what I'm running with -\n\nGraphics Card (GPU): AMD Radeon HD 7750\nProcessor: Intel Core i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40 GHz\n16 GB of RAM\nBought this as a pre-built PC before I knew much about building; it's 4-5 years old at least.\n\nNow, that's out of the way, on to the review.\n\nI like this game. I like it because it reminds me vastly of Dark Souls 1, and moreso, Demon's Souls. Not in a bad way; rather, in a way that seems refreshing, and breathes a feel that is nostalgic and unique into everything. Mood, design, it's all a wonderful balance, in my opinion. It's paced a bit faster, but still begs the patience you'd expect from the franchise.\n\nThat probably makes a bit more sense if you're a fan of the series already. If not, then whatever's below is for you.\n\nThe Souls series, as it stands, is probably among my favorites. It's not for everybody, which is absolutely understandable. It's grim fantasy, and the gameplay, while being difficult, is not done justice by being described merely as such. It's difficult for the sake of making the player learn and overcome, as opposed to just making the experience more tedious or grueling. It's got a learning curve, and a more-than-competitive online aspect to it.\n\nThat being said, each entry in the series is unique in it's own way. I'll avoid discussion of the other titles here, for the sake of keeping this a concise review. One could start with this being the first Souls game they play, and they'd be fine. Although, there's many references and lore implications in this game that allude to other games of the series. And speaking of lore, there's plenty of it to these games. It's rather vague at first, and much of it is in item descriptions, or the environment you explore, as well as characters you encounter. Personally, that makes it charming and intrigung to many, whereas for some, it makes it seem irritating and lazy. This is where it's up to the player to decide whether they want this, because again, it's not for everyone.\n\nSo in the end, I've not played much of this entry in the series yet, regrettably. Though, of my 23.2 hours, most of it is probably PVP, which is without a doubt much more accessible in this game. I'd fully recommend this to anyone who's willing, because there's much to be experienced here. it's something I'd hope for many to enjoy.","April 30","true","48.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jab2565/recommended/374320/","jab2565","Jab","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jab2565/","994 products in account","Over the last few years, From Software has grown in reputation thanks to the series and being one of the most challenging on the market. The previous Dark Souls I felt stepped away from what made the series great and left From Software in a position to recover with Dark Souls III. With 3, we have a mix of old and new designed to push (and punish) players further.\n\nUndead Again:\n\nAs with previous games in the Souls series, you are an undead being cursed to wander the land until you eventually become hollow or insane. Upon awakening, you are given a quest to return the lords of cinder to their throne; this entails wandering a very big land and dying a lot. Just like the other games, there is a deep story hidden behind the lore, but I'm going to leave that for someone more versed in it to talk about.\n\nThe basics of the Souls are on full display here: Using a skill and timing-based combat system, you're going to be fighting enemies of all shapes and sizes while looking for shortcuts and the ever vital bonfires for checkpoints. As with Dark Souls 2, bonfires automatically allow you to teleport to them once found; allowing for quick travel to and from.\n\nGone is the controversial adaptation stat that affected invincible frames, and the game is back to keeping them consistent across characters. There are a few new base changes to the gameplay to give players more options. The first is that your eastus flask which is your only source of healing is now split into two. You have one flask for healing and one flask for recovering flame points or FP. FP is used for using spells and special skills that are unique to each weapon type.\n\nThe skills are a holdover from Bloodborne and are meant to give you more options in combat, and allow melee-focused characters a reason to boost their FP up.\n\nYou can assign how many of your total charges to the different flasks, and of course upgrade your flasks to restore more with each swig.\n\nPrevious games had a mechanic built around living and dying in the game: From the complex and level altering light/dark tendency in Demon's Souls, to a simple measurement in the previous Dark souls.\n\nIn Dark Souls III, you can use ember to earn a flame which gives you a higher max health and puts you in a position to summon help or be invaded as long as you don't die.\n\nYou'll need all of these, as Dark Souls III continues the difficult tradition of the series.\n\nSwinging a Sword:\n\nThe Souls series is known for having very challenging and rewarding combat, thanks to diverse enemies and boss fights. Dark Souls III definitely takes things up a notch in both areas. Regular enemies are more varied and a lot more dangerous this time around.\n\nThe reason is that enemies are faster, more aggressive and have been given more combo chains for their attacks. In previous games, an enemy would attack at most two or three swings in a single chain. Now, they will attack with more swings in a single string and their strings are more varied.\n\nFor instance, enemies may perform three swings that look the same, but have two or more different combo endings to them. They also have more attacks, including those designed to punish players for using previously effective strategies.\n\nI've ran into enemies who knew how to get around circle strafing or attack you if you keep swinging too much.\n\nBosses are also more varied and remind me of Dark Souls 1 in terms of variety and different solutions to beating them. Just like before, you can summon characters to help you or be summoned to recover your flame and get some souls in the process.\n\nFrom a moment-to-moment standpoint, Dark Souls III continues the greatness of the series, but there are some issues hiding under the surface.\n\nHollowed Out:\n\nDark Souls 3 has all the good elements of previous Souls games, but it also has all the bad as well. The camera continues to have trouble with not getting stuck while fighting larger enemies and the increased speed makes it hard for it to keep up.\n\nOf the three games and Demon's Souls (haven't played Bloodborne yet,) this one takes the cake for roughest start for new players. Unlike Demon's Souls that had a great beginning to run things by the player, you are thrust within minutes into your first boss fight and expected to learn or die.\n\nWhat makes Dark Souls different from Demon’s was the fact that the world was open-ended; allowing you to explore different sections that were still connected to the world's geography. Dark Souls 3 feels somewhat limited in this regard. The starting areas have a sameness to them and the connectivity between areas has been downplayed in favor of just shortcuts within each area. While this is better than the confusing world of Dark Souls 2, it doesn't beat Dark Souls 1 for world creation.\n\nAll the problems that have been inherent in the Souls series is back: Unhelpful camera, enemies attacking and glitching thru certain obstacles and each other, camera still getting stuck when fighting large enemies and so on. While people may have gotten used to them, it's still a mark against the game by the fact that nothing has been done it seems to try and fix them.\n\nThe new concern at the moment has to be the technical issues plaguing the game and some underlining mechanic issues. There is a bug going on that causes massive framerate lost, stuttering or simply game crashes due to the lighting.\n\nIt happens at specific points in the game which makes it all the more frustrating that it wasn't caught. And of course, people have been having connectivity issues with joining games. There are also issues on the console versions as well; hopefully From Software will get those straighten out.\n\nAlso, there are some points to discuss with the underlining mechanics and changes of Dark Souls III. The short version is that there are several mechanical changes that impact poise and armor, and their impact on both PvE and PvP. Unfortunately, they're way too big to get into detail about here, but that will be saved for a massive post coming to Game-Wisdom soon.\n\nLight the Fire:\n\nFrom Software continues to make subtle improvements to the moment-to-moment gameplay, but still is having trouble with the overall problems and concerns of the series. As with previous games, you're either going to love it or hate it for its ramped up difficulty and challenging fights.\n\nIf you're new, I would still suggest either Demon's Souls or Dark Souls  to get your feet wet (maybe Bloodborne, but I haven't played it,) as Dark Souls III really feels like it was designed for someone with one of the games already under their belt. For me, I find the game at the moment lands too much on the side of being cheap with its mechanics to really enjoy fully. Just like with Dark Souls 2, expect a second post on Game-Wisdom talking explicitly about the gameplay to come soon.\n\nAnybody worried that this would be a continuation of Dark Souls II, fear not, Dark Souls III is clearly better in every aspect, but to compare it to one, well, I got a "few" words to say about that in another post.\n\nFor more content on Dark Souls III, you can watch my depraved run on the Game-Wisdom YouTube channel.\n\nCheck out Game-Wisdom[game-wisdom.com]where I examine the art and science of games","May 3","true","105.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Equally impressive is the audio, from the chilling sound effects to the fantastic OST, every boss fight feels just that little bit more special because of the incredible music.\n\nThe gameplay is also brilliant, as good as it has ever been. It's fluid and responsive and totally satisfying. Many of the boss fights require precise timing on rolls and attacks and the game doesn't let you down at all in this regard. The only gameplay issue I can really think of is the camera, on certain fights you will lose your lock on which can mean death at times, it's a shame that this is still an issue after so many games.\n\nAn area where the game has reviewed poorly is technically but for me it's running nearly perfectly after the recent Nvidia drivers and post game patches, there are only two small portions of the game that deliver less than 60fps on max settings, and only by at most 5fps so it's fair to say I'm hitting 60fps 99% of the time, and you can't ask for much more than that. The game does still suffer with occasional stutter when saving or perhaps when loading assets, it's not all that often but it is noticeable when it happens and I hope it's fixed, it wasn't a problem in Dark Souls II which I recently completed.\n\nNow it's time to address the elephant in the room, and that's cheating. The game has a problem where people can hack their in such a way that they can get you banned without you doing anything wrong at all, basically they will join your game and if they hit you, you will gain excess amounts of souls which will flag your save data as modified, if you do not delete your save file and replace it with a clean backup you will be soft banned which means you'll only be able to play with other soft banned players. Now, the game doesn't support cloud saving (which is completely unacceptable in itself) but you can manually backup your save data and upload it to an online hosting service such as Mediafire, OneDrive or Dropbox, or alternatively you can simply make a backup and keep it on a secondary hard drive or USB stick.\n\nHow to:\n\nEnable hidden folders\nNavigate to C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\DarkSoulsIII\NUMBERS\nCopy DS30000.sl2\nPaste DS30000.sl2 wherever you'd like to store it\nOptional: Upload DS30000.sl2 to an online hosting service, I personally use Dropbox\n\nYou will need to copy/paste this file regularly, I do it after every major session.\n\nOverall the game is truly fantastic with a couple of issues that taint it a little, especially the lack of competent anti cheat but it's still an incredible experience from start to finish with endless replayability and I highly recommend it.\n\n9/10\n\nReviewed on: i5 3570k @ 4.4GHz, GTX 970 @ 1373Mhz/1938Mhz, 8GB DDR3 @ 1600MHz, Samsung Evo 850 SSD, Window 10 64bit","May 4","true","51.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Full Steam Controller support with multiple action sets for Ingame, Menu and Inventory, as well as Developer presets.\n\nSummary:\nMust have for any souls fan. The best Souls game in the series and a fitting end to the trilogy without relying too much on throwbacks to previous dark souls games.\n\nFrom Software has done it again, so many weapons, so many armors, diverse bosses and a coherent land space design. The world makes sense as it was in 1, but with the superior Combat and Quality of Life changes of 2.\n\nLength: I'm really into PvP and Co-Op so I've been dragging it out and farming for armor sets, and weapons and helping people, and I've racked up 70 hours and still havent completed the game, the game has longevity, though I hear those who just want to get through the game have anywhere from 25-40 hours of content ahead of them.","May 3","true","91.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Dark Soul I and II are both bereft of problems and issues with quality that DSIII deftly escapes, leaving an incredible experience that rivals Bloodborne, one of the best games of the eighth generation of consoles. It's also a solid finale, with a good sense of closure that will stick with you.\n* Plot\nDark Souls III is much like it's predecessors in that it's vague. Little is explained to the player, forcing them to make logic connections between plot threads to reach answers. The enviroment itself tells a story, requring the player to make judgements based on what they see, hear and read. Item descriptions hide chunks of lore that explain everything from character identities and outfits to who they are and what they want. The plot itself is sparse, though some lategame revelations had me reeling. Overall, it's a good ending to the franchise, and i'm eagerly awaiting the DLC to wrap up some of the games' missing story threads. Dark Souls III's biggest problem in the story department, then, is that it refuses to stop jerking DSI off. The amount of references to Demons Souls, DSI and DSII feel incredibly awkward a lot of the time. Some are good, like characters being direct references to people in the first two games yet taking on new roles and personalities, and others are just pathetic "praise the sun!!!!" stuff. It takes you out of the experience when theres such a frequency of them, and it also feels like the creators aren't carefully referencing their other material as they are copying it. The tasteful Demons Souls references are a nice touch however, and show that FROM has not ignored their first game in this style.\n* Design\nDark Souls III has some of the best designed levels in the series. It's challenging without ever feeling unfair, and I died a number of times due to my own incopotence. Levels loop back around on themselves, revealing shortcuts, hidden areas and more with rather incredible abandon. The game will hide stuff from you very easily, and will often reward your troubles with loot or something else. The secret areas of the game are VERY secretive, requiring a hell of a lot of patience and careful exploration to uncover them all. The enemies are also a challenge as well, and some of the tougher ones can require multiple tries until they're vanquished. Despite this good, Dark Souls III really feels like it holds your hand some times. The frequency in which there are bonfires feels incredibly patronizing at times, and the game never feels like it's really challenging you with the scarcity of them. It's rare that unlocking a shortcut feels good, but when it does it feels great. The game is also obviously unfinished once more. While not to the rather extreme extent of DSII, it is painfully obvious that this game couldn't fit everything it wanted in, and that the developers were running out of time. One example of this is the games runtime (20 hours), which is incredibly short compared to DSI and II, though this isn't a problem as the game never stops being good- even the hardest, most frustrating areas are much better paced and way more fun than the worst areas of DSI and II., meaning the game never drags through terrible areas like Blightown or the Undead Crypt. Another irritating thing is that many of the improvements from DSII, from online to gameplay, are completely removed, setting the legitimate evolution of PvP in DSII back a few steps. Magic has also been nerfed quite a bit, and I feel like it's become too costly to use. Melee seems to be the way to go, and it's sad to see that only a few playstyles can really work given DSI's incredible flexibility in this regard.\n*EDIT*\nAfter discussion with friends it's become apparent that this balance issue has gotten out of hand. Magic is still useless in comparison to swords, Pyromancy still needs heavy tuning, and slower weapons like greatswords are useless due to their average scaling, meaning they won't do as much DPS as a straight sword. However, none of this is as bad as the poise problem, which is such a glaring and horrible oversight. I won't discuss it here, but suffice to say that poise functions much different in this game than in the second and first, and it's a terrible substitute for the function in the first game. From needs to get their ♥♥♥♥ together and fix these issues because it's starting to become a serious, game hampering issue. Also PvP is hot ♥♥♥♥ing garbage, is super unbalanced, etc.\n* Gameplay\nThe gameplay of DSIII is very much refined from the first two games. DSIII is faster, tougher and better than the first two games. Enemies are stronger and hit faster, requiring careful dodging and percise strikes. This makes for an incredibly tense experience in every single encounter, and makes the game incredibly fun against even the average mook. Bosses are better than ever, with some of the most creative and interesting fights in the series. Covenants are back and a lot of them are quite fun, with some classics from the first game returning gloriously, and the game allows you to switch them on the fly, going from glorious Sunbro to backstabbing Rosiarias Fingers in the matter of moments. This game also reintroduces the magic meter from Demons's Souls, but with an added twist- weapons can now perform special attacks which drain this bar. These moves can be anything from a guard-breaking upward swing to sending out a stream of fire, and they make each  normal, special, and boss-made weapon feel incredibly unique and add to the playstyle of that weapon. Now a sword and board user can be much more dangerous as he can easily break your guard, and spear users can become even deadlier with their horrificly long gap closing attacks, to say nothing of the incredibly cool and badass special attacks of the boss soul weapons. The gameplay is overall a massive improvement on DSII.\n* Presentation\nMusic is as usual fantastic and LOUD, though not to the height of Bloodborne- some tracks do come close, however, such as the amazing final boss theme ( DON'T LISTEN TO IT IF YOU HAVEN'T BEATEN THE GAME BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SPOILERS) The game also looks stellar, boasting the graphical improvements of Bloodbornes new engine to create some excellent locales. Many of the games locations look absolutely stunning, and contain some really excellent enviromental design. The game has a lot of technical issues, however, and whenever I entered a new area the game would horrifically stutter. I've also heard that the game has a lot of other techincal problems, so stay wary if you don't have a good PC. The game ran pretty well, and never dropped below 30 FPS for my game running on High, so just be careful.\n*Overall\nDSIII is an excellent conclusion to a great series, and I eagerly await the DLC in order to see what else FROM can squeeze in to what could be one of their strongest releases. Until they fix the problems with magic and builds, however, this will remain a flawed but fun game.\n8.1/10\n> Pros\n-Excellent design\n-beautiful world\n-fun, deep and satisfiying gameplay\n> Cons\n-patronizing design in many places\n-technical issues\n-many playstyles are bad, only a few can really carry you","May 5","true","36.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Another important thing to mention is that when talking about the story I don’t care about guessing what something might mean. In DkS you didn’t need to guess and interpret lore to understand the plot.\n\nShort version:\nDark Souls 3 is basically the same game as last time with the plot again being about killing 4 great ones and linking the fire but possibly written even worse than DkS2. There are some changes here and there but they are too small to excuse a whole new game, you still do the same things you did in DkS and DkS2 but this time you aren’t given any motivation to keep going. I got a refund mainly because after 2 hours the game did nothing to get me invested. I enjoyed the combat but for that I can just play the first game instead of paying the full price for the new one that has just a few small improvements.\n\nLong version:\nFrom Intro to Firelink Shrine and beyond\n\nThe intro sounds like it is taken out of context. It is so vague and forgettable I had re watch it on youtube to be able to write something about it. In the end It doesn’t give much useful information, might as well not be there. By the time I got to Firelink Shrine all I knew was that some lords left their thrones and that someone brought me back from the dead and wants me to bring them back for some reason. In DkS intro gave me the backstory of the world and explained its current situation as well as the situation I am in and by the time I got to Firelink Shrine I had a clear objective and a reason to pursue it. In 2 hours DkS3 didn’t make one attempt to make me care for what is happening. The only possible reason to care I can think of is that the link of fire is threatened but then the last game made it clear that it happens over and over and fixing that doesn’t get us anywhere. Even if I was new to the series and didn’t know that I wouldn’t care because the game doesn’t explain how it is a bad thing.\n\nThe Action and The RPG\n\nAs an RPG the game didn’t improve at all. There is still a choice of starting classes but there are no new ways to interact with the environment so in the end even if you want to play as a Cleric or a Thief the only way for you to advance is combat. And the combat didn’t change by much; it is still basically the same. There are some new moves that give some more options but they are just a slightly different way to do the same thing.\n","April 22","false","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As a sequel, it is more a sequel of the first game rather than the second, and it shows. Enemies, NPCs, items and areas make an appearance that didn’t even garner mention in the second game. Off hand, I remember around a handful of references and sets, while the references for the first game are far, far more numerous.\nHowever, holding up as a game, there are two parts to it. The game part of it and the story part of it. The game itself is fun, if you enjoy dark souls and all the little eccentrics that come with these games. It’s fairly big, not as big as Dark Souls II, but still big. However, I feel the development was rushed as I was playing through, I found quite a few empty rooms, corridors and alleyways that just didn’t have anything there. The Bosses themselves were also rather disappointing, barring a few standouts, but by and large were rather easy. According to the director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, they made it this way so journalists could finish the game, which detracts from the overall point of having the game be difficult in the first place. However, it is fun, resembles Dark Souls 1 rather than II gameplay-wise, and some enemies are very difficult and enjoyable.  Oddly, they implemented some enemies to move around the area a bit, but only had a few enemies patrol, when I seriously believe they could have done more. A recent development, though, had to do with stats. The Poise stat, which dictates how many hits you can take before you stagger, was never turned on in the games files. It is technically a useless stat.\nThe story of Dark Souls III was the biggest disappointment for me, and I’ll tell you why. Dark Souls was set in the beginnings of history, focusing on a lowly undead, trying to link the flame to keep the world going. Dark Souls II focused a little more on the philosophical aspects of a cycle, in that many different undead would come and link the flame, even if you yourself did not. Dark Souls III is much the same as its progenitor, Dark Souls. It focuses on an “Unkindled”, which may or may not actually be an undead or something else entirely, trying to link the flame. However, it does nothing new. It adds nothing as a whole to the overarching plot, but tries to distract some people (Me included, I will admit) with fan service to hide the fact that the story itself is rather boring. “LOOK guys! We added your favorite weapons back! And your favorite enemies and armors! Isn’t this game cool?!” It does nothing new or particularly interesting, but harkens back to Dark Souls so often I’d rather be playing a remake of that rather than the sequel. You can basically tell that From Software had ran out of ideas for the game, and probably never wished to make this game, but did because Bandai Namco forced their hand, seeing the opportunity to milk the sequel like the cash cow it is. We know that the game will have DLCs, the growing cancer of the videogame market, but only time will tell whether it will improve the story or not. However, I still enjoyed it, I’ll still pick it up again sometime in the future, but the fact remains that the game itself had a lot to live up to, but couldn’t quite fit the bill, and will hope that with time, or an HD collection of the series might sooth my bitterness.\n","May 1","true","78.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

"Hard" implies a great challenge and test of skill, power, and patience. "Harsh" implies accountability for our actions, that mistakes will be punished and good decisions will be rewarded. This game isn't hard, it's harsh.\nI've died plenty of times while playing and not a single one was because "I'm not good enough". Every time, there was a bad decision I made, a fight I picked badly or shouldn't have picked, a trap I handled badly, or a giant skeleton king I fought while emotionally compromised from work.\nSkill is a factor, skill is rewarded, but this is a game anyone can play and that anyone can conquer. This game has a lot of depth, lore, challenges and intrigue that make it a work of art in itself and in that regard it's nothing short of incredible.

Dark Soul I and II are both bereft of problems and issues with quality that DSIII deftly escapes, leaving an incredible experience that rivals Bloodborne, one of the best games of the eighth generation of consoles. It's also a solid finale, with a good sense of closure that will stick with you.\n* Plot\nDark Souls III is much like it's predecessors in that it's vague. Little is explained to the player, forcing them to make logic connections between plot threads to reach answers. The enviroment itself tells a story, requring the player to make judgements based on what they see, hear and read. Item descriptions hide chunks of lore that explain everything from character identities and outfits to who they are and what they want. The plot itself is sparse, though some lategame revelations had me reeling. Overall, it's a good ending to the franchise, and i'm eagerly awaiting the DLC to wrap up some of the games' missing story threads. Dark Souls III's biggest problem in the story department, then, is that it refuses to stop jerking DSI off. The amount of references to Demons Souls, DSI and DSII feel incredibly awkward a lot of the time. Some are good, like characters being direct references to people in the first two games yet taking on new roles and personalities, and others are just pathetic "praise the sun!!!!" stuff. It takes you out of the experience when theres such a frequency of them, and it also feels like the creators aren't carefully referencing their other material as they are copying it. The tasteful Demons Souls references are a nice touch however, and show that FROM has not ignored their first game in this style.\n* Design\nDark Souls III has some of the best designed levels in the series. It's challenging without ever feeling unfair, and I died a number of times due to my own incopotence. Levels loop back around on themselves, revealing shortcuts, hidden areas and more with rather incredible abandon. The game will hide stuff from you very easily, and will often reward your troubles with loot or something else. The secret areas of the game are VERY secretive, requiring a hell of a lot of patience and careful exploration to uncover them all. The enemies are also a challenge as well, and some of the tougher ones can require multiple tries until they're vanquished. Despite this good, Dark Souls III really feels like it holds your hand some times. The frequency in which there are bonfires feels incredibly patronizing at times, and the game never feels like it's really challenging you with the scarcity of them. It's rare that unlocking a shortcut feels good, but when it does it feels great. The game is also obviously unfinished once more. While not to the rather extreme extent of DSII, it is painfully obvious that this game couldn't fit everything it wanted in, and that the developers were running out of time. One example of this is the games runtime (20 hours), which is incredibly short compared to DSI and II, though this isn't a problem as the game never stops being good- even the hardest, most frustrating areas are much better paced and way more fun than the worst areas of DSI and II., meaning the game never drags through terrible areas like Blightown or the Undead Crypt. Another irritating thing is that many of the improvements from DSII, from online to gameplay, are completely removed, setting the legitimate evolution of PvP in DSII back a few steps. Magic has also been nerfed quite a bit, and I feel like it's become too costly to use. Melee seems to be the way to go, and it's sad to see that only a few playstyles can really work given DSI's incredible flexibility in this regard.\n*EDIT*\nAfter discussion with friends it's become apparent that this balance issue has gotten out of hand. Magic is still useless in comparison to swords, Pyromancy still needs heavy tuning, and slower weapons like greatswords are useless due to their average scaling, meaning they won't do as much DPS as a straight sword. However, none of this is as bad as the poise problem, which is such a glaring and horrible oversight. I won't discuss it here, but suffice to say that poise functions much different in this game than in the second and first, and it's a terrible substitute for the function in the first game. From needs to get their ♥♥♥♥ together and fix these issues because it's starting to become a serious, game hampering issue. Also PvP is hot ♥♥♥♥ing garbage, is super unbalanced, etc.\n* Gameplay\nThe gameplay of DSIII is very much refined from the first two games. DSIII is faster, tougher and better than the first two games. Enemies are stronger and hit faster, requiring careful dodging and percise strikes. This makes for an incredibly tense experience in every single encounter, and makes the game incredibly fun against even the average mook. Bosses are better than ever, with some of the most creative and interesting fights in the series. Covenants are back and a lot of them are quite fun, with some classics from the first game returning gloriously, and the game allows you to switch them on the fly, going from glorious Sunbro to backstabbing Rosiarias Fingers in the matter of moments. This game also reintroduces the magic meter from Demons's Souls, but with an added twist- weapons can now perform special attacks which drain this bar. These moves can be anything from a guard-breaking upward swing to sending out a stream of fire, and they make each  normal, special, and boss-made weapon feel incredibly unique and add to the playstyle of that weapon. Now a sword and board user can be much more dangerous as he can easily break your guard, and spear users can become even deadlier with their horrificly long gap closing attacks, to say nothing of the incredibly cool and badass special attacks of the boss soul weapons. The gameplay is overall a massive improvement on DSII.\n* Presentation\nMusic is as usual fantastic and LOUD, though not to the height of Bloodborne- some tracks do come close, however, such as the amazing final boss theme ( DON'T LISTEN TO IT IF YOU HAVEN'T BEATEN THE GAME BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SPOILERS) The game also looks stellar, boasting the graphical improvements of Bloodbornes new engine to create some excellent locales. Many of the games locations look absolutely stunning, and contain some really excellent enviromental design. The game has a lot of technical issues, however, and whenever I entered a new area the game would horrifically stutter. I've also heard that the game has a lot of other techincal problems, so stay wary if you don't have a good PC. The game ran pretty well, and never dropped below 30 FPS for my game running on High, so just be careful.\n*Overall\nDSIII is an excellent conclusion to a great series, and I eagerly await the DLC in order to see what else FROM can squeeze in to what could be one of their strongest releases. Until they fix the problems with magic and builds, however, this will remain a flawed but fun game.\n8.1/10\n> Pros\n-Excellent design\n-beautiful world\n-fun, deep and satisfiying gameplay\n> Cons\n-patronizing design in many places\n-technical issues\n-many playstyles are bad, only a few can really carry you","May 5","true","36.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Sam/recommended/374320/","_Sam","Sham_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Sam/","375 products in account","As much as I love the Dark Souls series, I honestly cannot recommend this game. The only positive I can honestly think of for this game is the graphics, they're gorgeous.\n\nLittered with issues both Online and Off.\n\nTo start my biggest problem with the entire game of Dark Souls 3. Estus Flasks. This seems to fit in with part I'll mention later in the review but to start off, they returned Estus back to it's Dark Souls 1 roots. Which is not neccesarily a bad thing; but it is, it really is. Estsus flasks are a life saver regardless of what situation you're in, you can sort of walk and move while healing now, and it instantly fills most of your health bar, so if you're in a dire situation ever you can just chug that sweet Lucozade energy, low on health? Chug. Low on health AND about to be attacked by an enemy? Chug anyway, you'll be fine, just take the hit and drink again, then maybe you can think about getting out of the way. It's a hundred thousand times worse in PvP though, if you're in danger of dying just roll away and mash that heal button, chances are you'll heal and wont be punished due to how incredibly quick you heal and put away the flask, so PvP tends to boil down to nothing but an endurance contest seeing who can run out of flasks first, then and only then can you get a kill because punishing ♥♥♥♥ in this game is a mess.\n\nI personally preferred the slow heal of DS2 as it required to player to strategise when to heal and when it's not safe, making a wrong move means death. The speed of DS3 is more on par with Bloodborne however so it's understandable why they changed it for this one. It's less slow and methodical compared to 2.\n\nRolling is also terrible, it's too easy, it gives too many i-frames, it barely uses any stamina. You can just roll and roll and roll around enemies in both PvP and PvE and be basically invincible. Completely saps any and all fun out of the game. Anyone with an inch of sense knows how to dodge in an unpredictable fashion and be impossible to punish.\n\nPoise is disabled and doesn't work. What this means;\nOnline is people spamming the straight sword/Estoc because it's easy, and works surprsingly well. Incredibly effective if you mix up the swings so people can't parry it.\nOffline you can be stunlocked by a rat or two wearing either nothing at all, or full Havels. And that's the game, basically it seems some enemies in this game have poise, but most of the time it's just no poise, I spent a good hour trying to get the parry timings down for enemies in an area later on in the game, the parry window for one certain enemy seemed incredibly out of sync with how his swing attacks performed, but regardless of this, it was completely pointless as I could kill the enemy within seconds by repeatedly tapping the swing button and stun locked him with death. Pointless.\n\nArmour is absolutely useless in this game, the defenses you gain wearing the thickest armour in the game is negligible compared to wearing rags, so if you liked to play a tank character in DS1 or 2? Too bad. It's roll or nothing in this game.\nI understand they were going more for fashion souls in this game? I really don't care because it ruins heavy armour for those who like it.\n\nThe game also has a decent amount of hackers that seem to have the ability to get you yourself banned from online play simply by hitting you.\n\nA recent revelation I've also read about online is phantom range, a large amount of the weapons in the game have range that extends beyond their physical hitbox, this seems to allow weapons like the straight sword to have range equal to greatswords. It also doesn't end there, the basic swords or rapiers have damage that is almost equal to most of the heavy weapons in the game, that swing infinitely faster, and require infinitely less stamina so to sum it up - there's little point to using any of the weapons other than the basic swords, unless you want to make it so much harder for yourself.\n\nThis game is really disappointing to me as the previous two games were ♥♥♥♥in' wonderful, DS1 had the superior world and the lore, DS2 had the mechanically superb game/swordplay, which it seems they have largely thrown out in Dark Souls 3 for a  much more boring, less intricate system, you also can no longer power stance weapons and instead are forced to only dual wield to specific weapons of the same type, which is incredibly upsetting as I loved mix and matching weapons to power stance in DS2.\n\nDark Souls 3 however, has very little of it's own to offer aside from graphics, many of the areas to me are incredibly hard to remember, the swamp areas and the dungeon areas all just merge into one as they look incredibly bland. This is only saved however by the few areas that do in fact look fantastic and stand up on their own legs, areas like Irithyll of the Boreal Memory I won't soon forget.\n\nWhich leads me into another point; the fellating. Dark Souls 3 has the biggest hard on for a previous game I think I've ever seen in any game series ever, this game of course being Dark Souls 1.\n\nIn Dark Souls 3, From Software removed the shield breaker in favour of the kick as it was in Dark Souls 1, not only that, but the light roll animation has been changed back to the weird looking incredibly floaty roll from DS1. Now I wouldn't mind this at first, but the references keep coming strong and hard and really just ♥♥♥♥ing slap you in the face.\nShortly after the tutorial area you stumble upon a building, upon entering this building you're met with a name - that name is "Firelink Shrine". Ok. Fine. You stumble around the area to get your bearings and then you hear a metallic clanking sound and you approach it. It's a blacksmith. The blacksmith. The exact same blacksmith from Dark Souls 1 - Andre of Astora, looking as if he hasn't actually aged a day since the events of DS1, despite it being seemingly numerous centuries after said events.\n\nAnd it just keeps going and going, another large one that I wasn't sure about how I felt about was an incredibly important, non optional area in DS3, you progress through an area and come to a lift, upon using said lift you are greeted with the sight of  Anor Londo. I was disappointed by this because it feels fairly obvious that the entire area would have crumbled away since we first met the place, especially since an entire city seems to have built itself under it's foundations? Fan service is all well and good, but there's a point where it's just excessive.\n\nIn the end, I found the gameplay of Dark Souls 3 to be rather incredibly unfun, tedious, repetitive, and quite boring. And I'm a big fan of the series, playing both DS1 and 2 multiple times in anticipation for the release of this game.\n\nProbably worth buying if you're a fan of the series but I honestly had a hard time finishing the game once I began nearing the end.\n\nTL;DR Summary I guess; The PvE is repetitive and boring, environments look great, PvP is incredibly boring and the worst in the franchise; even made worse by the fact that invaders are constantly at a disadvantage due to gank parties and spawning with less estus than the host.","May 18","false","47.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In other words, I felt I spent a lot less time dying to stupid things and more time dying to actual mobs and bosses in the game; which are certainly harder than usual due to the lack of poise and the pace of the game being faster.\n\nI will be completely honest, I really enjoy simply playing through Dark Souls 3 and have now done so multiple times and will be continuing to do so. There are very few bosses I find that are unenjoyable compared to the other Souls games and by far the best thing is that the level design is probably one of the best out of the Souls series - Farron\'s Swamp area is a massive pain though, since you dont have an \"Iron Ring\" like in Dark Souls 1 and you will probably lack anti-poison items.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the DLC will bring to the table this time since after all very few would disagree that this was the shortest Souls game so far.\n\nAlthough while I was lucky not to ever get into contact with the problems involving Hackers and the softbans, I did have some problems with fps drops in certain areas and the lack of any real change in NG+s will move my overall score down because of these issues; which I cannot ignore.\n\n\nOverall though I think its fair to give Dark Souls 3 a, 8.5/10\n\n\n","June 1","true","198.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I will keep it brief, and stick to only the major strengths and weaknesses.\n\nStrengths:\n- The bosses are the first thing that pop into my mind when I think of the game's strengths. The bosses are one of the major parts in the series, infamous for their difficulty and rewarding defeats. When I first entered the game, I can honestly say that I had a lot of fun fighting the first boss. The mechanics were fair and rewarded learning and well-timed dodging, and this continued to be something in most of the other bosses. They are also quite diverse and memorable, with a good balance of being difficult and fun-- something I was afraid would be overlooked in this game.\n\n- The level design is well done. Not in the Dark-Souls-1 sense where you would memorize every nook and cranny due to the inability to teleport until later into the game, but (for one) in the sense that the positioning and balance of regular mobs is nearly perfect to the point where it is not rage-inducing (I'm looking at you, Dark Souls 2) but still maintaining the necessary difficulty. Furthermore, bonfires seem to be at appropriate distances (as usual) and it is otherwise quite decent. It has made me memorize many areas in the game, but I don't think anything could quite compare to Dark Souls 1 anyway.\n\n- The combat is enjoyable. I don't have much PvP experience besides a few dozens instances, so I'm not expert in that aspect, but from what I found, it was quite standard in your typical souls game (which is still pretty good.) The movesets on most enemies (I said most, chain snakes.) made for fun and engaging combat. Furthermore, from what I could tell, almost all builds are viable and provide interesting and unique gameplay individually.\n\n- The scenery is my personal favorite in any souls game. I was amazed sometimes at just how beautiful the game was. Most areas are very atmospheric and fitting to the fantasy-role that they suggest, which is something I personally look for in art.\n\n- NPCs, quests, dialogue, old faces-- they are all very well done and voiced from what I have seen, and make for some very engaging and enjoyable gameplay. I cannot put much here, as I would like this review to be as spoiler-free as possible.\n\n- Co-op is easier than in any other souls game. Many people believe this is a bad thing, but I think that it is ridiculous that this has not been considered and done until this game. I believe that it is a great feature to be able to co-op with friends and have a jolly ol' time, for that is what kept me from playing Dark Souls 1 any further.\n\nI have not covered every positive aspect of this game, but hopefully I have covered some of the more major ones. Let us proceed to the negative aspects of the game. (Keep in mind, this is all my opinion).\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Poise is currently not enabled. What this essentially means is that whenever you are hit by an enemy, even while wearing the heaviest armor, you will still be staggered atleast a little bit. This prevents many fun builds from being viable in both PvE and PvP.\n\n- PvP has hackers that attempt to soft-ban and ruin the game for others. Dark Souls 3 is no exception to the hackers that every online game has. The good news is that being soft banned can be prevented by backing up your game with external software.\n\n- This game requires a somewhat capable machine in order to run it. I wouldn't count this specficially as a weakness, because the reason for this are the amazing graphics and gameplay that make Dark Souls 3 the great game that it is. However, it is listed as a weakness since many people are unable to even complete the first boss because of unbearable lag.\n\n- Chain snakes. Chain snakes are evil. (I'm joking around.)\n\n----\nIn summary: Dark Souls 3 is the next installment of the Souls(borne) series. Although it has its (in my opinion) minor flaws, the good significantly outweighs the bad. To anyone with a capable PC looking for an equally fun and challenging game, I would definitely recommend Dark Souls 3.\n\n\n\n\n","May 29","true","121.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When I first started playing, it took me around 3 Hours to actually defeat (STARTING BOSS SPOILERS AHEAD) Ludex Gundyr, and Vordt, then make it over to the next area, I think I made 3-4 different characters to defeat Ludex, because I needed those Firebombs to kill Ludex Gundyr, thankfully. My friend(s) started to help me through the game once I got near the First Lord of Cinder, I've completed the game over 7 times now, I'm always trying different builds and seeing if I enjoy it or not.\nMost of my play time now, instead of trying to complete the game again, is helping out other players, and PvPing. (And praising that I don't get into a fight club) Some people you find are fun to play with. Constantly chucking down "Hello" Carvings, and doing Gestures, Whilst others don't even Gesture before going into a Boss Fog, or slicing you to Death.\nA few times I've gotten a good laugh out of some people. I was once invaded someone, and they looked like a Phantom (Due to using a Ring) I waited a bit nearbye, and then walked over, he did a Gesture to look like he was Resting at the Bonfire, he Waved. I did "My Thanks!", I used the Bloodlust Katana to stab myself, and rest. Whilst doing that. I realised that the Bonfire wasn't lit, so I wanted to be kind, and wait for the Host to come. He constantly pointed at the Unlit bonfire, and so did I. He brang out his Bloodlust Katana and started to stab himself to do Death. I clapped constantly, he kept going, and killed himself, a moment later.

I reverified my game cache and everything but this glitch that locks my character still occurs, because the whole area is bugged.\n\nNext i would like to mention how you brought like the ♥♥♥♥♥est things from Bloodborne. Bloodborne was already a geninuely ♥♥♥♥ game (this is coming from a guy who has 100% completed DaS1, DaS2, and Bloodborne). Next you rehash yet another souls game? Really? Like I wear different types of armor sets, check poise, and now I am convinced that the poise number was just added for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles and pvp because when its not pvp I still get stun locked by any enemy just like as If I was playing Bloodborne. Then you have the watchdog of old lords from Bloodborne practically painted black and looks like some sanic deviant art OC. Punishing people trying to help others is awful. Punish the guy that summons at least. But halving estus and about a 20%-30% hp decrease from people trying to help others is just plain stupid. At least in bloodborne you basically had the same amount of healing items as the host, but this game you don't. It punishes the people trying to do covenants and people trying to be a good goy and help scrubs. I cannot defend a ♥♥♥♥ game, because I had to restart my character 4 times only to have the same glitch occur over and over. Decreasing estus and hp max in pvp and co-op was borderline ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. The worst part is how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the enemy placement was, like did B team work on this? because this is Scholars of the first sin enemy placement, artificial difficulty. Then you made shields just as useless as they were in Dark Souls 2. Remember how in Dark souls 1 where you could practically parry any humanoid enemy? yeah well you can't anymore. Some of the enemies you can parry in Dark Souls 1 (e.g. black knights) they just eat the parry and have like infinite stamina and poise to the point where they can just 2 shot you. Never in my entire life have I ever wanted something organic because this difficulty is artificial. Yeah the bosses and enemies are jokes, but you occasionally run into the 1 or 2 enemies that just stun lock you for years.\n\nFrom please fix your game before I just end myself because this isn't how it was supposed to end. Not this bad.","April 12","false","206.2"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","21","38","4","5"

This is my review on Dark Souls 3. I would like to say this game has many amazing aspects about it. Sound quality on it is very good, Story has a lot of depth to it and there is hidden lore throughout the game. Overall I'd say it's a very good game and I think that you should buy it because there are many things to do in the areas throughout the game, Many things to explore. Gameplay is very smooth also the controls are like the previous games also it's a good aspect of what they chose to do in the game overall for the gameplay experience. For me it was great and for me it is a very good game, It has way more things than the previous games. Bosses are very challenging than in the past two games. This is the hardest souls game I ever played before. the types of armor sets and weapons are very well designed and this game has better armor sets than in Dark Souls 1 & 2. The music to the game and cutscenes are very immersive and beautiful. I think the lore behind the game is very detailed and If you love the previous games you would probably love and adore Dark Souls 3 more than any other game in the soul series, because this game expands on Dark Souls 1 and it continues from there no matter what ending you chose in Dank Souls 1. Locations in the game are very interesting and super well-designed and they brought back some areas that we're in Dark Souls 1 because if you progressed the game to late game or halfway, you'll see that they brought some areas back from the first game, it's very cool to see and if you love Dark Souls or any FromSoftware RPG games you'll love it. - Rikka :D\nExtremely Great Boss Fights.\nGreat Combat, A lot of weapons to use.\nAmazing Soundtrack and good sound quality.\nOutstanding story and lore.\nAI & NPCS are improved from the older games.","April 15","true","39.9"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","21","38","5","0"

Usually grinding bosses, or generally placing their sign down at the start of a area.\n\n(thanks to aran and sunny if their reading this!)\n\nThe bad:\n\nInvaders usually.  but can be white phantoms that run around attacking everything, die, and then they attack you.\n\nThe wierd:\n\nUsually the most entertaining of the catagorys are these fellows. Usually dressed odd and randomly gesture. Heres a tip! If you encounter one of these rare and bizzare people, copy their gesture. And be trusting. Their proboly not going to hurt you!\n\nThe kind invader:\nThis is a invader that respects your position. If he see's you havent lit the bonfire yet, he will backaway and let you do so. He may also avoid using estus, and is genrally a nice guy.\n\nThe estoc user:\nAs I am versed in their language I will do the rest of this section in their tounge,\n\nR1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1\n\nThe duelist:\nThis is the easiest to find speicies of dark souls player to find. As they lurk outside of the pontiff. Once one arrives their they will be able to summon one. Then it will be a fight to the death, following strict no estus rules and bowing of course.\n\nThe troll:\nThis player will use the fingers to attract all the variants of invaders. They brandish the slumbering dragon ring and the obscuring ring, sneaking through the area. Until they find the right time to execute their plan. And that plan is to kill their invaders, in the most humilaiting way possible. Truly one of the most skilled players to be able to preform such trolling.\n\nThe hacker:\nI have had the privlage to see one of these with my own eyes. trully amazing creatures. Their body will most likely be distorted in someway (in my case they had a giant head). They are the most deadly, as they could permenantly kick you out of multiplayer. Truly terrifying, fear not however for we have the upper hand.

Case in point: that new Call of Duty: Bioshock Infinite edition seems to have broken global hate records for some reason. While I'm not sure I agree 100% that yearly sequels are evil, I will say that I pay very little attention to them generally.\n\nFrom Software's Souls of the Week series is a strange little exception to that rule. I've wound up buying the PC versions of all their Souls-y games at some point, regardless of the fact that broadly, they're extremely similar games. I think they get away with it because the games themselves have no market equivalent. If you don't like Battlefield du Jour, there's a Rainbow Six or Call of Booker DeWitt for you. While obviously these games aren't the same, they hit the same broad strokes: military dudes shooting other military dudes in extremely contrived yet intense scenarios. I cannot think of a game like Dark Souls without having to seriously qualify the statement. I'm not aware of another series that apes survival horror, action-rpg, and adventure games so well.\n\nDark Souls 3 is no exception to this.\n\nBasically, you've played DS3 already if you've ever played Dark Souls and Bloodborne around the same time. DS3 is the fastest entry in the core series. Enemies hit hard and often, and leave hilariously little room for error, even more so than DS1 and 2's more punishing fights. The combat, fortunately, is a little more forgiving than its predecessors. Dodge rolls work against attacks you won't believe, and frequently I found rolling into an attack somehow stopped it from working outright (I remember collision detection in DS1 stopping my rolly antics quite thoroughly).\n\nDark Souls 3's map design is a bit lacking in my opinion. Namely, there's a lot less choice this time. I can't think of any real branching paths that stay branching for very long. Most of the time, you'll be exploring cathedrals and castles. The overall map variety might be the only thing Dark Souls 2 did better than its sister (better) games, and Dark Souls 3 doesn't have a lot to show for itself in this regard.\n\nThat said, Dark Souls 3 shines in a few separate areas. It doesn't have the quirky-yet-haunting lore of DS1, but tells a reasonable tale in its own right. A particular, powerful motif is vulnerability. I built up a roster of friendly NPCs around the closest thing the game has to a home, and slowly watched them abandon me, or outright die, one by one. Generally, this happened because the game demands you care for and watch over them, something I failed to do many times. Solemn, powerful stuff.\n\nDark Souls 3's greatest boon is its roster of bosses. There are 19 in the game, each one memorable in a way not even DS1 attained consistently. I might just be willing to argue that DS3's boss design has no equal in gaming. No, these aren't the hardest bosses in the series. But each fight offers firm stakes, be it a change in the timing of blows, disorienting arenas, strong ties to complex underlying lore, or simply great design. DS3's worst boss encounters would be the highlight of many other action-RPGs.\n\nThere's not really much to say beyond this. It's a Souls game. Chances are, you know if you're bound to like it. It doesn't offer the raw invention of DS1, but it's more grounded and whole than DS2. If nothing else, it's a fantastic note to end the series on.","May 9","true","52.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

More variaty & interesting...\n- DS3 I did not feal that epicness of winning a boss battle. I think it's somewhat the easiest in the series.\n\n[Enemies]\n- In General: The world of Dark Souls enjoys some of the best enemies brought into Video games, the variety is great and the technices involved are also excellent on taking enemies.\n- I think that DS2 had the best variaety of enemies, with more unique approaches.\n- DS3, did not build on DS2 structure of approaching enemies especialy [SOTFS] version.\n- DS1 had these Black Nights scattered early and felt like a great challenge. the Metal Boar... DS2 had these big animal creatures and Knights as well... DS3 did not have much on that front.\n\n[NG+ and so on]\n- In General: DS games extend the replayability of the their games by allowing you to start New game Plus each time you finish the game. You can play differently, grow your character futher and even try different endings. this is a great feature from the Dark souls game that adds great value to the game.\n- Biggest dissapointment for me, just increased health / damage for enemies with added rings of +1... and so on. Sorry but DS2 SOTFS had a much more interesting NG+ with better changes... this is putting off.\n\n[World]\n- In general: the Wold of Dark Souls 3 is well crafted and at some points brings a dark Fantasy to life.\n- I think that DS1 Had the ultimate connectivity were most maps are interlinked. While DS3 still felt too broad.\n- DS2 had very interesting areas and despite the feeling of disconnect between.\n- DS3 is like a mixed bag between the 2, it did not really surpace the world of DS2 and not it's as connected as DS1.\n- Some times it felt that the area's are also just too big (e.g.: The Farron poisenous Swamp).\n- DS1 Assylem return remains the best hidden area in the series.\n- Secrets are scattered however nothing felt revolutioanry.\n\n[Death]\n- The challenge is in the death system, you must run to gain your  unspent experience (Souls) gained before you die again or you loose it forever! it's awesome.\n- In general I prefered the hollowing in DS2 more than DS3/DS1. DS1 was too puniching with the humanity counter.\n\n\n[Multiplayer]\n- Best MP in a video game ever for me. I love the DS system.\n- You can summen people to help you and you can help others.\n- You could get invaded (part of the challenge).\n- You can join covenants to defend areas, attack people, or even to be summoned and defend other players when they are invaded.\n- The game's easy mode is it's co-up modes...\n- Other things make this game alife (and like with other DS games). you can see the ghosts of dead players, you can see the ghosts of players near you...\n\nControl (9.5/10)\n- This is still my favourate Action/RPG with solid & precise controls.\n- I did not play this with a keyboard & mouse as I only use KB/M for strategy / FPS. I enjoyed the game with an XBOXONE Controller. It feels natural with that.\n- Added\n\nCamera Control (8/10):\n- In general Camera Control can tend to be challenging especially when you are being cornered, however this is normal with this kind of games.\n- Overall it's still good.\n\nGraphics, Overall: (8.5/10):\n- Art Style: Dark Phatasy, a more crisp Dark Souls I style.\n- Optimization: I ran this game on my GTX 980 and it run perfectly on Max / 1080p\n- Atmosphere: Not as enhanting as DS1, however it's still good.\n\nSound, Overall 6.5/10:\n- The game utilizes music at selected parts / areas. sometimes it gets too quit.\n- Boss Music fights is good though.\n\n... There is a lot to say about this game, just enjoy it for yourself.","May 23","true","85.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/374320/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","Dark Souls 3 is a sendoff for the series. Not only have From Software confirmed that the series is going on a break, but while playing it’s clear that this is the end of the series as we know it. The game constantly references the games that came before it, borrowing visuals from Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls 1 & 2, and Bloodborne. The greatest complaint you can level against Dark Souls 3 is that it doesn’t convey a strong image of its own, as it’s making you think of other games all the time. But as a sendoff for this series of games, that’s perfectly appropriate. I didn’t mind this approach at all, because the quality of execution is From Software at their best.\n\nThis is probably the most consistently good Souls game yet. For example, in Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborne I felt the quality of boss fights was too uneven, and in Dark Souls 1 some areas of the game felt rushed. In this game though, the minimum level of quality is very high, and the boss fights are better than ever. It presents the sort of challenge I like, where you have to learn to read enemy animations to learn when to dodge or attack. Given that even normal enemies now have more animations than before, regular fights outside of bosses retain a high level of tension and excitement, even after you’ve spent a few hours in the same area. Leveling up can only take you so far, so you’re pretty much forced to patiently learn enemy attack patterns to win consistently. It’s nicely balanced, where it feels fair. Most games like Witcher 3 can often mess up subtle details in how combat works, and add a sense of chaotic sloppiness. I’m talking about things like hit detection, invincibility frames while dodging, how target lock-on works, and so on. The best games make these things predictable and dependable, where your losses feel like your own mistake, and not the system screwing you over. Dark Souls 3 is such a game, where you CAN master it, and it will treat your fairly. As much as people (and Namco) hype the difficulty, it’s really only about on the level of Ninja Gaiden or Devil May Cry on medium. It’s not a cakewalk, but most people should be able to get through this without going nuts. I mean I had more difficulty getting through Uncharted 3 than I did this.\n\nWhen it comes to story, the game is as obtuse as ever at conveying information, as you really have to dig into it to learn anything. Especially at the start of the game you feel starved of information, to an extent you don’t in other games. So it’s more of a slow burn where pieces eventually start falling into place. One disappointment is how there are things that don’t pay off properly in the story. There are things put into the game seemingly because they thought they were cool, and not because the game “is about” those things. So there’s a sense that the game could’ve been even better, had there been more depth to the story here. But I guess we’ll have to settle for it being merely good.\n\nEven though the game reuses a lot of assets from earlier From Software titles, it does so with good direction and intent. The world design and layout makes sense, unlike Dark Souls 2 which was more like an amusement park than a world. There you went into a windmill, traveled up an elevator behind a throne room, and ended up at the entrance of a lava mountain land. A mountain which by the way wasn’t visible behind the windmill itself. It was a complete mess. Because Dark Souls 3 only came out a year after Bloodborne, I didn’t dare set my expectations too high, and as a result it consistently exceeded them. This is the kind of Dark Souls sequel you’d hope for after the first game, as it has most of the qualities that made the first game so good.\n\nOne thing that bugged me is how every location has fixed time of day and weather effects. Every location is tuned for a particular look and mood. This would normally be fine. But because you can teleport everywhere in the world via bonfires, it’s a bit odd to go from a sinister solar eclipse in one place, to a moon lit night in a different location, in the span of just a single load screen. I’m hoping this is something they can improve in future titles with better technology, so that the entire world can change its appearance as you advance through the story.\n\nAs the final Dark Souls game, this is a great way to end. This is just the amount of game this formula can take before running itself into the ground. Same goes for the tech they’re using, which also feels like its played out its role. For every flaw in the game, there were a hundred more things I thought were just awesome. I had a great time, it didn’t feel its length, and I couldn’t be happier with how it ended.","April 30","true","51.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Case in point: that new Call of Duty: Bioshock Infinite edition seems to have broken global hate records for some reason. While I'm not sure I agree 100% that yearly sequels are evil, I will say that I pay very little attention to them generally.\n\nFrom Software's Souls of the Week series is a strange little exception to that rule. I've wound up buying the PC versions of all their Souls-y games at some point, regardless of the fact that broadly, they're extremely similar games. I think they get away with it because the games themselves have no market equivalent. If you don't like Battlefield du Jour, there's a Rainbow Six or Call of Booker DeWitt for you. While obviously these games aren't the same, they hit the same broad strokes: military dudes shooting other military dudes in extremely contrived yet intense scenarios. I cannot think of a game like Dark Souls without having to seriously qualify the statement. I'm not aware of another series that apes survival horror, action-rpg, and adventure games so well.\n\nDark Souls 3 is no exception to this.\n\nBasically, you've played DS3 already if you've ever played Dark Souls and Bloodborne around the same time. DS3 is the fastest entry in the core series. Enemies hit hard and often, and leave hilariously little room for error, even more so than DS1 and 2's more punishing fights. The combat, fortunately, is a little more forgiving than its predecessors. Dodge rolls work against attacks you won't believe, and frequently I found rolling into an attack somehow stopped it from working outright (I remember collision detection in DS1 stopping my rolly antics quite thoroughly).\n\nDark Souls 3's map design is a bit lacking in my opinion. Namely, there's a lot less choice this time. I can't think of any real branching paths that stay branching for very long. Most of the time, you'll be exploring cathedrals and castles. The overall map variety might be the only thing Dark Souls 2 did better than its sister (better) games, and Dark Souls 3 doesn't have a lot to show for itself in this regard.\n\nThat said, Dark Souls 3 shines in a few separate areas. It doesn't have the quirky-yet-haunting lore of DS1, but tells a reasonable tale in its own right. A particular, powerful motif is vulnerability. I built up a roster of friendly NPCs around the closest thing the game has to a home, and slowly watched them abandon me, or outright die, one by one. Generally, this happened because the game demands you care for and watch over them, something I failed to do many times. Solemn, powerful stuff.\n\nDark Souls 3's greatest boon is its roster of bosses. There are 19 in the game, each one memorable in a way not even DS1 attained consistently. I might just be willing to argue that DS3's boss design has no equal in gaming. No, these aren't the hardest bosses in the series. But each fight offers firm stakes, be it a change in the timing of blows, disorienting arenas, strong ties to complex underlying lore, or simply great design. DS3's worst boss encounters would be the highlight of many other action-RPGs.\n\nThere's not really much to say beyond this. It's a Souls game. Chances are, you know if you're bound to like it. It doesn't offer the raw invention of DS1, but it's more grounded and whole than DS2. If nothing else, it's a fantastic note to end the series on.","May 9","true","52.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I recommend this game, I do.\n\nBut this review addresses everything wrong with the game as a sequel. This is a review for fellow Souls fans.\n\nDark Souls 3 is, straight up, the easiest Souls game created. Anyone can beat it. Even the most inept of players won't hit a wall, they'll eventually tear through it. The difficulty of this game pales in comparison to Demon's Souls, to Dark Souls, to Dark Souls 2, and to Bloodborne by a massive amount. It's possible even some casual players will find themselves never loving their souls to a second death.\n\nMany enemies, from across the series, come up as a huge wall to players. You learn their movements, and tear through them after putting in the time and work. Trying to work around them can even end in great disaster. The only enemy that really puts up a fight can be the Lotrhic Knights, but not because of their difficulty, because of their damage and that is all. They are defeated without effort: spamming light attacks will keep them staggered. And after that, there are no more hard enemies. Not one in the game. You are set on by nothing but hollows who sluggishly move, and the very rare semi-competent skeletons. Anything much harder.. is solved by a gimmick.\n\nA giant worm that would otherwise be a horrible fight can be killed using a giant ballista. One of the bosses has a weapon specifically for him to kill him fairly quickly, much like the Storm Ruler from Demon's Souls. The hardest bosses (The Dancer, Champion Gundyr) are dispatched with not even well timed rolling and a few hits to their backside.\n\nBut worse than that, the levels are not just short, but there's very few.. and most are very, very bland. While Dark Souls 1 was applauded for having a fantastically designed map, all of it interconnected and much of it unique, Dark Souls 2 was somewhat more traditional though still had some connections but was given far more unique locations, such as mining operations, a lava flooded castle, a castle drowned in rain, a quiet lake littered with fireflies and glowing fauna, dark labs, dragon's nests, and then the DLC areas were astounding. Dark Souls 3 is purely linear and only about half the total size of Dark Souls 2, every area was more bland. A somewhat interesting cemetery, a bland not-so-special castle aside from hollows who could only half way become pilgrim butterflies, bland forest with set pieces from DS1 for nostalgia, dull catacombs, a completely dull poison swamp, a lousy prison, a boring revist of Oolacile, a mostly uninteresting library... The most interesting areas of Dark Souls 3 are far from unique, capturing very little of the creativity of DS1 and DS2 with areas like Blighttown, the Painted World of Ariamas, New Londo Ruins, The Gutter, Majula, Shrine of Amana, Dark Chasm of Old, Brume Tower, Eleum Loyce... This isn't even half of the unique locales that were indeed quite enjoyable to look at, and the most unique location Dark Souls 3 has to offer is Kiln of the First Flame, an area that takes all of fifteen seconds to cross.\n\nAnd part of the world is the characters. While Greirat and Siegward are at least nice to talk to, everyone else is all but forgettable, and you rarely see them still. You don't talk to and regret meeting Lautrec, you don't feel as if you're following along on a grand journey like you did with Solaire (though you do stumble into Siegward just like before), you don't meet a character who asks you to kill -everyone- else, you don't meet some old king who tells you all of his regrets... You just meet people who are interested in selling stuff to you, and the obligatory Patches encounter.\n\nAnd then there's weapon balance. Much like other games, some weapons are better than others, but this time around, some weapons are leagues better than others compounded by the fact Poise is purely a disabled stat this time around (read again if you need to, Poise does nothing in Dark Souls 3 and has been confirmed as intentional). The Dark Sword, for instance, is a low weight of 4.5, and does a damage per second that completely outclasses nearly every weapon in the game with the correct build. The Spiked Mace can be built in a way that it will one shot players without any sort of parry. And Tower Shields are practically impossible to counter in PvP, and can attack while blocking far more effectively than a spear and shield torgether would be.\n\nOn top of the poor weapon balance and Poise removed, invading players are at an extreme disadvantage: with reduced health, halved Estus rounded down, and primarily only invading players with phantoms, each invasion results in one of a few ways: the invader gets greedy and goes to them, and gets stuck fighting two players at once, the invader sits and waits by monsters for the next half hour because the host is too afraid for the odds to be evened despite still having more Estus, the invader finds a gank squad just for killing players already at a disadvantage, or the host doesn't know what they're doing and just runs out wildly and gets himself killed not even by you but some accident or monster.\n\nOr, if you're particularly unlucky, you'll run into a hacker. They take far less damage than they should at their level? They're modded their stats to be much higher without raising their level. They kill you in one hit? A hacker. There is even the ability to turn completely invisible, or fly, alter weapons to work how they want... This is nothing new to Souls, oh no. In DS1, hackers had the ability to instantly curse others with one hit of their weapon, even crash their game or rapid fire Firebombs. This time around, hackers can actually hit you with something that rapidly gives you souls and gets you, the invader, or even the host, banned out of nowhere. The solution to this: manual save backups because there are no cloud saves. The only solution currently. And the hacker problem is much worse than DS2, as Soul Memory made it hard to peg down for hackers where to be in that total to appropriately ♥♥♥♥ over others.. but could get banned if they had more souls than soul memory as a counter.\n\nIn short: Dark Souls 3 is the worst game of the Souls series. While people ripped on DS2 for a long time being worse than DS1, DS3 is worse than DS2 by a long shot in size, balance, quality of level design, PvP, and most importantly, difficulty.\n\nIt's just too damn easy.","May 13","true","341.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I am hoping that they will tune up the game and have a finished product by the time all of their dlc has been released. The game was fun to play through the first time, and to play co-op with friends, but this game is as much of a Souls game as Bloodborne is. You spend the entire game going down a single path with very few forks. There is no poise (Despite an article from Kotaku claiming that it is working, and there being plenty of items that effect the "stat"), and the combat has been sped up to about the same pace as Bloodborne. Get used to being stunlocked by weak enemies with any sort of haste while wearing heavy armor. If you thought dogs or rats were bad in Dark Souls 1.. You'll get a kick out being stunlocked to death in a corner by a group of rats while wearing full Havel's.. With that said, you should think twice before attempting to wear heavy armor in PvP. There is literally no point. If you're not doing a fast roll, you're doing it wrong. The resistances makes little difference, and PvP is filled with fast weapons that have solid R1 spam and low stamina usage (Longswords). You will get hit-stunned regardless of the armor you wear, and this almost always guarantees two hits. Your large weapons are your only source of "poise" in this game via hyper armor, and these slow weapons still can't keep up. There is little place for great/ultra great weapons without poise, and magic has been gutted in this "Souls" game. INT spells hardly begin to scale until you make it past level 50 in INT, and all of the spells you attempt to use in PvP will just be dodged because of the terrible cast times. Pyromancies and Miracles are bad too without serious stat dedication. WIth that being said, hybrid builds have pitiful damage until far into the game, and you won't be very competitive in PvP if you are playing around the SL ~120 meta. All of this is really disappointing for me because a big part of what made Dark Souls great was how easy the games were to play over and over again with different character builds. The replay value just isn't there with this one. They have gutted most builds and it has had a huge impact on replay value, and diversity in PvP and even PvE. It also seems that a lot of the PvP playerbase is falling off recently. And for those of you that care... The difficulty for this game has been toned down a bit compared to previous installments.. Possibly to reach a larger audience. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game at this moment in time.\n\nTLDR: This is more like Bloodborne 2 than a Souls game. Don't go in expecting an improved Dark Souls 1 or 2. It's linear and lacks viable build diversity. There is no poise, and magic sucks. Say hello to quick rolling R1 spam meta, and goodbye to clashing knights. Wait for a sale, or for the inevitable complete edition if you prefer Souls over Bloodborne... Go back and play Dark Souls 1 with the connectivity mod.. Or play Scholars of the First Sin while you're waiting. They're both a better experience at the moment.","May 14","false","85.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandvichmaker/recommended/374320/","sandvichmaker","The Sandvich Maker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandvichmaker/","126 products in account","Quite frankly, I don't think Dark Souls 3 is that bad of a game. The first playthrough in singleplayer was a hell of a lot of fun and I was very excited about it at the time. But everything after my first playthrough has just been a disappointment.\n\n* There is no replayability to be found in New Game Plus, unlike Dark Souls 2 it is the EXACT same experience, just with your build carried over, and the difficulty hike is laughable. The only new thing is + versions of rings, which as a result makes going through the entirety of NG++ a highly important thing in PvP whether you want to play the campaign three times in a row or not.\n* But you shouldn't want to, quite frankly, because the PvP is just not fun. Dark Souls 2's PvP was a blast, I have nearly 400 hours put into Dark Souls 2 as a result. But in Dark Souls 3 it's regressed in so many ways, it's not funny. I'm pretty much done with it, I don't want to play any more of it at this point.\n* Magic is less fun. There are fewer spells, and offensive magic is incredibly underpowered and basically pointless in PvP. Dark Magic has just been retconned to hell and has as much presence as it did in Dark Souls 1.\n* The game on the current patch version (1.04.1) has real stutter issues UNIVERSALLY, every player seems to have them (myself included).\n* The game's cheat protection is still very flawed, and prevents community fixes like PvP Watchdog by Eur0pa and other mods from being developed while contributing little.\n* There is a reduced selection of weapons compared to Dark Souls 2 and many weapons are completely unviable in PvP, whereas almost any weapon could be viable in Dark Souls 2.\n* The covenants in the game are uninspired and some don't even work. I've not been summoned once for the blue sentinels or the darkmoon blades throughout my entire time with the game and the only alternative to getting the rewards involves a multitude of hours of soul-numbing farming.\n* The game rehashes Dark Souls 1's content far too much, while dismissing Dark Souls 2 almost entirely.\n* It also has almost no original memorable NPCs, the only memorable NPCs in the game are straight from Dark Souls 1. The NPC questlines are also another level of convoluted, they take the cryptic nature of the souls series too far.\n* One of Dark Souls 2's main criticisms was the regressed level design, relying on bonfire warping instead of intricate shortcut based interconnected levels. While Dark Souls 3 makes much more sense geographically, the level design suffers from the same issue. Memorable shortcuts are countable on one hand.\n* Power stancing has been ditched, making dual-wielding any weapons other than the pre-designed dual-wielded weapons completely useless. While a few of the special dual-wielded weapons are quite cool, they do nothing that couldn't've been done with power stancing left in place.\n* The game also seems strangely cpu-reliant. My framerate is sub-60 in a lot of areas on an i5 4690k @ 4.5GHz and a Sapphire Tri-X R9 290, and turning down the graphics from maximum to minimum has little-to-no effect on my framerate. I think my cpu should be perfectly powerful enough to run the game at 60 frames per second, but what do I know.\n\nAll in all, there's a rant for you. If you're a souls fan no doubt you've already bought this game. And if you intend to make this game your first Dark Souls experience, I imagine you'd have a lot of fun with it as I did during my first playthrough. So I don't think this review will be useful for a lot of people. But I still wanted to write it, if anything just to vent my frustrations with the game somewhere.","May 15","false","76.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

After Pre-purtching both the game and the seasons pass and playing for about 4-5 days after launch I recived this message "Invalid Game Data".\nThough i had no idea what that meant, It did lead to me deleting my first 3 games.\nThat being said, it made no difference in the long run. a week later I revived a "You have been Penalized" message making it so I "can't" play online.\nNow I say "can't" because Bandi/Namco will tell you you can, but you are just in a cheaters servers  but after doing yet another full wipe and starting anew in hopes that maybe that would help, I realized that there was little to none of players in that server.\n\nAfter spending over a month contacting Bandi/Namco and banging my head against the wall all i have learned before they told me they would not be replying to my mails was this...\n\nI was "\nWe have looked into this issue further for the profile you provided us and it appears that restrictions/limitations have been placed on this account due to the modification (having invalid parameters, hacked in souls, modified level/stats, etc.) of your character(s) on your save file." ....\n\nand when asked how this could have happened, and how it can get fixed so I can play the game I paid for, I revived this...\n\n\n"These decisions are handled by the Dark Souls III server team and we have no influence over their decisions."\n\nBasically what they are saying is they don't care about people affected by this nonsense, they don't care to fix it, and they will not offer any help to anyone that is affected by it and trying to just play the game.\n\nSo in conclusion, I do really like this game, but the rampant cheating that is running though the game and affecting those of us that want to play normally and Bandi/Namco's lack of care for people that spend money on there game makes it so I cant tell people to buy this game.\n\n","May 17","false","61.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

For myself its everything i like and wanted in a game, to start with as anyone should know Dark Souls is a hard game and this one is really difficult. Yes there are some easy bosses but me having not played this franchise before i got killed by most things even some of the weaker enemies but i kept playing and got better each attempt , i do love a challenge in Video Games. I also thought the Story was fantastic even though there isnt as many cutscenes in this game only before a boss, after and in certain points of the game, which for me is really good because it rewards you in a way for getting pass a certain boss that you have been stuck on for a while or a particular area. I'm so excited for the DLC to be released and what the next Dark Souls game will entail. Hard game but when you finally beat that boss thats been causing you trouble with so little health left you feel so good and get more excited for the next boss you will encounter in this remarkable, Action role-playing game.","May 8","true","63.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

Allso most of the time when me and my friends try to get help or want to help then the servers use to much time to send us help or send us to the person that needs help.

After the decent Dark Souls 2 port and more optimized SoTFS, I was hoping to see the same results for 3. Unfortunately that is not the case.\n\nFirst warning: Placebo. There's a lot of it, and a lot of hostility towards other community players in the Steam forums. I would not recommend reporting your troubles here as it's a cesspool of alpha males posting their amazing super computers and assuming anything under $2,000 is a toaster.\n\nMy Specs are as follows:\ni5 2500k at 4.7ghz\n8gig of GSKILL DDR3 @ 1600\nGTX 970 oc\nSeagate HDD @ 7200rpm\n\nSome days this game runs flawlessly, then there are days like today where I throw a chaos fire orb and the framerate stutters constantly before closing to desktop. There is no rhyme or reason to this as some days the game plays well. FromSoft's lack of an official acknowledgement 2 months deep into the game cycle is concerning. On the one side, I know they have been working tirelessly on balancing the game and have been pushing those updates regularly, but on the other side their community support teams are literally providing Reddit and STC found "fixes" for troubles that only work on very specific scenarios. You can do everything under the sun, as I have, and still get a stuttery mess or a smooth 60fps experience, it just depends on what ghost update From has done today.\n\nIn comparison, the following games made in the last year run without issue on my build: Doom 2016, MGSV, SFV, Fallout 4, and Star Wars Battlefront. These all run at a constant 60fps with no graphical issues. I can only assume at this time that this port is going to be left as is until we get an official response by FromSoft or Bandai.\n\nSo, even though I will play this game, I cannot play every day as each day it's a new problem. If you're unsure, buy the game and only play within the 2 hours. That is all you will need to see if it's going to work or not. Plenty of Youtubers (Gamegrumps, ENB, SuperBunnyHop) have footage on their channel of DS3 and it includes all the aforementioned trouble and more. This should give you a good indication of how well the PC port runs.\n\nAt this time, I do not recommend Dark Souls 3 for the PC. If it works for you, great, you hit the lottery. If, like so many of us, you get issues with the game outside of the frame drop on autosave, join the club and be prepared to be a full time technician while playing this flawed port.","May 24","false","74.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Guess not, but here are my thoughts. Before I start: I am sure you have read this before, but still:\n\nIf you dislike dieing in the games you play, if you get easily upset and outraged, frustrated or really ticked off when you do, you might want to skip this game. You WILL die, probably a lot, and it's a part of the game. Just like  the previous DS-games, this one is difficult, challenging, tough, but at the same time, it is VERY rewarding once you eventually nail that group of trash, clear that area, kill that boss.\n\nI played DS1 way back when, and if you have played that before, the controls and UI will feel familiar right away. Some people recommned to start with DS1... I am not sure I'd agree, because if you want modern-level graphics, you might as well start with this one, as it is beautiful.\n\nPerformance-wise, it worked great on my system (i7-4790 at 3.6 Ghz, 16 gigs of RAM, GTX 960 with 4 gigs, W7). I had a few smaller framerate-issues, but nothing major or problems that made playing even harder. No crashes either. YMMV.\n\nThe controls work quite well, and they need to for a game with such an emphasis on reaction times and using the right tactics for each mob/boss. I of course used a controller. I am sure some people can play this with kbm, but AFAIK, even the devs very much recommended to use a controller. Only issue I have is targeting sometimes...locking on a mob requires it to be pretty close, and by the time it's close enough, it might be charging or swinging at you already. If you miss the opportunity to target-lock and the mob gets on your side or behind you, it will swing at you and hit you, and you'll have a hard time blocking his attacks efficiently (I'm playing a knight with a shield right now).\n\nIf you REALLY wanna explore, don't read walkthroughs or watch gameplay videos. YOu will have to search the right path, you might end up at a dead end, but that's part of the system as well. I love how the game gives you different ways of beating enemies in many cases... not necessarily bosses, but: the trash in DS III is tougher (at least it feels that way) than it was in DS1. Some of them might feel harder than some bosses.\n\nExample: (Spoiler) There is a knight early on in game, not a boss. He will be a challenge if you new to blocking and rolling, and he uses combo attacks, like many other mobs. You can try to fight him with shield and sword, take him out with bombs, OR: Lure him onto a type of balcony you just crossed, with a huge dragon sitting on top. He will occasionally breath fire along that balcony, and if you can get him to do so AND dodge the fire, the dragon will fry that knight.\n\nStill, you will most likely die a lot. If you do, don't get ticked off. Stay calm and try again, maybe change your strategy, memorize the mobs and their attacks, or simply take a break. You will most likely eventually feel the urge to start the game and try again. It's fascinating how, even when you die a lot, it keeps you coming back.\n\nSo, in a nutshell:\n´+ Decent to good performance on MY system\n+ Looks beautiful\n+ VERY challenging especially if you're new to the franchise, but also VERY rewarding\n+ Lots of variety regarding weapon abilities and tactics\n+ Atmospheric\n+ Very good controls\n+ Some awesome animations and boss appearances\n+ Very nice music...some cliche, but some is a refreshing twist on well-known troupes\n\nCons:\n- Some performance issues, and apparently a lot of them for some players\n- Target-locking feels wonky to me\n- Some wall-glitching by NPCs. I had a mob hit me with his polearm through a wall. Look at my recent DS3-screenshots for a pic of a lance glitching through a wall. I can't do that, NPCs can. Needs to be fixed IMO if the game relies that much on precision. Biggest flaw for me in this game, even though it's not game-breaking.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667921978\n\nAt the full prize, I give this an 8, once it goes on sale and can be bought for like 10 EUR less, it will be a 9, especially if performance is improved by patches.\nTry it out. If you REALLY can't stand the amount of dieing and the difficulty, refund, but give it a bit of time, adjust yourself to the style of the game: CHallenging, but rewarding. You die, but you learn and get better. And once you master this, you might never play another game the same way, as they might feel slow or trivial to you =)\nGreat job, take your time, stay calm and enjoy!","April 18","true","22.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDirectorChris21/recommended/374320/","TheDirectorChris21","The Director","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDirectorChris21/","243 products in account","This game is an embarrassment.\n\nI love all the games in this series with the exception of Dark Souls 1 and that includes King's Field, which I do consider a part of this series and it's amazing. Dark Souls 3 strips out everything that I enjoyed about the series, beats in the face until it barely resembles anything and then stitches it back in with a healthy amount of laziness. For me, the hype was real for DS3. Before release, I watched one sixteen min gameplay video and two trailers. My first playthrough was done in twenty-two hours and done offline so I wouldn't have the messages and bloodstains to spoil anything, they're an eyesore anyway.\n\nFor the first few hours, Dark Souls 3 was engrossing. The High Wall of Lothric is one of the better areas in the series and apart from a few annoying enemies and a reused idea, for the third time. All was pretty good. It wasn't until you arrive at the Road of Sacrifices that things took a tumble off the bad game design tree and managed to hit every branch on its way down. Starting here, you run into a swamp that will slow your movement...and not the movements of your enemies, which was incredibly cheap in Demon's Valley of Defilement and that hasn't changed at all. Being forced to slow walk and fat roll while your enemies are as nimble as ever is about as fair as going up against an entire army wielding shotguns while you have a backscratcher and some string. This swamp area is also one of about five that I can remember but hey, originality right...\n\nDon't get me wrong, the entire series has had its fair share of cheap encounters and anyone who claims otherwise has their head crammed up their CENSORED BECAUSE WE'RE TREATED LIKE THREE YEAR OLDS. The problem with Dark Souls 3 is that it's ENTIRELY made of cheap encounters and enemies that have no wind up at all, infinite stamina, and deal a ridiculous amount of damage. The series' hook for me has always been the tactical approach you had to take to combat, attack and counter-attack was the name of the game and a quick footed dodger who parries and ripostes was the character I enjoy playing. If you get rid of parrying, this series becomes nothing but a simple, stupid hack and slash game and this is exactly what DS3 has done with the normal enemies. If you're going to have a parry system, enemies NEED windups, there's no getting around that. The player can't read the SIMPLE minds of the enemies and because the damage they do is so high, you can't stand there and risk damage to yourself while trying to parry. Not only that but a number of enemies have infinite stamina, which results in you being punished for successfully dodging an attack. There's an enemy early on who can spin a very long weapon SIX TIMES, you can't dodge or block all of these. If you roll away, you run out of stamina before you get out of reach and he hits you and if you stand there and block it, you also run out of stamina and take a hit. This is not fair, this is hard just for reasons...and not very good ones.\n\nAnother enemy I noticed with infinite stamina are the Lothric Knights and they also have abilities that stop you from using any kind of tactics against them whatsoever. Try to attack them from the front, they keep wailing on you, you can dodge if you want but sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. If you try to manuever around them, they have a shield bash they can do and they can even CANCEL attack animations to go into something like that. That is CHEAP.\n\nThere are a TON of enemies like this throughout the entire game. It's ridiculous and frustrating and saps whatever fun that could have been had out of this game had From concentrated on making a good game instead of on making a difficult one.\n\nFor those who enjoyed the Valley of Defilement in Demon's, get ready for an even more sinister version in Farron Keep because it slows your movement, enemies move at a normal pace. They have ranged magic attacks that home in on you, as if the cheapness couldn't be any worse AND...this swamp is poisonous as well. Such fun...\n\nBesides the cheap enemies and areas, this game even does fan service in a pandering way that is an insult to any TRUE fan of the series. I'm going to spoil a few things here and I don't care because the only people who will not be upset by this are the delusional fanboys who enjoy whatever From barfs out. Let's start with NOT Firelink Shrine and Andre the Blacksmith. To me, Firelink Shrine in DS1 was a place of solace from all the horrors of the world and what From told me in DS3 is that Firelink Shrine is nothing special at all. You can take any hub world, no matter how different they are, slap "Firelink Shrine" on it and there you go, awesome right? No, not really and the reason Andre is there is because...well...because...uh, he's just kind of there. No context or anything, he's just THERE. Not like the story in these games is anything but crap but I liked Andre and his appearance in DS3 makes NO sense at all.\n\nFinally, I'm going to talk about the most egregious fan pandering I've ever seen. Not in DS3 mind you, EVER...it just so happens to be in DS3 and I've actually seen people defend its inclusion. Anor Londo...or a small section of Anor Londo makes an appearance in DS3. You're not transported to Anor Londo, you're not going back to face enemies of the past or anything that resembles any kind of context or honoring of this memorable place. What you visit is the Ornstein and Smough arena and the immediate area surrounding it LITERALLY ripped out of the area from DS1 and placed in its own magical, random spot in the sky. Ornstein and Smough was the hardest boss for me in DS1, and the most memorable, and From came along and trivialized EVERYTHING about that area and that fight by reusing this area, without reason, and putting a SHAMELESSLY stupid boss in O+S's arena. This is not fan service, it's straight up pandering and the idiotic fanboys lap it up without even realizing how dishonorable it is to the memories that REAL fans have of these past enemies and areas. You can't simply rip a particular area out of an ENTIRE kingdom and place it randomly in the sky and call it a day and for the love of everything holy, don't reuse an arena from an amazing boss fight.\n\nDark Souls 3 should have been great. From has learned a lot over the years and improved with every entry in this series, except for Dark Souls 1, which I find disappointing in its own right save for a few things, and Bloodborne was the absolute best this series has had to offer...and one of the best games I've ever played. I was shocked at how you take a series so good and bring it to this level. Dark Souls 3 is cheap, frustrating, uninteresting, generic, and full of fan pandering that does nothing but stomp all over fond memories I had of past games. It's a terrible game when comparing it to the other games in the series and it's a terrible game IN GENERAL. Don't buy it, don't steal it, don't PLAY it at all. It doesn't deserve your time and From Software DEFINITELY doesn't deserve your money.","June 4","false","50.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

And the changes made to the game make it feel alot like Demon Souls, the first ever souls game. Having said that though, the game as a hardcore fan of the series is quite easy compared to the others. Having recently replayed Dark Souls 2 SotFS; im realy breezing through it withouth any armor(fast rolling) and the starter axe.\n\nMost of the time when franchises get more and more populair their quality and difficulty decreases because they want to apeal to a wider audiance, and I feel like this might be the last in the series that stays sort off true to the difficulty off the actual series, even if it is the easiest one. And I realy hope im wrong.\n\nFor hardcore fans, you might be a bit disapointed with the difficulty, but other that, its another Souls game, nothing majorly different.\n\nFor newcommers, eventhough I'd rather say start with the first in the franchise, especialy if you want to get into the story. It is the best one to start with when it comes to the difficulty.\n\nIF you are like me though, and you're sick of easy handholding every sucker can do it non-satisfying gameplay than buy Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin instead. It is argueably the hardest, but therefore 10x more satisfying than this.\n\nas for the major bugs and crashes, set lighting to low, and you'll barely have any crashes.\n\nAnd personaly because it is easy, I wouldn't realy recommend this one in the series.","April 13","false","27.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","4"

As of writing this review, I have not crashed, I have not experienced extreme FPS drops, and I have not had a bad experience playing the game. Now, to the actual gameplay.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nDark Souls III feels closer to Dark Souls I than Dark Souls II. Why? The movement feels solid, the combat feels solid, the world design (although it is not all interconnected) also feels solid. I did not experience these feelings when I began playing Dark Souls II. The inventory menus have been revamped and they work and feel very good. However, to my distaste, you must still travel back to firelink shrine every single time you wish to level up your character which kinda sucks.\nThe bosses and enemies look and feel unique to each of the encounters. As I said, the combat and movement feel solid and responsive, so it feels REALLY GOOD to backstab the ♥♥♥♥ out of some ♥♥♥♥ing dead farmer, for instance.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe graphics have blown be away so far. Many people have said that graphics don't make a game. Those people are correct; graphics are not the entire game. However, with very good graphics, a game can achieve an atmosphere that others cannot. At the very first boss encounter, the boss actually morphs and turns into this weird monster thing that was completely unexpected. The main character's cloak (O ma gawd tha cloaks) all have physics and look really cool. They look so cool, that I decided to lose a few points of physical defense in order to look like a stud. I expect those of you reading this to do the same.\nThis game looks really good. It is one of the best looking games I have ever played, and it is up there next to Witcher 3. It has a good amount of options to switch your graphics around. Don't expect it to be the best, though.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nI have not personally had any significant or major hiccup in performance, likely because I have a GTX 980ti and an i7-4790k. However, I have experienced frame drops when the game is autosaving, so just be aware of that if you are playing the game. I honestly cannot tell you how it will run on your system. I am not sure why many others are saying the game runs like ♥♥♥♥ on a GTX 970. I dunno. The game is capped at 60fps, which is okay for me, but not for others, so just be aware. There are also a lot more options in the menus to tweak graphics to get better performance, which is good.\n\nTL;DRPlays great, much more like the first game. The individual sections feel more Dark Souls I, but the entire concept of the hub world of Dark Souls II kinda sucks. The game looks great, and at least for me, plays great too. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the Souls series. However, check the reviews and performance of others with a similar computer rig as you; I can say that it runs great on a 980ti, but I can't say how it runs on a 970.

All that connected with the game look pretty good, I mean: sounds, battles, graphic, music and optimization (gtx 660 ti, 8gb, i8-3770) - that spec gives me 50-60 fps medium settings and full hd in DS3.\nThere are no quests and any trip pointers and I like it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/374320/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","Dark Souls has come full circle. From the niche beginnings with Demons’ Souls all the way up to today’s Dark Souls 3. What was once a game series reserved for the masochistic and patients players has grown to a brand that moves millions of games at the mere mention of its name. It has become mainstream. Is this bad? Maybe. Is this good? Maybe. Better production value and refinement are among the merits, but it is a Faustian embargo because the key element of a Souls game; its difficulty, is kind of lacking in Dark Souls 3.\n\nBooting DS3 sends you into familiar territory. A black screen, with the imposing letters once again awaits you as you slave for hours in character creation to avoid a complete farce. The introduction then sets the stage for this instalment’s cryptic story. The world as we left it after Dark Souls 2 has burnt out to nearly nothing by ashes and the time has come to once again rekindle the first flame. However, it takes five carcasses these days to stoke the fires so you are called from beyond the grave with the express purpose of dragging four of the five deadbeats back to the fire and casting their dried husks into it to give people an extension on their drab and dreary world.\nIt’s more of the same, and the lore and traditionally hidden plot development is leaning heavily on the original Dark Souls for its appeal. Frankly, the amount of DS1 pandering is so extreme that it makes the two or three concrete references in DS2 look tame. After having thoroughly established that kingdoms rise and fall in the sequel, part three throws all that plot development out of the window and returns to the source to bring alienated fans back. If you, like me, actually liked The Matrix Reloaded then you’ll understand why this is a bad thing. After establishing a rich world with details, mythology and lore they forgo most of it just to shoehorn some of the old stuff back in there.\n\nWhen you look past the story you’ll still find an incredibly solid and refined action role playing game that doesn’t compromise on a single thing. The starting area guides you past easy enemies, different terrain types, your first bonfire and an enemy only the truly gutsy can tackle at that point. It doesn’t take long before you meet your first boss which will either kick the living daylights out of you or you’ll triumphantly destroy it on your first pass. What follows is a short hike to a building on the cliff where you enter the hub of this game: Firelink Shrine. Here you’ll be given your purpose, a number of helpful NPCs and not a single proper hint that the bonfire in the centre will teleport you into the main game.\nThis first section is painstakingly crafted to teach you the fundamentals. Or not; if you’re a Demons’ Souls veteran and have played all the other games you’ll breeze through it like it was a different game. Unbeknownst to me, this had become the theme for my overall experience with DS3. After I went to the first area, a castle, I was greeted with hollows, knights, dogs and a dragon. However, none of them really presented an obstacle. Nor was the first boss, a quadrupedal knight with an ice club, much of a challenge if you’re used to playing a dodge build. This continued throughout the game. Most bosses only took me one or two tries to beat. If I used summons I didn’t even have to try. I hardly ever got killed. Sure I died a few times in the Dragon Keep, and Knightslayer Tsorig sure knows how to earn his name, but I never felt in any way triumphant or relieved to have passed an obstacle or have beaten a boss. Returning to the game with a different build did give me a challenge eventually, but when playing like I usually do the game was kind of a breeze. If death is your teacher in Dark Souls, then I didn’t learn much this time round. For all them memes and jokes made about its difficulty, DS3 doesn’t live up to its predecessors reputation.\n\nDS3 may have lost a notch in difficulty, but it certainly has gained props in its level of quality. DS 2 was mired at first for its lack of polish. Sloppy hitboxes, poor level design, bland graphics and enemy design. DS3 has got none of that; it is an amazing accomplishment in level of refinement, presentation and interface design. Hitboxes are now perfectly implemented. You can vault through two swooping swords and land on the other side unscathed. Firebreath stops exactly where it seems to stop and a giant’s foot only stomps where it lands. This is a colossal improvement over 2’s dingy detection. The improvements don’t end there. The game is gorgeous. Skyboxes create an amazing sense of scale while the miniscule details in the world make each area vibrant and alive (despite the fact that everything is dead). Capes and cloaks look absolutely gorgeous and you have all the options to make your character look truly stunning. The game runs excellently at 60fps at 1080p on a GTX970. FROM also made a considerable effort to make the regular enemies a lot more interesting. From your regular zombies to ravenous beasts, there are some incredibly creative designs. Some enemies are as challenging as bosses themselves, without being cheap like in DS2. Speaking of bosses, despite some of them being stupidly easy, a good number of them are still amazing. I’d have to say that they’re more cool than hard, but the hardest bosses in the game also happen to be the coolest. Imagine a pope with lightsabres, or an insanely intense fight against a dragon rider knight, without any gimmicks. These are the game’s highlights and the moments where I enjoyed the game most.\n\nNot everything is perfect though. While a lot of systems have seen significant polish, quite a few enhancements that were introduced in DS2 were dropped along with its lore. The power stance in gone, replaced with special dual weapons; reducing the creative weapon matching to almost zero. Poise is gone; the game did away with it entirely; enemies still hit you through walls; new game+ is severely lacking in features; NPC quests are more vague than ever before and often end without warning. None of these issues are game breaking. The overall whole is extremely solid and amazingly well engineered. It is just so perplexing that many of the systemic improvements from DS2 were removed. I guess streamlining is the keyword here, but that still doesn’t make up for the inability to wield two repeater crossbows.\nAnother massive gripe stems from PVP. The implementation of a password system to hook up with your friends is also extremely welcomes (seriously, this password system is the best thing since the white soapstone). However, the tweaks to PVP matchmaking are horrible. The game now biases invasions to intrude the world of a host with a phantom. That way, the invader has to face at least two, more powerful opponents, with a possible blue spirit joining the host to fend off the invader. Meanwhile, invaders can kill each other, despite pursuing the same goal. PVP is reserved to the truly committed invaders with the skill and ability to pull off these feats.\n\nAfter thirty hours the credits roll on what was to me the easiest Souls experience I had had up to that point. It was by no means a bad journey. It looks and runs amazingly, the combat is still fun and the online component runs like clockwork most of the time. It is refined to the point of perfection, but certain elements are up for debate in both terms of gameplay and plot. Without a doubt the best Dark Souls experience available on PC.\n\nThis review was edited to fit the character count. Certain illustrations and elaborations were omitted.

There's three main issues that make this game so much harder to enjoy properly.\n\n1) Summoning covenants like Aldrich Faithful, Blue Sentinels etc can never be used. For some reason I find it impossible to ever get summoned to a host's world, but I find it quite common to get counter-invaded by Sentinels and Darkmoons whenever I invade. When you think about it that's at least half the covenants rendered useless since it's strangely so ♥♥♥♥ing difficult to ever get summoned.\n\n2) Poise. There's a LOT of heated discussion going on about this but in my opinion it's just turned off. The only times I've ever seen poise in action is with "hyperarmor" and the certain weapon arts for the certain weapons that makes you impossible to stagger for a moment (even then that doesn't actually raise poise, it's the weapon art doing the work). Personally I never see or even feel poise in action as it was in DS1 and DS2.\n\n3) Idk if others are getting this issue, but connectivity to DS3 servers. I've been having a problem very recently where, if I ever get more than a few phantoms or dark spirits going at once, it's as if the connection is under infinite duress and then gives me a "Disconnected from the Dark Souls III Game Server" message and takes me to the main menu. I've been unable to host fightclubs or go through levels with any help, which is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ for my main character and a new sorcerer character that's really hard to play alone with.\n\nThe worst part of this problem is that for some reason, Fromsoft believes that disconnections, accidental or no, have to be punished severely. My main character has been softbanned (which means you lose all online privileges except for being invaded by others, and the chance of being invaded goes WAY UP, especially with dried fingers). I created a female sorcerer character (the one that's super hard to go solo with), but over 5 times I've been disconnected from DS3's servers while I've had other people in my world, so she's well on the way to getting softbanned.\n\nIt's honestly a 10/10 game but these issues made my blood ♥♥♥♥ing boil, and now here I am writing a negative review amidst a sea of other complaining negative reviews.","May 13","false","160.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stormrhodos/recommended/374320/","Stormrhodos","Stormrhodos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stormrhodos/","250 products in account","An absolutely worthy last part of the Dark Souls trilogy, and my new favourite game of all time, sharing the throne with Dark Souls I and in some areas even surpassing it. After the fairly mediocre Dark Souls II (which was still a great game, just not a great Dark Souls) I was sceptical if the spark/fire would fade,so to speak.\n\nTurns out I had no reason to be. Everything I missed from the first game is back in full force and improved in many aspects. The scale, the atmosphere, the absolute joy after killing a boss or clearing a hard area (which there are plenty of), the shrouded lore and interesting NPCs with interlocking stories, the POISE, the amazing always-on-the-edge combat, the gloom and "dark" (and the Sun,praise it) and most importantly, the amazing story and adventure that gets told sublimely through NPC interaction, item descriptions and secrets. Everything just feels like a quality Souls game and how RPGs should be.\nThe combat feels much faster and threatening this time thanks to more agressive enemies with faster attacks and a huge array of combos and charged attacks. The "cheap" feeling Dark Souls II had in so many areas with copy-pasted enemies plastered along corridors is replaced with constant change in enemies and threats from all directions, with singular enemies often still being a big threat if you're not careful. It is still unfair and you will be outnumbered constantly if you allow it, but it doesn't feel as lazy and cheap as Dark Souls II did.\nAnd THANKFULLY, Lifegems are gone. You have your estus flasks and ONE Ember (equivalent of humanity in DS I) to heal and that is it. It brings back tense moments and relief when you find the next bonfire or shortcut, something sorely missing from Dark Soul II. I still wish there would have been less shortcuts/bonfires but it feels a lot better than Dark Souls II.\n\nThe combat from the Player-side also has improved: The charged strong attacks and "Specials" every weapon now has make the already legendary Souls Combat EVEN BETTER. Landing a timed charged attack just at the right moment feels as amazing as it should and the new specials range from shooting piercing Moonlight-Infused arrows to tornado-spinning attacks and leaping sheev-spins to thunderbolts and ice scythes shot from weapons.\nAnd FINALLY,thanks to the mana (FP) system from Demon Souls you can actually use these specials regularly without your weapon breaking every 2 swings. It also means that a magic playthrough is finally somewhat challenging as you can't just have a million casts of soul spears or dark orbs, instead having to rely on precious mana (FP) that you need to sacrifice estus flasks for.\n\n\nOverall, there isn't a game (series) I could recommend more to fans of RPGs and Fantasy/Adventure games. Hundreds of hours of NG+, Jolly Cooperation and/or PvP in an amazing dark fantasy-setting with some of the most memorable moments you will never forget.\nAnd for Souls Fans: It's a worthy last game :'( Praise the Sun.","April 16","true","55.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","0"

He has his friends, his work, his hobbies. In short, he has all the neccessary occupations to keep him from the pits of loneliness and despair that comprises the human experience - but tonight? Tonight, he feels ALIVE.\n\nTonight, he stomps around his empty house, pumping the air with a fist and laughing maniacally. He laughs and weeps tears of frustration turned joy. He has died, and died, and died again. And with each death, learned not only how to correct the mistakes he didn't even realise he was making, but also the most valuable of lessons - that of HOW to learn. This mad, masochistic man has picked up his controller after countless defeats, each time more embittered, but with a subtle, growing reassurance that he is not, in fact, failing, but rather growing stronger.\n\nYour victory in this game will not be as a result of some arbitrary number. It will not be granted to you via a nameless NPC. And it will most certainly not come easy. It will happen in increments, with every small fight won, every foot of territory gained, every successful dodge that previously seemed impossible. And when the fruits of your labour flourish?

The game felt very natural to me as someone who adored the first Dark Souls, and the combat feels like a return to the proper formula. The first couple of bosses are perhaps a bit easy, and I haven't had a chance to do much real PvP (but the one match that didn't turn into a gank fest was fun and exciting, a good sign so far).\nThe game is beautiful, even on the minimum settings I have to use to keep the game from setting my toaster on fire. There is quite a bit of graphical pop-in on these settings, but the game still looks beautiful and is well playable with only the occasional stuttering and bad area (mind you, my graphics card is below the minimum required) and the optimization is not bad at all- I'd say that it runs better than the first Dark Souls without DSfix and looks much nicer.\n\nThe world building is back, and the game has the rich ambiguous lore that made the first game great. Talking to NPCs reveals things, but you still need to piece together the dialogue into a tapestry- who is a reliable narrator, and what are they talking about all the time? I don't know, but so far it's been enthralling.\n\nUltimately, I've only just begun, but I look forward to sinking a lot more time into the game and moving ahead and fighting more interesting enemies and bosses.","April 12","true","28.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Will see if changing the settings around fixes it since I am already playing as the Knight. (which many say fixes the crashing in the first area.) Will change review once game works without crashing. ;w;\n\nEDIT: Lowering lighting quality to low helped until I tried to leave the first boss area, which just instantly crashed my game.\n\nEDIT 2: after 2 hours of messing around with the settings, I managed to open the first door in the game without crashing. But now every time I kill an enemy the game consistently crashes. This wonderful game experience has now become absolutely unplayable for me.\n\n-Lowering lighting to low, using Knight as a starting class, and turning off/downgrading some of the settings does seem to fix the game for a good percentage of the people suffering crashes. Other than that, I've got nothing :/\n\nReally this isn't a massive issue to get salty over because the majority of players don't have this issue, but enough players do have this issue to the point that From Software should have caught it. And really, it isn't just the crashing. It's the glitches and the occasional mechanic that fails to work properly that gives the impression that From didn't really spend as much time playing their own game as they should have, even if that may not be the case.\n\nEspecially after the first two Souls games had issues with both of their releases on PC. It just seems odd that a group with a history successful and amazing game worlds would create a game with these issues.\n\nAlthough I've no idea what the crashing computers all have in common, if you have an excellent gaming computer, I doubt that you'll have any issues with the game. That being said, I'd recommend looking up the glitches online or waiting for the April 18 patch to see if you think it'd be a good idea to buy the game.\n\nOr just....buy it for a console system.","April 11","false","3.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

Previously i was put off from it due to the infamy the series has gained as being very difficult, and didnt wasnt to play a rage fest. But after playing Lords of The Fallen (which i picked up for free on xbox due to their games for gold program) i realized the fun in the challenge, that these types of games pose.\n\nI decided not to preorder it because of the fact that many games nowadays are being sold with game altering bugs to the point of them being unplayable. Which is unfortunetly the case with Dark Souls 3. I foolishly bought the game on launch day without reading any reviews because i didnt want to spoil my first souls game. Calling myself foolish is actually very wrong because:\n\nNO GAME DEVELOPER/PUBLISHER SHOULD RELEASE AN UNPLAYABLE GAME.\n\nIf you are going to release an unfinished game why not as well make it early access, that is what it is there for. It's not like this managed to sneak past quality controll (do they even have that???) because there are hundreds if not thousands of unsatisfied players are having the same problems i am having, and i doubt that they are ok being swindled out of their cash by paying for a game that was SUPPOSED to be complete.\n\nIt makes it even worse that neither bandai namco nor from software have really acknowlaged the problem. Could this be considered false advertising, because what i bought did not resemble the playable game they showed in the trailers.\n\nAs of now my steam profile states that I have "played" this game for seven hours. Realisticly i only played for about four because of all the starting and restarting its made me do. I could have acomplished what i did in those sevn hours in about two if these problems had not existed. It also ruins the imersive feeling that the game has when you've seen the same cutsceene fourteen+ times!\n\nIts like releasing buggy games is the industry standard now. A la Quantm Break, Batman, Assassins Creed, GTA 5's multiplayer, and the list goes on. When did the video game industry shift from entertainment to a cash grab? That they relaeased this game in its current state like this KNOWINGLY is absurd.\n\nI will not be changing this review to a positive one, even if they manage to fix the game. This is my first review (i think), and my first Souls game, sucks that they both were negative, because it is a really fun game when you get it to work, and has amazing visuals and soundtrack. Also the enemies are very uniqe not just in styling but in they way they play, taking advantage of your mistakes and chaining combos. Im sad to leave this review but i do not recommend the game in its current state and no company should lie to their customers.","April 12","false","49.5"," 30 of 56 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","30","56","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/recommended/374320/","rust_decay","raZe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/","394 products in account","Here we go again. The name says it all. It's Dark Souls for the third time and that's pretty much what you get: demanding melee combat reliant on timing, rewarding exploration, cryptic lore, fashionable armor and medieval-themed environments that are as beautiful as they are deadly. There are differences to previous games, however. But they're not nearly as striking as the similarities.\n\nDark Souls 2 received a lot of flak for its uninspired environments, its floaty, somewhat cheap combat and the lack of enemy variation. It's great to see that Dark Souls 3 improved on most of those complaints. Decrepit castles, dimly-lit chapels or moldy dungeons - as usual, the selection of areas sounds like fantasy standard, but the way in which they are presented certainly is outstanding. On many occasions the player will stop what he's doing to soak up the atmosphere.\n\nMeanwhile, From Software has actually increased the combat's floatiness and it's easy to see why: Bloodborne happened - the game that took Dark Souls's formula and made it faster and more frantic, so of course Dark Souls needed to keep up. Enemies have shorter wind up phases resulting in much shorter windows for counter attacks, so combat in general requires you to be quick on your feet. It all plays into shields being kind of unimportant in Dark Souls 3. They're viable for fending off groups of smaller enemies, but when it comes to large enemies or bosses, you really want to master dodging since the stamina loss from blocking a hit is much more severe.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, Dark Souls 3 is demanding but fair for the most part. Still, some of the cheapness introduced in Dark Souls 2 remains. The attacks of some enemies cover easily 75% of the area around their bodies and they can attack seemingly without running out of stamina. However, enemies like these are few and far between. Also, the advantage you gain from leveling up or upgrading your weapon is noticeable, but barely enough to make a difference in the early stages of the game. I returned to an area after ten level ups and three weapon upgrades and it still took me three hits to down a common enemy. Also, sometimes enemies tend to be damage sponges.\n\nDespite the differences, Dark Souls 3 plays like a greatest hits compilation. It features many callbacks to previous games, which is expected from a sequel to some degree, but it's arguable whether or not those callbacks were executed with grace. Often situations or characters are replicated with few variations, suggesting From Software is running out of things to show us. Even Demon's Souls gets referenced on some occasions. If you've played a Dark Souls game, barely anything this one throws at you will come as a surprise. A large swamp area where the water slows down your movement while gradually poisoning you? Never seen that before. Which is a bit disappointing considering that Bloodborne took the established formula and added its own unique twist to it, making the experience fresh anew.\n\nBasically, Dark Souls 3 is more of the same. If you don't insist on it reinventing the wheel, you will have a grand time.","April 16","true","50.9"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

I have a gtx 780ti, i7 2600k @ 3.40Ghz and 16gb ram. For the most part I hit 60fps, it just randomly dips.

Also, it doesn't necessarily happen at the same place each time, so its definitely not a hardware limitation on my part.\n\nIn addition to this, co-op is unplayable. I did a speed test and I got 140mb/s (I pay for 152 so thats brilliant really I didn't expect to get anywhere near this), however when I just did co-op there all the hosts enemies and the host themselves just appeared to be gliding everywhere with no animations. I managed to beat the boss they were stuck on with absolutely no loss of health by just running at them and attacking because for me they weren't attacking at all, they didn't seem to do anything on my screen. Even when I'm in my own world and I click on a patch of blood to see how another player died, the animations on that aren't shown and they just glide around for a bit and disappear.\n\nIts sad and confusing to see they've messed this game up when really it isn't that different from the last two and I'd be surprised if they hadn't even used the exact same game engine/animations etc for the most part, so I have no idea how they've managed to f**k it up.

There was simply put no Q&A (that’s quality assessment if you didn’t know) done. Like at all. PC gamers got shafted with a version of the game that just outright crashes every time you get close to a bonfire while you have a shield equipped.\n\nLet me walk you through it: You face an enemy – obviously you have a shield equipped – you die, you respawn at the last bonfire, you still have said shield equipped, the game crashes. You restart the game, you spawn at the last location the game placed you at, which is the fricking bonfire aaaand the game crashes again. When they told us about the never ending cycle of the Dark Souls world I really had something else in mind.\n\nHow can this pass the Q&A? Why was this not addressed? How could endless players and streamers have the game and none picked that up? By the way, I’m far from the only one who encountered that bug. Look at Steam.\nI really love the franchise but I cannot play the game past the first bonfire. It crashes and crashes and crashes. I mean sure, I could do a no shield run, but since this is my very first time playing DS3 that would be a hard thing to do. Sure, I love me a good challenge but … come on.\n\nThe problem is, that FromSoft obviously places no worth in the PC community at all. Look at the facts. DS1 was released – no one rushed them to it, they had all the time in the world. The game was completely broken and was only fixed by the modding community. DS2 was released – one whole month after the consoles got their version. It wasn’t broken but half of the promised features were missing and they had to re-release the game as the scholar of the first sin edition in order to implement them. Now DS3 is out. I would have loved to make a review, but I can’t. Since I can’t progress through the game.\nSo yeah, that was my little bug report/appreciation message for the stellar job FromSoft did with their latest game. Maybe it’s awesome. Maybe it’s a masterpiece that dwarfs even the likes of Half Life 2. But unfortunately I don’t know that. So thanks again. I took a day off from work only to stare at a crash report screen for hours straight.","April 11","false","60.9"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","13","23","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/damdern/recommended/374320/","damdern","Damdern Jinkins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/damdern/","171 products in account","Dark Souls III is amazing, In alot of ways it's on par or better than the original. My first playthrough of the game, which included all bosses took me 45 hours which is over twice the amount of time it took me to beat Dark Souls 2.  Mechanically speaking I'd say it's the best a Dark Souls game has ever been, the level design is great although how the world connects together, especially in the begining can be a bit boring and linear with one area after another without alot of branching paths that lead to new areas, the lore from what I've seen is great. My only real problem is how the game performs and while I personally haven't had any crashes a friend of mine was saying they had. Overall 9/10, if they get the game running a bit better and/or fix up any bugs/crashes 10/10.\n____________________________________________________________\n\nFollow Up:\n\nSo at the time of this follow up I have 148 hours and have beat the game 4 or 5 more times. The game does have more branching paths than what I initially though, although nothing as complex as the original.  As for bugs, crashes, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance issues From seems to be working on getting that all fixed up still. Something I forgot to bring up in my initial review is the game's boss design. Bosses are much better designed and more memorable than they were in DS2, although from still doesn't seem to know how to make a decent dragon boss fight. Another area of the game I didn't touch on originally in my review is pvp. At first it seemed pretty broken and quite a few weapons just felt broken and cheap compared to what I was used to in DS2, but you get used to that. Ganking also seems to be a much more common  than it was in previous games (Not uncommon to go 5+ invasions with nothing but ganks.), so if you like using red eye orbs over soap stones that might be a pretty big turn off if you perfer pvp to pve. Another issue is the auto summon covenants are broken for large amounts of people currently.","April 14","true","188.7"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePostalGamer/recommended/374320/","ThePostalGamer","ThePostalGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePostalGamer/","313 products in account","Foreword: Due to the game’s early age, there will be a lot of marked spoilers so as to not ruin specific area names or NPC interactions for those who wish to experience those themselves.\n\nThis game is terrible.\n\nI was hoping that after five games, we would be receiving an omnipotent super-game that would easily blow every Souls game before it out of the water with the amalgamation of all of them melded into one perfectly constructed gift from the heavens. What we received was a scrunched up ball of blatant, shameless fan service pandering to the fanbase coupled with the cheapest enemies that the franchise has ever seen, bosses that have zero creativity, a recycling of its own areas and basic enemies that are capable of annihilating you even if you’re overprepared thanks to their zero wind-up attacks, unlimited stamina and absurdly high damage.\n\nI'm going to quickly cover the very few good points that this game has before I tear it apart. To begin with, the Focus Points system, mechanically identical to an MP bar which hasn't been used in the series since Demon’s Souls, is no longer completely useless for melee characters thanks to the new Skills system. These Skills consume your FP to use some kind of special ability. As an example, the Club gets one that grants it a short damage boost and the Longsword gets a sideways slash that bats away an enemy shield. Focus Points can also be replenished using the Ashen Estus Flask which upgrades alongside your regular Estus Flask and you may divide the maximum charges between them at the blacksmith. It’s a clever mechanic that allows melee-only characters to take advantage of their formerly useless MP bar.\n\nNPC questlines are worth seeing at least once, in my opinion. A handful of them will even move around the game world instead of all just ending up in one spot without some kind of conclusion to their own personal journeys, a common complaint about Dark Souls 2.\n\nLastly, after four whole games, they finally implemented a way to hand over multiple covenant items at once. Hallelujah. EDIT: You can also now swap your devotion between each covenant through your inventory.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s about it for the good stuff. It’s actually quite an outstanding game in the first few hours, but it begins to fall apart very early, at Road of Sacrifices.\n\nAs soon as you enter this area, you are greeted by a large swamp that is littered with enemies and some areas of this swamp slow you down to a crawl. This is nothing we’re not used to, but this doesn't mean it was a good idea in the previous games, either.\n\nEven knowing that traversing the swamp is much faster if I equip a weapon that has the Quickstep skill and use that to speed through the parts of the swamp that I'm otherwise forced to slowly walk or fat roll through, this doesn't change the fact that there are enemies everywhere that can all move at normal speed, so the end result is a desperate slow walk to dry land so you can hope to kill the horde that will have followed you. Also, if you’re playing online, you'll have the Watchdogs of Farron player invaders akin to the Forest Hunters in Dark Souls to worry about, as well.\n\nOnce you’re past all of that for the first time, you get to do it again in Farron Keep. The swamp slowing your movement speed was tolerable, but the fun drops way down into the negative numbers when the swamp is about three times larger, poisonous, you’re forced to locate three shrines and extinguish the fires on each of them and the new enemies here get a weapon that launches about twelve homing projectiles at you. This is about the point where I started eating my controller, the taste of which wasn’t improved when I found out that there was no Rusted Iron Ring.\n\nThis was not made any better after I hit Irithyll Dungeon, at which point I was introduced to the worst enemy in Souls and possibly video game history: the Jailer. This enemy has the ability to drain your maximum health all the way down to 1HP if you’re standing near him and he has a soldering iron that he will instantly poke you with to ruin your movement speed thanks to a debuff, then quickly perform a grab attack that WILL strip about 1,500 health off of you. There are also eight of them patrolling around a room near the end of the level. This entire area infuriated me so much that I defied my own usual rules with these kinds of games and rushed the rest of the game because I just wanted it to be over.\n\nThere are also the dogs in this game, which WILL kill you repeatedly because there’s no defending against them. Try to swing and they'll read your inputs and dodge away, try to block and they'll bounce too far off your shield for you to hit them, try to run away and they'll nibble on your ankle the moment you slow down to heal. If there are two of them on you, you might as well put your controller down because you won’t win. Swinging blindly hoping that you'll tag them is seriously your best bet.\n\nMost of the bosses, final boss included, are more of a spectacle or something for fans to beat themselves off with using the game’s lore that was hastily stapled onto it for fan service than a genuine challenge on a level playing field. Once I was finally able to kill most of them, my initial reaction was a sigh of relief at the fact that I didn't have to slog through it again rather than what should have been a respectful salute to the worthy adversary that I’d just defeated. For the most part, they’re predictable like clockwork, stunlock-happy and deal way too much damage.\n\nFanbase pandering  is absolutely everywhere in this game and it’s worse than it’s ever been. I can’t possibly go over them all with the 8,000 character limit, but as a few examples: When you first run into this game’s hub world, Andre makes his return from Dark Souls as your blacksmith. There’s no reason for this, he’s just there. Later in the game, you will return to a frozen version of Anor Londo and there are chests dotted around the area that contain equipment that’s all ripped right from Dark Souls. They’re not even boss soul items or picked up through a questline or anything, they’re just in chests for you to find.\n\nIn closing: This game is actually so bad that after I finished it for the first time, not only did I fully reverse my initial idea that my first playthrough of Dark Souls 3 was simply the exploratory phase and I don’t yet have the first hand experience or knowledge to consistently overcome it, but I revised my initial thoughts on whether I was actually having fun with all of these games, or simply tolerating them so I could squeeze whatever little bits of enjoyment that I could get out of them. If there’s some aspect of this game that I'm simply not seeing that pushes it to the glowing 9/10 scores that everybody else are giving it, then that’s great. I would love to be proven wrong and actually begin to enjoy it again.\n\nThis review was written before any of the DLC came out, so if the Rusted Iron Ring makes a return and updates make it so the enemies that don’t have wind-up on their attacks are given some, the enemies that can attack you relentlessly are given a limit on their stamina and the damage you receive is toned down to more reasonable levels, then that would fix every major problem that I have with this game and I would happily change this to a recommendation. Until then, avoid this game.","May 28","false","77.3"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","20"

It's a great series, but I went into this thing knowing how to dodge roll and to not have equipment load over 70% and all that stuff. Someone who comes into this game not knowing their ♥♥♥♥ might not have such an easy time of it. So overall, I'd say this is the easiest Dark Souls I've played, but geez I sort of have been training hard for these things, you know?\n\nWhat I can say compared to other games:\n- The Co-op is fun, but there isn't a dual boss like Ornstein and Smough, the Sentinels, the Throne Guardians, those two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tigers or whatnot. Dark Souls is a challenging game and there is nothing that builds an everlasting friendship than in going up against a boss and trusting your back to a friend.\n- There are a lot of AI holes you can exploit. I found a bunch of spots where enemies would refuse to advance on you because they apparently are not supposed to leave their designated zones. Maybe it's because I'm savvy to how the games work, but still.\n- The Fashion Souls game is alright, but I never found anything like the Desert Sorceress outfit. :(\n- The story is... great. I'm really looking forward to VaatiVidya videos for this one. Special shout out to the moments where you go to the Abyssal Firelink Shrine.\n\nIn any case, Dark Souls is great.

Very challenging and different from many others.\nThe only cons are that the server lags sometimes, online gaming glitches once in a while, and anti-cheating system is absolutely horrible.\nI would recommend anyone playing this game to back up their save files frequently. This can be done easily with a C++ backup software made by EntityZero on reddit. Just set up how frequently and how much back up files you want your save to be backed up, and keep it on while you play your game. It takes no processing power at all, all the program does is copy and paste your save file to another location every X minutes. You can also choose how much save to keep. Keeping 5 or more is recommended.\nBacking up can save you from a soft ban. For example, if you meet the hacker that gives you millions of souls, once you get hit, quit the game as quick as you can. Pull up your back up save and replace your ruined save. If you left the program on, the most recent save is probably corrupted also, so use the older one ( like 2 minutes older) just to be safe.\nSince your back up save is clean, the anti cheating system won't detect any invalid data, therefore you won't get banned\nHere's the link for the program:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4f02y7/dark_souls_2_3_auto_backup_tool/","May 7","true","161.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Be wary of praise the sun and don't give up, skeleton!\n\nI absolutelly loved the third part of the series. It was as unexpected, as pleasant to find out that devs are working on it and I spent my fair share of hours in this game and I must say that it adds plenty of variaty to PVP and gameplay itself. All the old elements are still present, devs even ressurected some from long forgotten "Demon Souls" and brought them back to life in third part (Like FP bar, etc)... And it does offer a good degree of challanging gameplay, exploration freedom and player's activities. The one thing that I did not liked so far, is that game servers are probably REALLY loaded right now and most player encounters ends in awkward "Fight" with your opponent's levitating standing animation, where you have no idea if he is attacking, casting a spell on you, blocking, dodging or what. All you see is this awkward flying аsshоlе, standing still, surrounded by mistery of his future actions. But besides that little detail, the game is good and I do recommend you to buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/recommended/374320/","bastwood","Bastwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/","689 products in account","Marketing has always been a problem for the Souls series. I remember being supremely disappointed in Demon's Souls, a game lauded back in 2009 as this new, revolutionary RPG experience with innovative multiplayer features. I played it, died a bunch, killed the first boss - a thoroughly unimpressive black blob - and thought: "Is this it?". The game seemed to be lacking almost all aspects I consider critical to a good RPG, such as story, player choice and an immersive world. Best foot forward this was not.\n\nNevertheless, the Souls series marched onwards, becoming a worldwide multiplatform phenomenon. Marketing shifted its focus to emphasize the extreme difficulty. "Prepare to Die!", barked the banners and billboards in anticipation of Dark Souls 1. I still didn't see the appeal. From the outside looking in, it seemed like the game was merely difficult for the sake of being difficult. Plus the PC port was initially abysmal.\n\nIn retrospect, it's a crying shame that the true strengths of the series were so rarely mentioned in any materials: The all-encompassing sense of discovery, wonderfully glum Dark Fantasy atmosphere and the scale & feel of a grand adventure. I propose that only by letting go of your preconceptions can you start truly enjoying the Dark Souls experience - a reason why "blind" playthroughs are a big thing among DS fans. Now that I've finally completed my first Souls game, I realize it's all about the journey, not the destination.\n\nNot knowing what lies ahead creates a powerful framework of both tension and awe. The game delivers on its rich environmental details: Emerging topside after a grueling jaunt in some underground ruins is always rewarded with a new, spectacular vista - a promise of more discoveries to come. Treading lightly is also rewarded, since you need to be acutely aware about the fact that the game is just waiting for you to drop your guard for a second to plunge a knife in your back.\n\nObservation and determination are required in equal amounts. Dark Souls 3 is definitely a difficult game, but eventually overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds can result in rare "MMO Raid Boss" -style highs that are seldomly reached in single-player games. The combat system is cruel but rewarding - Probably my favorite close-quarters brawling system in any game.\n\nI only wish the game did a better job of explaining its underlying mechanics. I absolutely enjoy exploring totally foreign, sprawling areas and meticulously studying enemy attack patterns, but some crucial under-the-hood stuff is just plain not communicated well or at all. It took me ages to figure out you actually cannot be hit during parts of your roll, or that the roll gets progressively worse even while you're below the maximum load threshold. I still can't claim to completely understand the parry system. The game just goes a bit too far with its obfuscation in places.\n\nStory is another aspect I cannot really be fully satisfied with. While Dark Souls lore is undeniably rich and you can sense the coherency in its worldbuilding, the story could use some more flesh around its bones. The intro movie seems more like a boss highlight reel than a yarn being spun into motion. I can appreciate what the lack of story is going for, but even if it's all an exercise in futility, I feel the tale could be told more effectively.\n\nOverall, after finishing Dark Souls 3 I can't help but to feel the need to kick myself for letting this series slip through the cracks. It's amazing that a game this good could be created today using design tenets mostly from the eighties, but there it is. I don't have to agree with or even like all the design decisions at play here; What I do have to recognize is the whole - A game that feels tremendously right, stubbornly clinging to its age-old ways, knowing there's still some spark left in them.\n\nI'm not sure I can say Dark Souls 3 is for everyone. I know that I initially anticipated completely wrong things from the series. But what I can say is that the less you expect from it, the more you will end up getting.","April 26","true","51.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But especially with heavy mooded games like the Souls series I prefer to be completely immersed without being distracted by online traffic. Also this is just my first playthrough, so I'm probably missing a million things. Having said that I can say the following about my experience:\n\n+ Graphically this game is sublime, absolutely beautiful. Textures are rich and detailed, background and lighting are very atmospheric. Very happy to see as much beautiful medieval fantasy architecture (both interior and exterior) as there is.\n+ Not only that, it also runs very smoothly (at least on my system) and I have encounterd little to no bugs on my 80+ hours of play.\n+ Combat is satisfying and fluent. There are some great movesets, it's pretty hard to choose a bad weapon here (as long as your build is suitable for it ofcourse).\n+ Some boss desings are awesome as ever (not all quite as surprising as in DS1, but some really are)\n+ I like the collection of characters you get to meet and the story they carry with them. There are a couple of really enjoyable storylines to follow throughout the game, making it a very replayable (NG+) experience.\n+ The number of weapons, armor and other loot is also very impressive\n+ The way leveling works took a little bit time to get used to, but in the end I liked it, it's fun to play around and see what works best for you.\n+ Good variety of characters and playstyles to choose from\n+ Locations feel fun and varied, although some may not like the reusage of former game locations and formerly valuable key items being (at least seemingly, I might be missing something) casually thrown in a dusty corner and reduced to mere non-essential decorative trinkets. I think the rehash has been done in a nice and respectable way, but then again I never played Bloodborne or DS2 and only the first part of Demon Souls so I probably recognised less and interprated more elements as something new.\n\n- I don't like the idea of Fire Link as a central hub. It has its advantages, but it very much makes the world feel less naturally connected. What I absolutely love about DS1 is the way the levels connect with eachother and the freedom of movement you've got to navigate between them both back and forth. Every place you see is reachable, you can walk right to it (except for the asylum at the beginning, but that was a deliberate and thought out decision, it makes sense).\nHere from the very start you can't reach Lothric without poofing from one bonfire to another. And you need to poof back to get back to Firelink Shrine, no walking allowed. To me this makes it a destination without a solid, touchable place in the game world, even though you can look upon it from afar from certain points of view.\n- Also in general there are way too many bonfires too close to each other, reducing the challenge and breaking immersion\sense of urgency in exchange for more focus on combat and faster pacing. They might as well have made a quicksave option at this point.\n- Many of the characters in this hub seem to have too little variation in the lines they say as you progress in the game. Especially the Fire Keeper which whom you have to talk to most because you can't just level up at a bonfire anymore. There are some surprising lines and lore to discover, but I think there could have been more (hell, there isn't even a why-did-you-ran-away-without-saying-bye line this time around). I know for sure I have missed some by the decisions I've made in this playthrough, so I hope to discover more on next playthroughs.\n- I haven't found a use for the repairing system yet. My armor never wore off and neither did my weapons. I must be missing something here, or at least I hope I am.\n\nAll and all DS3 is a great experience and I would highly recommend it. To me it's not as fresh and original as DS1, but that doesn't mean it's not an awesome, challenging and satisfying game. When all the hype has been done hyping and maybe the cheating system will be fixed I'll go for a online run, but it's already been fun enough.","May 13","true","95.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've heard that nvidia cards have trouble with this game, so, if you own an Nvidia card, you might want to read some of the negative reviews and patchnotes.\n\nThis game, is everything i've hoped for, it's simply amazing, no videogame is perfect, but this game is coming damn ♥♥♥♥ing close. The game could, and should be summed up with but one word ''Masterpiece''\nDark souls, which is arguably the best videogame series ever made, changed how i looked at videogames forever. the sheer detail and work that was put into it is astonishing. this was also the saddest  playthrough of a game i ever had, constantly being reminded that this is the last one, the last time i can ever experience a masterpiece like this.\n\nThe fire fades, and with it, so does dark souls. it's brave and beautiful. in dark souls we heard that the flame was dying out, in dark souls 2, the flame was still burning. but now, it's dead. the flame, the series, and the universe has come to an end. after this, there is nothing, no deus ex machina to save the day, no more hope. simply an empty void in which nothing leaves but a trace of what once was.\nThat's truly the hardest thing about dark souls, and at least miyazaki kept his word. The series went out with a bang, For me, this is the best game i've ever played. i don't want to spoil anything so the only thing i can say is, please, please, for ♥♥♥♥'s sake, play this game, play this game and be amazed. there is nothing else like it, and nothing like it will ever come again.","April 21","true","296.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'll try to keep this brief and spoiler free though. The PvE and lore is done really well but on the other hand the PvP balancing and covenants are really poorly done. I feel like FromSoft really took a lot from Bloodborne and put it into this series which wasn't the best idea, the increased speed of PvP causes a lot of it to feel... bland.\n\nOverall if they can fix the balancing in the coming months and with the inevitably fantastic DLC that is going to come out I'll give this game a solid 9 right now... which is actually really low considering how much I like it but the balance issues can't be overlooked.","May 24","true","139.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

From a gameplay standpoint, it is different in its own way.  The way this game pieces together not only Dark Souls 1, but 2 even, is baffling, and the combat system, npc's; friends and foes alike, straight up to the bosses, is a well defined, and blatant improvement.  The geography and map itself is well improved and has come a long way, following the style of Dark Souls 1 and 2 both, structurally and scenically.\n\nAlthough, at this moment I post this review, it is worse for keyboards, however, movement itself is easier and polished. It is advisable, regardless, to use a controller.  Still not a big issue.  Aside from bugs that make you restart your game or hinder performance/ gameplay; only from time to time, of course, this game is quite the experience.\n\nThis game I would recommend heavily for anyone that enjoy the Dark Souls series and can look past the launch problems and bugs.

(Waited 3 hours in anor londo while i played on my PS4 to have a single invasion.\n\nBlue Sentinel's: Ditto as the above\n\nWay of Blue: only has players until the second or third area of the game and some rare ones later making the other 2 dead as hell.\n\nWatchdogs of Farron : did a run on the game with this one on all the time untill abyss watchers (literally went through the whole area's gathering all items at level 35 waiting for an invasion ( Yes i was at Sacrifice Road) never had a single invasion.(Tough i was invaded so kudos for that not as dead)\n\nAldrich Faithful: Literally can only do it's thing in like 1% of game's area(from the area of a boss to the other wich is like 20 minutes of walk if you kill everything in your way and explore) but amazingly it is alive because of the pitfight's in the area( Power goes way up the head of some people i've seen some hot's using a whip and hitting the guys that didn't want to fight literally like he was the owner of the world).\n\nCON 2: COVENANT'S PART 2.\n\nYeah.\nCovenant's again.\nProblem: as the 2 covenant's wich are to help way of blue are dead and dead as dead and dead( that's alot of dead) after the initial area's of the game you literally can't get rank's in those 2 without some HEAVY FARMING(BORING AS HELL) I Almost went into a Boringness induced coma farming the Proof of Concordt Kept to get the miracle and the ring.\nAnd some people really think it's the fault of the players for not getting the damn 30 things before you get to level 40.(Nuts i know)\n\nApart from that farming of the other 2 went smooth ( Mound Maker's and Watchdog's of Farron) Mound Maker's i farmed at level 180 and still found people easily and Watchdog's is really easy to get the 30 killing some mobs in the swamp.\nAldrich Faithful is easy too.\nSo why the hell they did the hardest one and most boring one be the one that's the hardest one to find matches? Pure Evil? Satan advised those japanese to do it? probably but let's not get into that.\n\nAll in All i really liked this game. But if those 2 covenant's ( Blue Sentinel's and Darkmoon) actually worked without depending of a single covenant ( Like making Darkmoon work just like in Dark Soul's 1 wich would be the dream)\nI would have been done with the 100% in about 30 hour's earlier ( I Just like to make 100% in soul's game's and i won't stop playing even now( i play dark soul's 1, 2 and Bloodborne all the time even to this day.\n\nBut even with that this game get's about 99% of my love so this review will be a positive one.\n\n","April 24","true","111.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skittlesz/recommended/374320/","skittlesz","Just Your Average Darkwraith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skittlesz/","524 products in account","Alright, serious review time.\n\nDark Souls 3 is the best in the series. Yeah, I said it. Am I alone in that opinion? Perhaps, but I'll say it anyway.\n\nThe easiest way to describe Dark Souls 3 is to tell you that From Software looked at all the Souls games, including Demons Souls, and said, "lets take what we did best in each of these and combine it".\n\nAnd it worked out beautifully. DS3 has all the atmosphere and subtlety of Demons Souls, it has the memorable characters and incredible world of Dark Souls, and it has the refined mechanics and covenant diversity of Dark Souls 2. Well and there's even some inspiration from Bloodborne thrown in for good measure. The game is a love song to the fans of the series, and its extremely evident that the team put their heart into this game. They didn't make Dark Souls 3 for the money, they made Dark Souls 3 for the love of the series.\n\nDS3 does introduce some mechanics of its own, as well. The weapon upgrade system from Demons Souls returns, but is combined with the upgrade system from DS2. How so? Well, there's a plethora of upgrade paths once more, including the long desired Quality, but each path uses the same basic materials with gems to "infuse" the weapon. Spell uses are gone now, replaced by the MP bar from Demons Souls (now called FP) and Attunement increases this bar as well as your spell slots. "Dual" weapons exist now and become dual wielded when two-handed, functionally working like powerstancing in Dark Souls 2.\n\nBut theres a lot thats new to see here and to just list it all off isn't terribly important. Thats what wikis are for. So now we're gonna talk about the story and atmosphere of the game. And yes, major spoilers will be abound.\n\nI'll say it again, SPOILERS BELOW.\n\n\nIts not unusual for a Souls game to invoke emotion in the player. Hell, when I fought Garl Vinland in Demons Souls I felt no sense of accomplishment. Only sorrow. But no Souls game yet has made me simply *feel* as often as Dark Souls 3 has. The moment I entered the Firelink Shrine, nostalgia washed over me. Here before me was the familiar Nexus of Demons Souls, but different. And then the Fire Keeper spoke almost the very same words the Maiden in Black said to me seven years ago. It was a lot to take in, and it was only the beginning. Wandering further into the shrine I heard a familiar hammer, and saw a familiar face. Andre of Astora, still alive after all these years.\n\nIt didn't stop there. I made my way through the game, fighting tooth and nail to survive and emerged into Irithyll, the Boreal Valley. It was tough, but I got through that too. As I walked out of that place, a sense of familiarity washed over me again. There were knights with greatbows firing at me as I dashed across the rooftop to safety, emerging in a room all too familiar: the Darkmoon Tomb. I couldn't believe it, I thought it was a mere homage to DS1. I ran out of the room and pulled the elevator lever excitedly. I had to know, I had to see it. I spun the lever once more and ascended. And there it was, Anor Londo. I was back.\n\nI don't want to talk about every single emotional moment, there were far too many. I'll just share one more. The final battle. Entering the Kiln of the First Flame was in itself another emotional moment, but it didn't truly hit me until the fight began. The Soul of Cinder swung a mighty weapon and wielded powerful spells, but it meant nothing until the second phase of the fight, when the moveset and the music changed. Then the realization hit me. You see, when the second phase began, a familiar piano began to play, a familiar greatsword was swung. The Soul of Cinder wasn't some random guardian that From cooked up to give me one last challenge. The Soul of Cinder was me in Dark Souls 1. The Soul of Cinder was you. The Soul of Cinder was Gwyn. It was everyone who had linked the fire. This was very well the end of the series, and the final challenge to overcome was none other than my former self.\n\nSo why am I gushing about all these emotional moments in a review? This is a video game right? Well, as I said, this is in all likelihood the final Souls game. It was made for people like me, who have been with the series since Demons Souls. Who felt no joy in defeating Garl Vinland, who felt a solemn respect and pity for the husk that once was Gwyn. This was for us. Thats why these moments matter. For us, Souls games make us feel. And that Dark Souls 3 makes me feel as much as it does is very important.\n\nSo thats it. I've sung the game's praises enough. If this is to be the last hurrah of my beloved series, I am completely okay with that. This is the perfect end to a series that has meant so much to me. It was a wonderful journey, I'm glad to have been a part of it.","April 18","true","149.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

But especially with heavy mooded games like the Souls series I prefer to be completely immersed without being distracted by online traffic. Also this is just my first playthrough, so I'm probably missing a million things. Having said that I can say the following about my experience:\n\n+ Graphically this game is sublime, absolutely beautiful. Textures are rich and detailed, background and lighting are very atmospheric. Very happy to see as much beautiful medieval fantasy architecture (both interior and exterior) as there is.\n+ Not only that, it also runs very smoothly (at least on my system) and I have encounterd little to no bugs on my 80+ hours of play.\n+ Combat is satisfying and fluent. There are some great movesets, it's pretty hard to choose a bad weapon here (as long as your build is suitable for it ofcourse).\n+ Some boss desings are awesome as ever (not all quite as surprising as in DS1, but some really are)\n+ I like the collection of characters you get to meet and the story they carry with them. There are a couple of really enjoyable storylines to follow throughout the game, making it a very replayable (NG+) experience.\n+ The number of weapons, armor and other loot is also very impressive\n+ The way leveling works took a little bit time to get used to, but in the end I liked it, it's fun to play around and see what works best for you.\n+ Good variety of characters and playstyles to choose from\n+ Locations feel fun and varied, although some may not like the reusage of former game locations and formerly valuable key items being (at least seemingly, I might be missing something) casually thrown in a dusty corner and reduced to mere non-essential decorative trinkets. I think the rehash has been done in a nice and respectable way, but then again I never played Bloodborne or DS2 and only the first part of Demon Souls so I probably recognised less and interprated more elements as something new.\n\n- I don't like the idea of Fire Link as a central hub. It has its advantages, but it very much makes the world feel less naturally connected. What I absolutely love about DS1 is the way the levels connect with eachother and the freedom of movement you've got to navigate between them both back and forth. Every place you see is reachable, you can walk right to it (except for the asylum at the beginning, but that was a deliberate and thought out decision, it makes sense).\nHere from the very start you can't reach Lothric without poofing from one bonfire to another. And you need to poof back to get back to Firelink Shrine, no walking allowed. To me this makes it a destination without a solid, touchable place in the game world, even though you can look upon it from afar from certain points of view.\n- Also in general there are way too many bonfires too close to each other, reducing the challenge and breaking immersion\sense of urgency in exchange for more focus on combat and faster pacing. They might as well have made a quicksave option at this point.\n- Many of the characters in this hub seem to have too little variation in the lines they say as you progress in the game. Especially the Fire Keeper which whom you have to talk to most because you can't just level up at a bonfire anymore. There are some surprising lines and lore to discover, but I think there could have been more (hell, there isn't even a why-did-you-ran-away-without-saying-bye line this time around). I know for sure I have missed some by the decisions I've made in this playthrough, so I hope to discover more on next playthroughs.\n- I haven't found a use for the repairing system yet. My armor never wore off and neither did my weapons. I must be missing something here, or at least I hope I am.\n\nAll and all DS3 is a great experience and I would highly recommend it. To me it's not as fresh and original as DS1, but that doesn't mean it's not an awesome, challenging and satisfying game. When all the hype has been done hyping and maybe the cheating system will be fixed I'll go for a online run, but it's already been fun enough.","May 13","true","95.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not a perfect one, despite what me giving it a ten may say. If I were to give it a more accurate score, I'd personally give it a 9.4. It brings back a lot of elements from the first Dark Souls, and the level designs really do feel like I'm in a different version of Lordran. Whenever I see the sweeping castles in the distance, I can't help but be reminded of Anor Londo. And traversing the High Wall of Lothric just feels so much like traversing the high ledges of Undead Parish, it's just...nostalgic and refreshing at the same time. Even the cliffs in the Cemetery of Ash up to Firelink Shrine remind me of the cliffs surrounding the original Firelink Shrine, as well as the graveyard surrounding The Catacombs. It truly is like a love letter to the series, as well as to the fans who have been with the series since the start.\n\nMoving on to the gameplay aspects, combat is much faster now (you can thank Bloodborne for that), and there's a new element to it that has been added, in the form of Weapon Arts (I think that's what they're called). These function as special techniques that change based on the weapon you happen to be using, and deal high damage at the cost of a new uh...I'm not really sure what to call it, but it functions similarly to health (you even get a unique Estus Flask to refill it). I don't know the actual name, but it's referred to as FP, and a little is drained every time you use a Weapon Art. There's also a 'Cinder Mode' where you have double health and I believe increased strength until death. You can achieve this by either killing a boss, or using a consumable item known as an Ember.\n\nAnd all those pesky annoyances about Hollowing, such as losing some of your max health, as well as now looking like a zombie, are gone. When you die, you just lose all of your Souls and are sent back to the last bonfire. No Health loss, no green skin, none of that. If I'm not mistaken, death functions similarly to Bloodborne in that aspect.\n\nI will close with a slight warning. The PC version has occasional framerate dips. Fortunately, at least for me, they didn't interrupt play too much, and I was still plenty able to enjoy my time with the game despite these dips.\n\nAll in all, I absolutely love this game. It's fantastic, it really, really is.","May 8","true","131.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That being said, here's my spiel on the third installment:\nFrom is one of those publishers who apparently really like to reuse their formula for gameplay. This is by no means a bad thing, especially since it works here. Overall, the movement for the player and for the varying sizes of flesh in this installment feels way less stiff from previous games. Movements feel faster and more fluid, allowing for combat to be way more intimate over previous installments where the stratagem was usally just to wait for Bigbritches McBossalot to do a heavy attack so you have time to peck at his ankles. The one place this falters, and feel free to tell me I'm wrong about this, is with shields that have 100% physical block. In my opinion, these things make Dark Sutra games way too easy, as only a handful of enemies have alternate means of damage.\n\nThe enviornment of this game is something to behold. Many of the areas (save for some out of bounds nonsense, as per usual) are marvelously crafted and mind-bendingly interwoven. It's truly something to visit the other half of a destroyed bridge hours of meandering around later. Something I kind of hated about Dark Souls One was the amount of depressing caves and dark areas that were visually akin to hard pudding. There's a lot less of that here, and environments of that sort are better crafted this time around.\n\nAll I can really say about PvP from my lack of expecience in prior games and lack of a pretentious state of mind is that it's a lot easier to have fun with it if you're new to the series. Being bad is totally fine, because odds are you'll have like 3+ dudes with you engaged in jolly cooperation anyway.\n\nClass rebalancing is pretty solid. Weapon stances are a welcome change to make melee combat seem less mundane. The same can be said for spells. Good God there are a lot of magic and faith options this time around--both in gear and in heathen spellcasting. There's so many that I'd even say that the devs clearly favored all classes having at least a bit of every category, because as Strength BigCubberhousen I feel that I'm missing out on quite a lot.\n\nLastly, and this can be a good thing or a bad thing, Dark Souls Tres really, REALLY wants you to remember the first two games. There are so damn many references through bosses, enemies, equipment, areas, and everything else that are about the first two games, mostly Dark Souls One. I honestly feel that they overdid it a bit, because the game feels less like its own thing and more like a reimagining of the first installment. To this end, you might actually enjoy the game more if you haven't played previous installments.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is worth your time if adventure games are your thing, casual or not. Given the game's resources for the player, these games really aren't as hard as they're infamously said to be. In fact, I'd say they do difficulty extraordinarily well, as encounters are engaging and require you to think quite a lot more than most other modern games, at least that I have played.

Dark souls III rises above its previous younglings, and takes all of it into one sucessful bundle of dark fantasy. If you liked 1, 2, and Bloodborne even, chances are you'll love this too. Combat is fast and fluid, graphics are, although not a killer, shines in many areas. The music will keep you motivated, as the epic haunting sounds of Yuka's score blasts through each boss. Buy it.

Be wary of praise the sun and don't give up, skeleton!\n\nI absolutelly loved the third part of the series. It was as unexpected, as pleasant to find out that devs are working on it and I spent my fair share of hours in this game and I must say that it adds plenty of variaty to PVP and gameplay itself. All the old elements are still present, devs even ressurected some from long forgotten "Demon Souls" and brought them back to life in third part (Like FP bar, etc)... And it does offer a good degree of challanging gameplay, exploration freedom and player's activities. The one thing that I did not liked so far, is that game servers are probably REALLY loaded right now and most player encounters ends in awkward "Fight" with your opponent's levitating standing animation, where you have no idea if he is attacking, casting a spell on you, blocking, dodging or what. All you see is this awkward flying аsshоlе, standing still, surrounded by mistery of his future actions. But besides that little detail, the game is good and I do recommend you to buy it.

Not a perfect one, despite what me giving it a ten may say. If I were to give it a more accurate score, I'd personally give it a 9.4. It brings back a lot of elements from the first Dark Souls, and the level designs really do feel like I'm in a different version of Lordran. Whenever I see the sweeping castles in the distance, I can't help but be reminded of Anor Londo. And traversing the High Wall of Lothric just feels so much like traversing the high ledges of Undead Parish, it's just...nostalgic and refreshing at the same time. Even the cliffs in the Cemetery of Ash up to Firelink Shrine remind me of the cliffs surrounding the original Firelink Shrine, as well as the graveyard surrounding The Catacombs. It truly is like a love letter to the series, as well as to the fans who have been with the series since the start.\n\nMoving on to the gameplay aspects, combat is much faster now (you can thank Bloodborne for that), and there's a new element to it that has been added, in the form of Weapon Arts (I think that's what they're called). These function as special techniques that change based on the weapon you happen to be using, and deal high damage at the cost of a new uh...I'm not really sure what to call it, but it functions similarly to health (you even get a unique Estus Flask to refill it). I don't know the actual name, but it's referred to as FP, and a little is drained every time you use a Weapon Art. There's also a 'Cinder Mode' where you have double health and I believe increased strength until death. You can achieve this by either killing a boss, or using a consumable item known as an Ember.\n\nAnd all those pesky annoyances about Hollowing, such as losing some of your max health, as well as now looking like a zombie, are gone. When you die, you just lose all of your Souls and are sent back to the last bonfire. No Health loss, no green skin, none of that. If I'm not mistaken, death functions similarly to Bloodborne in that aspect.\n\nI will close with a slight warning. The PC version has occasional framerate dips. Fortunately, at least for me, they didn't interrupt play too much, and I was still plenty able to enjoy my time with the game despite these dips.\n\nAll in all, I absolutely love this game. It's fantastic, it really, really is.","May 8","true","131.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But especially with heavy mooded games like the Souls series I prefer to be completely immersed without being distracted by online traffic. Also this is just my first playthrough, so I'm probably missing a million things. Having said that I can say the following about my experience:\n\n+ Graphically this game is sublime, absolutely beautiful. Textures are rich and detailed, background and lighting are very atmospheric. Very happy to see as much beautiful medieval fantasy architecture (both interior and exterior) as there is.\n+ Not only that, it also runs very smoothly (at least on my system) and I have encounterd little to no bugs on my 80+ hours of play.\n+ Combat is satisfying and fluent. There are some great movesets, it's pretty hard to choose a bad weapon here (as long as your build is suitable for it ofcourse).\n+ Some boss desings are awesome as ever (not all quite as surprising as in DS1, but some really are)\n+ I like the collection of characters you get to meet and the story they carry with them. There are a couple of really enjoyable storylines to follow throughout the game, making it a very replayable (NG+) experience.\n+ The number of weapons, armor and other loot is also very impressive\n+ The way leveling works took a little bit time to get used to, but in the end I liked it, it's fun to play around and see what works best for you.\n+ Good variety of characters and playstyles to choose from\n+ Locations feel fun and varied, although some may not like the reusage of former game locations and formerly valuable key items being (at least seemingly, I might be missing something) casually thrown in a dusty corner and reduced to mere non-essential decorative trinkets. I think the rehash has been done in a nice and respectable way, but then again I never played Bloodborne or DS2 and only the first part of Demon Souls so I probably recognised less and interprated more elements as something new.\n\n- I don't like the idea of Fire Link as a central hub. It has its advantages, but it very much makes the world feel less naturally connected. What I absolutely love about DS1 is the way the levels connect with eachother and the freedom of movement you've got to navigate between them both back and forth. Every place you see is reachable, you can walk right to it (except for the asylum at the beginning, but that was a deliberate and thought out decision, it makes sense).\nHere from the very start you can't reach Lothric without poofing from one bonfire to another. And you need to poof back to get back to Firelink Shrine, no walking allowed. To me this makes it a destination without a solid, touchable place in the game world, even though you can look upon it from afar from certain points of view.\n- Also in general there are way too many bonfires too close to each other, reducing the challenge and breaking immersion\sense of urgency in exchange for more focus on combat and faster pacing. They might as well have made a quicksave option at this point.\n- Many of the characters in this hub seem to have too little variation in the lines they say as you progress in the game. Especially the Fire Keeper which whom you have to talk to most because you can't just level up at a bonfire anymore. There are some surprising lines and lore to discover, but I think there could have been more (hell, there isn't even a why-did-you-ran-away-without-saying-bye line this time around). I know for sure I have missed some by the decisions I've made in this playthrough, so I hope to discover more on next playthroughs.\n- I haven't found a use for the repairing system yet. My armor never wore off and neither did my weapons. I must be missing something here, or at least I hope I am.\n\nAll and all DS3 is a great experience and I would highly recommend it. To me it's not as fresh and original as DS1, but that doesn't mean it's not an awesome, challenging and satisfying game. When all the hype has been done hyping and maybe the cheating system will be fixed I'll go for a online run, but it's already been fun enough.","May 13","true","95.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Never have I been forced to stop spamming dodge/attack and actually learn the moveset of the boss or perfect my reaction time. It took me approximately 2 hours to beat Iudex as a starting Mercenary, but the thrill and adrenaline post-battle was truly something no other game offered. I never thought I could come to love a game that wanted to kill me so badly.\n\nGameplay\nAs I fought my way through the story, I began to become immersed with the lore and progression system. Bonfires are placed just when you truly need them most. Enemies are never too difficult - strong enough to warrant consistent player attention. Although the world design is fairly spectacular, it was mostly linear/bi-linear (city with a dungeon below it) with moderate exploration required for completionists. The traditionally grande map comprised of interconnecting smaller maps through shortcuts is replaced with a more direct route. However, the world is still HUGE. 19 total bosses with several mini-bosses in between. The extremely well planned level and boss design (minus a couple bosses) easily makes DS III the most memorable game I have ever played. I can clearly recount most of the paths in every area along with every bosses' movesets and shenanigans.\n\n==== Current State of the Game ====Issues & Updates\nDS III launched with quite a few minor grievances, mostly sporatic FPS drops, but all of them have been fixed. The only major issue atm is regarding softbanning due to "Data Inconsistencies" which may occur due to advancing in the game offline (de-syncing with the server) or from online hackers. Continuous patches have been applied since the posting of this review in order to keep up to date with the demanding pvp balance and bug encounters.\n\n==== Conclusion ====Verdict\nI can't stress enough how much I really enjoyed playing DS III. I really regret never playing the earlier two during their hayday, but at least it gives me something to do while i lament the end of this great journey.\n\nMasterpiece\n- 10/10","May 1","true","41.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I've heard that nvidia cards have trouble with this game, so, if you own an Nvidia card, you might want to read some of the negative reviews and patchnotes.\n\nThis game, is everything i've hoped for, it's simply amazing, no videogame is perfect, but this game is coming damn ♥♥♥♥ing close. The game could, and should be summed up with but one word ''Masterpiece''\nDark souls, which is arguably the best videogame series ever made, changed how i looked at videogames forever. the sheer detail and work that was put into it is astonishing. this was also the saddest  playthrough of a game i ever had, constantly being reminded that this is the last one, the last time i can ever experience a masterpiece like this.\n\nThe fire fades, and with it, so does dark souls. it's brave and beautiful. in dark souls we heard that the flame was dying out, in dark souls 2, the flame was still burning. but now, it's dead. the flame, the series, and the universe has come to an end. after this, there is nothing, no deus ex machina to save the day, no more hope. simply an empty void in which nothing leaves but a trace of what once was.\nThat's truly the hardest thing about dark souls, and at least miyazaki kept his word.

Instead they wanted to make the game more "casual freindly" by ruining it for both hardcore and casual fans. I honestly compare this game most to BloodBorne. The combat feels almost ripped straight from it. This is a game that has made it clear that it doesn't matter how hard you hit, all that matters is that you hit first. Almost any hit by any enemy will stagger you, causing you to have to restart your attack animation. Basically, 95% of weapons that aren't broadswords or rapiers are complete trash, because by the time you can actually get an attack off with your greatsword, an enemy will have bitten off almost half of your health. And when you do get that attack off, congrats, you took away a fifth of it's health.\nThe worst part I'd say in my opinion is enemies no longer use tactics. In DS1 enemies would try to flank you, they would time their attacks for when it's assumed that your guard is down the most. In this game, they just follow the strategy of keep attacking until you run out of stamina and are forced to take a hit. The only way to properly beat an enemy is to just keep stunlocking them and PRAY you don't run out of stamina. Meanwhile enemies can attack for years before they start to break a sweat. I was fighting a knight in the Cathedral of the Deep with a greatsword, and this guy, no joke, constantly swung his sword for a minute while I kept dodging and chipping away at his tank of a health bar. What I was trying to do was roll around him and get a cheeky backstab, but because the game's tracking is so good it's bad, that's near impossible. He just kept swinging away without a care in the world.\nThe big problem with this is it creates a disbalance in the game. In DS1, enemies had a limitation similar to you. They were limited by stamina. They may be able to go for a while, but at some point they'll run out of energy and have to stop for a Gatorade and a Powerbar. That creates a game that is always balanced. This is what people talked about when they said that Dark Souls is hard but fair. Your enemies are limited in the same way you are. That goes out the window in this game though!\nAs I said, they already had the game perfect at Dark Souls 1.

As someone who struggles to stay interested in a game for longer than a couple of hours, I've got 100+ hours clocked into DS3 and I still want to play more.\n\nA lot of my opinion on the game is based on PvE and PvE Coop (both matchmaking and password, which is a godsend), as the majority of the PvP I've done is either a pretty good matchmaking experience or I've used a password to be summoned by friends for a friendly duel. I have not experienced any issues with the online thus far, apart from a few summons being timed out, however this usually only happens once.\n\nAs with DS1, the hack 'n' slash action-RPG style gameplay is what entices me the most and allows plenty of replayability using different builds and equipment. The leveling system is the key to wielding higher-tier weapons and it feels so satisfying to come back to difficult enemies in the earlier areas to slaughter them in revenge.\n\nDark Souls III is easily one of my favourite games so far of 2016 and I'm highly anticipating the upcoming DLC.\n\nIn regards to my game time and saying I have "100+ hours clocked", I spent about 80-90 hours on a pirated copy before I was able to afford the game. I have no regrets buying the game as I believe FROM has done an outstanding job and they deserve my money as I've enjoyed this game quite a lot. I just thought I'd write this for anyone who cares.","May 20","true","45.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's so much to it that I am sure there is still more to find in future playthroughs. I feel like it is definitely an improvement over Dark Souls II. Having said that there are some things that confused me. Some characters make reappearances from the first game and unless I missed something, I don't understand how it's possible. I get that the reality of the world is "changing" but it felt like a lot of fanservice at times. The soundtrack is amazing and the environment is great as always. Combat is fun, really like the weapon skills they added as well as the Focus Bar. Most boss fights are easy but they are REALLY cool, and the ones that aren't easy give you an experience you won't forget. FROM has a history of putting out great DLC so it'd be interesting to see what kind of lore is yet to be discovered.","May 1","true","147.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

Keeping things short, I will just list some pros and cons. This is by no means a conclusive review, but these are the things that stood out to me.\n\n- Enviroments are wonderful to look at and explore. While most areas within themselves are pretty non-linear, the ways that the areas connect to each other seem very linear, with few exceptions.\n\n- The lack of power stances, while annyoing, seems to be replaced by weapon abilites. These abilities do add some awesome depth, and many unique weapons and shields have unique abilities. This is on top of the large amount of unique weapons and armor that you can find in the game.\n\n- Hitboxes in this game seem far more accurate than the second game. The moments when you dodge hard hitting boss attacks just by sidestepping attacks is far more satisfying than constantly having to dodge huge invisible weapon hitboxes. Combat is tighter than ever in this title, making PvP all the more enjoyable.\n\n- While some areas in the game feel cheap as f^*&, everything is surmountable. It just makes the feeling of satisfaction all the more palpable.","May 17","true","107.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Be wary of praise the sun and don't give up, skeleton!\n\nI absolutelly loved the third part of the series. It was as unexpected, as pleasant to find out that devs are working on it and I spent my fair share of hours in this game and I must say that it adds plenty of variaty to PVP and gameplay itself. All the old elements are still present, devs even ressurected some from long forgotten "Demon Souls" and brought them back to life in third part (Like FP bar, etc)... And it does offer a good degree of challanging gameplay, exploration freedom and player's activities. The one thing that I did not liked so far, is that game servers are probably REALLY loaded right now and most player encounters ends in awkward "Fight" with your opponent's levitating standing animation, where you have no idea if he is attacking, casting a spell on you, blocking, dodging or what. All you see is this awkward flying аsshоlе, standing still, surrounded by mistery of his future actions. But besides that little detail, the game is good and I do recommend you to buy it.

Most every aspect of this game is enjoyable, in a frusterating way.\n\nThis game is also one of the most rewarding games I have ever played, this game will kick you when you are down, and you will have to try and do everything to get your place (and your souls) back. But once you do, you taste the sweet revenge that you were seeking, which fuels you to play for another two more hours.\n\nI just finished the game, and it took me about 50 hours, and that is just for the very first save, now that I have beat the game, I have the option of playing NG+, which allows me to play through the game with my character, but with a new story. Mind blowing.\n\nI would reccommend this game wholeheartedly to anyone who enjoys a great game that they can sit down and play for hours at a time.\n\nBut there is also one thing that I would like to touch on...\n\nAlthough, the multiplayer aspect of the game is interesting, it is also quite flawed.\n\nThe idea behind the multiplayer is nice, you can put down a summon scroll and help someone else in their world, or if you want to play with a friend, you can put on a password and summon them. That is awesome! Although you require consumables to spawn in people (which I personally don't like), that is fine.\n\nBut the invasions in the game are very annoying. You are forced to go into someone else's world, and fight them, for barely anything in return, and this can happen at most any time assuming you are playing with online enabled.\n\nThis also happens when you are playing with friends, up to two people can come into your world, disrupt what you are doing, and destroy you, completely halting your progress. This is without a doubt very annoying, and although it is a small flaw in an otherwise flawless game, the flaw is very very bad in my opinion.\n\nTL;DR: Best Action/Adventure game I have ever played, this game is amazing! If you have friends, I would reccommend you and them pick this up and play with eachother, or solo for that matter. Multiplayer is slightly flawed, but beyond that I couldn't reccommend this game enough!\n\n9/10","May 29","true","62.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

The environments are all varied and gorgeous, the combat feels amazing and the new weapon art system adds a new layer of depth.\n\nThe game is difficult. Of course that is subjective, but in my experience I had a fairly difficult time with at least half the bosses, a select few taking over ten tries each.\n\nBut, most importantly, there are the bosses. In my opinion there were no bad bosses in this game at all. Each boss now has a first and second stage which creates some of the best boss fights that i've experienced in video games.\n\nLast but definitely not least is the soundtrack. Some of the tracks may not be as memorable as some of the ones in the original Dark Souls but especially once you get to the later game content it will blow you away. Everything from epic choirs chanting, violins, horns and there's even a harpsichord in some of the pieces. One of the pieces has the harpsichord as it's main instrument which you barely see these days.\n\nAll in all, this is definetly one of my favorite games of all time.

I strated playing the first game out of the three in 2013 and finished it twice (on PC and on XBOX 360). While playing  Dark Souls 1	 I became obsessed with the game and loved every single thing about it. Then, in 2014  Dark Souls 2	 was born and a new saga began to the  Dark Souls	 searies. I have played the second game the second it came out and I finished it a week after, and to be honest, it wasn't a blast. I had fun time playing it, but it was just not like the first game.\nAnd then, Dark Souls 3	 showed himself to the world in 2016...........\n\nCurrent State in Dark Souls 3\nIn the middle of the second playtrough with a new character. Playing a lot of PvP with the first character after finishing the game and grinding to level 120 (PvP Meta).\n\nMy Opinion\nFirst Cutcene\nWhen I launched the game for the first time I was so happy to go back into the world of  Dark Souls	, the menu screen, the sounds, everything was exactly like good old  Dark Souls	. Then, the first cutscene started (and with it the goosebumps ^^) and god.... oh god the voice acting in this game is just... SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GOOD! Already in the first cutscene you hear an old woman's voice telling you about the history of a place called  Lothric	 and while hearing the woman's voice you see characters and lords that you know, you are going to meet and probably fight.\n\nFirst Gameplay and Boss Impression\nThe gameplay starts, and you pick up your Ashen Flask after killing a bunch of dudes and then you light the first bonefire, wasn't so hard right? Meeting the first boss 2 second later gives you that breathtaking feeling that you are fighting against a gigantic armored guy that got some cool moves. After few tries you manage to take him down to half health and you see  phase 2	, and oh god, that is just terrifying!  Some dark creature is just cracking his way up from that guy	 and you need to fight against it! After managing to take that thing down you fully walk into.... the world of Dark Souls 3!\n\n40 Hours Into the Game\nYou are geared up, got your own playstyle with unique swords and spells and you crawl deeper into the dark lore meeting up glorious and scary bosses. In your journey you get to choose things that will affect the end that you will get (  there are 3 endings to the game and another special end	 ) and to be honest, on my first playthrough, I didn't knew what I was actualy picking (Blind playthrough) but at the end I figured it out.\n\nOverall Rating\nStory: 8/10 - 	 I realy love the  Dark Souls	 franchise lore (the things I know about it...) but I didn't like it so much how the developers delivered it in the third game. there are a lot of NPC questline that you most likely missed on your first playthrough and how the lore is being told... it is too foggy in my opinion.\n\nSounds (Music and Voice Acting) : 10/10 -  The music in this game just matches so good into some situations and the voice acting is amazing.\n\nGameplay and Mechanics  (Xbox 360 Controller) : 9/10 - 	I realy enjoyed how the game is being played and the new weapon arts is just great. I was sad to see that they took down the dual wielding stance and some of the mechanics are just hiddin inside the game and you only realise them when watching a toutorial or by accident.\n\nPvP and Online Matchmaking: 8/10 -	  Dark Souls 3	 is the first Dark Souls game I started playing PvP and I having super fun with it. The problem is that some of the weapons are just not balanced enough and the hitbox can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ sometimes.\n\nGraphics and Sceneries: 10/10 - 	The game looks great and most of the sceneries are so amazingly good (  Irithyll of the boreal valley	 was just so beautiful ).\n\n\nThis was my first review, hope you guys liked it :)","May 29","true","126.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Abbadabadon/recommended/374320/","Abbadabadon","Toast Of Doom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Abbadabadon/","95 products in account","I constantly ask myself this same question when playing DSIII...\nHow the ♥♥♥♥ do you really ♥♥♥♥ up Dark Souls this badly?!\nIt's something that I seriously wonder because in almost everyone's opinion, Dark Souls was perfect at DS1, all they had to do was polish it up and fix some of the bugs! Instead they wanted to make the game more "casual freindly" by ruining it for both hardcore and casual fans. I honestly compare this game most to BloodBorne. The combat feels almost ripped straight from it. This is a game that has made it clear that it doesn't matter how hard you hit, all that matters is that you hit first. Almost any hit by any enemy will stagger you, causing you to have to restart your attack animation. Basically, 95% of weapons that aren't broadswords or rapiers are complete trash, because by the time you can actually get an attack off with your greatsword, an enemy will have bitten off almost half of your health. And when you do get that attack off, congrats, you took away a fifth of it's health.\nThe worst part I'd say in my opinion is enemies no longer use tactics. In DS1 enemies would try to flank you, they would time their attacks for when it's assumed that your guard is down the most. In this game, they just follow the strategy of keep attacking until you run out of stamina and are forced to take a hit. The only way to properly beat an enemy is to just keep stunlocking them and PRAY you don't run out of stamina. Meanwhile enemies can attack for years before they start to break a sweat. I was fighting a knight in the Cathedral of the Deep with a greatsword, and this guy, no joke, constantly swung his sword for a minute while I kept dodging and chipping away at his tank of a health bar. What I was trying to do was roll around him and get a cheeky backstab, but because the game's tracking is so good it's bad, that's near impossible. He just kept swinging away without a care in the world.\nThe big problem with this is it creates a disbalance in the game. In DS1, enemies had a limitation similar to you. They were limited by stamina. They may be able to go for a while, but at some point they'll run out of energy and have to stop for a Gatorade and a Powerbar. That creates a game that is always balanced. This is what people talked about when they said that Dark Souls is hard but fair. Your enemies are limited in the same way you are. That goes out the window in this game though!\nAs I said, they already had the game perfect at Dark Souls 1. All they had to do was polish it up and fix some bugs, maybe a few balancing tweeks here and there, get some good servers, and that was it. Instead they tried to make BloodBorne 2.5 and failed at it because they forgot what made Dark Souls great.","April 26","false","84.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Never have I been forced to stop spamming dodge/attack and actually learn the moveset of the boss or perfect my reaction time. It took me approximately 2 hours to beat Iudex as a starting Mercenary, but the thrill and adrenaline post-battle was truly something no other game offered. I never thought I could come to love a game that wanted to kill me so badly.\n\nGameplay\nAs I fought my way through the story, I began to become immersed with the lore and progression system. Bonfires are placed just when you truly need them most. Enemies are never too difficult - strong enough to warrant consistent player attention. Although the world design is fairly spectacular, it was mostly linear/bi-linear (city with a dungeon below it) with moderate exploration required for completionists. The traditionally grande map comprised of interconnecting smaller maps through shortcuts is replaced with a more direct route. However, the world is still HUGE. 19 total bosses with several mini-bosses in between. The extremely well planned level and boss design (minus a couple bosses) easily makes DS III the most memorable game I have ever played. I can clearly recount most of the paths in every area along with every bosses' movesets and shenanigans.\n\n==== Current State of the Game ====Issues & Updates\nDS III launched with quite a few minor grievances, mostly sporatic FPS drops, but all of them have been fixed. The only major issue atm is regarding softbanning due to "Data Inconsistencies" which may occur due to advancing in the game offline (de-syncing with the server) or from online hackers. Continuous patches have been applied since the posting of this review in order to keep up to date with the demanding pvp balance and bug encounters.\n\n==== Conclusion ====Verdict\nI can't stress enough how much I really enjoyed playing DS III. I really regret never playing the earlier two during their hayday, but at least it gives me something to do while i lament the end of this great journey.\n\nMasterpiece\n- 10/10","May 1","true","41.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

And the online play was really wonky, which made a huge negative impact on my review of it. The story of the player\'s journey made it a memorable experience though.\n\nThe second game fixed the frame rate, maxing out at 60fps, which made for a much smoother game. The problem is, the multiplayer was still really messed up, it allowed messages and blood pools to be accessed, but no online help during boss fights. And the bosses were totally unoriginal, many having similar characteristics to either another boss in DS1, or even another boss in the same game. The second game also removed the dark, creepy atmosphere which really killed the game. DS2, in my OPINION, was the worst of the series and the worst game I\'ve played in years mainly because the health system.\n\nThe Review of Dark Souls III:\n\nI absolutely LOVE this game! It is everything the first two games tried to be, but not without its flaws, of course. They have improved multiplayer connectivity, making for easy summoning. A flaw to this though is that the area I am currently in, I can\'t be embered and take more than two steps without being invaded (If you are looking into buying the game, you probably don\'t know what ember is, if you\'ve played the first game, it is similar to humanity, or the second game\'s human effigies. If you ember, it increases your health to max, adding about 25% more to the bar. It also allows you to summon other players and get invaded) The boss fights are actually fun again.\n\nMy favorite thing to do is help people get past bosses. I\'ve been helping so many people get past the tree boss fight in undead settlement.\n\nIf you want to know, my character name is Lord Kool Kat, so if you raid me, make sure to say hi first!!!\n\nAlso, please, if you are a mage build, don\'t be a total c*nt... What I mean by that is, don\'t hide yourself in a big group of enemies just so you don\'t get your *** kicked. It is cheap and annoying.\n\nHuge tip for new players:\nRound your character out. I suggest starting as either a knight or a warrior and then learning magic and all that. It will help in the long run!","June 1","true","35.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Poise isn't just turned off, that'd be nice. They could fix that. Poise is an almost useless stat that effectively makes a full havels user with 69.9 weight ratio, a tower shield and a wolf ring...The most agile character in the game.\n\nWeapons are pretty pisspoor balanced, and currently you have a god-tier. An 'okay but why' tier, and a huge mass of junk. Junk includes all magic that's not pyromancy as well. And all ranged weapons. Its sad when I feel like throwing knives are...better then a bow or crossbow.\n\nThe game's high points are early with few exceptions. (Farron Keep felt like the last...really awesome and exciting area...and HIgh Wall of Lothric...the first actual zone, is the most difficult of the lot. Somehow.)\n\nThe game is extraordinarily linear. With two total 'branches', and in addition a grand total of two 'sideroutes', one is a brief Demon Ruin zone...that somehow makes hte original Demon Ruins look like fun.\n\nThe other is... King's Gardens (or something like that) a tiny, tiny area. Untended Graves (The neatest of the optional areas, led to by King's Gardens...but it's also tiny as...its smaller than the tutorial zone.)\n\nAnd finally, Archdragon Peak. an actual decent sized zone that's I guess kind of a weird Sen's Fortress but meh area. Its only distinct as alot of people die to it. It's mostly useful for farming crafting components and souls. Basically having whole areas expressly set up to enable that. Its okay, though. Not bad. Decent area, if unremarkable. The boss has a great track for it though.\n\nThe game...Dark Souls 3 I can't reccomend right now. In total. It's a mess. Its filled with cheaters, bugs and broken issues. I thought DkS2 was dissapointing until Scholars launched. I thought it was pretty much an awful mess. Then came DkS3. I don't know. I'm pretty unhappy so far--I reccomend, it, likely, in the future. If From actually works on it.","May 19","false","181.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I thought after several weeks/months these issues would have been resolved, but even at low settings I am frequently dropping to 12-15 fps. To make matters worse, the game won't allow you to play in online mode with a low framerate. Your game session also terminates if your framerate falls too far. The entire UI is obviously designed for console users, and there isn't even a quit to desktop function. You have to exit from the main menu.\n\nOther than that, the game is itself is pretty fun. The difficulty is what you would expect, and the sword play is faster than Dark Souls II.\n\nI just can't recommend the game due to its bugginess.

It basically retrieved and improved the best aspects from the previous games, and took care of the bad ones, creating the perfect mix beetwen the two.\n\nThe biggest improvements were made in combat, and with combat being the most important aspect in the game, that's a damn good thing.\nThe biggest innovation is the introduction of "Skills" AKA "Weapon Arts". Those are special attacks with unique properties, specific to each weapon type (for example. straight swords let you perform attack that breaks the enemy's guard when blocking, allowing for devastating critical attack). Those are of various usefulness though (patches may fix that), but still, they provide new interesting options during combat.\nThe combat in general is much faster than it was in previous releases. The attacks are swifter, deal more damage, and require more finesse to use. Backstabbing and parrying mechanics are much more intuitive and are more based on skill and timing, rather than luck and "fishing" (alternatively, using lag to your advantage).\nOther than that, the combat is largely the way it was before, without special revelations.\n\nThere are still certain issues with game balance that weren't taken care of, however. Swift weapons, such as rapiers and straight swords, are still the bane of most players, since all it takes to defeat your enemy is spamming the same attack over and over again. A common tactics is buffing such weapon with magic and watching your enemy die in agony, locked in an endless barrage of swift hits. While veteran players know how to counter it quite reliably, new players are pretty much helpless against it and have no real chance of winning.\n\nAside from that, it's still the same old Dark Souls we know and love/hate, so there's no point in detailing the rest. The game is still surrounded by that peculiar aura of mystery and despair. The soundtrack is amazing once again, and there are many new, charming NPCs you will definitely grow attached to.\n\nMy only issue with the game is that it's too short. Completing it takes about 20 hours, which is half the time it would take fo finish the first game. But that will definitely change when they release the DLCs, and the replay value already more than makes up for the short length of the game.\nWhile I think Dark Souls 3 is superior to Dark Souls 2, I can't say whether I preffer it to the first one, since it no longer gave me the same feeling of being lost and overwhelmed I felt when first playing DS1, and I dobut any other game will manage to imitate the effect.\nFor me, it's a solid 9,5/10.\n\n","May 11","true","160.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Both valve(I understand they don't have to) and fromSoft refuse to do anything about the cheaters who have been running around in this game. Having put in a ticket with both steam and bamco about this I basically got a whole lot of f*uck you in response. Cheats since last I played outside of 5 mins ago to see if anything changed(well over a month ago at this point) fake phantoms that serve as dmg sponges, the usual infinite health/stamina, and the most annoying of all being one that will actually get you softbanned by fromSoft. These are still a thing. What makes it so bad was that these cheats started popping up around 2 or so weeks after the game came out...\n\nThe rest of this review is based on my own personal feelings as someone who has played as sorcery based classes since demon souls. As for the actual gameplay my major complaint, besides enemies following the tired formula of have infiite stamina to bash you with, is how bad sorcery has it this time around. No one was asking for from to make the game easy for us(don't understand how it ever was. Dodging skills were a must in agressive boss fights and pvp). However with 90% of the bosses in this game being aggressive and spells damage being nerfed hard, it makes boss fight needlessly difficult and maybe even a little unfair. Playing as melee, Spell damage has been given really odd base requirements before the it become decent. Starting at 60 int is where you'll start to see the damage accel at. Keep in mind that in previous souls game you maxed out at 60 if you were hardcore sorcery otherwise 50 was perfectly fine at you're still dangerous. Remember how soul spear and the crystal spells(bar homing crystal in dks1) were good? Yeah not so much in this game. Incredibly slow and in most cases outclassed by the arrow spells. I started the game as a spellsword thanks to some people on reddit I was able to see just how jacked sorcery really was. To start  my Dex was 25 and int 15 with base class being merc. Casting magic weapon wields an extra 50 points of dmg at best. I don't remember these results in the first 2 games. In DK1 with mild point allocation I remember seeing around 100 points of extra damage on an unupgraded weapon. In this game I deal with one swing 200~210 per swing on a normal enemy with a +3 Uchi. Respec to 31 dex and 21 int damage went from 263 to 290 with magic weapon. This was done as apparently you don't see minor returns on int until at least 20. So that's my opinion on this game from a spell slinger pov. I wanted to love this game. Really I did. But I have completely lost faith in from's ability to make an anti-cheat system that's worth a damn and that sorcery will stop being completely eclipsed by other styles of play.","June 5","false","56.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Mod's keep locking discussion of it on both steam forums and reddit.  Here is some screen grabs of the threads.\nhttp://tinypic.com/r/zqryd/9  https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4gcp89/poise_stat_works/\nWhy the response from mods and the dev team is to seemingly cover this up is suspicious as hell.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  From Soft is acting shady as hell and not supporting the PC version at all.  From Soft used to be my favorite dev(before dark souls 2) and while this game is markedly better than ds2 their treatement of the consumer base is disgusting.  They've lost my Business forever.\n\n**Original Review**\n\nCurrently the game is in a bad state with loads of crashes and no response from the developer.  I exceed the recomended spec's and get consistent crashes in specific spots every time now, its weird because these are places I was able to pass by earlier but got a random crash there and its like the game hardcodes the crash into the game so now its automatic every time I go to these places.  One such instance is now a boss fight which means I can not progress untill the issue is solved.  Get your ♥♥♥♥ together from soft.\n\nnetcode is still garbage, roll the dice in pvp to see if you're going to be able to actually judge what the other person is doing or if they're going to suprise you with lag ♥♥♥♥ery.\n\ntwice i've had the game cheat me out of boss wins due to its terrible coding.\nFirst while fighting the Dancer I repeatedly attacked her and had my attacks bounce off her as if I were hitting a wall or something and doing no damage.  I got her down to almost nothing before dying, had the attacks I would have landed if not for this bug actually went through I would have killed her before then.  I had to then go on to fight her for like another hour before beating her finally.  Here's proof. https://www.twitch.tv/ultrakrampus/v/60612659\n\nSecond while fighting Champion Gundyr when the boss was at critical health the bug that gets a random input stuck(so say you run in one direction without pressing the button and if you press another direction your character freezes in place) prevented me from moving as I was trying to move in the opposite direction, this got me killed.  GG fromsoft and by GG I mean GIT GUD.\n\nThe story delivery and writing are also amateur as ♥♥♥♥.  Game assumes you're going to be doing all this ♥♥♥♥.  "Oh youll be needing to go here and do this and this."  Why?  why would you assume I would even care?  They do no work to set up why you would have any motivation to do this the only motivation to play the game is becasue its a souls game and you want to murder things.","April 12","false","149.6"," 29 of 55 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","29","55","0","2"

I don't see myself pouring thousands of hours into this game like the previous ones, hell I'm barely breaking bloodborne hours right now and this is way better than that thing sitting on my ps4. Was pretty fun the first week though, lots of summons and invasions, everyone was experimenting, but now it's all meta: gr8 swords, spear, or estoc. No variety, no fun moves. Pve is pretty eh too, plays fine, I suppose, but isn't pulling me into it. Enemy aggression is bipolar, drop rates, at least for me, despite buffing the stat, are abysmal. Seriously, 2 hours trying to get a machete just to try it. Sub optimal. I'm sure plenty of folks will love this game though, just like with bloodborne, just like with 2, yada-yada. If you started later in the series, or with bb (the mistake) then you'll love this, if you started with one, eh, you'll still probably like it. Not for me though. I'll try and sum it up below.\n\nEnemy aggression: honestly, they're either going ham or they're motionless, seemingly regardless of my position in relation to them. Checked streamers, youtube, everyone elses game seems fine, but my world is always like this. Who knows.\n\nDrop rates: several hours for a machete, several more for a dagger in the woods, tons waiting for a silver knight shield, only to find out the items above weren't even worth it. For real, long sword + Lothric knight shield is all you'll need, nothing comes close to that combos usefulness. Even the cool quickstep ♥♥♥♥♥ is weak in comparison and that ♥♥♥♥♥ is cool af.\n\nhackers: summoned a few without knowing, invaded a few without knowing, was invaded by a few without knowing. Tell tale sign for anyone interested, they won't have a walk animation, they'll just sorta...float around. This is also sign of a ♥♥♥♥♥ connection though, so be wary. Pro-tip, don't pvp right now, if you wanna co-op, use a password with one friend, any more than that and you'll be invaded.\n\noddly short: now most souls games can be speed run pretty swiftly, like DKS2 unpatched can be done in like twenty minutes. This thing...about an hour, hour and a half, potentially less post NG simply due to how many bosses are, well, optional. Which is fine, but that alone is pretty bloodborne-y and well I hated that game so lets leave it at that.\n\nMeta: whether in pvp or pve you'll hit a wall with what is useful vs what is fun. Useful: longsword and a 100% melee cut shield. What's fun, manakin claws (holy ♥♥♥♥, dude) but sadly, not useful. As you level up even the infusions are ♥♥♥♥-poor: heavy and sharp are a joke compared to quality (usually) raw is useless as the pure damage up is still less than the BASE scaling benefits (literally at lvl 1 a raw longsword is weaker than a standard longsword due to the scaling. If you infuse it with quality scaling it becomes even more of a joke). Fire and Deep are useless as there are scaling based alternatives, and how defenses work with enemies in the game you may as well, again, just use quality or no infusion at all and just apply buff items. Pvp-wise, hope you like the estoc and greatswords because that is literally all you'll see outside of the occasional spear. Oh, and the target shield, everyone has one of those. Maybe as things get patched the metas will lessen but I highly doubt it as DKS1 and DKS2 metas are still going strong years later.\n\nUpped AI + upped damage: now, upgraded enemy AI is the thing of dreams, it makes enemies plan their attacks, strafe, parry, riposte, backstab, backpeddle to heal or get allies, lure you, use consumable ffs, it's amazing, but you know what isn't? Getting run over by a truck then it gliding away in a very graceful animation that messes with my emotions. A key feature I feel has been lost to FROM was that enemy placement and moveset variety are what made their enemies hard, making them hit like trucks is what made bloodborne a joke. Especially when you get into the flailing type enemies, which are most of the humanoid ones, as they hit like trucks and stunlock you...as there is no poise system. Who knows though, maybe this is due to me trying to use some of those nifty armor sets FROM litered the game with...perhaps I was supposed to just wear the knights set on every character forever.\n\nPoise: you've probably seen this pop up a bit, poise isn't in the game. Armor has a poise rating, but...well, it means about as much as my review does: nothing. You might as well just fashion it up and cross your fingers that you don't get hit by a combo. There is a way to bypass this: greatswords. They give you hyper armor, which can act like poise as it keeps you stable midswing even if you're getting jumped by several enemies...just hope you have enough HP (trucks *cough* trucks).\n\nUseless weapons: mentioned this in the meta section, but it requires restating, almost every weapon you pick up will be inferior to something like the longsword or battleaxe (hell even some battleaxes are useless too!) they're either too big to handle in most environments, too short to effectively reach enemies (despite the sick af quickstep or other unique weapon arts) or they're just not practical (i.e. consume huge amounts of stamina per swing or just don't deal enough damage compared to their atk time and stamina use). In other words, your starting gear will be the best gear unless you aren't the knight or herald (arguably the assassin too).\n\nWeapon arts: they killed dual wielding for this? I don't think I've touched the weapon arts for most weapons since I picked them up for the first time: they're useless. The longswords? Breaks guards...so does the kick. The estocs pierces shields (but can be parried) just kick (no parries). Some shields only let you use weapon arts (great for the quickstep...and the like three weapons which use it...the most useful weapon art in the game...) some let you parry (the small shields) and some let you try (the mid shields) others..well...you sorta give a shove with them...often really slowly and incredibly telegraphed.\n\nQuickstep: jfc this is only on a handful of weapons yet it is singlehandedly the best weaponart in the game, it lets you dash right after the strike period of an animation (something you can't do with the roll) and it also keeps you close to your target. It's fabulous but also only on the worst weapons: three daggers, and a claw set (as far as I've found). Seriously, give me a weapon with better damage, or reach, or SCALING ffs that uses it.\n\nHeal aid: you can cast this basic heal spell with 8 faith...but the lowest req talisman is 10 faith... (not multi faceted catalsyts, kids, those are too late into things for this to still be useful outside of low HP runs) . Seems like an oversight, at the very least.\n\nLet's talk about some nice things though, people like those...well, not on the internet anyway.\n\nLevel design is nice, got a lotta' quick pathes you can take to speedrun this thing. Animations are nice, usually, like when you dash with the quickstep (I'm salty) or roll off the ground b/c that carried over from BB...not so much though when a sitting enemy you ambushed is, mid attack by you, suddenly on their feet and unleashing a several hit combo that you can no longer get out of because your two attacks are qued ahead of your roll (because that wasn't annoying in the earlier games) particularly annoying when combined with the ever present incorrect input read (remember that from Dark Souls 1? I do. It's here now too, yay!) Mind you, it could be that literally all four of the controllers I have available suffer from some odd software/hardware issue, but I kinda doubt that as they work fine elsewhere (games and console) yay FROM you never cease to...find a way to rehash even old mechanical errors.\n\nWell...I guess I didn't really have anything nice to say...uh...it looks...nice? I guess? But that's sorta just what happens when a series progresses: get prettier, polish mechanics, and try not to ♥♥♥♥ it all up.","May 6","true","185.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sofacykel/recommended/374320/","Sofacykel","Sofacykel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sofacykel/","209 products in account","Dark Souls III is a good game in and of itself. Exploration is a huge part of the journey and the reason a first playthrough takes so many hours. Scanning every nook and cranny, dying horribly to everything and starting over.\n\nPC port runs excellent on my system (i5 4690k, 16GB, GTX 970). I've probably experienced 2 crashes in the 80 or so hours I've been playing.\n\nLevel design is remarkable, though I did note a trend in "This door doesn't open from this side" spoilering an obvious shortcut later. A bit too many bonfires for my taste too, I'd like if everything was as interconnected as the Cathedral, which reminded me so much of Dark Souls 1 and how everything just lead to everything there. Sadly From kept the Teleport ability from Dark Souls 2 from the beginning of the game making it all feel *really* disconnected. Sure you can see where you're going in the distance, but for the most part in Dark Souls 1 you could just walk there. You will be teleporting a lot in 3 and that's really unfortunate, but I guess it is to be expected since the story wants you to go on this grand journey to fetch all these lords from different places... Still, getting around felt disconnected and was always interrupted by a loading screen.\n\nThat being said I don't really agree with the direction From seems to force combat. Longsword is by far the best weapon throughout the game PvE-wise. Magic has been nerfed to hell and back from DS1 and DS2 (though they were broken in 1). Poise effects are completely nonexistent (actually missing, bug?) forcing everyone into a dance of neverending rolls or betting heavily on hyperarmor during heavy weapon swings. PvP is cool, but it's a mess currently with only very few totally viable weapons and combinations, and the Estoc being the bane of everyone not running a parry build.\n\nInvasion are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Someone coming to screw with your hard-earned progress, cool. Letting people trade end-game items to level 10's, not cool. Getting ganged up on by 2 invaders simultaneously 'cause the game feels like ♥♥♥♥ing you over... Multiple times... Getting invaded by a guy with the 3-shot crossbow of doom when I'm at the very beginning of the High Wall on my second (non-NG+) playthrough is just... Bad design. "Git gut" I guess, but it just shows the developers lack understanding of what makes a great game. Make it fair for both parties, always. As of now you might aswell just cut the cord when you get invaded 'cause there's little to no reward in defeating the invader anyway except being free from further invasions for 5 silly minutes.\n\nPvP aside, PvE has become way more fast-paced than earlier games in the series. In DS1 and DS2 (and Demon's Souls for that matter) we had well-telegraphed attacks from every creature. Relatively predictable timings on swings, a fair amount of stamina to break if so desired and everything was good. In DS3 every freaking undead has been practicing some kind of Kung Fu arts in the mountains of China. Combos are often 6-7 hits, attacks are seemingly neverending, the homing on some attacks are extremely unforgiving and some attacks just feel like cheap underhand slaps to the face with zero buildup. That's all fun and games when enemies like that are fairly few and far between (Black Knights in DS1), but when they're everywhere in the game it gets a bit tedious and frankly un-fun. In the older games only big and scary dudes could swing their massive weapons with little to no effort, but just look at the fat ladies in the Undead Settlement and tell me they're well designed from a melee standpoint.\n\nThe way I see it, it suffers from being made by the same guys that made Bloodborne. While Bloodborne is a very good game it isn't Dark Souls, you don't have a fast action shotgun as your sidearm, you have another blade, a shield, a stick or a flaming hand. They sped up combat way too much and the game suffers greatly from it. Again, it *is* a good game, I just wish it would've had a bit better pacing and PvP.\n\nDo I recommend it? Sure. Get a controller and it's a really solid game. Is it the best From Software has made to date? No, not by a long shot. To me, and I know this is treacherous, even 2 had better combat pacing, but 1 is definitely the darling. If you enjoyed Bloodborne you'll probably find yourself right at home here, but it's missing some of the "flow" of Dark Souls in my opinion. Arbitrary score: 8/10, very good game.","May 6","true","92.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Streaming and Youtubers also ran into issues like this before release - so From and Bandia Namco has warning.\n\nDO NOT BUY UNTIL GAME IS FIXED - DO NOT REWARD SHODDY PORT JOBS OF ANY KIND!!!\n\n\nEDIT - For each step forward from the last one (DS2), there are one and perhaps two steps back.  I would not even know where to begin, but the game, in some ways, is as badly designed as 2 was.  DeS was great, and DS1 was also great, if less so and more so at the same time.  2 was a disapointment to me, and now 3 is as well.  However, where we could blame problems with 2 on the fact that it was the "B team" at FROM, we cannot do that here.  Also - after 2, you knew there would be a 3, so atleast you had sequal to hope would be better - yet now we cannot hope for such a thing.\n\nSimply put - DS3 is DS2+BB, with some (not enough) minor flirting with DeS, and has almost nothing to do with DS1 no matter how you choose to look at it.  So, if that sounds like a great thing to you, then by all means, but I cannot recomend this game to anyone.  It'sa big let down (some will find it unfairly hard and irritating -hard for the sake of hard/un souls like- if they build one of several ways, a few other ways make the game FAR too easy), and as of even this edit, the game is still a buggy mess (graphics crap mentioned above, items not working, PVP is a mess, etc).\n\nFanboys will like anything FROM shoves out, but some of us liked DeS and DS for reason that go beyond what tryhards blindly worship (because they are probably losers in real life).\n\n\nNotice - I will NOT be replying to any replies, and I am not going to update this again.  You may see me playing sometimes, because I have an addictive personality.

The ammount of variety will keep the game fresh and interesting for years to come, not to mention the addicting PVP online play and unique co-op that is deliciously unpredictable. The challenge of the game makes you want to be better and rewards you for doing so, and expolration for secret areas are laden with diffculty and epic loot. If you're new to the Souls series or a returning champion, this is the game for you. If you're up to the challenge then absolutley get this game. I would not be suprized if this won game of the year for 2016.\n\n~ PRAISE THE SOUP! ~","April 25","true","61.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And yet Dark Souls 3 is also the least interesting Dark Souls game because there are few weird and strange enemy and encounters.  I love Dark Souls because you must defeat difficult enemy by learning the game and taking risks so you can be rewarded. Well, Dark Souls 3 doesn't have many super difficult enemy, most of the game is pretty similar and there very few interesting rewards.\n\nUnlike in Dark Souls 1 & 2, I wouldn't say playing online is recommended anymore. There is maybe two or three difficult bosses if you are offline only.  When you are playing online in "ember" form (aka human-form or unhollowed), you rarely get invaded and you can easily summon skilled players to be your allies so you can destroy any invader & boss. It's not interesting when you summon a Sunbro ally who defeats the boss while you watch. I would have to place my summon sign so I could help others defeat that boss a few times so I could feel some satisfaction from the boss fight. And as always, using a gamepad is strongly recommended.\n\nTL;DR Dark Souls is more Dark Souls and I cannot say I didn't enjoy Dark Souls 3 even though it is the least interesting Dark Souls game. For Dark Souls newbies I would recommend you try Dark Souls 2, maybe Dark Souls 1 if you want a challenge. And for Dark Souls Veterans:\n\nPro- The world is more open than DS2 (less linear)\n- Weapons are very balanced\n- convenant variety\n- offline friendly\n- very few rage inducing enemy\n\nCons- very few rage inducing enemy\n- the easiest Dark Souls game\n- the shortest Dark Souls game\n- The least variety of Bosses\n- there aren't any serious consequences to the covenants\n- All magic is mostly useless for damage until you have very high-level sorcery\n- Magic is far too slow for PvP\n- online friendly - a few connectivity improvements since DS2\n- The world isn't as open as DS1\n- Camera is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥","May 10","true","58.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Absolutely. Spoiler free review.\n\nThe great- Stunning and smart level design, there are ALWAYS clues for the secrets if you pay attention, there is often a more convenient and less obvious path to take.\n- Bosses: mostly different from each other, multiple phases. Very few bosses gave me real trouble as a solo player, while still being fair fights. Praise the lack of gank squads!\n- Soundtrack, what else to say?\n- It took me over 50 hours to finish the first run, 50!\n\nThe good- Enemy AI. The PvE offers a good challenge also outside of bosses: knights won't let you circle around them as easily, they will tackle you differently depending on their weapons and your offensive/defensive stance, while beasts will mindlessly rush you down and screw your life if they get an opening.\n- Tons of weapons and armors, many new infusions for every kind of build.\n- High amount of references and throwbacks.\n- Very populated online, it had some problems in the beginning but it seems stable at this point. There is an easy password system to engage in jolly co-operation with your friends of any level.\n- Weapon arts are the cherry on top of my favourite ARPG combat system ever.\n\nThe "meh"- Too many references? Too much fanservice? I personally enjoyed all of them, but your mileage may vary.\n\nThe bad- PvP balance and poise: pretty much every heavy weapon can be parried and poise doesn't work (actually, it does but it's bad), so running tanky builds will get you nowhere in a world ruled by rapiers and short swords.\n\nWe didn't get Bloodborne on PC, we got this instead. PvE is a 10/10 and I recommend it at full price, but people who live for PvP may not have their best time here.","May 5","true","57.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
