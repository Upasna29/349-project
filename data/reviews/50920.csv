It means that while you have a story, you're just going from list of items to list of items. Here, you're still an adventurer but you're in South America, as the title is suggesting.\n\nAnd when you're thinking about this era, it means lots of items in the scene, with some being well hidden without forgetting a number of hints instead of it being resplenished. You can also get more of them by finding insects (5 of them are hidden but not at the same place). It means also random list as every playthrough is different. And generally, that era was also setting high scores.\n\nWhile I'm more inclined to play the new generation of HO, that are mixing adventure, puzzles and HO scenes, I must say that I still have good moments with the old generation. However, for those that never played them before, it may appear as boring as hell. The graphics are correct, like the soundtrack, but I must admit that you're quickly fed up of the lists after a moment, even me that played Mystery P.I. or the other Hidden Expedition in retail.\n\nDespite that, it's like retro-gaming or playing an old Doom, you enjoy these memories of another era. Or it's nice to know where the genre comes from. Anyway, while I admit that 10 euros is maybe a little too much for the game now - and that you may never see a discount, the game is still worthy. And thanks to Tristetea for the gift too else I wouldn't have played that entry that is missing in my retail collection :D.","December 13, 2015","true","5.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It is clearly a IOS/Android port game designed for low resolution usage. Even on my old screen (16870 * 1050) it was shown in a real small frame. This made playing the game a bit of a hassle. (I would however consider buying it for my tablet if the price is reasonable).  I finished the game in roughly 6 hours, which was more or less my expectation although i hoped it would take me more time.\n\nPro's:\n+ Sounds and music are nice\n+ Puzzles are challenging enough for a hidden object game\n+ scenes are nice setup.\n\nCon's:\n- Screen resolution!  Screen resolution! Screen resolution!\n- Sometimes it is not clear what is expected from certain puzzles throughout the game.\n- 10 EUR /USD too expensive (value for money wise)\n\nFinal thoughts:\nI would not recommend buying unless you really enjoy these types of games and they put up on a steamsale deal. The scaling of the game to a small window is really annoying and would require adjustment of your native screen resolution to be playable. If the creators of this game would repair the screen resolution issues it might be a slightly different case.","December 26, 2015","false","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
