I've always been a fan of the tycoon games and this has the potential to be one of the good ones. Some of the missions are abit confusing though (but it's still alpha, so it's ok) and there's abit of a misconseption from the developers that seem to think that their language (german) is the international language. The news here on steam are  in german first and then english. Some of the menues are in german (I'm guessing they make the game in german and forgot to translate). Since I'm from Denmark it's not that big of a problem, (we learned alot of german during WW2) but for the non european people this could pose a problem.\n\nNote to the developers: Please stop being lazy with the translations.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/recommended/353630/","Apokalupsis","✫ Aionion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/","447 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe game has potential, but in its current state (as of 8/14/15), it has a VERY long way to go, even for Early Access. I'm a huge supporter of early access games. I own probably about 50-60 ea games. This by far, ranks as being one of the most incomplete. It seems more like a pre-alpha.\n\nThe Good\n1) The graphics seem fine/good for this type of game, although many have complained that the cartoony graphics break the immersion of a business sim, making it feel more like a BigFish Games flash game. I can understand that criticism.\n\n2) The concept (oil business) is unique and is a refreshing change for the genre.\n\n3) It's educational (you'll learn about the various practices and buildings necessary in the oil industry.\n\nThe Bad\n1) The tutorial, which apparently was recently redone, is amazingly inadequate IMO. There are only about 5-6 steps in the tutorial, and each only tell you to build a specific buildilng. There are additional help pages, but in game that has several moving balls like this, the tutorial should do more to engage the player. The game is fairly sophisticated yet the player is thrown in to figure everything out for themselves. You either have to experiment or get what little information exists through manual help pages.\n\nHere's the thing with that...and is why it's my #1 gripe here:  I enjoy figuring things out on my own. It creates a sense of discovery and accomplishment. But figuring out GAME MECHANICS is not the same thing as figuring out BEST PRACTICES or world/game exploration.\n\nYou are supposed to be a businessman in the oil industry. Which means you should already know and understand key concepts and processes, and industry strategy. Obviously, us as gamers do not have this knowledge. THAT is where tutorials come into play. The catch the player up to speed with the mechanics of the game (basic setup practices) and key understandings to be successful. THEN, the game ought to challenge the player to use what they learn to be successful or overcome obstacles.  This game doesn't do that. Instead, it forces the player to not only learn the basics of the industry themselves, but also the basics of the game mechanics, which breaks the immersion and creates an almost hair-pulling experience, especially compared to so many other involved games that have a proper tutorial.\n\n2) The animations are too simplistic nor are they relevant. They don't tell you anything about the flow of the process nor are they relevant in as far as how buildings interact with one another. There are no construction animations. You place the building and it looks 100% constructed, but are told it isn't. You have to wait. See #4.\n\n3) There are no intuitive capacity indicators for your buildings. No way to easily tell when buildings are getting filled up, which tells the player how the efficient the processes are working.\n\n4) The sense of time is horrible. It takes "5 hours" to build most if not all buildings. But there is no clock, no sense of time whatsoever. You can however speed things up with a FF button which is nice, but it doesn't do anything to help with the lack of sense of time. I know a building is being constructed, but I don't see how long it takes to construct via the expected construction bar (or similar) animation that practically EVERY other builder game in existence has.\n\n5) The price point is always going to be subjective. Obviously what is worth it to one player may not be to another. So instead, I'd argue that the price point is NOT comparable to OTHER early access games for what you get. There are several other early access games at or around the same price point (many even less) that are more fleshed out, more intuitive, more immersive, etc.\n\nMost likely, I'll be requesting a refund. The game has potential, it just has a very long way to go and ought to consider itself a pre-alpha IMHO.","August 14, 2015","false","0.4"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","19","35","0","13"

You have to buy all the equipment needed to extract and sell the oil and manage profits and production wisely to not go bankrupt.\n\n\nHowever, This game needs more depth/strategy to it for it's price tag. (It is still early access and the dev's do seem to be still adding to it) After completing a few of the intro scenarios and 2 failed (bankrupt) attempts at free play I was able to devise a strategy that had great results for every new field I created and the game started to feel repetitive and a lot of busy work trying to keep an eye on all the logistics of the game instead of expanding further.\n\nThe game is great small scale, the first couple hours of free play, but after you get a couple fields  and maybe a second region going there isn't much strategy in expanding, mostly just a lot of busy work.\n\nSince it's still early access and I'm assuming the dev's want feedback, here's afew additions I would like to see in the game. (I'm not sure where elese I could post/send these)\n\nI think it would be great if there was a central location to look at all the logistics/data without having to jump between regions, oilfields, or buildings. If the contract page could be added to so I could just select what region I want to view the open and active contracts for. Also, in the contracts page I'd like to see a breakdown of what each fields production is and how long they have until they are depleted because signing a large 180 day contract when a field has less than 6 months before it's depleted has some expensive penalties. It would also be great if there was another window that again has a place to select a region and it shows all the logistics of that region. Basically a condensed location to see the condition, performance characteristics, and operating costs of each building in the region.\n\nAlso, as for strategy additions. It would be great if buildings could be put into an idle mode where they require minimal operating costs so when prices are low in a certain region operating costs and production can be adjusted to wait it out instead of depleting the reserves with oil prices that make it hard to profit and expand...Also, it would be great if I could pack up and ship equipment/buildings to another field (for a fee of course). This way once a field has been depleted, the equipment can be repurposed instead of sitting around costing money or having to pay to take it down.","November 14, 2015","true","10.4"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","0"

For now it looks like the variable that provides the challenge is time.  Fun for scenarios but not freebuild.  The concept is outstanding and the trade system works very well.  In addition, its fun to work within the trading system.  I would love to see more challenge around logistics by using tankers or oil rigs and having the ability to own fleets of both.  That would introduce an entirely new overhead cost that would be fun the manage not to mention the challenge of seeting routes.  Also, I dont know too much about oil drilling but I have to think there are more specialized buildings.  I would love to see additional buildings.

There's still more things I'd like to see adjusted, but as it stands, the game is pretty fun to play and am switching my recommendation from negative to positive.  Kudos to the devs for being very active and releasing content on a quick & regular basis.\n\n---\n\nUPDATE 5/31/15\n\nThe game has admittedly improved a bit since the posting of my original review.  More campaign missions and a free play mode are now available, adding a lot of value to the game.  I am enjoying this game a bit more now, though I do think it needs a bit more time to cook before I can recommend it at the $20 price (had it been cheaper, I would have recommended it).\n\nWhat I'd personally like to see is the difficulty levels balanced...that is, on easy settings (both scenarios and free play) have the maintenance costs of the buildings reduced so that folks can enjoy the game without worrying too much about the budget (yet still provide a "little" challenge).  I also think the maintenance and safety structures aren't that effective and need the amount of maintenance/safety they provide increased or at least, decrease the maintenance costs of having them in the first place as you will need a LOT of them to handle all the pumps, refineries, and etc. you'll have out in the field.\n\nThe game is still under development, so we'll see how this all plays out.  For now, I recommend waiting a little longer.  The devs have been pumping out content like crazy, so thankfully the wait should be short.\n\n---\n\n\nThe game has promise, but it's not worth the $15 at this time.  At present, the free play mode does not work and there's only two scenarios available (one of which is a tutorial that doesn't cover everything you need to know).  I believe I figured most of it out through trial and error in that you can sell oil to either the market or via contracts...the former having a variable price while the latter having a fixed price.  Logistics enable you to sell more per day, which is important if you intend to accept a lot of contracts.  Expect to stumble your first few playthrus of the scenarios as it can get a little confusing.  I would have liked a way to distinguish crude from refined oil, for example...they should really have their own separate resource count.  That's not to say that it couldn't be something fantastic some day, but I'd only recommend it to dedicated fans who want to support the developers.  As for the rest of you, I'd say wait a while until the game receives a bit more TLC and content.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6aLdQBLgOI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVnETyh5Qb4\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQvOb2vGYHo","May 22, 2015","true","6.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","18"

Overall it's pretty relaxing and quite engaging as you try to get the maximum amount of contracts possible without running out of barrels of oil.\n+ Some neat mechanics later on where you can buy licenses to drill in other countries with different biomes and real-world perks like cheaper labor / construction costs. You can also build up a headquarters which are large research buildings that improve your structures.\n\n- At some points it becomes a waiting game where you just wait a long while for your contracts to finish, and to raise enough money.\n- There are some bugs in the game. At one point I had over 7,000 barrels, and it randomly said that I failed to supply enough for a 300 barrels / day contract, which fined me $1million and I ended up failing the scenerio and had to restart.\n- Feels a bit too basic, I would have liked to have been able to build pipes to transfer the oil, or at least see people working or transporting oil below. Even when a station breaks down nothing really happens you just have to wait. I  would have liked to have seen more animations in the building process, and perhaps more unexpected disasters or events.  Although these are just minor things.","May 1","true","8.6"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Minimalistic, tough and excel-esque micromangement? Sounds boring? Nah. Crafty Studios really do catch the charm of the old Amiga times. The relatively dry gameplay gets spiced up by some cute comicish artworks and an excellent tutorial.\n\nI’m a few hours in it and really start digging it (you get it, huh?). An additional plus are the freely placable buildings on your drilling grounds, which do not really have an strategy effect, but allow you to get a grip on the layout of your companies area. Balancing could take a little makeover ever so often and it could be a bit cheaper – anyways fans of strategic tycoon games will get a bang for the buck.\n\nFrom what if seen updates do come in frequently – so everythings good on the EA side.\n\n8/10 will drill again","June 24, 2015","true","8.3"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

But the bits and pieces fit together nicely, the mechanic is rather easy to understand but not that easy to master perfectly, and it has a very good replay value with all the scenarios and especially with the upcoming multiplayer.
