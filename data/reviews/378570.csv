I can somewhat understand it being OK on a mobile device when you have some time to kill on the bus or train but it is a bit silly to run it on a pc.\n\nFirst of all, there is not really any music to acompany the robot, which I think is a bit sad! The little guy is on a mining trip, he could atleast whistle a merry tune!\n\nThe mechanics are a bit simple and dull. There is a prize somewhere that you need to find but there is no real challenge of getting the prize. Yes, you run out of energy and equipment but is super easy to just hop back to the surface and replenish everything instantly without any cost.\n\nAs long as you keep a lazy eye on the energy level and can count to 9 (amount of ladders to get back up again), then you can beat the game quite easily. The levels are just a matter of time then. I did not play a whole lot of it, as I got bored with it within 5 minutes of playing this. Not a good sign for a game, I feel.\n\nNot a very enjoyable experience, I'm sorry to say.","June 16, 2015","false","0.1"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

The presentation is poor, the quality is that of a 2006 flash game, there's no music of any description.\nThe game shows every little flaw of it being a mobile port, and a rather incomplete one at that as well.\n\nIf this was on kongregate its score would sit at around 2/5, the available games there completely crush it even on the exact same genre.\n\nEven if this was a free game it would be a waste of time, at the current price it's really expensive.\n\nAm I being fair? Probably not, this just feels like it's only a few steps away from when it was a minimum viable product and for that I'm not willing to throw any money at it.\n\nI got it from bundle stars, it's currently bundled with far more interesting titles that more than pay for the bundle. Don't give it a go otherwise.","July 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You can upgrade ladders, power and your drill etc by making money from mining coal (the brown blocks with black specks)\n\nIt's fun - and cheap.\n\nenjoy.","June 30, 2015","true","0.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","1"

My wife is thinking of leaving me, my kids have forgotten me and several AAA games are waiting to be played. I hate this game. +1 will play again, and again, and again.

The other is language, which can be set to German or English. As far as i can see there is no fullscreen in this game except just to use windows fullscreen button, but that wont hide taskbar. Now that i've been trough that there is nothing more about this game. I heard there was somthing about a robot that was suppose to mine. But honestly the 2 settings option meny was better.","June 12, 2015","false","0.1"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

I had it on my phone a few years ago and it hasn't changed much since then, which is awesome! The keyboard is not rebindable, which is sad. The arrow key  movement is okay but the mouse movement is hard to use because you accidentally dig things or use ladders unintentionally. They added WASD movement, which is great! I wrote about how the dev (devs?) should add WASD movement in my last review so that shows that the dev(s) actually read the user reviews.\n\nOne thing I would really like to see in this game is fullscreen support! That would be awesome.\n\nI give this game a solid 8.5/10","June 11, 2015","true","0.9"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","3","12","0","0"
