Buy it!\n\nSeriously, they got everything right about this game. Looking at my steam library, I am not usually someone who actually finishes a game. But this one, I did. It was kinda like a good book or a thrilling movie. I just kept going and going excited to find out what's gonna happen next.\n\nWell, at first I was like "meh, it's 2015. Do I really want to buy something that looks like it could be made by Lucas Arts in the 80's?"\nLet me tell you, I am glad I did. Once you start playing the game, it simply captures your imagination. Writing and pacing are superb and neither story nor dialogues ever get boring. Characters are interesting and entertaining. The voice acting fits perfectly. This might just be one - if not THE - best game I have played in a couple of years! HD graphics? Never while playing this game did I feel the need for that.\n\nPlease, let there be a sequel.","June 17, 2015","true","10.9"," 44 of 46 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","44","46","0","0"

It is completely true and unmanipulated, yet highly subjective from someone who loves adventure games in general and the WEG adventures so far in particular.\n\nTechnobabylon is, depending on your preferred taste in setting, the best Point & Click adventure Wadjet Eye Games ever put on the market. It can only be surpassed by the complete Blackwell experience if you like the ghost story more than Cyberpunk. Technobabylon easily snatches the summit of adventure games away from even the highly praised Gemini Rue, and a welcome release for everyone disappointed by Broken Ages final release.\n\nWith this out of the way, I’ll try to get into the positive points without destroying the experience trough spoilers. Technobabylon takes place in Newton, a cliché Cyberpunk City in the 21th century. It’s controlled by a sentient AI called Central who not only manages electricity and water but also the police. In this town, a between-jobs internet addict and two high-ranking police officers get sucked into a mass murderer case that seems to rip the information out of their victims brains. In the end, one might find that the whole cliché Newton presents is not quite what it seemed, and Technobabylon might have played with your expectations all along…\n\nThe graphics are superb – if you like the characteristic artstyle of Ben Chandlers, who’s responsible for all of Wadjet Eyes graphics. The game, while not being developed but only published by WEG received much help from Ben in terms of style, that is for certain. The animations are a little stiff while walking, but the gestures and animations of characters in dialogues are great and really set the mood. The music is alright – nothing fancy, but fitting for the black-and-neon world Newton provides.\n\nGameplay is very classic, but in a very refreshing way, especially for Wadjet Eye. While most of their earlier adventures have a focus on dialogues and riddles to progress the story, Technobabylon has a huge amount of item and inventory puzzles.This depends on the character you are currently controlling – the old techophobe police officer depends more on the good old use-fishing rod-with-magnet style of play than the internet addict who just hacks all systems she can get her hands on. This really helps differentiate the characters and is, plainly, really fun. The puzzles are very intuitive, though – no Grim Fandango “How the f’ would I have guessed that moments” in here.\n\nOverall, if you have the slightest interest in adventure games, go get Technobabylon. It’s one of the best out there developed in modern times.\n\nMy German Review is found here: Gamingpoints[www.gamingpoints.de]","May 21, 2015","true","8.6"," 54 of 66 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","54","66","0","0"

Technobabylon is on par, if not surpasses classic point'n'clicks, like Westwood's, Sierra's and Lucas Arts ones.\n\nIt is almost a crime how little this game sold on Steam, and it clearly needs more publicity. (So I feel I should at least write this review, dammit)\n\nFirst things first, it catches what it takes something to be cyberpunk pretty well.\nIt also abides the number one cyberpunk rule - every character is involved for their own reasons and is trying to resolve their own problems. Their actions overlap, interests conflict, and thus, the story is born.\n\nMoreover, dialogues are also put together very well, it really shows.\nWhen talking / describing a situation, characters are trying to cover all possible critique coming from player and explain their reasoning, so there will be no (or very little) unanswered "Why didn't you do %that% instead?" questions on your behalf.\n\nCharacters also have distinct personalities, and they are not in a hurry to just dump all information from character sheet on you, you need to ask questions (or not, just like with people around in "meatspace")\n\nThe pacing of game also matches a pace you expect from events of the story, so there is no dissonances on this part.\n\nPlot twists: KOJIMA / 10\n\nThat's good writing for you.\n\nAs for gameplay aspects, like in every good point'n'click game, you are not so much "solving puzzles", as "managing situations", and there is often more than one way to resolve your problems (It is mirrored by achievements, which is nice)\n\nOverall, it's a must have.\nTechnocrat Games clearly should be more proud of their creation and make better publicity for Technobabylon and future games.\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrRokuro-san/recommended/307580/","MrRokuro-san","Mr. Businessman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrRokuro-san/","330 products in account","It seems as if, nowadays, adventure games straddle one of two extremes. They are either interactive works of fiction that don’t offer much in the way of traditional challenge, or they are traditionally difficult point-and-click games with traditionally broken logic. Games that combine a rich story and world building without feeling like a DVR simulator are somewhat rare. Being one of those rare titles is what makes Technocrat Games’s Technobabylon a remarkable experience. First began life as a freeware title, Technobabylon benefits from better production values (evident in the voice acting), revamped and stylistic pixel visuals, and a well assembled adventure experience thanks to the involvement of Wadjet Eye.\n\nA bit of background Technobabylon takes place in a sci-fi setting that is not to dissimilar to what what we’ve seen in adventure video games and other forms of media and entertainment. As you sink into the premise, setting and characters of Technobabylon, its influences become apparent in its nuances. Technobabylon will remind you of classic movies Blade Runner, cult classic games like Policenauts, iconic anime/manga like Ghost in the Shell and even newer anime like Psycho Pass.\n\nIn a city called Newton, a place where science has risen above ethics and morals, and everyone plays god with free-form genetic engineering. Advances in computing power have led to massive advancements in AI, that mostly put to use for monitoring and controlling citizens. Social media and inter-web interaction has gone up a few notches, with the virtual-reality medium called Trance giving people a platform to interact in a virtual world and not deal with the real world responsibilities. Genetic engineering has made stunning advances as well – when an organic nanomachines called "wetware" are invented for many different purposes. Such freedoms and technological progress come at a price, however, when it created a generation of addicts (known as “thralls”) who have no jobs and spend most of their time in "trance", or when a genetically engineered children with explosive bones can be made as a suicide bomber.\n\nThe protagonists Meet Regis, He’s the typical “too-old-for-this" cop, and boy is he too old for this. If Regis could wear a Rage Against the Machine shirt to work, he would. Assuming people remember Rage Against the Machine in post-nuclear 2087. Surveillance cameras, computers, phones, cyborg-style implants—Regis hates the whole lot, and most of all he hates the city’s overzealous artificial intelligence, Central.\nThen there's Lao, an ordinary girl with her cheerfulness and spark keeps her partner Regis’ cynical doom-and-gloom attitude at bay for most of the game and brightens up the atmosphere considerably. In a game that has such a dark plot with so many terrible things happening, Max’s character provides the perfect balance to the mix, adding the sense of hope the story so desperately needs.\nAnd finally Latha. She brings the game its biggest breath of fresh air, as she is able to enter the Trance. From here, she can interact with other users and even AI systems she encounters, displaying them through humanistic avatars complete with unique personalities. Here, the game flexes its creative muscles at not only providing unique gameplay, but also at delivering dialogue with wit and humor as well.\n\nThe way it shuttles you between these three viewpoints is probably one of my favorite aspect of the game. It feels like we learn a lot about the world, thanks to our split perspective.\n\nPuzzles n' stuff Speaking of puzzles, we can agree that the most important part of any puzzle-based games is the presentation of the puzzles themselves, and this is where Technobabylon really delivers. Not every puzzle has the same wealth of approaches, but in general things adhere to each character’s skills—low-fi investigation from Regis, high-tech hacking from Latha, and a bit of both from Lao. It’s a clever conceit that helps make each character feel functionally distinct even within the limited mechanics of a point-and-click adventure game. Whether its remotely piloting drones, manipulating AI personalities, or even solving how to enter through a locked doorway, Technobabylon makes figuring out how to get to the next destination an enjoyable experience. Visually, Tecnobabylon carries a style akin to the DOS adventure game classics from yesteryear, and the pixelated graphics are put to good use to create some detailed environments and character sprites. Neon colors/lighting mixes nicely with the darker contrast and undertones to create an artistically charged setting. Except for the character portraits that pop up in conversations, the game looks like an early 1990s LucasArts adventure game.\n\nSome minor complaints Despite the overall positive experience, the playthrough wasn’t without its own set of problems. There are moments when I got confused about what the objects are or how they function, as it is often unclear without clicking on them to get a text description. The low fidelity visuals also contribute to the problem of not always knowing what you can grab from the environment and what you can manipulate. It is easy to miss out on a drawer or a wrench since so many useable items blend into the background. In addition to that, some of the voice acting – in particular that of Regis – was a little too monotone, which made even the more dramatic scenes a little less moving. Not to mention that Trance is somewhat underutilized too. We get glimpses of Trance’s potential, especially the part where Latha is constantly swapping between the virtual and physical worlds to solve puzzles. But in general the game doesn’t do enough with a world that has literally zero rules.\n\nBottom line Honestly, I feel like I can write an essay or two about this game. Like drawing some comparison between Central (Newton's overzealous artificial intelligence) and The Sibyl system from Psycho Pass, whether the escapism provided by Trance a blessing in a world gone to hell, or is it merely enabling people to give up on the real world and many other topics to cover. But surely if you managed to make it this far, you want to see my thought about it. While there is no shortage of choice when it comes to adventure games — especially on Steam — Technobabylon is not just another face in the crowd. It doesn’t make you feel you are just a passenger along for the ride, nor does it make you feel like you need to be a mind reader to figure out how the developers want you to solve a puzzle. A little fix might have made game more enjoyable in a couple of ways, but the game is still a very easy one to recommend, especially since it's only 15 bucks.","May 7","true","10.0"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","0"

With its\nthought-provoking story and themes, engaging characters, and its incredible use of pixelated graphics, Technobabylon proves that the point-and-click genre is alive, well, and growing artistically.\n\nThe story of Technobabylon is intriguing, and also told out of order from different points of view. This keeps the player engaged and shows the incredible depth of the world that the game takes place in. While it falls in the realm of science fiction, I feel that the game takes place in the not so distant future, considering how quickly technology is advancing. Not only is there a great story, but there are a variety of themes and ideas that could provoke thoughtful discussion. As society advances, the importance of family, the increase in scientific power and how much license mankind should take, and the dangers of embracing a virtual world while forsaking the responsibilities of the real world are all examined. This is a game that tackles a number of social issues that are relevant today, as well as what could possibly be achieved in the future.\n\nThe characters of this game are well fleshed out and acted. In Technobabylon, we follow three main protagonists, Dr. Charles Regis, a genetic engineer with a past; Max Lao, his tech savvy partner;  and Latha Sesame, a young woman who would rather live in a virtual world than face the harshness of reality. All the performances in this game are top notch, with great writing throughout.\n\nFinally, the star of the game is how beautiful it is. Pixelated art never looked so good. The stunning backgrounds and gritty atmosphere really give the game depth. The techno music is a\nperfect fit for the gorgeous and gritty city.\n\nPoint-and-click games have come a long way from the obtuse puzzles and nonsensical solutions that they are known for. Technobabylon's puzzles feel more like continuing an investigation. While puzzles may take more thought, they are not difficult. There are also instances where there are multiple solutions to a puzzle or situation. This game should be replayed in order to see all the different outcomes. There is also the ability to hack into different electronics, which almost feels like breaking the fourth wall, as one is able to effortlessly phase in and out of the virtual world.\n\nTechnobabylon is a great and creative game that should not be missed by those who love science fiction and a great story. This game educates as well as entertains. I look forward to more from Technocrat Games, and can understand fully why Wadjet Eye would want to publish this game. Its great story, memorable characters, and stunning sights and sounds prove that the point-and-click\ngenre is still worthy of attention and excitement.","July 14, 2015","true","13.8"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","29","36","0","3"

The game hits themes of the Internet and the social stigma behind it, governmental control, and the human condition. The writing is pretty well done with strong work done in terms of the dialogue between characters, as you have reasons to actually listen to everyone and talk to them. The games puzzles are hit and miss. Some puzzles will make you feel like a real detective in how you solved the problem, and rewarded paying attention. Some puzzles on the other hands suffer from the old point + click adventures basic problem of not knowing exactly what it wants from you, and contextual item use. In the end, those who like sci-fi+control plots will really enjoy the experience that's here.\n\n+:\nGreat dialogue work done here as the writing isn't forced, and flows naturally. Dialogue between characters plays to their personality strengths, and makes you want to find out what they have to say.\nIn addition, secondary dialogue and repeated dialogue options in particular were pretty fun to listen to, especially with the elements of the Trance in there.\nGood variety of environments and made me appreciate the art style even more. Despite being set in the future, there was a great sense of difference within the world controlled by the AI.\nThe strongest puzzles in the game give a reasonable sense of accomplishment and a feeling of a real detective when completing them.\nSome heavy themes are hit here, and some character depth really is brought to the forefront in terms of those themes. Emotional connections were strong in this game, especially if you have someone IRL you can relate to.\nSolid voice acting all around (with an occassional misstep).\n-:\nSome puzzles are really suffering from the old school point and click adventure syndrome. You will get stuck if you don't pay attention specifically to the contextual clicks.\nToo many subplots at time really muddy the water in terms of the overall story, and could have maybe eliminated one or two to focus on the bigger plots.\nFelt like hint system in terms of dialogue sometimes sent you in the wrong direction.\nA personal point in terms of games that crash when you alt+tab.\nCompletely unrelated to overall review list but is worth a mention:\nFor some reason, Nvidia shadowplay's recording icon decided to show up for some reason, maybe with the weird way that the resolution is put on the screen.\nFor More First Impressions and Edited Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPUpNmZc_-g","May 21, 2015","true","9.9"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","25","35","2","0"

The design stretches beyond the main story to fill out a fascinating version of the future. The switching between characters, reminiscent of Wadjet Eye's equally impressive Resonance, gives you multiple perspectives on the city of Newton, which comes alive through implicit storytelling - filling in history and culture without dense exposition. Well-written dialogue develops naturally from the characters and is often very inventive, with no opportunity for embellishing the world squandered.\n\nThe puzzles are well integrated into the story and fun, sometimes offering multiple paths to the solution - and eventually multiple endings. Artwork is more exceptional pixel-mastery from Wadjet Eye regular Ben Chandler, coherent and consistent design with great use of teal/orange colour scheme.

In fact, some aspects of it are superb, but I just -can't- recommend it. If Steam had a neutral option, I would've picked that. For now, I have to regretfully give a thumbs down.\n\nThe cyberpunk setting the game has is amazing. I could really connect with the characters. Their motivations were clear, and the decisions they faced were well-executed. The whole story was put together well and kept the intrigue going, apart from maybe the big plot twist, which I saw coming from a mile away, and when it was revealed, it only left me disappointed that there wasn't more to it than what I already figured out.\n\nI also really like the old-school pixelated art style. The art is beautiful. Most notable were the character portraits. Brilliant artwork. The voice acting was also really well done.\n\nSo, a great story, beautiful art, and solid voice acting. Why the thumbs down? Well, just like most point and click games, this game suffers from convoluted puzzles that often make no logical sense, and at times even require you to have the knowledge of how things in the game's fictional setting work, like wetware or trance. Don't get me wrong - some of the puzzles were fun and executed well, but many others require you to have a walkthrough on hand, especially in the last two chapters. It just horribly breaks the pace of the story.\n\nThe game also offers some choices. It was a great touch, though many don't seem to make much of a difference to the story. I was especially annoyed by the ending, which I shall outline in the spoiler below (read at your own risk!):\nThe ending had me choose to either side with the A.I. or side with the power-hungry woman (Nina Jeung). I chose to side with the A.I. and to give it full control of the city, and yet, the A.I ended up somehow getting under Nina's control, even though I specifically chose not to side with her. These kind of false choices really ruin potentially good stories. What was the point of giving me this choice when the outcome is almost the same?\n\nSo to conclude, although I enjoyed a lot of parts of the game, it left me feeling disappointed, and hence I can't with all honesty recommend the game. If you don't mind the outlandish puzzles that will force you to consult a walkthrough, then by all means, get the game. Otherwise, eh, just watch the story on Youtube or something.","July 13, 2015","false","12.5"," 35 of 55 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","35","55","0","2"

Of them all, Technobabylon was easily the most enjoyable. The problems I had with the game feel minor, like some voice actors overacting, or how the text is written when you examine objects. These issues were blotted out by the mysteries, the music, the audio design, and puzzles with multiple solutions. I just loved “being in the world”, to whatever extent that’s possible in a point-and-click. It was a nice place to be in, even before the first line of the game was spoken. I saw it, I heard it, and I knew I liked it. That propelled me through the opening of the game until the story kicked off in proper and hooked me completely.\n\nCompared to Primordia, Technobabylon’s story lacks depth. It goes for a less subtle and more action heavy approach. More thrills, more instant gratification, and no confusion. This approach works, as it succeeds in actually being thrilling, and makes it hard to put down. Because of this, I find Technobabylon easy to recommend. It’s unlikely anyone is going to be bored by it. It’s fairly long for a point-and-click adventure, but the superb pacing makes it feel half its length. If you haven’t played an adventure game in a while, this is the one I recommend above all others if you want a reminder of what this genre can do.","June 27, 2015","true","10.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The cyberpunk city of Newton is well-fleshed out and does an excellent job of providing coloration even on the parts you don’t see. There are some relatively unique ideas, as well as some good implementations that help make it stand out in different ways.\n\nWhen it comes together, Technobablyon is a very nice adventure game with only a few flaws – the graphics sometimes don’t quite work, the puzzles on a few occasions get away from logic, and the story has only a few points that make you frown on minor bits. However, it bears the trappings of its genre in many ways and that makes it a difficult game to score because if you aren’t interested in adventure games, if you don’t have patience, and you don’t want to experience a well-written narrative where you solve puzzles on the go, it isn’t something that will interest you.\n\nI will say though, if you like Adventure games, this is something you definitely want to check out!\n\n---\nFinal Score: 7.5/10 Very Good\nRead the full Review[techraptor.net] for more!","May 21, 2015","true","8.6"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","0"

Characters are deep, with real personalities, secrets, desires and resentments. Even the ‘synthetic’ characters are better written than many supposedly human characters in other games.

Production value is very high, comparable to Resonance and the final game in the Blackwell series. Story is gripping and interesting all the way through. Puzzles are nearly as tough as those in Resonance, including a few that require some action skill. Game length is pretty decent - plenty of optional dialogue, and lots of different scenes. The only Wadjet Eye game that's longer is Resonance.\n\nWhen it comes to character chemistry, your mileage may vary. The voice acting direction feels pretty loose - as if the majority of it was intended for a Blackwell game.

The plot isn't completely original - once you look at it closer, you'll notice strong inspirations from Beneath A Steel Sky and Neuromancer, including a few of the puzzles - but it holds its own without feeling derivative.\n\nI did have a few gripes with the game: in particular, some of the lines recorded for Max sounded very differently from the rest and the pixel-art style is less than perfect on a few occasions - seeing "half pixel" lines was kind of jarring, and there's a loose plot thread - unfortunately, one rather relevant to the plot (we never really find out why both clones were created). The game includes an autosave on the start of each chapter, which turned out quite handy in when I ended up in what's probably the only dead-end situation in the game (no way to progress without interacting with an item you can't backtrack to when you climb outside the airship).\n\nThe limited amount of objects you can interact with in the game's locations has both upsides and downsides - in the 90's adventure games, they often provided a lot of colorful, sometimes humorous, exposition on the game's plot and setting, but from a design perspective, less items for the player to work with means less red herrings (there are a few, such as the toilet cleaner)\n\nIn a nice touch, not all of Technobabylon's puzzles are linear: in several chapters there's more than one solution, and the game rewards you with achievements for discovering each. While they do not alter the course of the game's plot (apart from one in the final chapter), later chapters sometimes contain callbacks to the choices you made earlier.\n\nOver all, the game is not perfect but thoroughly enjoyable regardless - if you buy it, you won't regret that decision.","May 8","true","11.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This may not be the strongest thing they have produced, but it still has a number of good ideas.\n\nThere are a bunch of high level sci fi concepts put into the characters and set pieces. To mention any of them would take that discovery away from you so I won't really say too much, just suffice that it exists and it's fun to see what Technocrat came up with.\n\nThe actual writing is passable, but not super strong. The star here is really the sci fi ideas, not the characters themselves. I don't even want to criticise too much because it would require spoilers.\n\nThe actual puzzles are a mix of a bunch of different ideas too, and sometimes there are some minor UI issues as a result. Often it feels more like trying to understand how the game functions more than solving actual puzzles. But they work more often than not.\n\nOverall a solid adventure game, even more so if you are a sci-fi nerd.

Technobabylon has the quality that is to be expected of Wadjet Eye Games and is perhaps a contender for their best game at the time of writing.\n\nTechnobabylon takes place in a dystopian future where genetic engineering is common and many people use "Trance" instead of interacting with other people normally.  An AI named Central powers the city and the CEL police keep tabs on just about everyone and everything.  As usual with Wadjet Eye Games, the story is high quality and I do seriously hope it continues in a future sequel.\n\nDeveloper Technocrat has pushed the somewhat divisive AGS engine further than I thought it could go; there are many sections involving people connecting to electronic devices and some of the best puzzles take place in this state.  Whether it is just using these devices to obtain download attachments or solving far more complex puzzles, Technobabylon stands out when compared to adventure games using simpler mechanics.  I wasn't expecting some of the puzzles and a few genuinely had me stumped for a while.  So unlike many adventure games, this isn't just a great story based experience, there's challenge here and it's more challenging than most Wadjet Eye Games.\n\nWadjet Eye Games enjoy giving you control over numerous characters and I found that this could lead to some confusion as how to progress.  I liked that this game rarely had any of these moments and when you were able to switch between characters, it would always be in aid of solving a puzzle together.  It's these design choices that make Technobabylon a bit easier to swallow than a game like Resonance.\n\nThere's not a lot else to say, if you are really into Wadjet Eye Games, then you will already have your eye on this.  Fans of Gemini Rue, Shardlight and Resonance will eat this up.  A polished point and click game in that old-school style and a creative science fiction story that deserves some sequels.","May 13","true","11.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

So I was provided a review copy.\nI really recommend this game to any cyberpunk or simply SF fan. I couldn't wait for Technobabylon because Resonance and Primordia are part of my favorite point & click adventures. I am aware that all of these games are made by different teams within Wadjet Eye, but it's still tempting to compare them.\n\nThe conspiracy that gets untangled slowly hooked me up very quick. I also loved how the characters, when you play with each of them, don't really know each other, so you get to see quite different sides of the story, even different ways of mentality. I expected mature themes and I wasn't disappointed. Political corruption, criminality, blunt violence. Yet, all of these are depicted in a serious manner and they are not gratuitous. It's hard to achieve that.\n\nFor those who wonder about difficulty, I say that it's not hard for veteran adventure players, but the creativity of the puzzles ideas will keep you going.\n\nOverall, even though the soundtrack isn't as amazing as i expected but still good, there is no real minus for this game. It would worth every cent for such a strong storyline-gameplay bond. It's also replaylable because of the achievements that are only unlocked by taking different choices in the plot or solve a few situations in another way.

People can’t find jobs because most services are automated by a singular computer system named, Central. Humans are raised by the city and molded by it, they can either become successful or sponges trapped in the thrall of the internet.  There are some high notes in there like acceptable gene manipulation from man to woman, and racial hatred seems to be a thing of the past. However zealotry, hacking, government spying, war, and terrorism have all gotten worse than we can ever imagine.\n\nTechnobabylon bounces between many distinct characters similar to the film “Crash.” The story revolves around the actions of a shady group of criminals who manipulate a police officer into making some questionable choices, and the attempted termination of an otherwise uninteresting woman living in the slums. The mystery goes beyond those two and slips into the lives of other citizens in the city, as each layer is peeled from this clandestine group.\n\nHigh points\n\nDeep and engrossing – Technobabylon is a well-written cyberpunk adventure game with a knack for fleshing out its world via descriptive storytelling. For a game that looks like it was made in the early 90’s, it comes to life with witty dialogue, interesting characters, and believable explanations of technology that would impress William Gibson. It easily articulates the impact of humans allowing technological advances to get out of control and effectively rule them.\n\nIt paints a picture of a future full of genetic-manipulation, synthetic love, curable diseases, news outlets corrupted by corporations, and wars that are waged not just on the ground but also in the mind. If this were a novel, it could easily be a best seller among the Science-Fiction crowd.\n\nFun characters and puzzles – Charlie and the gang, will interact with some interesting programs and synthetics in the city. I thought I had accidently turned on Discworld or Monkey Island after interacting with the various wacky programs in and out of the Trance. Most of the characters can be outright hilarious amongst an otherwise grim world. The interactions are only highlighted by intelligent puzzle design that refuses to force us into spamming random objects. The title gives plenty of hints to allow us to look at a situation logically, understand it, and complete the puzzle.\n\nLatha can interact with terminals and drift into the Trance to use programs and manipulation to hack the internet. Charlie and Max will find reasonable ways to discover clues, and hack into the brains of synthetics to twist their personalities to something more helpful. As much as I love The Walking Dead, I think this game properly demonstrates how to create meaningful gameplay, while also providing us with a stimulating tale.\n\nHard Choices & Cold Outcomes – While it’s nothing like Mass Effect in terms of sheer volume of decision making, each of the available choices are not to be selected on a whim. No matter how well intentioned a choice may be, it is always countered by a consequence. You may not feel the immediate sting of what you’ve done, but eventually the game will let you understand the weight of it. This game doesn’t mind making you feel like a terrible person after your judgment calls.\n\nVisual Discrepancy – In the early build that I’ve played, I’ve noticed that the visuals take a jarring leap between clean 16-bit graphics in the trance, and grimy looking pixels in the “real” world. I’m sure this is a stylistic choice by the development team, and I respect them for it, but it comes off as a bit jarring. I also noticed that characters are always speaking in the Trance, but in the real world their lips will only move in special sequences. It’s a small issue that dilutes the atmosphere of this otherwise immersive world.\n\nLow Points\n\nTechnical Issues – There are a few bugs in the build I played but nothing that negatively affected gameplay. I did notice that the game crashes trying to Alt-Tab, or refuses to even start if you have a multi-monitor setup. I did notice that the game stopped Auto-saving on some levels, so be sure to manually save when you can. Hopefully all these issues will be ironed out by the time the game releases.\n\nConclusion\n\nTechnobabylon may not be a visual and technical marvel, but the story and immersive dialogue creates a believable Science Fiction world. If you’re a fan of cyberpunk books or the classic Blade Runner film, you’ll absolutely adore the detailed and brutal storyline of Technobabylon. I recommend that you buy this game at full price if you’re an adventure fan, or even if you’re a person that just loves great storytelling. Technocrat and Wadjet Eye Games did a fantastic job, and I still can’t believe these are the same people that made a game called “Nancy: The Happy ♥♥♥♥♥.”\n\n*A review copy was provided to us by the publisher*","May 21, 2015","true","14.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","11","18","2","0"

'Genginneering' (genetic engineering) is common place, synthetic humans act as security forces and maids, amongst other jobs, the police force is run by a central A.I., known as Central, and humans use nano-machines to 'Trance' into the internet.  The story involves the murder investigation of a mind-jacker who uses this nano-technology to steal the neural pathways of his victims for some unknown purpose.  It is your job to figure that out and unravel the conspiracy as it unfolds.\n\nThe game is heavy on dialogue, but you never feel overburdened with it.  The puzzles are never too obtuse. The pixel hunt is kept to a minimum. The voice acting is well done.  All of these things combine to make a very fun, enjoyable, and rewarding experience.

The game focuses on three people living in a futuristic city run by a central computer. There's Charles Regis, an agent of CEL, which acts as a police force within the city, his partner Max Lao, and trance addict/hacker Latha Sesame. The three become entangled in an intricate plot involving part secrets, intricate histories, and unique technologies. The game separates itself from typical sci-fi by giving it's technology a bizzare form of organic technology, ala David Cronenberg, in which computers come from an organic source. And while the story may have an immense amount of dizzying technical detail, what truly separates it is the way in which it is played. Yes, it adheres to much of the usual point-click style, but it breaks this up by including some interesting game elements and making use of it's technological setting. At certain points, you'll control drones, be able to play minigames, and access a network hub. Things are kept fresh by giving you different kinds of environments to play in and different tools to use. All the characters are fairly well developed, though they aren't necessarily all that original. But the story feels somewhat fresh, thanks to it's unique technology, and it makes the central mystery interesting. If you're in the mood for a great sci-fi story, this is a very highly recommended game.","July 15, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Love the reference to Big Blue Cup)\n\nI find a lot of point and click adventures to be a little tiresome these days, some are a little too rooted in conventions set by their predecessors, while others find themselves wrapped up in overly convoluted and obtuse puzzles. Technobabylon manages to find some fresh perspective on these puzzles, keeping most of their components within reasonable grasp and still manage to deliver a fantastic plot with engaging characters at the end of it all.\n\nPresentation is beautifully executed, as i have come to expect with Wadjet Eye games, thus enables the player give in and throw themselves into the experience completely. There were some really cool and interesting puzzles involving the "Trance", along with a lot of humour stitched effortlessly next to some gruesome and possibly even barbaric scenes. I did find that one or two puzzles that involved the dreaded pixel hunt, and one puzzle in particular involved a reflex mini-game...which i hate with a passion in these types of games.\n\nFantastic game and well worth the price of admission.

Easily amongst the best modern point-and-clicks I've played, and good enough to hold its own with the classics too. Its engaging story is bolstered by stellar worldbuilding that strikes the perfect balance between drowning the player in backstory vs giving them nothing outisde the main narrative. You get to delve deep into many aspects of the dystopian cyberpunk future that the game weaves around you, but there are plenty of things that are only mentioned or implied. This dichotomy makes the game/world feel much larger than it actually is, which is a rare trick in this age of exposition heavy Wiki-oriented games. The end result of the narrative and worldbuilding is a game that you won't want to stop playing, and I was a little sad when I completed it just because I knew that was all I'd get to see of this world.\n\nThat said, it does have the same flaws as many other games of its type. Sometimes you won't be able to parse what the designer expects you to do next. Other times you'll overlook an interactable object and spend a good 15 minutes furiously trying everything in your inventory on all the interactable points until you realize you missed something. You'll be able to get hints from NPCs to help you past some of these issues, but they're still present and can be annoying when trying to complete the game without a walkthrough. I think it's worth noting that the hints were never immersion-breaking; the NPCs' advice always seemed to fit their characters and the situation at hand, rather than breaking the fourth wall and condescending to the player by practically telling them the solution.\n\nAll in all, this is a must-have for anyone who loves point-and-click or cyberpunk. If you like both then scroll up, click "Add to Cart," and free up the next 8-10 hours to be swept away by this masterpiece.\n\nDisclaimer: I did not receive this game for free, nor do I have any relationship to anyone involved with the game. I do, however, have a raging nerd-on for cyberpunk settings.","September 22, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Technobabylon manages to find some fresh perspective on these puzzles, keeping most of their components within reasonable grasp and still manage to deliver a fantastic plot with engaging characters at the end of it all.\n\nPresentation is beautifully executed, as i have come to expect with Wadjet Eye games, thus enables the player give in and throw themselves into the experience completely. There were some really cool and interesting puzzles involving the "Trance", along with a lot of humour stitched effortlessly next to some gruesome and possibly even barbaric scenes. I did find that one or two puzzles that involved the dreaded pixel hunt, and one puzzle in particular involved a reflex mini-game...which i hate with a passion in these types of games.\n\nFantastic game and well worth the price of admission.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldeenaxe/recommended/307580/","goldeenaxe",".png","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldeenaxe/","232 products in account","I like Wadjet Eye games. They've proved to be publisher I can trust, with high-standards and a great back catalogue of games to boot. I still regularly look back on my time with Gemini Rue as one of the rare hidden gem findings I've had in the past few years, so, thankfully Technobabylon is a game worthy of association with Wadjet.\n\nMuch of the game's appeal will be determined by one thing: Do you like Cyberpunk? If you answered, yes then Technobabylon is may well be for you. It has cyberpunk bleeding out of its digital wounds and the writing finds a fantastic way to provide homage to the likes of William Gibson, Blade Runner, and Ghost in the Shell at once.\n\nThe best thing the game has going for it is the writing. While the characters aren't particularly memorable, the dialogue does what it needs to and in terms of world-building, the design is excellent. This being the world where a super-computer threatens to take control of the city at the wishes of a megolamaniac band of scientists, there's plenty of scope for drama, manipulation, conspiracy and crime, with some fantastic pixel-art visuals of a future dystopian to boot.\n\nThe worst element of the game (and what holds it back from being great) are the puzzles. It's hard to put a finger on the problem, but I'd say the clearest issue is that many simply halt the game's narrative. In a game with as good writing as Technobabylon, you want the narrative to flow, but the puzzles constantly serve to stop things in their tracks. Many are simply shoe-horned into proceedings to the point where I wondered why the developer hadn't put much less focus on them.\n\nOverall though, Technobabylon proves to be a decent, if somewhat inconsistent, game. Its aspirations seem higher than what the engine provides, so hopefully one day the creators will be allowed to take control of a more ambitious project.\n\n3/5","October 25, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Without shame, I looked up help guides on five occasions, but this is more a fault of points and clicks in general and not Technobabylon specifically.\n\nThe story is deep and wonderfully written. Like all great cyberpunk works, Technobabylon's tale asks thought provoking questions about our future and has two very satisfying, if unsettling, endings.

Sure, the cyber stuff is sort of hokey in this day and age, but that's just the stage they created to set the story in.\n\nLike the rest of Wadjet Eye's games, 'Technobabylon' is also a puzzle-filled detective story, with well-written, interesting characters who each have their own personalities and motivations. With the exception of a few obscure puzzles where I couldn't figure out the developer's intentions (a common issue for this kind of game), the rest of the puzzle are enjoyable and logical.\n\nIf I had to give a star rating, it would be 4/5 stars.","June 11, 2015","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It would be a pity, because the game is a must buy.\nMaybe they should make a Kickstarter campaign for the next one, I'm sure their fans will get behind it.\n\nOne other important thing about adventure games: the puzzles. I strongly believe that the puzzles should advance the story, not just be thrown in so you have something to do.

Technobabylon manages to find some fresh perspective on these puzzles, keeping most of their components within reasonable grasp and still manage to deliver a fantastic plot with engaging characters at the end of it all.\n\nPresentation is beautifully executed, as i have come to expect with Wadjet Eye games, thus enables the player give in and throw themselves into the experience completely. There were some really cool and interesting puzzles involving the "Trance", along with a lot of humour stitched effortlessly next to some gruesome and possibly even barbaric scenes. I did find that one or two puzzles that involved the dreaded pixel hunt, and one puzzle in particular involved a reflex mini-game...which i hate with a passion in these types of games.\n\nFantastic game and well worth the price of admission. It really shows what a quality team can do with AGS and I'm glad to see it has come so far over the years.","February 19","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The storyline is amazing & well executed! No annoying plotholes! Every relevant piece of information was sufficiently developed & clarified throughout the whole game.\n\nEven though there were quite a bit of technical terms implemented in this game (which sometimes felt like I was learning a new language) I most definitely enjoyed the game! I found it very interesting & exciting!\n\nThe puzzles were of a satisfying difficulty. There was a good balance of "flow" & "resistance" in regard to game progression (for me, personally).\n\nWhat I mean by this is that puzzle difficulty allowed for smoother progression at some times, and at other times I felt I was required to think a bit harder before I could proceed (without doing my head in  though).\n\nSo I was very pleasantly surprised by how the developer team pulled this off!\n\nI figured out most on my own, but did need to cheat about 2 times (hey!, that's not too bad!).\n\nThis game contains different fun elements:\n- beautiful character design & environment + fitting music\n- natural voice acting (although the way it was scripted made some reactions seem over-the-top)\n- well written dialogue (made sense)\n- multiple & meaningful character introductions\n- intuitive & original puzzles (with some exceptions, but definitely doable)\n- flashbacks\n- choice & consequence\n- virtual reality & AI theme\n- ethnical diversity\n- taboo & shocking details\n\nThere's a total of 3 main characters (which are each playable at some point, and even interchangeably so near the end, so as to have them act as a team - very fun!).\n\nJust wished they had implemented that possibility sooner!\n\nI pretty much loved everything about this game :). I could see myself replaying it over & over again in a couple of years from now!\n\nThis game gave me the chills (in a good way), the way Blade Runner did back in the day! It's so refreshing & different!\n\nI'm hoping there will be a sequel to this! There has to be! The ending (as is) is acceptable, though I'd love to see more :)!\n\nSo worth the price!","February 11","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The solitions to the puzzles require a bit more emersion than is allowed by this style of game, however hints are usually not far off. Very much a game where you really have to read between the lines if you want help, although some are outright unfair (found myself looking at the walkthrough and uttering outloud "What the hell!"). I was more of a Normaility fan when point and clicks came to my door 1st of all, but this has to be one of the best adventure games I've ever played, very much sticking to the "3 is a crowd" style of storytelling. Plenty of game design tropes rolling around in this one, but defines itself away from any other type of game like a finely composed score... old, new and beutiful, all at the same time. Many minds made this game, many styles approched it, they found a way to compromise and create a consistant gaming narrative, by giving everything a space in its own world that is delibratly jenky and seemless at the same time.

It must be me and my diet of modern hold-your-hand grade 5 logic puzzles, and shoot-pointblank-don't-think FPS's, but it took me a while to figure out a few of the challenges. That's not really a bad thing, as the puzzles are (mostly fun) and very creative in thought and execution (the CI program on the synths ensures hilarity), and overall, it's a refreshing experience for cerebral activity in their gaming. Just be prepared to use the noggin! ;)\n\nCharacters are mostly cliche-free ridden, with talented but vulnerable Latha, transgender protagonist Max (a minor but still notable detail), and "old-man" technophobe Charlie, a Texan who finds himself caught in a situation he doesn't want involving his deceased Sri-Lankan wife. In fact, very noticeable are the diverse and different ethnicities and characters; again it's something new and different in media. (Heck, the setting of fiction Newton city is India, not "New York," or even LA!!)\n\nThe music sets the world mood excellently. From the calming sooth and placid feel of escapist Trance lobbys, to dour, gritty feel of investigate megacity murder, the audio matches the setting, tone, and pace mirroring the on screen action.\n\nThe writing is wry and writty; sardonic Max makes one sarcastic quip after the next, and Charlie has his own way of handling things, as does Latha, but really, so do all characters, major and minor alike, with a writing humorous style in  constant flow. On note of the characters, the voice acting is quite impressive, with characters carrying the wit and humor far, and giving some mostly convincing dramatics. The narrative engages, and the plot catches, though listen and pay careful attention to the narrative earlier than later, otherwise you'll miss a few things, as well as some "oh wow!" story revelations.\n\nI can tell that it was a small studio (probably very small actually) that made TB, but there was a lot of love and care put into it and it shows. The game is very charming, and in the days of 4K res, 60fps, blah, blah, it at least gathers an unhealthy, grimy ambience to the entire cyberpunk setting. One other thing to appreciate, despite the small studio size, Technobabylon retains from feeling like a tiny indie game with peesy commercial value. Give or take a few noticable modern things, if this was back in the day and you'd said a big studio made it, I'd have swallowed it in one go.\n\nSome minor gripes: one puzzle involving a crime scene you stumble into is particularly hard to solve because of a particular items lack of visibility. I quite stumbled onto it by accident, but this could have been spelt out a little better. Another thing, at times the narrative and plot convolutions are hard to follow. Truthfully though, since when was cyberpunk known for ease of rite, accessibility, clarity and understanding? TB's narrative clunks are all intentional right? XD\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nIf you're a cyberpunk aficionado, love classic pointers, and like engaging logic puzzles (relative to the brain drizzle on today's market), you'd be a nob to ignore Technobablyon.\n\nThis was my first Wadjet Eye Games game, and I'm definitely checking out the rest of their catalogue.\n\nFinal verdict? For general gamers, 9/10, but for point click adventurers/cyberpunk fans, a definite 10/10.\n\nBuy this game, and enjoy!!","May 28, 2015","true","23.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is one of the most complex and captivating games I've played in a long time and if you're a fan of point and click games or just love the Cyberpunk genre; it's an absolute essential purchase.\n\nThe game takes place in 2087 in the City of Newton -  an AI run City where genetic engineering dominates humanity and an online Trance craze has taken over society where human interaction plays secondary to online communication. The City is also ran by CEL - the Police, who see and control everything. The conspiracy-driven narrative follows the story of three playable characters;- Charlie Regis a CEL agent and his case officer partner Max Lao along with Latha Sesame; a jobless Trance addict who spends her time fixed in a fantasy online world as opposed to the heavily controlled Newton. After a spate of bombings in the city and a criminal on the run who steals people's memories - the 'Mindjacker'; the game flourishes into a sublime and depth-ridden tale of corruption and intrigue. Elaborating any further would be a huge spoiler but it is simply an incredibly well crafted narrative that is extremely thought-provoking and powerful.\n\nThe general gameplay is similar to that of classics in the genre and modern titles alike such as Blade Runner and Gemini Rue. It's a puzzle-oriented point and click adventure with some very difficult and well-designed puzzles. Some have been very smartly implemented and can often leave you feeling confused and hapless. The satisfaction when you solve a problem and progress a wonderful feeling though as well as earning achievements. Voice acting is also present and is supported by some very appropriate music that adds to the amazing atmosphere. The writing is also very impressive with many clever fictional futuristic aspects being added that brings intrigue and understanding what happened in the past. Some of the script terminologies are very complex though and users sometimes have to decipher and guess what the game is talking about as some things aren't explained clearly. You will gradually understand everything as your progress though, as the narrative begins to fall into place and terms are elaborated in greater detail.\n\nOverall; Technobabylon is one of the best games I've played this year and another massive success for WadgetEye Games and Steam debut developer Technocrat. The game is complex, challenging, engaging and a remarkable experience throughout. It will take 12-15 hours to finish and with plenty of achievements on offer; there is certainly replay value here also.

Beneath a Steel Sky. Police Quest. Blade Runner. You name it. If its 80 Sci-Fi or Cuberpunk then i am the happiest guy you will find for miles. Games like Technobabylon are not only scarce, they are worth gold. I knew when i saw the Title of the game it would be exactly what i wanted. And after installing the game and seeing the menu for the first time, hearing the music, i knew that GTA V would have to wait. All my games would have to wait. It's been an amazing 18 hours.  Even if i tried i couldnt praise the game enough. The Art and Music direction already puts this apart from most Adventure Quest games.  But the story just makes it unforgettable. It pulled me in and kept me fully immersed in the City of Newton and it's inhabitants. Just please, do yourself a favour, and get this game if you are serious about old school quest adventure games with a good plot, full voice acting for all characters you get to play and meet, yes, you play multiple people, a great sound track, well written dialogue, and clever puzzles. The world and it's characters are believable and unforgettable.","May 26, 2015","true","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You will love the first half hour or even the first hour depending on how long the initial puzzle takes you however any sense of this being a game for adults swiftly flies out the window by the second chapter.\n\n*Potential spoiler*\n\nIn the comments below reviewers are making claims such as the "good voice acting" or "impressive story line with interesting characters" and....for the life of me I cannot comprehend how. In the three hours that I played I was introduced to three archetypes that were neither interesting or unique in any fashion. I lost faith in the "fleshed out characters" when a man fell from the sky and landed on a nearby car outside to which my characters calmly looked at the body made a few offhand remarks about how odd that was and proceeded to discuss the next objective. It could be argued that since the "Omnipresent" AI controls so much of the city that even sudden murder is viewed with an almost apathetic reaction but the game does little to give the player any sense of immersion or backstory for this to be believed. The dialogue is poorly spoken and the characters are bland cardboard cliches.\n\nThis being said, I will admit that the interactions with some of the computer programs was genuinely fascinating and fulfilling. It is a sad state when the only enjoyable moments in the game come from the various AI interactions with panels and programs then with the actual human characters.\n\nRereading the description I feel I should have known better.\n\nA cyberpunk adventure game from the studio that brought you Gemini Rue and Blackwell! The year is 2087. Genetic engineering is the norm, and an omnipresent AI powers the city. Take control of three citizens of this world as they struggle to understand a deadly conspiracy.\n\nAn exclamation point and the phrase "generic engineering is the norm."\n\nI was not going into this game expecting novel trilogy building depth but if you are going to make a puzzle adventure game (and I am using the phrase puzzle lightly here) then you must make people care about what is happening and build a sense of interest in the characters.\n\nTL;DR\nRetro graphics cover up bland story with horrible voice acting and cliche story. Would recommend to people with more simplistic tastes.","September 30, 2015","false","3.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","1"

Most people coming to play Technobabylon are coming from the game Gemini Rue, so I'll explain it sort of from that viewpoint. If you haven't played Gemini Rue, it's pretty similar to this game, although quite a bit more interesting.\n\nGameplay is, as one would expect, nil. There are a few small puzzles and lots of random desperate clicking around-- but, for the most part, it's an interactive story; similar to something you'd find made by Telltale games, except you don't really have freedom of choice other than the somewhat-literal deus ex machina at the end of the game. This is not an inherently bad thing, but DOES mean that high expectations are held for the game's story, which is where things start to fall flat.\n\nThe story, in a similar manner to Gemini Rue, is focused around the lives of three characters-- and none of them are particularly interesting. We've got an infertile genre-required police detective under blackmail, a transsexual tech-expert cop, and a 'trance-junkie' (who remains entirely unrelated to the other characters until the last ~10 minutes of gameplay), the 'trance' being a cheap knockoff of William Gibson's idea of 'cyberspace'; an idea that's been taken almost nowhere past its origins in the genre. The villains are also mostly uninteresting-- which is quite a turn-off.\n\nTechnobabylon piqued my interest, especially at the beginning, but really only left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Every time that I thought that the game was about to get better, it'd get worse-- whether because of boring puzzles or because of boring plot cliches.\n\nI'm not going to say that Technobabylon is a trainwreck, but it's certainly not worth the $15.","July 8, 2015","false","9.1"," 10 of 30 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","10","30","0","0"

This game relies on you understand what everything in the future world is without explaining what it is. This makes for annoyingly frustrating puzzle solving that counteract the normal ways of solve problems. Doesn't help that everyone seems to have a shrill and annoying voices.\n\nOne example early on is getting the food dispenser to print a metal fork. Apparently your anti-virus is kept inside the keypad to your door, not your computer. I can't be alone in say "what the ♥♥♥♥, how does this make sense!?" Other puzzles seem as counter-intuitive, some even seem to be there for no reason as the solution they place in front of you seems to be the time consuming and ultimately pointless options. I speak of the keycard door, you don't need the code despite all indications pointing to the fact that you do, the girl you're with just shoots the lock if you mention the lock to her, which negates the reason for trying to find out the code to begin with.

Three viewpoint characters you swap between at plot points (two cops with biosci PHD's, and a jobless net addict), one of whom happens to be trans -- an interesting throw-away detail that doesn't define the character.\n\nThemes include AI, surveilance, and a little bit about the definition of consciousness.  You get to make morally-based choices on things, by which I mean stuff like "blame this guy for something serious because you think he's evil, or blame the real but more personable culprit".  Only some of these choices effect the ending, but that's okay.  Overall this game was immensely satisfying, and was very full of detail and story.

This particular dystopian cyberpunk society includes a youth fad where people use nanomachines to give themselves the symptoms of "retro" diseases, a street preacher that wants to sell you drugs to get you addicted to the real world and off the evil internet, and more competing factions than you can shake a stick at.  Three viewpoint characters you swap between at plot points (two cops with biosci PHD's, and a jobless net addict), one of whom happens to be trans -- an interesting throw-away detail that doesn't define the character.\n\nThemes include AI, surveilance, and a little bit about the definition of consciousness.  You get to make morally-based choices on things, by which I mean stuff like "blame this guy for something serious because you think he's evil, or blame the real but more personable culprit".  Only some of these choices effect the ending, but that's okay.  Overall this game was immensely satisfying, and was very full of detail and story.

From the atmospheric opening credits to the tumultuous ending, this game is packed full of originality and atmosphere. In Technobabylon, you play the role of two disenfranchised citizens in the sprawling metropolis of Newton. The year is 2087 and the entire city is controlled by an all-seeing, all-knowing artificial intelligence known as ‘Central.’\n\nCharlie Regis, an old-school detective with a background in human engineering and a poverty-stricken young woman named Latha Sesame with an addiction to the ‘trance’ (a kind of futuristic, full-sensory internet) serve as our protagonists. Charlie does not trust Central to the point that he regularly covers up the camera in his office under the pretence that it is malfunctioning. His appreciation for privacy and his belief in the human side of police work make him something of an odd-ball in a city which simply accepts the convenience of rule by AI. He serves as the plot’s moral compass, especially when compared to his partner, Max Lao, who embraces the complexity of technology in all of its forms. Similarly, Latha Sesame is an expert at the use of the trance, a kind of state of meditation which allows humans to physically interact with computers and technology through the use of an organic material known as ‘wetware.’\n\nIf I’m making the plot of Technobabylon sound complex that’s because it is, but the game presents it in such a way that it becomes easy to digest. Take, for example, the concept of the ‘trance.’ The opening puzzle shows the player exactly how this works when Latha is unable to leave her apartment due to a power cut. She must then utilize her abilities to trance with the various AIs which control the objects in her room. One of them is a security obsessed anti-virus program, designed with the personality of a medieval knight. The other is an annoyingly chirpy, anime-inspired computer chef named ‘Cheffie’, responsible for cooking and preparing meals for the inhabitants of all apartments in the city. These AIs become some of the most entertaining and ultimately compelling characters in the game and in truth, I was left feeling that Technobabylon could have explored this idea further. There are other AIs in the game but not nearly as many as I had hoped for and that early promise was, to a certain extent, never delivered upon. But in truth, I’m nit-picking.\n\nDespite suffering from the often convoluted style of puzzle-design that seems to have dogged the point-and-click genre forever, Technobabylon’s puzzles are usually tough but fair. However, where the game really shines is in its presentation of the city of Newton and its inhabitants. The colossal sky-line flanking the highway as Charlie’s patrol car speeds to its next destination, the incorporeal cyber-bar where trance-addicted techno-junkies meet to anonymously dance and play computer games, the dilapidated, graffiti-ridden factories of an abandoned district of the city. All these locations come together to create the impression of a living, breathing city, a city that you believe could really exist sixty years from now. This is aided in no small part by the excellent, ambient soundtrack which, for me, was very reminiscent of the original Deus Ex’s score.\n\nThe plot is brilliantly original, especially in the already bloated cyberpunk genre, a genre which Wadjet Eye have already explored in 2011’s ‘Gemini Rue.’ But where Gemini Rue’s World felt oppressive, claustrophobic and ultimately constrictive, the city of Newton feels open and is presented as a bastion of liberal thinking and left-wing acceptance, all the while giving you the impression that this image might just be merely another tool for control of the populace. Valtaire’s famous statement that “it is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere” springs instantly to mind and this subversion of the old cyberpunk cliché of a right-wing government being obviously evil and brutally oppressive is a real breathe of fresh air.\n\nTechnobabylon is definitely a game for fans of the genre. If you’re looking for non-stop action and intense gameplay then you won’t find it here. But chances are, unless you’re a Victorian time traveller who has never played a computer game before, you already knew that. Solid puzzles, beautiful level design, decent voice acting and a constantly intriguing plot make Technobabylon an adventure well worth embarking on and at just $14.99/£10.99 it is also an adventure which won’t break your wallet.\n","July 9, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Things that attract me to the genre include; neon lit futuristic worlds, crazy looking characters who often have their own street lingo, integration with technology, people having their snazzy wee devices (comm links, data pads etc), mad plots & conspiracies...The list goes on.\n\nWhat Technobabylon has; A bright, neon lit futuristic city, cool devices called travellers that you can use to phone people browse the web etc, people who live in cyberspace and are very much integrated with tech and a mystery that threatens to bring the entire city to collapse.\n\nI loved every minute I played of Technobabylon, it is a very welcome step back to the adventure games of old, in the vein of Beneath a Steel Sky or Broken Sword. The world and characters are layers deep, as mentioned above, you can browse the net in game, play games, read the news, even check your mail. The characters have multiple dimensions that give them (and by extension the player) motivation to make questionable decisions. Also something I find quite novel for a point n' click, there are often multiple ways to resolve a given situation instead of having to find the right items to be used in the right way to advance. It has a fantastic story and typical of any SCI-FI piece, throws loads of nouns at you to wrestle with bringing you deeper into it's world.\n\nTL;DR Great game with fantastic characters & story, any SCI-FI fan particularly of things from Bladerunnrer to The Matrix should definitely check this out.","April 27","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But also pretty formulaic – not surprisingly, I suppose. I'm strongly reminded of the Wadjet Eye catalogue in general, and especially the cyberpunk Resonance. Wadjet Eye has a certain type of point and click game they like to produce over and over, but I'm liking it so far.\n\nThe ending goes, unfortunately, the way of – well, it's not a button press to decide the fate of the world, but you can see one from there. You can also see the Versalife building's neon adverts, for what it's worth.","May 5","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Even if its not very long, but more medium-length, its a very nice game and pretty easy to grasp what to do once you finish the first apartment.\n\nThe game is a longer variant of the "point of click" games that exist on the internet, but with a very nice science-fiction setting.\n\nHOWEVER. This jumping back and forth in the storyline timeline, makes me confused and its pretty impossible to piece together the storyline. For example the subway bomb event and the apartment bombing could have been placed before the apartment event in the very beginning\n\nSo, if you like storytelling, this game is pretty confusing, but for enjoyment and a good puzzle game, this game is great.","May 24","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This time the plot is set in a cyberpunk future, and although the atmosphere is great, the downside is that you are likely to have difficulties learning how certain concepts work. Especially in the beginning. However the puzzles are quite good and entertaining, the voice acting is great and the plot twists will appear whenever you are not expecting them.\n\nA solid recommendation for those who appreciate a good point-and-click adventure.","May 31","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the story, atmosphere and immersive lore compensates makes up for this.
