I found a strategy guide dated 2012 when I was looking for the original publishing date which I did not find.  Since I am fool for old school I like it, of course.  Old school games are hidden object driven and with no time limits, no misclick penalties and no penalties for hints. (Hints are expected and a lot of hint use is normal.) There is no map or achievements (in-game and definitely not Steam).  All these things simply do not exist in this game.  The storyline is simple, very simple. (Some fairy tales are more complex.)  This game is also more or less open world, and the gamer has the freedom to chose what to do and do it in whatever order they want.  The game is not linear, it progresses.\n\nStory: A paranormal investigator has been called to the town of Deadwood to free them (the town) from the vengeful and murderous ghost of the infamous gun man Blackjack.  In life Blackjack killed 21 men, in death he killed many more.  How does one save an entire town and all its residents from a vengeful ghost?  Break the curse, of course.  Oh and a long the way meet all the resident ghosts which are conjured up by the investigator's psychic gift of seeing and talking to the dead.\n\nGameplay:  As I said before this is old school with just a bit of that point and click element of picking up inventory items as the gamer goes by.  This game is Hidden Object scene driven.  The Hidden Object finds are drawn in, not overlayed, making some of the find clues uniquely intesting when one sees the "whole" thing.  Many of the find clues are very fragmented and nearly unrecognizable after they have been found and the gamer can see them.  Just thought I would mention that.\n\nSome reviewers have complained about clicking on some of the objects which do not seem to be obtainable until clicking all over the find object.  I am not going to say this does not happen, however, I would also like to point out a quite clever thing the developers did with the Hidden Object scenes.  The Hidden Object scenes break down into three types: straight find clue lists (no fragmented or extra hidden places to look in), find X amount of objects and silhouettes.  The X amount of objects are straight forward and very easy.  A fast clicker can probably complete these in about ten seconds.  The straight find list have some well hidden finds, in some cases, but are easy enough.  Neither of these types have the above mentioned "issue/problem" of having to hit just the right spot either.  However, the silhouettes in some cases do.  I believe that is because the developers did something quite clever with the silhouette scenes.  A general silhouette find for most players goes like this, see the silhouette then click on that object in the hidden object scene.  And I believe most people played exactly that way.  Yet what these developers did was make the silhouettes MOVEABLE so they CAN BE PICKED AND PLACED OVER THE FIND OBJECT IN THE PUZZLE SCENE.  The silhouettes actually lie on top of other another and can be moved around in the clue box, as well.  So the silhouette hidden object puzzles can actually be played either way, locate the find object in the puzzle scene and click on it, or move the silhouette on top of the find object.  Some of the very obscured find objects are very hard to click on and to find the right spot, but if the silhouette is laid on top of it, walla, find clue completed.  I found this quite fun once I realized that this happened.  Very clever.\n\nPuzzles:  This game has real puzzles, and I do mean that literally.  Put the pieces in place, whether the pieces are rectangles or circles, to form a picture.  One clever type of puzzle is matching the puzzle piece to the picture that has been divided up in mini-hexagons like a beehive.  There are not many puzzles in comparison to the hidden object scenes, and they are usually found on doors or pictures or some "locked" place.\n\nThis is a relatively short game, just a few hours, but enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nJust a few words on music, art work, and voice acting which I seldom ever comment on.  The music is repetitive but fitting, though maybe it is just me but some pieces seemed louder then others, since I found myself adjusting the volume from scene to scene.  Art work is very stylized and quite typical of the art style when this game was first published.  Voice acting .... hmmm...  The undertaker's voice was as annoying as his character, so the voice acting was "spot" on, even if I did not like it.  The voices in general fit the characters, though I think they tended more toward Southern accents instead of Western ones.\n\nOverall an interesting game to play with quite different game elements and puzzles then those found today.\n\nOh one last thing I am unsure why this is a collector's edition.  There are no extras, no wallpapers, no extra chapter and no strategy guide that one usually associates with collector's editions.","October 12, 2015","true","4.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

I played the game on the hard mode.\n\n-The story in itself is horrible and lacks depth, but that is okay, cause it is just a 'hidden object game', and I do not expect an in-depth story any more. It is as if the genre itself is lacking that final push to become more modern. This particulary story left me very unsatisfied, and I was not ready for 'the end'.\n-The puzzles are also quiet bad and not very challenging, having few types. Most of them is about matching a puzzlepiece to a screen, but the shadows makes it obvious.\n\nThese two I can live with, but the worst is still to be written:\n\n-The hitbox within the HIDDEN OBJECT mini-games are NOT MATCHING WITH THE CLICKABLE ITEM! However, there is also no penalty from clicking fast over the entire screen. The items are also reused a lot, having the same bowl with the same items in, in almost every scene. Those are not the clickable items, but it makes it easier to look past - you simply know that you're not searching for it.\n-The game lacks LOGIC! If you need, lets say, a hammer, you cannot take any hammer - you need THE hammer. I realize that this occurs in other games, and I've played a lot of hidden object games over the years, but this is by far the worst.\n\nI also had no horrorfeeling what so ever, and I believe it is because of the lack of suspense. Also, many games become more horror-like if you can actually be harmed.","September 28, 2015","false","3.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

The highlight was one HO scene with a belt arranged in a loop, which was not only half hidden behind the interface, but the game wouldn't accept that I found it until I clicked the empty space in the middle of the loop.\n\nMight be forgiveable if the rest of the game was good, but the story is bland and the puzzles are incredibly lazy. A lot of them involve finding the pieces of a lock, and then suddenly the lock turns into a really bad jigsaw puzzle and you have to put the pieces together, because anything more complicated would be too difficult to program, or something.\n\nI played the whole thing (about 2 hours long) because I apparently have no better outlet for my newfound masochistic tendencies.

It may not win awards with its writing, but its many good hidden object scenes certainly should put it on the map of any HOG fan.\n\nLong version:After playing through Ghost Encounters: Deadwood, I’m somewhat baffled by the abysmal Steam ratings. Sure, this hidden object game isn’t a masterpiece, but it is far from being bad.\n\nThe story has a fairly average premise: a paranormal investigator decides to get to the bottom of the curse of a desolate Western town hunted by a vengeful spirit of an outlaw. What she sees there though is anything but a predictable HOG story. Nothing ground-breaking, and the voice-acting is rather mediocre, but it has its own moments and even a few well-written surprises.\n\nGameplay is simple and the puzzles quickly get repetitive, probably this is why we get tons of hidden object scenes instead. As a feature presentation, they work great: the scenes are crowded, but only to the point to be fair in their challenge. In my book, this aspect alone should earn Ghost Encounters a spot in most HOG fans’ libraries.","May 29","true","14.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Will she lift the curse? Will she save those who are apparently alive?\n\nThe story is good and sad. Many ghosts are staying because they're not at peace concerning their loved ones or because they're tied to earth by stuff. Also, many twists will let you scream "NO!!!!!". Yeah, true, the ending is happy in the sense where Deadwood is uncursed. But is it really an ending like you would have preferred?\n\nAnyway, the problem with the game isn't hidden objects scenes or puzzles. They're just what you need. However, by moments, you don't know what you have to do and it's frustrating. Another big problem is the "get back to a previous scene". In almost all games, you have an arrow just above the inventory that lets you go back. Here, nope, you have to click an arrow next to the inventory. When you're used to the standard way, it's hard to remember that.\n\nAnyway, the graphics are pretty good as the soundtrack. While you're in a town set in the far west, you visit a lot of places: mine, saloon, even the funeral home!\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes.

While there are some minor technical difficulties, i.e. a few objects in the HO scenes took some pixel-hunting to obtain), nothing is off-the-charts bad.  There were honestly so few of the "why is it taking me 150029492 clicks to get this object" problems, it didn't bother me much when it did happen.\n\nThe game ran perfectly on my newish Windows 10 laptop.  No issues whatsover.\n\nGraphically a little older-looking but still nice-looking.   Voice-acting was decent which is all I've learned to want in a HO game.  Music and sound was well done.\n\nThere are not a lot of frills to this game; no interactive map, no achievements, no extra objects, etc. which we've learned to expect thanks to the really spectacular Artifex Mundi games, but this game strikes me as an older one from a time when the bells and whistles weren't so prevalent.   It doesn't bother me any but if you're expecting something like the newer, shiny games, you'll be setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a perfectly passable HO game and worth it if you can grab a sale (I wouldn't recommend full price due to the couple of minor issues listed above).  As long as you don't expect a masterpiece, it's an amusing use of a couple hours with a story that's surprisingly touching at points.","October 4, 2015","true","3.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It's a traditional point and click adventure with a horror setting.\nIn this game to make progress in story mode you will have to go through some mini puzzle games like, find the objects, match the objects, match the broken pieces etc and sometimes this puzzle games can be very tiring and repetitive. Like all other point and click adventure game you will have to collect the right item and use it for the right situation. There is nothing new.\nStory is not that good and voice acting is so-so. But, background music is good. This game's music will give you the horror feeling and it matches with the game perfectly.\n\nIn the end I kinda enjoyed this game in my own way. I think its a good puzzle/educational game for kids and they will definitely enjoy this game. To be honest the current price for this game is kinda high.

Because as soon as you press Play the game crashes, I tried all the regular stuff to fix and patch it, but nothing, really nothing worked. Neither looking up the newest drivers of my Video card, neither updating Flash, Shockwave and other things, not even installing it on another harddrive did work... the game seems to have serious troubles with running correctly. It crashes almost instantly.\n\nThis is, of course not a reason to recommend the game and thus I vote for:\n\nNot Recommended\nBecause of bad user support, general (often not working) links to get the game running.\n\nI will change this review as soon as I get the game started alongside with the solution to the troubleshooting.\n\nAddendum as per 09 September 2015\nI have litterally given up on the game and on the support.

The mini game puzzles are also very easy pretty much across the board, so don't expect to really stretch your brain here.\n\nIt is perfectly playable (and currently ridiculously cheap), so if you want another HOG then this is a perfectly acceptable option if you aren't too picky.","October 31, 2015","true","4.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I more or less enjoyed it, but it has plenty of drawbacks that some people might consider deal breakers.  It wasnt bad, but it wasnt great either. If it sounds interesting, grab it on a discount, but I wouldnt pay full price.\n\nThe game is very buggy. For me, nothing was voiced until I clicked the characters a second time, and then the voice audio would ignore all volume settings. Not game breaking, but very annoying. Clicking objects in the puzzles wasnt an exact science either. You had to click them just right to get it to register that you found the item, and more than once I sat there spam clicking an object until the game registered that I found it.\n\nStory wasnt too bad, but it was pretty predictable. I wont spoil it, but I figured out the "twist" pretty early on. Was a bit hard for me to feel involved in the story, but it was interesting enough for me to want to finish the game and see the ending.\n\nPuzzles were pretty easy and repeated a couple times.\n\nIn the end, the game is a very basic hidden object game with its fair share of bugs. It isnt terrible, but it certainly isnt that great. It was a nice, short, relaxing playthrough though.

The puzzles a mild brain teasers and they story seems sparcely put together.  Some of the hunting around for items is a little disconnected.  Not sure if I can honestly recommend this game, I am not really certain I understand why Blackjack was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, just knew he was killing the whole town and thats it.....I just felt more could be put into the story and in the puzzles. Graphics are on the line of similar hunt and pecks, so its got that going for it.  The searchables were a little broken and I dare someone to truly try to play this game without using a hint, let alone find the gate in the back of the graveyard.\n\nI am willing to change my view if the designers decide to revisit this game and give it more of a story and a little more understanding of what need to happen.\n","January 2","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You had to click at the specific point on  or beside the wanted object for it to selected. Some of them took repeated clicks all over the object and around to finally get it, A little frustrating, when you can't skip anything and really need to finish the puzzle to continue.\n\nOver all loved the game and recommend it, just keep the glitch in mind.","December 5, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now don't get me wrong I absolutly love Hidden Objsct Game, this is the worst one I have ever played. The hit dectection on some of the objest is absolutly horrible i spent 20 minutes trying to click on a lizard! I figured oh i must have the wrong item, used a hint nope right item just had to find that one pixel to click on! Some of the puzzels that they love to reuse are made my the devil himself. Also the hints are vague at best which will lead you to running around the whole map trying to find out where your suppose to place/use objects, which lead back to there is NO MAP! I spent more time running around trying to figure out what i was trying to do than doing things in this game! Now i went out of my way to finish this thing that at this point i refuse to call a game, it was more like a true test of endurance and patience, but if for some reason you just HAVE to play this "game" use the walkthrough. Honestly though just save your money, getting it for free will make you feel ripped off.","December 15, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
