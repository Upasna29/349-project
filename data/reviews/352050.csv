I don't normally bother with them, but I just wanted to counter the negative reviews (most of which seem to have vanished now). There was an issue with steam upon release which apparently resulted in the game being erroneously free for a short period of time. It was never meant to be free, but some reviewers had given them a negative review simply because they felt shortchanged because they paid for a game that was free for a bit... they were saying it should be free to play, even though there are no in app purchases...Dev's gotta be supported somehow! I paid for it and I'm glad I did.\n\nThis is a fun little puzzle game. I'll put it simply, if you like puzzle games and want to try a bejeweled type game with a chess twist, give it a go. There are a few different game types, and it does seem to be tricky in some levels (especially the puzzle and challenge levels) and I'm still fairly early on in the game.\n\nIt's cheap, it is a tried and tested genre with a twist, and the dev seems to be active in the forums at this early stage, so I'd definitely recommend it if you like this type of game.\n","March 18","true","3.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","1"

Chesster is a new twist on placement puzzles which will challenge your wits to plan ahead.\n\nIf you like strategy and logic games, give this one a try.  It has an appropriate theme with three types of gameplay that will keep you up at night for just one more round. All this wrapped in a friendly price tag.","March 19","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I suppose that stuff could exist... but because not every puzzle is solvable (theres a puzzle where you have to break 15 blocks and not once has 15 blocks even so much as spawned on the puzzle, its just rng hoping the layout works in your favor) I am unable to progress any farther without just getting lucky.\n\nI'll likely keep with it and hope the rng rolls in my favor but i cannot reccomend the game.","April 15","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The king (K for short) may not move to any square where it is threatened by an opposing piece.\nThe queen (Q) can move any distance in any direction on the ranks, files and diagonals.\nThe rooks (R) move any distance on the ranks or files.\nThe bishops (B) move diagonally on the board. Since a bishop can only move diagonally, it will always be on the same color square.\nThe knights (Kt or N) move in an "L" shape. Each move must be either two squares along a rank and one square along a file, or two squares along a file and one square along a rank. It is the only piece that can jump over other pieces.\nThe pawns can only move up the board. On its first move a pawn may move either one or two squares forward. A pawn captures one square diagonally, not as it moves.","March 18","true","1.1"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

Check.\nLike match-three games (but find them a bit simplistic)? Check.\n\nLike Chesster? Check mate!!\n\nSlightly more seriously, there is one thing about this game that really, really bugs me.\n\nAnd that's the fact that I didn't think of it first.\n\nAll the simplicity of match mechanics, but with some real thought required in places. A really inspired 'obvious' blend of genres. But only obvious once you've seen it. Like some of the puzzles in the game, really. Kudos.\n\nThe interface felt a bit lethargic at first; maybe some of the animations like score calculation and so on could be given a bit of a poke with a sharp stick? But once you have adjusted to the pace that's not really a problem.\n\nI'm hoping that this is well enough supported that the dev decides to keep with it. Who knows; more levels? More game modes? I'd certainly be up for a Chesster2 or Chinese Chesster. Or even a Goster (which I can't quite get my head around; but it sounds kind of intriguing)..","March 21","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But enough to know, this game combines a wonderful blend of Chess and a weird Match3 rolled onto one game. Think you're good at Chess or Match 3....Guess again! This amazing game will give you hours of highly addictive fun and maybe a headache or two long the way, lol! Great game, Devs Thanks! Happy Gaming, Everyone!","April 3","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
