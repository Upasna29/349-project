Screencheat developer Samurai Punk does.Screencheat is a loving homage to those days, with one unique twist—looking at the screens of your opponents is essential to ensuring victory. Regardless of whether you’re playing Screencheat locally or online you can always see your opponents’ point-of-view, as the game brings back those split-screen windows that are slowly becoming a thing of the past. While playing a first-person shooter in split-screen is typically not ideal, in Screencheat it is absolutely necessary as each player in a match is invisible, thus forcing you to check their screen to discover their position on the map.While you’re not exactly armed to the teeth with weaponry, the game does feature a reasonably sizeable selection to choose from, with the majority of them being suitably off-the-wall. There are a few guns that are based in reality, such as the revolver and blunderbuss, though there are also the likes of the hobby horse, which gives you a boost of super speed and kills your enemies when you bump into them, the candelabra, which can be used to beat enemies over the head, and my personal favorite the bear bomb, a remotely detonated teddy bear that hops around the battlefield in a similar fashion to the explosive sheep featured in the Worms series.Screencheat’s unabashed love of the insanity of late-nineties/early-noughts shooters is thoroughly endearing, though its homage to the frenzied action of the likes of Goldeneye 007, TimeSplitters and Unreal Tournament is somewhat absent in its level design. Samurai Punk puts such a strong emphasis on symmetry that each map feels like it’s missing something.Thankfully Screencheat excels in its 5 game modes, which feature the likes of deathmatch and king of the hill, alongside a fun ‘One Shot’ game variant that only allows players to reload after each competitor has shot a round from their weapon, and the inventive ‘Murder Mystery’ mode which sees players being handed a selection of cards detailing the color of the room that the opponent they must kill is hiding in, alongside a picture of the weapon that they must kill them with.Screencheat’s unique concept is one that provides a nice dose of hilarity and harkens back to all those memories spent staying up late playing with friends.","December 6, 2014","true","9.6"," 104 of 115 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","104","115","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/combatwars/recommended/301970/","combatwars","CombatWars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/combatwars/","2033 products in account","An enjoyable game for those who think CoD matches are too slow.\n\nScreencheat requires you to be on the move constantly whereas games like CoD, BF, and the likes all have their campers.  In this game, other players can see exactly where you are(at least from your/their point of view) so camping is useless since they can see what you are seeing and kill you from behind. Because of that, you have to be moving non-stop while also glancing at the other three screens to see where the opponents are. It's a lot harder than it sounds because glancing at the other screens is a near requirement to survive however the intensity of the game makes it hard for one to glance away from your little quadrant on the screen. The maps are quite small so there is little to no moments for reprieve during a match lest you be blown away by a well aimed grenade. Certain map functions like air vents increase your mobility and allows you to do sneak attacks but be prepared to be shot out of the air due to the predictability of the air vents.\n\nThere are only two gamemodes at this time: A free for all Deathmatch and a King of the Hill match. A King of the Hill match is basically camping(if you can even call it that) at a specific location to gather points while waiting for the inevitable death to claim you in the form of a blunderbuss or a grenade. Deathmatch currently only supporst to 10 points per game so a player has to get to 10 kills max.\n\nCurrently, there are two maps available. The first is a Museum map with a huge fossil in the middle. There is a ramp that leads to the top, an elevator that leads you to the top floor, and an air vent that drags you to the floor below it. It's quite easy to score points on this map (IMO) because the ramp makes enemy movements extremely predictable. The second map is a garden with air vents on the bottom of the floor that can boost you to around the middle of the map or even farther. The map is slightly symmetrical in it's shape and is a lot harder to get kills on(for me at least). One positive note about this map is that in a 4 player server or 2 player server, the map's color changes so you can easily locate the enemy. In a two player server, one half of the map is blue while the other is red. In a 4 player server, the map is split into quadrants with a different color in each. Despite this, I still failed at this map compared to the Museum :p\n\nA small thing to note is the kill feed which is EXTREMELY satisfying. More often than not, it gives a small line at the top of the screen that says "_____ creamed ____" or something that basically says that you got owned. A few times, the entire screen would be filled with the text in CAPS basically rubbing it into your face that you were killed or that you killed someone. It's hilarious but causes you to screw up because you can't see where you're going and you cam be killed by another player in the few short seconds the message stays on the screen. But it is satisfying XD","July 30, 2014","true","2.1"," 97 of 123 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","97","123","0","6"

You have to locate the other players by screencheating, and then go and kill them. Every kill is satisfying. A ragdoll flops into existence when someone dies, and the ragdoll models include fish-people and chickens. There is an announcer, whose accent can be changed in the options. My personal favourite is the Australian announcer :D\n\nThere are 10 maps, which are well designed and colour-coded so that you can easily tell which area someone is in. There are 10 weapons, which are all unique. There are several different gamemodes, such as CTF (Capture the Fun), Deathmatch, KOTH, Murder Mystery (you are assigned a target that you must kill to gain points), and Juggernaut, to name a few. The gamemodes can be played FFA or in teams. There are also several server mutators which can be activated to create an even more hilarious/weird experience, like huge ragdolls, and Australian mode.\n\nThe game supports up to 8 players on a server. 4 players is a nice number, but a full server of 8 is pure insanity, and it's wonderful. You can play local or online multiplayer, or both at once.\n\nYou gain exp by playing, and as you level up you unlock bonus ragdolls (such as a hotdog) and weapon skins (such as the Cod of Duty skin for the melee weapon).\n\nOverall it's a really fun game, and it's even more fun if you have friends to play with. It would probably be a great party game. There are so many funny moments, but it can be quite competitive too, and it gets pretty intense sometimes. But it's always fun! The game needs more people playing it, so buy it sometime!","August 3, 2015","true","6.9"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","29","31","8","4"

My experience of indie FPS' has been mostly negative, some have been OK but really havn't been able to offer anything unique at the cost of smooth play, graphics and content. The concept of this game looked funny and original but I was sceptical about how fun it would actually be.\n\nBoy was I wrong. The basic concept of invisible players and having to "screencheat" to find them is really something you need to experience for yourself. Level design colors rooms differently to make it easier to screencheat - thus familiarity with the map is not everything. Games are intense and involve split second choices such as firing in the enemies general direction or glancing over at their screen one last time to determine their location more precisely.\n\nThe game offers more than this concept though. The game offers tradition kill mode, king of the hill, capture the flag. It also has a "one shot mode" where you cant fire again until 15 seconds elapse or all other players fire. As well as a cluedo inspired game mode, where you have to kill a particular player with a particular weapon.\n\nThe weapon system is also in my opinion far superior to other FPS'. Instead of being aware of weapon spawn points on maps being the key to winning, each time you respawn you pick your weapon, ANY weapon, and you cannot change it until you respawn again. The weapons are all balanced, unique in concept, and offer different strategies, advantages and weaknesses.\n\nGraphics are suitable for the purposes of the game but quite poor. If you're overly concerned with graphics in your FPS' then this game might not be for you. Otherwise there are no drawbacks.\n\nThrilling game. Best FPS I have ever played.\n\nSubscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/\n\nCheck out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM","November 14, 2014","true","5.5"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","1"

The reason is simple: I usually am very bad at them so I spend most of the time waiting for respawn and I get bored (and angry) quite easily.\nBut I love this one!\nIn Screencheat all of the players are invisible but each and avery one of them can see what the others see at the same time, so you always know where your opponents are... without knowing EXACTLY where they stand. You notice that one of your opponents is on the blue area of the map, next to a couch. Good! You too are on the blue area of the map and, look!. you're just in front of the couch. So you pull the trigger. And miserably miss by a hair's breadth. So now he knows EXACTLY where you stand (guns leave some sort of a contrail for a couple of seconds after the shot) and merciless frags you.\nIt's glorious.\nEven if I die alot, this game is so entertaining and offers so much fun I don't really care. There are a dozen of different maps and a list of different game modes and you can even add mutators (like slow-mo, walking upside-down...) to make things more spicy.\nAlso a number of well-designed Steam achievements to get.\nAlso when you die your corpse get visible for posterity and never disappears no matter how long the match is or how many dead bodies are already on the floor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/recommended/301970/","murderbits","murderbits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/","2796 products in account","Screencheat is damned clever. It is a fast-paced first person arena shooter in colorful  maps where you are always watching the screen of every player, to find their position and murder them. There are several game modes, including death match, king of the hill, murder mystery, and others. Murder Mystery is like death match, except you are given a weapon to pick up and a target to kill -- and you only score if you accomplish killing that selected target with that specific weapon. The weapons are clever, too. Rifle revolver, exploding bear bomb, blunderbuss, brave knight charging on a children's makeshift horse-on-a-stick.\n\nThe only downside is the limited player-base. As of this writing, you can find a game, but it will take awhile and you will probably be the one who has to host it. This would be improved, if the developers didn't require you to leave the game and go back to a lobby in order to pick up new players (including those who are actively spectating you and may want to join). A smarter move would be to just fill the empty slots with new players as old players drop off. If not during a game or round, then in-between rounds.

It's a lot harder than I thought as you usually screen cheat to get a general idea of where a player is, but because everyone is constantly invisible (unless they fire) you need to keep track of a lot more!\n\nThey have a great game mode called 'One Shot' where everyone only has a one shot gun and can only reload once everyone has fired their shots or a timer runs out (on memory was about 20-30 seconds) so it's a lot more tense. Other game modes like Murder Mystery, Deathmatch and Hillcampers work great as well.\n\nI really enjoyed playing this but I definitely enjoyed it more playing local multiplayer rather than online (you can actually do a combination of both: 2 local vs others online) so if you like local multiplayer games, I highly recommend this. Much fun shouting (and cheating) to be had!\n\nHere is some gameplay footage of me playing with four friends, shows really well what the game can be like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75hCcQ7upKU&list=PLgrLUq0pLmj0Bc_IEyvKkMWKJQNu_drgD&index=1","October 20, 2014","true","1.8"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

And anyone who has played Goldeneye with friends would have cheated by looking at their screen so they know where they are. Don't deny it. Everyone has done it. Well, if you have been screen cheating in a lot of games, well your work has paid off. Now it is a necessity. In this game, you have to kill your opponent but everyone is invisible. To find them, you must screencheat in order to win. This game is extremely fun if you have friends to play with. Online or Local the game proves that you can have good times with it. The biggest dissapoint is most definetly the lack of AI. There IS NO singleplayer practice mode. Also they multiplayer base is still small but as time goes by it will grow.

The basic premise is that you see a split screen with all the fighters' point of view, but you don't actually see them on yours.

The music is fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic and it fits well with the atomsphere and most importantly the gameplay as well.\nThe level desgin, I can't imagine how it could be better. The different colors for different locations makes it easier to know where your opponent is, not to mention the landmarks that serve the same purpose.

Remember how there's always that one person who's looking at your screen to find where you are? Well Screencheat is made for that one person! Except this time around, the game promotes each player to screen cheat and every one is on equal grounds!\n\nThe gimmick behind Screencheat is that every player is invisible with only each other's screen as indicators to where s/he might be. As a player, you must manage your own screen so you know where you're going and shooting, while paying attention to every one elses, so you know where to aim. It's a very simple idea that's executed very well.\n\nGraphically the game isn't much to look at. It's more functional than it is pretty. Luckily for most, this is not the type of game that people will care too much about the aesthetics, rather the mechanics. As mentioned above, mechanically this game pulls off it's goal with success. It is a pretty basic FPS when you strip away the multiscreen / invisible player gimmick, but in a game like this, simplicity is probably for the best.\n\nThe game is very fun, especially if you have a soft spot for old time local play FPS feel, even if it does support online as well as local. It's nothing too special to look at, but it is something special to play with friends!\n\nPros:\n- Frantic micro-management of multiple screens\n- Very interesting concept\n- Easy to understand and jump into\n\nCons:\n- Aesthetics are some what weak\n- Might be too mechanically simple for some","March 15, 2015","true","3.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

In this game, everyone is invisible, and it is really difficult to find them other than what the game title suggests you to do: Screen cheat, that being, looking at other players screens to determine where they are. Now by the sound of this it seems very difficult, but the intensely colorful environments and uinique areas of the maps make this far easy than as if this mechanic was in another game.\n\nOn top of this unique mechanic the developers make the game revolve around, the variety of gamemodes and customization are what make this game so much fun. From the classic deathmatch to capturing and running around with a pinata, playing this game with others is a true party (especially with 8 people at once!). Also, the customization, mutators, and silly announcers are sure to get a laugh out of you.\n\nWhen I statrted out playing this game I had a hard time trying to kill ONE guy, let alone the other 3 at once (I started playing this right as soon as the game got out of Beta). Despite me failing hard at this game it was difficult to stay mad because the style of this game is just too damn funny. Instead of throwing my controller across the room I was too busy rolling around on the floor laughing. Of course eventually I got way too good at it and now people avoid me when I try to play, but that's another story.\n\nSo to sum it up: Screencheat is a funny spin on typical FPS multiplayer games that is sure to give you a good time with friends and just about anyone online.\n","February 22","true","181.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Screen-cheating. It ruined friendships, and even killed some people. It was the worst. Until now.\n\nWelcome to Screencheat! The game where you NEED to screencheat to win! The game is where you have many game modes to play (I think there are about 10ish) and everyone is invisible. You get to see everyone else’s screen on yours, so that you can shoot into nothing and hopefully hit someone.\n\nIn this game, there are many maps that are color coded and have very unique pictures to help you find out where the person is and shoot them. This game has local co-op and full controller support. It is really fun as a party game and I enjoyed it a lot. Let’s go into some pros and cons.\n\nPros\n-Full Controller Support\n-Really Fun Concept\n-Hours of Playtime\n-Tons of Unlockable Content\n-Fun Party Game\n-Offline Play With Bots\n-Up to 9 Players\n-Cross Platform Multiplayer\n-Tons of Game Mods\n\nCons\n-Really Hard at Sometimes\n-Somewhat Crappy Animations/Graphics\n\nOverall, this game is a really fun game to play alone or with friends and it has a fairly cheap price weighing in at 15 dollars.

Everyone who has ever played a multiscreened first person shooter with their friends knows about screen cheating. We've all blamed our friends for doing it, while simultaneously snuck a quick peek at their screens to gain an advantage. It's part of the experience. The guys at Samurai Punk have taken that simple Idea, and ♥♥♥♥ing ran with it. In this game one is forced to screen cheat. All the characters are invisible, so the only way to findout where someone is, is to look at their screen. and It's hard work. There is a lot of information you have to keep track of in a match. But, there are so much going on to help you. First off the level design is brilliant. Each of the levels, for now there are only three, and laid out and colored to let you know roughly where someone is just by quickly glancing at their screen. A quick peripheral look will tell you everything you need to know. Each shot you make also reveals your location with various particle effects. If someone tries to shoot at you, you will know where the shot came from. It's simple and intuitive. you are outfitted with a number of various weapons to actually do the killing, and these weapons are all ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. There is a simple shotgun, but incredible effective. There are weirder things with the Giant bouncy ball launcher, and the "Chargey Horse." and some more standard stuff like a melee weapon (although this happens to be a giant candle stick), a rifle, and a grenade launcher. They are all Beautifuly designed and no one weapon feels more useful than the others. they each have their pros and cons and all have their idle situations. The trick is that you only get one per life, so choose wisely. There are a few bugs that need fixing, while we were playing there was an awful lot of simultaneous kills, and a few other random glitches. Nothing game breaking though. You guys, this game is incredibly fun. It reminds me of my time playing old fps games like Golden Eye, or Perfect Dark with a group of friends. but with such a new and refreshing take on the genre. Plus, It's an absolute delight to look at.\n\nIf you are interested in checking it out, you should watch our video of Screencheat\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PCXNo8P38w&list=UU8yN_FDPmI6nY0dx♥♥♥KDvA","September 26, 2014","true","6.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Y'know, you would look at your mate's screen and go full YOLO to his place to blow his head off before he could blow yours. Absolutely fair play. Well, this kinda reminds me of those times. Who doesn't remember the typical weapons from the first CoD? You know, the freaking horse head in a stick, a loving teddy bear that will tear you appart or the typical 1WW wall_hacker that made the Allies win. Yeah, don't look at me like that. Learn some history.\nWell, this game offers you the opportunity of going back in time and rekt your friends with 10 wonderful weapons. All of these weapons completely make sense and they are by far way more logical than weapons from Battlefield 3 and all those AAA titles that aim for you.\nActually this is one of the best multiplayer shooters you will probably find. It doesn't have the biggest maps, neither the best gameplay quality, but if you're full of dramatic nostalgy and tired of the typical and boooooring shooters availables nowadays, this will come as a tornado, and will get you a few hours of non-stopping fun. It's much better to play with friends, 'cause you will hear them screaming some stuff about your mom and the last night while you shoot them in the face. (This is the only reason to play with friends actually)\nSo if you're thinking about buying this game, do it with a friend or just add someone who plays often, 'cause you won't regret it.","December 5, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vulkanpi/recommended/301970/","vulkanpi","VulkanPi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vulkanpi/","81 products in account","A game that executes on its core idea very well.  It's a very good party game, as my brother and I found out, although it wasn't quite as frantic because it was just the two of us.  If we had another 2 players for the full 4 I think it would have been even better.  The maps seem to be sized for 4 players as well, though that can be remedied with a couple of settings, or playing King of the Hill, forcing both players into a small space.\n\nSpeaking of gamemodes and settings, there are plenty of them.  There is standard deathmatch, one shot (every player has one shot, and cannot reload until everyone else has shot), coin battle, capture the fun (a flag with a visible trail left in the map), juggernaut (only one player can get points, and whoever kills them is the new juggernaut), and more.  Nearly every mechanic in the game can be tweaked; from weapon selection to point scoring to campers becoming visible to adding mutators like low gravity and flappy jump.  All settings can be saved with a custom name, which is a nice touch.\n\nI am not the person to comment on the quality of the gunplay; I don't play many shooters.  I find that if it is lacking, it's made up for with the weapon variety.  It's not like you are going to get AAA-shooter-franchise level gunplay from such a company.\n\nThere are no gamebreaking bugs, but there is an issue I found with naming settings.  If I pressed the "r" key (which was bound to "use" in-game, it would save the incomplete name and return me to the previous screen.  The devs have been pushing updates fairly constantly, so that issue may not exist by the next build.\n\nThere is a lot of ridiculous things in the game, including references to other games and even MLG montage parodies, but I'll let you find that on your own.  Because if you have IRL friends, you are going to buy this game now.  So that you can play with them and so that they will no longer be your friends.\n\nEDIT: This game has native Steam Controller support, actually one of the best games to play with the SC.","August 9, 2015","true","8.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Also there are 3 announcers tochoose from, a silly one a brutal one reminiscent of games like quake, and an australian one, this isn't relevant at all but i figured i should mention it.\n\nOVERALL:\nI like this game a lot, although the lack of servers is a problem, this game is well worth your money, (I reccomend the 4 pack though otherwise you will only be able to play on weekends at certain times)","November 23, 2014","true","5.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Yes? Good. No? Fine, but you're MISSING OUT!\n\nSo, everyone has played a First-Person-Shooter, the concept is easy: Run around with a weapon, find the enemy, and shoot them. It's easy! Gamers have been doing this for years. Now, grab a drink and listen closely, this is where it gets juicy!\n\nBack in the old days of FPS' on consoles (N64, PS1, ect. ect.) when you wanted to play a game with a friend, you grabbed your extra controllers, went to a friends house, and all sat down in front of the same TV. When playing multiplayer, you all shared a "chunk" of the screen, and the "rule" was to keep your eyes on YOUR "chunk" of the TV, and no one elses.\n\nNot everyone followed that rule.\n\nPeople would look at the other players "chunks" and found out where their friends were hiding, what they were doing, and pretty much knew everything that was needed to be known to find that player, destroy them.\n\nBut what they didn't realize is that they were destroying friendships, and honorable play.\n\nThis technique of looking at the other players "chunks" was soon named "Screenpeeking", or "Screenlooking". It was a technique that was hated by everyone, and it was a general rule not to do it.\n\nThat was the old days, and due to advancements in technology, you don't have to worry about it anymore.\n\nNow, imagine if there was a game where the only way to win was Screenlooking?\n\nWELCOME TO SCREEN CHEAT!\n\nIn this game, everyone in invisible, but, you can see everyones screen, no matter where they are playing from! You literally have to look at everyone elses screen to find out where they are at, and to see where you must aim to kill them.\n\nIt's a simple concept, but it is the most nostolgic fun I've had in forever.\n\n11/10, can't wait for the Full game.

You're invisible, they're invisible and the only way to see them is to check their screens for a location. You'd think it would be easy but sometimes it takes quite a bit of skill to split your attention between four screens, keeping eyes on all your enemies and of course, on yourself. But don't think that just because they can see your screen that they'll know where you are. Some of the maps so far have been a dizzying mix of colours and shapes that don't always match up with what you're seeing.\n\nIn any case, I would definitely recomend this game, especially for LANs or parties as having people within shouting distance while you play makes it all the more fun.

This game ranks up there with golden-eye, halo, timesplitters , etc. Screen cheat has that perfect blend of nostalgia but also throws some new ideas into the mix for a fun local multiplayer experience. Everyone is invisible, so the only way to find anyone on the map is to screen cheat, and you do this by using the different colors on the map to determine where the other players are. Its a simple concept but it plays so well that you'll be screaming at your friends and having a great time. The weapons themselves are not your typically fps weapons. sure you have your standard shotgun, called the blunder bust, and the semi-auto sniper, which is the revolver rifle. Then you have the weirder weapons such as the candle abra, which is just a candle stick melee weapon and the Wall hack, which, as the name implies, goes through walls using a small beam to aim. There are a variety of game modes and a handful of maps and the developers are always adding something new to the game which keeps it fresh and entertaining to play again and again. Overall its a great buy, especially if you like splitscreen fps games.","May 29, 2015","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Usually people will have a fire effect if they shot first, allowing you to aim at them on your screen.

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the indie Multiplayer, FPS ScreenCheat. ScreenCheat was released back on October 21, 2014 by Developer Samurai Punk and Publisher Surprise Attack.\n\n\n(NOTE: This game was NOT reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher, it was a game I purchased for my own account)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QZEjXLCs2pI\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nAWESOME throwback to old-school FPS (think Goldeneye). TONS of fun.\n4/5 Definitley worth it.\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nFantastic little throwback game, this game brought me way back to when I played Goldeneye on the 64 with my friends after work at my 1st job! SO MUCH FUN!!! See, the trick with this gem is to play like we used to play in those days. The Split-Screen exists in ALL modes, you can see where your enemies are...because you cannot see them at all! Each player is invisible and the ONLY way to track them down is by utilizing the "Screencheating" method of watching their screen to find them and shoot them. it is a VERY fun mechanic that will probably be familiar to those of you who have played the old console FPS w/split screen action. The unique variety of weapons also add some extra flavor into the mix. Trust me, they are quite unique. You MUST play to see them. All in all, this game is heavy on the pros if you dig FPS or just that Old School multiplayer feel. Good graphics, fun and easy gameplay, retro feel, TONS of customization. All positives. A big negative used to be that you had to play MP, there were no bots or single player mode....but that changed back in October! You can now play this game with bots, and they helped to enhance the game further by adding some extra ragdolls and a new level too. That used to be the single biggest gripe, but with that resolved the only issues are typical (occasional server issues and or finding people) and after a while you get used to the maps. However, with 9(!) game modes, you should be good for a while....pick this one up, get the 4-pack and have a blast with friends. I know I did. 4/5 and worth it to chip in with friends and get a pack.\n\nHappy Gaming!","December 20, 2015","true","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefatfrank/recommended/301970/","thefatfrank","Fat Fronk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefatfrank/","258 products in account","Amazing game. It's very reminiscent of old N64 screen splitting games and definitely has a Goldeneye 64 feel to it, which I consider a huge plus. You have up to 4 screen and all the player models are invisible, and the only way to kill someone is by watching their screen and estimating their movement.\n\nIt's hilarious how when you build a game around what most people go to such big efforts to cheat into normal games, even big FPS games like Counter Strike and Call of Duty, you realize how hard it is to kill someone even with all the knowledge in the world when it comes to raw skill and reflexes.\n\nThe art is very pleasing and makes finding people cake, dividing each map into multiple color sections to easily screenpeak and figure out where to go to hunt down your quarry. The game looks great, honestly, and plays very well even on an old laptop. Optimized well, quite hilarious, and a lot of "pure fun" vibes going for this game. The music can be a bit repetitive after you've played so much of the game with so little tracks, but you'll be killing too many invisible men to care.\n\nThe weapons are insanely balanced and despite the small selection of maps and, there are 5 game modes that turn Screencheat into a hilarious and fun party game for you and your friends. Good luck on finding anyone in the random matchmaking, there are pretty much no public lobbies.\n\nI would buy this game again for myself even knowing there was no real community for it yet, but honestly trying to get a 4 pack and some like minded friends is your best bet for this hilarious retro-feeling game.","November 24, 2014","true","7.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/riblet/recommended/301970/","riblet","Ribs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/riblet/","52 products in account","This game is... frustrating, and frankly a bit of a gimmick. At best it's an hour or two of fun, and certinally not worth the asking price. The game expects you to see the other players, on maps that you don't know (and can't possibly learn, as they are just a mess of bright colours, and are symetrical) and somehow shoot them, even though you cannot see them. Yes, that's the premise of the game, but just *think about that for a moment*... How much *fun* is that going to be? It's clever, but is it *fun*? For me, the answer was no.\n\nAlso, the game frequently glitched for me; when someone joined or left the game, it would often still divde the screen by the old number of players, whilst trying to squash in the new number of players. This resulted in a unplayable game. Given this game is in version 3.whatever, that's kinda inexcusable. I triggered this bug several times in my short (less than 1 hour) time playing this game.\n\nI requested a refund in less than one hour of playing. This game, was, frankly, terrible. An interesting premise, but not any fun to play, and glitchy.","January 1","false","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

We are all guilty of looking at each other’s screens in split screen games, let's be honest. What this game does is make screen cheating the core of the experience - every other player is invisible on your screen! Absolutely love the game, and is receiving frequent updates at the time of posting this review (17/08/14). Also for those interested in buying the game, here's a nice feature Epic Popsicle and myself found - when another player fires their weapon, there is a smoke trail on your screen for a couple of seconds, which really helps but in my personal opinion, ruins the experience slightly but nevertheless I am sure an easy feature to tweak!

( Sometimes I got a drop to 1/2 FPS without knowing why but It was probably linked to some mutators ? )\n- Only designed for multiplayer.

Taking the occasional glance at my friends' screens during Goldeneye and it's kind. I wasn't cheating, I was practicing for this!\n\nBut Screencheat doesn't rely on peoples' nostalgia. The core gameplay is fun. It takes the basic concept of a local split-screen shooter and expands on it. The mechanic of using other players' screens to determine their location takes getting used to. A good use of colors helps make locations easily identifiable. There's a good selection of levels to choose from, as well as different weapons to help mix gameplay up. Do you want to use the Blunderbuss's range of fire at the cost of slow shooting? Or maybe charge people with a stick horse?\n\nWhile the game is based on one of the keys from local play, the split screen, online is also an option.

It’s just too much to focus on two things at once; let alone four. I mean, you can do it. It's just not always fun.

The entire game revolves around cheating. It's great for stupid fun, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're going for a competitive aspect. In that regard, the game needs to be further balanced, however, since this game is mostly casual, I can't complain much about that.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes.

There are a few different gamemodes, like Deathmatch, "Capture the Fun," which is basically like Juggernaut from Halo, and tons of others. If I recall correctly, most of these gamemodes are available in Free-for-All or Teams. The online community is non-existant, so either look for stragners online to play with, and set a time; play with friends online, or play with friends locally (but if you were going to do that then why not actually play Goldeneye 64?)

It offers a huge nostalgia kick for those who remember playing splitscreen shooters, and goes there with a light-hearted approach. It also offers a unique take on the genre. Invisible avatars creates entirely new tactical decisions. Where you are standing matters less than what you are looking at. A precision weapon with a narrow line of effect is a bit weaker when you can't see the target. Delayed weapons become a bit more difficult to aim when you can't trace their movement as easily.\n\nPros never come without their cons though. As someone who isn't the best at shooters - especially fast paced ones - having to watch numerous 'screens' and then play around with multiple perspectives can be a bit rough. The game also greatly rewards knowing the map, as you can more quickly grasp where another player is in relation to you.\n\nAll in all, I definitely enjoy the game when I'm with people I can voice chat with. I've yet to play it in a local setting, but I imagine that would just make the experience even better.","September 7, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

( Sometimes I got a drop to 1/2 FPS without knowing why but It was probably linked to some mutators ? )\n- Only designed for multiplayer. Even with bot, there isn't any real solo mode, and it's isn't as fun as it is without friends.\n\nPros :\n- Awesome deaths messages ( e.g : You got Windows vista'd by XXX ! )\n- Really, really fun with a bunch of friends ( On vocal if online, or all together on a couch ! ) The more you are, the best it is.\n- Various gamemodes, maps and weapons.

FPS gaming with a controversial thing in splitscreen gaming: screenpeeking, or screencheating! All player's screens will be displayed on all player's screens, basically meaning everyone can see everyone. The map is color coordinated, and everybody is invisible, so in order to find your foes, you must look at your screen and see what color they are close to, then go to that same location and shoot where there body should be. It's a blast.","February 27","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Doesn't have the addictiveness of rocket league or nidhogg or lethal league. It's a concept game. It's a very cool idea to play with. I can't really recommend it unless it's pretty on sale. It's got some pretty great maps though. Perhaps I need to explore more gamemodes than the deathmatch one. I may be missing more entertaining gameplay.","December 27, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is the most fun I have had with friends in such a long time.\nI can't really say much wrong with this game other than the lack of weapon skins. COME ON I WANT MORE WEAPON SKINS ;A; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nThere are a lot of different weapons ranging from Rifles to Blunderbusses all the way to Toy Horse charging! So finding a weapon that suits you is easy!\nMap variety is outstanding! Game types are diverse and all feel extremely fun!\nThis game really requires a few friends to play with, but playing with strangers can just be as fun!\nThe concept was done extremely well and getting a kill feels very satisfying cause you had to screen cheat harder than your opponent.\n\nPersonal Score : 10/10\n\nLike I said.

The multiplayer topic not many of us have said about since N64 day's of GoldenEye. But now, Aussie (yes!) studio's; Samurai Punk and Surprise Attack! Games have made a game where the only way to win, is to screencheat, and this game is called... Screencheat (not a very original name, I know). In this multiplayer only shooter that can be played locally or online (or a bit of both) has you and up to three friends battle it out in the five arena's that have been made, where you must only do one thing, KILL EVERYONE! But it's not that simple because, everyone is invisible so you must screencheat to know where they are. Obsiously, many of you will go; "But wouldn't you only see your screen on an online match?" Well the answer that wheather you are playing online or not, you will see everyone's screen's. I really enjoyed this game, I played mostly with my brother and... it ruin's your LIFE! (ish). It's just so fun, knowing that your enemy is somehwere, but you don't really know where he/she is. My only real problem is that there isn't exactly enough content here, as I said, there are currently only 5 maps, FIVE. And while the six or so game modes including "Murder Mystery", which is basically Cluedo: The Videogame. Maybe having Workshop support would fix this problem. I also found a few bugs here and there, but I'm sure they will be patched out. Overall, I really enjoyed this game and hope it is constanly updated. Not many maps and qutie a few bugs do ruin it a little bit, but the funny things that pop up after killing someone are just funny. For a game that recently came out, I enjoyed it, just make sure you have lots of friends. I'm giving it 8/10 Times I slamed my hand on the table because I got killed.

Remember how you could just look at your friend's screen to see where they were at any given time, even if they had an invisibility power-up? Well, this game was designed around that type of strategy and as far as I know is the only retail game in existence to have online split-screen multiplayer in an FPS. It's invisible screen-peeking instagib madness, and it's the most fun I've had in an FPS in a long time.\n\nMany people argue that "screen peeking" is cheating, but in this game it's the only way to win since everyone is invisible until gibbed... or fragged... or eliminated... or slammed... or unfriended... or corrupted... or #PWN'd... or any verb the kill feed decides to use. And then you find out your ragdoll is a humanoid chicken, or a man with the head of a horse, or even just a good old fashioned skeleton. The game is very silly and doesn't take itself too seriously, which only adds to the fun. Even the weapons are silly, including a remote detonated bouncing bear bomb, a stick horse that allows you to charge at your opponents, and a candelabra that acts as a standard melee attack, as well as a more traditional blunderbuss (shotgun) and revolver.\n\nEvery stage is split into 4 colored areas, and for the most part they all have some kind of symmetry to them, but they still manage to be unique and some are almost just as maze-like as the old Goldeneye 64 maps. Overall, I'd say this is an excellent game to mess around with friends in, and the 4-pack is definitely worth it if you can afford it or get your friends to chip in.","March 5, 2015","true","8.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

One system that I did not own was the Nintendo64. I was rather lucky though, because a mate of mine did. I would often go over to his house and we'd play for hours. The one game that we couldn't get enough of was GoldenEye, now a gaming classic (which is more than I can say for the Pierce Brosnan movie). The split screen local multiplayer game was heaps of fun as we ran around shooting each other, trying to get bragging rights with the most kills. As we played, we often worked out where the other was by looking at their screen. Some would call it cheating, others would say it was tactical.\n\nScreencheat plays out much like GoldenEye or games like Quake Arena in that you run around the location attempting to dispose of your opponent(s). The thing that sets Screencheat apart from those others, is that looking at other players position on the split-screen is encouraged. In fact, it is absolutely necessary because... all the players are invisible.\n\nYes, that's right, invisible\nSo, in order to make a kill, you are required to look at their screen to ascertain their position. It may seem difficult, but once you get the hang of looking at both where you're going and where your enemy is going, it becomes quite easy. And although the opposition players are invisible, there are often some telltale signs of where they are. Whenever someone discharges one of their weapons, their position becomes apparent by the vapour trail of the rifle shot, the smoke trail of the grenade launcher, the shell casings of the blunderbuss, or the flames of the candlestick.\n\nGames can be played either via a split screen local multiplayer, or, for those without friends, online with up to four players. Both play identically. At present, the weapons mentioned above are the only ones available (during the early beta), but the developers have eight lined up for the finished product. Each weapon has both its advantages and disadvantages. The grenade launcher, for example, has a large blast area, but its shots are easier to see, giving away your position. Also, you can accidentally harm yourself if you run into the grenade zone. The rifle allows four quick accurate shots and leaves a minimal trail, making it a great weapon to keep you invisible. But it takes longer to reload than the other weapons.\n\nBeta limitations\nThere are only two maps at this point, and they are fairly small, but with two to four players in a game, they feel about right in scope. The Museum map is probably my favourite of the two, with its layered rooms, the quick getaway zones and the dinosaur display in the middle. The other is an outdoor area known as the Garden. It feels slightly larger than the Museum with its four colour areas that merge together at a central statue. Hedges, large plant pots and park benches are scattered throughout the area. There are three more maps in development, and I'm certainly looking forward to exploring them at a later stage.\n\nThere are six different game modes, of which only two are playable during the beta. I did, however, have the chance to play a third, which is probably my favourite. The two playable modes during the initial phase of the beta are Deathmatch and King of the Hill. Deathmatch is self explanatory, requiring gamers to be the first to score the allotted amount of kills. King of the Hill requires competitors to stand in the hill area for forty seconds, all the while being attacked by the other competitors. The third mode that I played, which is not yet playable in the beta, is Murder Mystery. It is a rather cool mode that plays out like a game of Cluedo (or Clue, depending on where you come from). In it, the game sets a particular task to each of the combatants. Each player is required to kill a certain opponent with a particular weapon in a particular room (or coloured zone). Completing all three sections of the task gives maximum points. Other points are awarded for partial completion and for killing other players as per the traditional Deathmatch.\n\nNostalgic two to four player fun\nVisually, Screencheat matches the nostalgic feel of playing GoldenEye. But with the nature of the game it works remarkably well. The bright colours for each of the areas make it simpler to work out where other opponents are located. The controls are simple as well, with both the keyboard/mouse combination and gamepad controller supported. As primarily a PC gamer, I found the keyboard and mouse combination easier to use, but I trust players with a console flavour would prefer the gamepad controls. With its simple controls, simplistic visuals and fun gameplay, Screencheat is well worth getting into, even with the two maps and two modes during the initial beta. And, if you get in during the beta, it's free.\n\nBest. Value. Ever.\n\nAs posted on the Hooked Gamers website.","August 19, 2014","true","15.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

YOU WILL DIE REGARDLESS OF SKILL. It is incredibly fun to measures that are practically unmeasurable. If you're one of those people who just can't help it but look upon your opponents screen in order to locate them, then why not add a challenge to it but doing it deliberatly.\nThere are some problems though that i do feel should be accounted...\n\n1) Level design is quite confusing for the recently added maps (and when i mean confusing, i mean u can't even navigate through them without getting lost yourself, let alone trying to focus on your opponents screen)\n\n2)In order to win, most players will usually just look upwards whenever they are on a map with no hazards and walk around in order to locate you\n\n3)The crossbow is incredibly glitchy (you will see why)\n\n4)Online lobby is really bad, and I dont say this lightly\n\n5)No solo play\n\nOverall its a pretty fantastic game, minus the few problems that have been stated above.

YOU WILL DIE REGARDLESS OF SKILL. It is incredibly fun to measures that are practically unmeasurable. If you're one of those people who just can't help it but look upon your opponents screen in order to locate them, then why not add a challenge to it but doing it deliberatly.\nThere are some problems though that i do feel should be accounted...\n\n1) Level design is quite confusing for the recently added maps (and when i mean confusing, i mean u can't even navigate through them without getting lost yourself, let alone trying to focus on your opponents screen)\n\n2)In order to win, most players will usually just look upwards whenever they are on a map with no hazards and walk around in order to locate you\n\n3)The crossbow is incredibly glitchy (you will see why)\n\n4)Online lobby is really bad, and I dont say this lightly\n\n5)No solo play\n\nOverall its a pretty fantastic game, minus the few problems that have been stated above. I would definetly play it more once it increases in popularity, but for now people should really only get this game if its on sale or they have friends and are able to configure controls onto their PC.

Remember sticking to your own screen to avoid being called out as a screen cheat? WELL FORGET ALL THAT CRAP! Screen Cheat is a unique game that requires you to use the dirtiest of split screen moves. Players are invisible and the only way to kill them is to look at their screens, the game puts 4 (I'm not sure if it can play more than 4 players) players screens all on one screen so everyone can see what each other is equipped with and where they are on the map. You must use your skills and a range of wacky weapons to elimininate your opponents. The game, in my opinion should be free to play, but it is still heaps of fun to play with some friends over skype, screaming about F@$#%!? B*&%#@?! Kills and other screen cheating goodness.

Feel free to check out the review video below or read the text-version instead. Your choice!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBz81Dele_M\nGRAPHICS: The graphics are passable. The small polygon count, low resolution textures and outdated effects will not win any awards, however this style always clearly indicates where the players are and thus ease orientation a little.\n\nSOUNDS: Similar to the graphics, the sound design clearly shows the indie origins of the game. The music is fairly repetitive and the gun sounds are average at best.\n\nGAMEPLAY: This is the shining star of Screencheat. The concept is utterly unique and incredibly fun. There are currently two game modes, deathmatch and king of the hill, with the latter being significantly more fun. Even though these modes in themselves are no creative outburst, due to the way you have to play Screencheat, this game plays significantly different compared to other FPS. You will constantly look between your screen to roughly aim, the enemies' screens to determine their location and in the end probably be shot in the back by another enemy that you did not screencheat soon enough. There is currently a lack of maps, as there are only two maps available. The four guns feel all quite different and thus more content might only really be required in terms of maps to play on.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Especially with a couple of friends, Screencheat is a blast and I highly recommend checking this out!","August 11, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Utterly overwhelming to begin with, but accompanied with a fiendly learning curve somehow, Screencheat is a great game to pick up. I purchased it 50% off at $7.49 and liked it so much after the first couple hours that I bought it for my friend as well.\n\nCurrently, there are probably 8-10 weapons, gamemode and maps. All the weapons function very independently and are therefore quite unique. All of the gamemodes are fun. Some of them, like Hillcampers, are gamemodes you'll recognize from other games, while others, like Murder Mystery, are completely unique and refreshing. All of the maps are incredibly well designed and, while most of them are tiny, they fit the purpose of the game. I never felt cramped.\n\nAs far as "incredibly well designed..." if you decide to play Screencheat, you'll probably notice within the first few games what I mean.","March 8, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is fun, fast paced, and really entertaining when you get to pllay it. That being said, online play is severely limited, with no one on at most times. If you have friends who play it then by all means for gameplay I highly recommend you get this game. If you don't know anyone who plays it, however, you may want to skip on this until its online activity becomes enough to play.\n\n\nBottom line: Great game, but wouldn't recommend buying it without friends having it.","January 7","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So now, I will describe it. You and 1-3 other players battle against each other, but there's a catch, you're all invisible, so you have to screencheat to know where everyone else is. While it may sound boring, I can assure you that it's not. There is a good variety of weapons to choose from and the game modes are fun. This game adds a purpose to screencheating. I give this game a rating of 8/10.","November 17, 2014","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Or are/were you that kid that owned everyone in Goldeneye and Halo because you cheated?\n\nThen this is the game for you.\n\nPros:\n-Well designed Local Multiplayer\n-Fantastic with three-four friends\n-Easy to use controls\n-Colorful maps that make the game easier to pick up\n-No learning curve if played FPS games\n-Great play modes, including a mode where all players only get one shot, then wait until everyone else has taken one until they shoot again (or the timer runs out)\n-All around hilarity and fun\n-Available on the HumbleBundle Store, so you can feel good about buying the game\n\nCons:\n-Boring with only two people\n-Playing online is a nice feature, but isn't nearly as much fun when not with friends\n-In-game voice chat ay help if added, but steam chat works if playing with friends\n-Not too much variety in maps, so they can get old quickly. But still fun for a couple hours every other week\n\nIn the end, this game is well worth owning. It won't be your most played, but it is a great party game like Starwhal or Mount Your Friends.

Every time you scream and realize that you just got hobby horsed frrom behind, or realize that you shot your only bullet at nobody, this game becomes so entertaining to me. Each weapon provides a new thrilling approach, and the concept of having to keep track of so much at the same time thrills me constantly. Finally, the game never feels stale because it is always different. Never do you "figure it out" and master the game and just spam something- the screen cheat element makes nothing quite that simple.\n\nAll in all, I love the concept, the graphics are good enough for my tastes, though they could be better, and the weapons are nice. Though I think balance might need a little work- sometimes I wonder about the hobby horse.\n\nMy only complaint is about the maps. Sure, they're nice, they let you easily screencheat, yes, the colors are nice. But the actual level design itself leaves a little to be desired. Maybe it's that I feel that all of the maps were too similar, or that there weren't enough, but I think that they are the game's greatest flaw. A level designer tool or a mpa pack being released would probably fix that problem, but at the moment, it feels slightly limited.\n\nBut if you have 4 people who like to play, this is still a blast.","December 9, 2014","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

FPS games are fun, and so are local mp games. But Screencheat is a one trick pony due to its obscure game mechanic of invisible players. Aiming is incredibly difficult even if you know almost exactly where your opponent is, and after a while the difficulty in aiming becomes unfun. The alternate game modes and mutators add nothing to the experience due to poor design. Screencheat alters the core game mechanics of FPS games too much, and is therefore not comparable to games such as Perfect Dark or 007 or Halo. Splitscreen is a wonderful thing, and screen looking is a fun part of split-screen games, but invisible players just don't work.\n\nBuy Towerfall instead.","August 5, 2015","false","3.0"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

People unwilling to let spectators join the game by not returning to lobby or intentionnally delaying the game, getting cussed out of lobbies, and just rude people in general. While this may not be the game developers fault for rude people, there are many flaws that the creators should be responsible for. In the off chance that you do get into a game, you can only play 1 or 2 consecutive rounds before the game freezes on you and forces you to reopen the game. There should be a public lobby system so that you aren't forced to pick between privately hosted servers. The weapons are unbalanced and overall it just isn't very satisfying.\n\nIt is a wonderful concept with poor execution.\n3/10 for me.","November 23, 2014","false","4.7"," 10 of 39 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","10","39","0","2"
