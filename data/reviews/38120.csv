It’s quite old hence very low system requirements. Nice music and quite good graphics, though in 4:3 format. Forty-eight levels, of which at least a few is really hard to complete in the best time. Sixteen awards, some of which are quite difficult to accomplish so the best way is to find some clues on the internet. If you want to get all awards and beat all levels in the best time you must plan most of them very well and prepare for many frustrating repetitions. Highly recommended especially on sale.\n\n[PL]\nNie ważne ile masz lat – ta gra jest dla każdego. Gra jest dość stara stąd bardzo małe wymagania systemowe. Przyjemna muzyka i całkiem dobra grafika, choć w formacie 4:3. Czterdzieści osiem plansz, z których przynajmniej kilka jest naprawdę ciężko ukończyć w najlepszym czasie. Szesnaście nagród, z czego niektóre są dość ciężkie do odgadnięcia, więc najlepiej poszukać wskazówek w Internecie. Jeśli chce się zdobyć wszystkie nagrody i pobić wszystkie plansze w najlepszym czasie trzeba dobrze planować większość z nich i przygotować się na wiele frustrujących powtórek. Gorąca polecam zwłaszcza po przecenie.","August 18, 2014","true","66.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
