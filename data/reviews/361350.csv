For me, it was the latter. I'd recently ordered a Steam Link so I could play games on the big TV in my living room. I figured I should try picking up some local-multiplayer games for when I have my friends over, so I did a Steam store search of games with both the "Full-Controller Support" and "Local Multiplayer" tags. I found Skyhook about half-way through the fourth set of results. After seeing both the neat gameplay and the 50% off discount, I thought to myself "ehh...why not?" and got it.\n\nWas it worth it?\n\nAbsolutely! Even though it's still in Early Access, it's amazingly good! Here are some more specific details as to why:\n\nThe gameplay is unique, fast-paced, and downright fun! The easiest way for me to describe it is Super Smash Bros. with hookshots and 1-hit kills. There's cannon turrets, rideable gryphons and airships, numerous powerups, various game-modes ranging from classic Deathmatch to Sky Ball (Skyhook's take on basketball), as well as a list of modifiers you can add to change things up. Each gamemode has a team option, and can be played with difficulty-adjustable AI bots.\n\nSpeaking of which, the AI is commendable. The bots are good at navigating the stages, and can really give you a challenge (especially when you put their difficulty on hard xD). The bots can also fill empty slots when you're playing with only 1 or 2 other friends.\n\nCurrently, there are five characters to play as (four available right off the bat; one unlockable) and five available maps (the layouts get switched around each time a map is played, which helps add some variation to the stages), and the developer is planning to add more in the future, as well as other new content.\n\nWhich also reminds me. Skyhook's developer, Megastorm Games (which is only one guy, by the way), is actively listening and responding to community feedback/questions. So far, I've posted a question concerning bots, reported a bug, and suggested a new control scheme; each time I got a friendly, helpful reply from the dev. #awesomeindiedev\n\nControllers are recommended (I personally use a Xbox 360 gamepad), but a keyboard works fine as well. You can also use a keyboard along with controllers when playing with friends.\n\nOh, and there's also some pretty cool Twitch integration. This video showcases how that works.\n\nIn conclusion, Skyhook is a game that, though still in Early Access, delivers a distinctive, enjoyable, local-multiplayer experience, albeit with a few minor bugs here and there (that will inevitably be fixed as development progresses). At a low cost of $5 (and even less when on discount), Skyhook should be a definite purchase for anyone desiring a unique game to play with/without friends. Why are you still reading this? GO BUY IT!!!!!\n\nTL:DR\n\nAwesome Gameplay, Great Dev, Low Price, More Content Forthcoming. You can be a pirate shark and blow up a literal cat burglar with a cannon whilst it's riding a lighting-spewing gryphon, then get hookshotted to death by a teleporting desert princess-assassin.\n\n10/10","January 3","true","13.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/361350/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLike most Indie Games on Steam, you've probably never heard of Skyhook. It's a local multiplayer action platformer, or a less fancy term would be party game. As of late the market has become very saturated with party games. They have become the newest trend in gaming, from Nidhogg, Towerfall, and Gang Beasts, you name it, they come in just about every flavor. Skyhook looks to make a name for itself in a big market. Now while this title is still in active development and on Early Access, the basic core mechanic of the game is in place.\n\nWhy that would be grappling hooks of course! Who doesn't love grappling hooks, they're the best item in all of Zelda games and Batman! Skyhook challenges you with murdering your best friends using grappling hooks in its multiple arenas/levels. If grappling hooks aren't enough, hop aboard the floating ship and blast them in the face with a cannon. Now I will admit that there is only a certain amount of content to be explored here in Skyhook. Despite this though, with the right group of buddies, Skyhook can have some very dynamic and interesting battles as you bounce around its levels like a monkey on crack.\n\nOf course Skyhook features the same delicious amount of pixel goodness we have come to expect from party games. The characters are all very colorful, designed neatly and seemingly have a bit of personality. The level designs are pretty solid and allow for some pretty crazy matches as you desperately try to hook your friends to death. There are some bugs though, this is Early Access. The floating ship can be piloted into a position which makes it unusable and it just floats there like a log. Bugs are to be expected though as development continues.\n\nOther features include items that can give you a key advantage in combat, from invisibility, to mirror imaging yourself on the other players. These items add a bit of "brawl" style flair to matches and a little break from just hooking people over and over. Multiple people can also use the same keyboard for Skyhook, including controllers which I find to be a bit more intuitive with these types of games. Thankfully Skyhook does feature full controller support, so there isn't much stress in finding one that works. Also other game modes like Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, and Steam Tank which limits your grappling hooks.\n\nI had fun with Skyhook, but of course the major caveat of the game is that it requires other people to play with, in order for the game to be enjoyed. With no online multiplayer and no current single player campaign, there is only so much you can play before you move along. Now while it is still early to make a call on Skyhook, I feel the game does have some interesting potential. Grapple hooking enemies isn't the newest concept but still can be innovated in some interesting ways. Adding shifting levels dynamics like on the level seen above is a good example. Perhaps a level that is scrolling sideways/up or take a note from Speedrunners and make a racing level but solely based off your grapple hooking skills. Make a level that has glowing stars to be collected behind several dangerous obstacles, first to three wins. These are just some examples of what Skyhook could become.\n\nThere are many possibilities for Skyhook, as long as the developer continues working passionately. I am happy to say that while cruising the Skyhook Steam forums, I noticed a daily development blog that had scores of minor tweaks and updates being made. This is the kinda thing you want to see out of a developer, and should put some fears to rest for those burned by Early Access games before.\n\nSpeaking to the future of Skyhook, the developers planned features include more characters, more levels/hazards, more powers ups and environmental effects, new vehicles and mounts. Not to mention a single player/co-op campaign that will have 40 levels and other unlockable goodies. It is important to underline that online multiplayer is not a planned feature currently.\n\nSo if you're in the market for a fun party game, want something that combines elements of Mario, Smash Bros, and Speedrunners, Skyhook might be just the game you're looking for in your gaming library. Just remember to make sure you have some friends who don't mind coming over instead of playing online","June 28, 2015","true","0.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Montyblancs/recommended/361350/","Montyblancs","Montblanc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Montyblancs/","307 products in account","Short Summary\nSkyhook is a 4 player local multiplayer arena fighting game centering around a grappling hook mechanic and one hit kills. The game is similar to games like Towerfall and Samurai Gunn. It is very easy to pick up and learn, and has a decently high skill ceiling that involves reaction-based dodging and good usage of the grappling hook to get around.\n\nEvery player has a hookshot, which allows you to cling onto platforms and move around the arena quickly. The hookshot also works as a weapon, allowing you to kill other players, along with a melee mechanic. At any point, however, you're able to dodge, which gives you invulnerability frames, allowing you to pass through attacks. Each character has a different style of dodge, which is the defining factor making them unique.\n\nSkyhook offers both a good multiplayer and single player experience. With a roster of 5 characters, and 4 different game modes, the multiplayer is fun and addicting. The controls are very responsive, and any mistakes you make don't feel like it's the fault of the game. Skyhook offers a good amount of content for it's current price. ($10)\n\nMultiplayer\nMultiplayer fights are the main draw to Skyhook. As previously stated, there are 5 characters and 4 modes. There's additionally 5 different arena types, each with 2 maps each. The maps contain unique elements, turrets, moving platforms, and drive-able ships, but none of these elements are overburdening and take away from the game itself. Additionally there are items delivered randomly via chests, offering various, but not overbearing effects.\n\nThe main game mode is straightforward, be the last one alive in a fight where everyone has a set amount of lives. The other modes include 'skyball' where you have to carry and throw a ball into the enemy's goal, 'grab the loot' which requires you to hold on to a bag to increase your score, and a mode that limits the amount of hooks you can shoot, with the only way to reload being standing on a platform. These modes are fairly unique, and don't feel like just a side-thought to the main game.\n\nThere is no online multiplayer currently, only local multiplayer. The developer has expressed interest in an online mode, but this is not guaranteed.\n\nSingle Player\nThe single-player experience has not been neglected. There is a quest mode to the game that offers several unique challenges, each with their own individual high scores and achievable medal tiers. There are no online leaderboards for the top scores, however. This mode also allows you to unlock additional skins for characters, as well as the unlockable stage and 5th character.\n\nAdditionally, this game has bot AI that allows you to play the multiplayer modes by yourself. While the AI performs well in most scenarios, it has a tendency to sometimes fall off the stage or sometimes get stuck, though these issues are not terribly bad. The AI has extreme difficulty with the lava stages, however, and will often jump itself into lava a lot.\n\nProsResponsive controls\nEnjoyable, addicting combat\nEasy to learn, and the singleplayer trials let you practice your skills to become even better\nUnlockable content\nDeveloper is quick to respond to bugs and issues\nGood singleplayer and multiplayer content.\nConsLocal multiplayer only, no online\nAI sometimes gets stuck or makes poor decisions\nShould you buy it?\nIf you are looking for an enjoyable local multiplayer game that allows you to easily pick up and play with a group of friends, I would recommend this game. If you are looking for strictly a single-player game, this may not be the best choice, but you may be interested in picking it up when it's on sale.","May 17","true","1.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

I love super smash brothers enough that I spent over 100$ to get a gamecube, controllers, and melee. Duck game is my current fav game. So its safe to say that I love the Genre and as long as the game isnt too terrible I will play almost anything in this Genre.\n\nAs stated in the TLDR this is a Local Multiplayer Action Platformer, akin to super smash brothers, duck game, and towerfall. There are currently 4 playable characters, but play style does not differ very much between characters. Some are faster, some have longer grapling hooks etc. There are 3 different levels, The Castle, the Egyptian tomb, and the snowy mountains. Those are not the real names, but its a good summary of the levels. the maps themselvs vary, with platforms at different places each time. I am not currently away if this is random generation or pre set generations, but either way it provides a good amount of replayablity.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The 1-4 players move around the level by jumping and using their grapling hooks. Kills are made by hitting a player with a grappling hook, and one hit is enough to kill a player. You can die by falling off the map. Each player has a set amount of lives and last one with lives win. It is really that simple. However it is fun. And for 5$ this is not too much to ask for. It is importaint to note that this is early access and more features are coming soon.\n\nThis game does have AI, and the AI is ok most of the time, although they do have a tendancy to just stand still.\n\nI have found this game to shine at its best when having 4 players(AI or human) on a TV with controllers on the snowy mountian map. THIS GAME DOES HAVE FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT. AND I SUGGEST YOU USE IT\n\nPro:\n-fun gameplay\n-cheap\n-easy to get the general idea and start playing, hard to master movement with grappling hook\n\nCon:\n-(EDIT: Devs taught me how, its actually easy, +1 for awesome Devs, disregard following on recovery) it is RIDICULOUSLY HARD to recover. If you are on the castle or egytain tomb map and you find yourself hanging off the edge of the tall towers towards the bottom of the map, your screwed. It is almost impossible to recover. That or I suck at recovery. It would be nice if that was made easier.\n-Keyboard is not solid. But it seems like a game to play with controllers anyways, I cant think that this can be fixed.\n\nOverall a nice fun party game that I am legitimatly excited to play with my friends. I am very excited to see where this game will go.\nOnline play would be nice. Arcade mode will be awesome.\n9/10 would cause a cat and a shark to fall to their deaths while being a viking with a grapling hook again.\n\nGAMEPLAY EXAMPLE: https://youtu.be/mjppEgwC-l4","November 6, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's an absolute blast flying around the screen, dodging hooks, and finally pinning your opponent down with a well aimed shot. What makes it even better is how it's only in early access, which means we'll be getting even more content as time goes on!\n\nI'm looking forward to sharing this with my friends on a future night c:","January 18","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game isn't easy either, it definately tests you and could be considered catering to the hardcore gamer, but is still fun if you want to play multiplayer with a bunch of friends (unfortunately only local, online multiplayer would be AMAZING)\n\nFor some sneaky gameplay just check here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEjCRcwyreQ","May 27","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The grappling hook mechanic will keep you addicted for hours, it's simple to understand yet hard to master. The character designs are well thought out (this is my opinions to what their persona's are like) You have the Terror of the 7 Seas Fin (my favourite), the mysterious assassin Anara, Runa the fearless Viking, and the battle hungry warrior Jade! The stages have a great vibrant palette with iconic mechanics, i.e.  the castle stage you can fly a ship and shoots cannons. The modes will keep you entertained for hours and there are currently 5; Deathmatch, Steam Tank, Sky Slayers, Capture the Swag, and Team Deathmatch.\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the genre or who is completely new to it!

A lot of people were crowding around and playing it, so my friends and I decided to go check it out. The game is basically like Super Smash Brothers, except you have to hit the enemy with a grappling hook to kill them. We start playing, and I soon became addicted. The devs asked if we wanted to sign up for the tournament they were having for free Steam Keys, my friends and I agreed to sign up. I lost in the first tournament immediately, but I wanted a Key so bad. I started practicing at the booth against random people, I soon became very good. Then comes the second tournament. I make it up to the finals. I won, and it was ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. The devs gave me a key, and then said that I can compete in the winners tournament they were having later. I ended up having to leave early, but devs gave me 4 extra keys for my friends and I. 10/10 Devs.\n\nFor the over all game score, I can't rate it as of now. The core mechanics are there, 4 characters, and a few levels, but there just isn't enough "game" yet.\n\nDevs, if you guys are listening, priortize adding multiplayer and ranked play. If you can do that right, I think you have a real gem on your hands. I can forsee myself sinking many hours into this game.\n\nFor everyone else, this game is amazing for game night. I would really recommend buying a copy of the game to support the devs. I met them and they seem like really nice people.","August 8, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
