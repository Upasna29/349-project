Luckily, said trick is a seemingly endless imagination, reflected in each of their products; Samorost 2 (the sequel to their first game which is freely available on their web page[amanita-design.net]) being no exception.\n\nThis incredibly short room-by-room type point ‘n’ click game has an almost childishly simple story: the protagonist’s dog gets kidnapped, and he travels to another asteroid to save his pet. But Samorost 2 isn’t really about the plot; the real content is the creativity. There is more of it present in the alien landscapes (and all the little details they are filled with) than in many large-budget AAA titles. And Samorost 2 manages to present it all under an hour, leading to a really concentrated experience. Sure, it has its price too, but if you like games a little more on the artistic side, then Amanita delivers yet again.","February 22","true","0.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

People will go on and on about it, out-snobbing each other with cries of BURRR THIS IS A FLASH GAME IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON NEWGROUNDS, REAL GAMES FOR HARDCORE GAMERS ONLY PLEASE!!!!, but ignore them. They're dumb.\n\nI love the way Amanita Design makes their games - a lot of love clearly went into the worldbuilding. You're a little man in his PJs exploring floating mushrooms that have been uprooted from the ground and left in space! Your spaceship is made out of a discarded can of weenies! There's a sewage tank and the water stains look like a pastoral farmscape! So many little beautiful details that are worth the price of admission alone.\n\nI'm not so much a fan of the puzzle-solving. Most of the puzzles are fine and are nice little breaks from the art, but sometimes they are a bit of a pain when trying to decipher context clues in a small Flash window. (FYI, this game was released ten years ago and it holds up well, though it's hard to see things sometimes.) Sometimes, there's areas that you need to click on that weren't clickable before and the game doesn't bother to tell you whether or not they're activated. It's not a perfect system, but it's fine.\n\nSamorost 2 is uneven but overall fine. If you want something with more difficulty, check out their games Machinarium and Botanicula. There will be a sequel for this one coming out very soon, too.","February 21","true","0.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/recommended/40720/","thecolorurple","TheColorUrple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/","511 products in account","Samorost 2 is short. It's going to resonate differently with each individual. I personally found nothing particularly fantastic about it. The original Samorost sets itself apart by using close-up photographs of various objects, mostly forestial, to create the illusion of large landscapes. Samorost 2 relies more on a traditional hand-drawn approach, and struggles to be as visually interesting as the first game, which is available for free on the Amanita Design website.\n\nSamorost 2's music, as usual for an Amanita game, is top-notch, and one of its highlights.\n\nThere are only a handful of puzzles in the game, and the design is problematic in certain areas. For example, the point-and-click interface allows you to click anywhere on the screen to interact with any object - yet for certain objects, it requires your little hero character to be standing in a certain area, making it easy to dismiss something as non-interactive when in fact you were just incorrectly positioned.\n\nAnd the very last puzzle of the game is a frustrating chore - it's a timing-based puzzle, already something I don't care for, and if you get it wrong, which is highly likely as it takes a bit of trial-and-error to figure out, you have to grind out the game's previous puzzle to get back into the situation needed to try your luck again. The previous puzzle involves collecting animal farts. Of the 90 minutes I played the game, I spent maybe 30 minutes collecting animal farts. That kind of pisses me off.\n\nSo I can't really recommend the game. It's not exciting, challenging, or visually appealing enough to merit even a short playthrough, and spending money on it seems silly. It should have been a free flash release. Skip this and play the excellent Machinarium.\n\n\n4/10","January 26, 2014","false","1.5"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","23","35","0","0"

This is the only game in the series that is available as a free game. Samorost 2, released 6 years later, continues the journey of our gnome-like protagonist who sets out to retrieve his stolen dog from aliens.\n\nAlthough very short, Samorost is a great point-and-click adventure game which has a very unique artwork. The gameplay is very simple - we look for clickable objects on every screen and try to solve the puzzles that represent obstacles before Gnome could proceed any further to reach his goal. I really like the game's surrealistic world with its unique creatures - above all, Gnome itself, who lives on an asteroid full of plants.\n\nThe game was designed in flash, hence the use of macromedia player when the game is launched. Also, the game omits any achievements or additional challenges. While the game offers the "play again" option you do not click on it because there are things you haven't seen in the game's roughly 2-hour long journey - you start again to see how very well it is designed (albeit everything in it is minimalistic) and to listen to its great accompanying ambient music.\n\nIt is a tad bit expensive for 5 euros, however, if it is on sale it is a great purchase. I look forward to seeing how Amanita continued the adventure in the 3rd episode.","April 16","true","1.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Besides that, Samorost 2 may be remembered mainly because of its atmosphere: both the classy soundtrack and the environment overgrown with wild roots and strange creatures are moving and unique.

In this age of advanced graphics and immense budgets, it is difficult to find a game that is atmospheric enough to immerse you in its world or setting as well as Samorost 2 does without the aid of state-of-the-art 2010's cuputing technology (That is not to devalue such games; there are masterpieces among them).\n\nI must begin by stating that,  although, for all intents and purposes, it is a "G-rated" game,  it is NOT just for children. In theory it is suitable for them, but young children would become frustrated by it's difficulty.  In hindsight, it probably isn't suitable for children, as it does contain a man who smokes wild, touch-sensitive mushrooms. So there. Not a children's game. You can play it. No-one will laugh at you.\n\nI rarely play point-and-click adventure games, but I must concede that this one is making me re-consider the credibility of the medium as a  whole. As you can see from the screenshots, the game's visuals are comprised mostly of backgrounds created from stitched-together phoographic elements with meticulously hand-drawn aimated elements in the foreground. The game is not wholly 2-Dimensional, however, as certain interactions will cause the characters to move further away or closer. This art style in combination with the varied and highly atmospheric ambient music gives the game an excellent "feel" when played for the first time, and the clarinet in particular is put to good use in portraying the mood of the characters.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging but not impossible, and most require you to think "outside the box," with a few involving the need for careful timing or requiring you to complete steps in a certain order which, although often unclear to begin with, will have real consequences, causing you to have to repeat an often difficult section if you fail to execute the steps in order or in time. The solutions are often amusing, and the cut-scenes that follow equally so. However, I must admit to consulting the walkthrough occasionally. Mostly this was due to my own inability to see a solution, but sometimes it was because it is not clear what can be interacted with and what cannot.\n\nThis leads me to my one real complaint: The fact that it is not always clear what can be interacted with and what cannot results in same "pixel-searching" on the part of the player, whereby one clicks systematically on every object visible on the screen before proceeding to click on every five-millimetre-square section of screen-space boustrophedonically starting in the top-left corner, regardless of whether or not it contains an object or not.\n\nWhat surprises me the most is that both this game and it's prequel managed to be so art-like, atmospheric and high in quality, despite being made so long ago and utilising only the capabilities of Adobe Flash Player.\n\nTo summarise:\n\n+Unique appearance\n+Excellent soundscape\n+Amusing solutions to some puzzles\n+As much as it pains me to say so, the characters and story can be described accurately as "cute"\n+Happy ending\n+Price (I bought the Amanita package on sale, but even even at $5.00 for 2-3hrs per play it's still better value than a rollercoaster or a movie. And it can be re-used.)\n\n-Some pixel-searching\n-Small game-window size on high-resoluton screens\n-Every time you start the game you are reminded of the unwelcome but necessary presence or Adobe Flash Player on your computer  http://www.orison.biz/blogs/chall3ng3r/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/flash_update1.png\n-at one point you have to push a baby animal off a branch (It hurts inside)\n-it's way easier to think of criticisms than praise\n\nDisregard those Pros and Cons and take my word for it: If you have any appreciation for subtlety of design, art or music, you will enjoy this game. It is good in the same way that the French short films series "Minuscule" is good.","December 13, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The cool art style feels original even though the graphics are in flash. The puzzles feel okay but there is a small amount of them and they are not at all difficult. This contributes to a very short game that could pass up as a free flash game but as a paid normal game it seems too short. There are no options except for volume and a place for putting the level code. Also the 1 resolution creates a huge black border around the game itself. This makes the game feel cheap. So while I liked the game it does not feel like a whole experience. I recommend it, but get it on sale, otherwise you might be tempted to refund it since the game time is below 2 hours.","December 28, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Being a Flash game, you can zoom in the image - and it's good - but you have to do it at every single new clip loaded. No Steam working layer, also.\n\nThe puzzles doesn't make much sense, so you have to pixel-hunt on your tinny screen, or bother yourself zooming every new screen. You'll fight to find the point to click many times, mostly places you need to enter or walking by, because they're not so visible, and considering the puzzles doesn't make much sense, it's always a waste of time and patience.\n\nThe game is very, very short. Not even 2 hours.\nAnd part of this time you'll just watch your character slowly walking from a place to another, and since sometimes you have to do the same things more than once, it's very annoying. Also, you have not a save system, any of them. Instead, you receive codes every new level, and you can enter these codes if you want to play it later. If you don't realize the purpose of these codes to memorize them or take note, you'll have to play again from beginning, and considering what i said about slowly walking, you know what does it mean.\n\nFinally, you don't have any real support from Amanita Design (developer). They're not present at Steam forums, and never patch their games to fix, improve or adapt them to continue to sell them. Although the asked price is low, it's not worth by any aspect, maybe for 1 dollar or so, and if you really like P&C games or the art style.","December 14, 2013","false","2.4"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","12","28","0","0"

It was short, but still very satisfying.  The point&click gameplay is very simple, with most puzzles being solved on the same screen, though there were a few that required 2-screen thinking.  The graphics are aesthetically pleasing and stylistic, which is another reason that attracted me.  If I'm going to be staring at a screen for an hour trying to figure out what I should click on, I'd like it to be good looking :)  Also, this game also has no text or language.

"Samorost 2" the award winning sequel definetly surpassed the first. Samorost 2 is pretty much the same as the first, but much more improved, better grahpics, harder puzzles and an awesome soundtrack by Tomas Dvorak. However, the puzzles are much much harder... which can easily frustrate some not-so-patient gamers, you need to squint and try to click on every tiny detail in some stages.. which kind of damages the beautiful graphic experience. There is no inventory or lots of gathering like in most adventure games, instead you solve puzzles at every stage and proceed to an another. Collage-esque graphics are rare in video games, but Jakub Dvorsky definetly knows how to make some very lovely and astonishing backgrounds and artistic graphics in general. If you are looking for a challenging, lovely and a bit weird experience. Samorost2 is a great choice.","November 6, 2012","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Amanita’s quirky characters, worlds, and stories are truly unique, even in the indie game landscape.  In Samorost2, follow a cute space gnome as he searches for his alien-abducted dog.\n\nSamorost1 is available for free, right on Amanita’s website!  Play that first, and if you like it, invest in Samorost2.  Samorost1 is a Flash-based game, and Samorost2 expands on its ideas and you can really see that the developer learned from the first game and it outpaces the first both technically and gameplay-wise.  In each game, you will guide the little gnome from static screen to screen, clicking objects in the environment and figuring out how to open the path forward.\n\nThe gameplay here is simple.  If something looks interesting, click on it.  It will either help you progress, make a cool sound effect, or do nothing at all!  Most of the game you will be squinting at the screen to try and find the one object that turns your cursor into a hand (indicating a clickable object), or trying to determine the correct order to click things in.  Often it is not 100% apparent exactly what you’re supposed to do, but the options are generally limited enough that you can stumble across the solution pretty easily.  This is not an adventure game that makes you feel very clever for having figured it out, but rather one where the atmosphere and the weird surroundings make you curious and inquisitive to see how things fit together.  Real-world knowledge of how things work is not very useful here, where items behave in unexpected ways.  The joy in this game is not figuring it out based on what you already know, but by being inquisitive.\n\nThe graphics are one of the outstanding things about this game.  Simple, but evocative.  You’ll see an old oil can used as a spaceship.  You’ll see mossy tree trunks used as massive structures filled with life.  Strange alien landscapes made out of things we see everyday bring a refreshing look to a genre that is often all about either retro pixelation or brown realism.  Also, Samorost2 can be run on almost any old Windows machine, due to its incredibly simple Flash programming.\n\nThe audio in Samorost1/2 is really interesting.  Ambient, often soft and eerie, you’ll be displaced by the music and thrust into this odd world.  The sound effects are also incredibly detailed.  Animals will make unique sounds, alien machines will clank and whir strangely, and wind will blow through the “trees”, lending a beautiful atmosphere to the game.\n\nObtuse puzzle games like this can be frustrating at times, where you see a bunch of clickable objects, but have no idea how to put them together.  Even when you do manage to blindly stumble into the solution, that is often unsatisfying.  However, Samorost drips with such charm and quirky joy that you’ll often find you do not care.  The uniqueness of the alien landscapes, coupled with the cuteness of the gnome and his dog (and the smoking bro), will likely make you enjoy yourself regardless.\n\nSamorost1 and 2 are interesting games for more than just their own sake.  Amanita Design went on to make some of the most highly-praised adventure games of the past few years, including Machinarium and Botanicula.  Some of the features that made those games so great are present here, in Samorost, in their infancy.  Amanita’s first foray into adventure games is well worth your time, if only to see where it all began.","April 5","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the atmosphere and quirky humour is here in Samorost 2, thanks in no small part to the continued contribution of composer Tomas Dvorak.\n\nSamorost 2 is quite short, but oh so sweet. It's simple tale of a space gnome looking for his dog isn't quite as deeply involving as Machinarium's robot love story, but it's certainly no less charming for that. The experience can be somewhat lengthened by going to Amanita Design's website and playing Samorost Part 1 completely free of charge.\n\nLovely stuff. 9/10","August 18, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ppnhzk/recommended/40720/","ppnhzk","ragequitmaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ppnhzk/","1364 products in account","Samorost 2 is a cute little adventure game made in flash player. It has a nice art style and an overall good atmosphere. It is quite short, can be easily played through in less than an hour on the first try. Its price tag is high for a game like this, but I got it on sale for about $1, which is more than a fair price for the experience.\nOtherwise, it has some problems with the puzzles, especially with all the pixel-hunting that is going on. Sometimes there are things in the background that does not seem any special, still, they have an important role in completing the current scene. Most of the time there is a need to search for points which can be activated throughout the area and given that the background images are not the best in quality this can be frustrating. Animated objects can be easily distinguished.\nIn the end, S2 is still worthwile due to its unique style.\n\nMy opinion in scores:\nOVERALL: 7/10\nVisuals: 8/10\nGameplay: 6/10\nSound: 7/10\nReplay Value: 5/10","March 14","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Amanita’s quirky characters, worlds, and stories are truly unique, even in the indie game landscape.  In Samorost2, follow a cute space gnome as he searches for his alien-abducted dog.\n\nSamorost1 is available for free, right on Amanita’s website!  Play that first, and if you like it, invest in Samorost2.  Samorost1 is a Flash-based game, and Samorost2 expands on its ideas and you can really see that the developer learned from the first game and it outpaces the first both technically and gameplay-wise.  In each game, you will guide the little gnome from static screen to screen, clicking objects in the environment and figuring out how to open the path forward.\n\nThe gameplay here is simple.  If something looks interesting, click on it.  It will either help you progress, make a cool sound effect, or do nothing at all!  Most of the game you will be squinting at the screen to try and find the one object that turns your cursor into a hand (indicating a clickable object), or trying to determine the correct order to click things in.  Often it is not 100% apparent exactly what you’re supposed to do, but the options are generally limited enough that you can stumble across the solution pretty easily.  This is not an adventure game that makes you feel very clever for having figured it out, but rather one where the atmosphere and the weird surroundings make you curious and inquisitive to see how things fit together.  Real-world knowledge of how things work is not very useful here, where items behave in unexpected ways.  The joy in this game is not figuring it out based on what you already know, but by being inquisitive.\n\nThe graphics are one of the outstanding things about this game.  Simple, but evocative.  You’ll see an old oil can used as a spaceship.  You’ll see mossy tree trunks used as massive structures filled with life.  Strange alien landscapes made out of things we see everyday bring a refreshing look to a genre that is often all about either retro pixelation or brown realism.  Also, Samorost2 can be run on almost any old Windows machine, due to its incredibly simple Flash programming.\n\nThe audio in Samorost1/2 is really interesting.  Ambient, often soft and eerie, you’ll be displaced by the music and thrust into this odd world.  The sound effects are also incredibly detailed.  Animals will make unique sounds, alien machines will clank and whir strangely, and wind will blow through the “trees”, lending a beautiful atmosphere to the game.\n\nObtuse puzzle games like this can be frustrating at times, where you see a bunch of clickable objects, but have no idea how to put them together.  Even when you do manage to blindly stumble into the solution, that is often unsatisfying.  However, Samorost drips with such charm and quirky joy that you’ll often find you do not care.  The uniqueness of the alien landscapes, coupled with the cuteness of the gnome and his dog (and the smoking bro), will likely make you enjoy yourself regardless.\n\nSamorost1 and 2 are interesting games for more than just their own sake.  Amanita Design went on to make some of the most highly-praised adventure games of the past few years, including Machinarium and Botanicula.  Some of the features that made those games so great are present here, in Samorost, in their infancy.  Amanita’s first foray into adventure games is well worth your time, if only to see where it all began.","April 5","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays in a tiny window surrounded by black borders and its low-resolution graphics will have you hunt the pixels more often than you'd like. It is also extremely short and has no replay value. You should only get this title on sale or as part of a better bundle.\n\nIf you are a newcomer to Amanita Design's truly original work, I suggest you start with Machinarium for a more rewarding and complete experience.","May 13","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
