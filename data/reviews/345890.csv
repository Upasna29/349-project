The AI in general does a great job and racing against "it" ,with no driving aids, loose setup, and a racing wheel, is just huge fun imo because AI really takes care of the player car. This wasn't always the case in '13.\nThe latest patch has made AI less aggressive/fast after starts/ restarts, which is great. AI difficulty can be set up again by "%" as it was in '13.\n\n+ more features in career mode, resarch&development, car builder\n+ slightly improved graphics\n+ daytone'14 dlc for free ... but all the '14 dlc/paint schemes should be for free imo which sadly isn't :( ..once again: NR3k3S was a great time :) ..\n+ new chase, qualification and nascar rules\n+ new/changed UI graphics but overall the functions an options are pretty much the same as in N'13 ...I still like the '13 menu-music a little more ;)\n+ physics are the same as in '13 and still "sim-cade". It depends on how the player plays this game but it is definitely not an Arcade-title (when aids off).\n+ setup features: Changes can be felt clearly on track. (same as in '13)\n+ No ISI game/graphics/physics engine !! (as '13 a big plus! for that)\n\nThe worst about NASCAR 14 is it's multiplayer. (Same as '13, unstable/crashes/ poor features)\nI had stopped playing multiplayer before the latest patch but the multiplayer is still nowhere where NR2k3S or even Grand Prix Legends (with VROC) have been many (15?) years ago...no patch can fix this "mp-concept"\nthe N'14 multiplayer has just changed the leaderboard times, which have become totally laughable.\nNo browser, no important MP-features, no players, no games... N'14 multiplayer is just "crap".\n\nFor multiplyer I'd recommend to fire up NASCAR Racing 2003 Season, ( or GPL, or Race07) again or to join the IRacing service.\n\nIf you like NASCAR and you are looking for a great "offline" experience that represents the thrill on the PC again, this game is the right choice for you, even if it's not a die-hard siumlation game . It's much better as NASCAR 13 imo.\n\nI like this game as it is and with the right AI difficult settings it's just an absolutely awesome offline NASCAR experience on the pc.\nCheers!","June 13, 2015","true","19.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","2"

Yes, it's true. Why am I recommending a game that, I will say right off the bat has bugs? Because once you get past these few quirks, for 10$, I can't say my 80+ hours was a bad experience. For starters, its NASCAR! Yes it has bugs and ♥♥♥♥ AI but it's still the most recent NASCAR game, and considering the 2014 version isn't even on steam anymore, or any other markets selling it online are in the 30-40$ range, 10$ is quite a steal. You can race in a single season with any driver, a career mode with your own driver, and multiplayer (which quickplay might seem dead, but use the forums and finding people or leagues are no problem). Granted nothing new, and even some other series are taken out, but if your just looking to race, its good to go. Also im very suprised reading all these comments are people with 1-4hrs, saying the game is unplayable? Soooo my guess is those people legit started the game, played Daytona, couldn't drive with the downforce, degrees and left push of the track, and were like "♥♥♥♥ this game its broken" Cause thats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t saying its unplayable (if talking about gameplay) And if its unplayable due to crashes then fortunetly my laptap has been lucky as the game has never crashed on me. But with gameplay, I play around 50%+ difficulty and the only track I have a problem with is Pocono, and thats just because I don't use setups to often. And the Paint Booth is still fun as well, as I've spent hours in it recreating old schemes from my favorite drivers or just brand new career schemes. But moving foward, As this is a review I have to give the negitive side too. To start with errors and such, the bugs I know off the top of my head that seem to happen are; everytime I minimize the game it switches to the lowest resolution. This is the the far worst bug in my opinion but when I'm set into the game I'm not going back and forth all the time so its avoidable. Next is the game stalling online. The game itself doesn't freeze but it doesn't get past a caution replay or a restart, it stays stuck at the Sprint Cup screen. Though out of the last 50 multiplayer games I've only had this happen 3-4 times. Now along with stalling restarts, sometimes when a restart happens cars are in each other or all in a line in each other glitching back and forth, this one may happen more then the stalling but not overwhelming. Next to some just bad gameplay is the consistancy with the AI. I don't find them as terrible as people claim more or less the fact that the difficulty doesn't seem consistant. One track set on 50% difficulty I can easily win everytime, others on that setting would have me sitting in the 30's garuntee, thats just really weird. I can understand if this is due to them wanting you to use setups but if one should be the same all across. Next, one of the biiiiiigggest ercks about the gameplay, is not having AI on multiplayer!!! I played Nascar 2010 like there was no tomorrow back on the xbox 360 and even then it didnt have it, but wth, that doesnt make sense to not add that in yet. It would be great to even just have you and your bud and fill the rest with AI or have an online league option in it already and whatever spots are open fill it with AI. There's a lot of potential in the next game for fixes and new features, but out of all this problems or things I wish, I can still sit back and enjoy racing a season, or getting a group of friends in a race, flooring it to the finish line. And for 10$ I don't see how you can regret it.\n\nPS... For all these people ♥♥♥♥♥ing to get refunds, if you really are worried that much on spending ten dollars on an older video game, then you should probably save your money because if ten dollars is really that critical to get back, gaming should be your last priority.\n","March 23","true","154.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

Oval racing is a big draw for serious simracers on iRacing, e.g. the Peak Antifreeze NASCAR sanctioned championship series, Pro Series, etc...  I've driven the legendary "NASCAR Racing 2003 Season" sim by Papyrus but it's dated. Even with mods and a great online community it's still getting long in the tooth.\n\nLast year's NASCAR '14 from Eutechnyx got bad reviews from simracers (search youtube). The FFB gave them problems, the damage model was not realistic, the physics were dated. They found bugs in the program. It was a console port and not targeted at serious simracers. Online racing was non-existent. And they did not see anything really new from previous versions. They liked the graphics, frame rates were good, sound was rated as good, they basically liked the tracks and UI.\n\nInitially I ignored "NASCAR '15 Victory Edition" thinking it must also be terrible [same developers]. Admittedly this may have lowered my expectations which were then more easiliy exceeded.. and I have not played any of the previous versions. However it was only $9.99 so what the heck.. gave it a try. I have to say after less than a week I'm really liking this sim (yeah I'm loosely using that term) which is why I'm writing this review. People ignoring this game are missing out on a really decent racing experience. Even if not extremely realistic by simracing standards it's fast, close, exciting racing and gives you an opportunity to develop simracing skills (situational awareness and reactions) for tight packed oval racing without, or perhaps prior to, subscribing to iRacing. AI can be very aggressive, there's a lot of pushing and shoving in close quarters at high speed with heavy, powerful, sluggish beasts. Racing 20 laps at Auto Club in Fontana last night, and mixing it up with the AI was a blast. Rarely do I have that much fun in racing sims. And the AI actually did avoid several close calls when my tires started dropping off and my car became loose. I saw a different side of the AI performance which was better and more nuanced than I expected. This game (for me) is a very different experience from F1, GT, Touring Car, Rally, Rally Cross, Gymkhana, Drifting, and other types of racing sims I've been lucky enough to drive.\n\n\nCons.\nDamage model is unrealistic.\n\nAI can be very difficult to drive with initially.\n\nSaving paint schemes opens a file-dialog which causes to Windows to exit fullscreen mode and the game resets the screen resolution to a low default value. If you switch to windowed mode in Graphics Settings before using the painting booth this is avoided. Or just switch modes when you know you are going to be selecting actions that open the dialog. Only a few file actions actually trigger this.\n\nFFB and wheel setup needs a little tweaking. Being a console port may be the reason. I searched online and set my G27 to less than 90 degrees of rotation and set the dead zone to 99% (yes, it works well). I believe the Logitech controller settings take over.  (Have not tried using a gamepad)\n\nOnline is basically non-existent. You have to invite friends to join in your own session. See youtube online racing examples. I have not raced online with this game yet.\n\nPros.\nThe price was $9.99\n\nDamage model. Check youtube for real world NASCAR crashes and how often they actually occur. If damage was realistic.. as a rookie driver you would rarely finish a race, at least rarely without pit stops for repairs and time delays - not fun. The limited damage model allows you to typically keep racing after a crash and hopefully learn more quickly how to drive in close quarters. Yes, this requires some active suspension of disbelief on the driver's part.\n\nFun. If you like this type of racing, or are curious about what draws people to NASCAR racing.\n\nTrivia questions between races. Gives you a small taste of NASCAR history and racing personalities.\n\nPer above referenced 2014 review: it has good sound, graphics, UI, a paint booth, all current tracks.\n\nLike Codemasters' F1 2015, NASCAR '15 VE has the current roster of drivers, cars and paint schemes. Kind of cool.\n\nPro (for me): after racing N'15VE I may start watching more NASCAR races.\nApparently Dusenberry Martin Racing has acquired the NASCAR video game license, etc... from Eutechnxy in Jan. '16 and has already made changes for the 2015 Victory Edition. It would be nice to have a next generation NR2k3 sim (in addition to iRacing) that the diehard NASCAR fans can race.","May 15","true","21.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

If windows 8.1 would run Nascar Racing 2003 Season I would still play it stock.\n\nI didn't enjoyed nothing that EA came up in racing sports. The only one I caught myself playing and getting into was F1 2001.\n\nAbout this Nascar the game inside line or whatever franchise is one thing I can say: It's something. Yes, I know, majorly, it's a great nothing.\n\nI played the 2013 one after knowing about the take on the series on Inside the line in 2012. I was fun, but a horrible taste in the mouth at a time that I was looking after something N2K3 like...even Nascar Racing 3 like. A year maybe passed, I can't tell, I picked up 2013 again and had the fun it could ever give to someone... yea, but not on that initial price tag and the dlc model was....disgusting for a title that has a broken AI (don't run a season on it...it's stressful enough a single race).\n\nNASCAR '15!\n\nIt's actually....good. Price tag wise, It's adequate. The AI is better, It doesn't ram you all the time and it's imperfections on dodging on you is somewhat a good kind of punish (played only 85% to 95% AI, and thank whoever got back percentage to change skill level of AI).\n\nThe physics are....awful. Devs wanted to get the average public into and all that kind of stuff....pfff it didn't work, and personally, I think it doesn't work at all in titles like these.\n\nNASCAR is a punishing sport. It's a 1.5 tons+ car in it's grip limit in every corner. The damage model is laughable, the physics gets you here to there in no trouble. No, it shouldn't be like this, but it is.\n\nIf you take it as a SIM: you'll get disappointed, angry, refund mode on...whatever, DO NOT GET THIS.\n\nIf you take as a GAME: you'll be alright for the most part. Strategies are there, fully functional NASCAR season. Career features, car setups quite nice to get around.\n\nMultiplayer fun seems absent. Broken or who the hell knows.\n\n\nIt's a carbon copy on Nascar 14, So beware owners of that title.\nNew to the franchise.\n\nWhy the thumbs up: it's fun enough if you pick it up without being all serious about physics or what should be more real and what not, you'll have a good time. It's raceable, it's awesome in several ocasions, falls short in others but doesn't harm it. This review will get ♥♥♥♥ ton of flack just to be a thumbs up one. This community is absurd.\n\nIf you should consider this game a pass or this a non recommendation: If you are into pc simulation racing games, don't care about NASCAR all that much, no simpathy at all with arcadish racing games even though this title can be considered a arcade\sim as there's Need For Speed to arcade games.\n\nMost importantly, if you are not in rush to get a NASCAR game or out of budget, spend money in something else or wait for next year NASCAR game under the new development team.\n\nIt's a ♥♥♥♥ed up world.","May 29, 2015","true","7.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

For example, the replay system works, and is even fairly good despite some bugs, yet it could be miles better. It could give you a free cam or the ability to focus on other cars outside of yours, just to name two examples. On the same vein, the painting mode is barebones, and is complicated and difficult to use, even after figuring it out.\n\nWhere NASCAR '15 shines however, is it's gameplay. It is pretty good for a racing game on the keyboard and the tracks all offer unique and different challenges. You might be extremely good at Texas, yet fail miserably at Kansas. Thus is the parity and challenge of NASCAR '15. Yet even the driving doesn't escape my earlier complaint: being lackluster. Most of the game's depth comes from tweaking your car, changing setups, adding wedge, addcing tape, et cetera. But none of those things are adequatlely explained. How are you supposed to know what adding or removing tape does to the car unless you are a diehard fan or an areodynamics fanatic?\n\nOne last point is about the multiplayer, specifically private matches with a few close friends. It sucks. Again, it is hard to figure out how to even set it up correctly, and then you JUST race against your friends. There is no option to turn on A.I. None. It would be fine in my eyes, if there was a setting I could change. Sometimes, you just want to race your buddy with the A.I. but you simply can't do that; it's 1v1 or however many friends you have, and that's just the way it is.\n\nOverall, NASCAR '15 is an adequate racing game, yet suffers from not being as good as it COULD have been. It feels like a poor console game slapped onto PC and then forgotten about. I would recommend it if you were going to have a few fun hours with friends, but on it's own it is not a very good game. At best, I would describe this game as average, for $20.00 though, you can't be THAT wrong. 5/10.","August 13, 2015","false","15.5"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

I had just about every NASCAR game since NASCAR '98 on PS1.  I ended up taking a break from NASCAR for a couple years and just recently tried to get back into it.  I bought NASCAR 15 because it was the newest one out and I gave the developers the benefit of the doubt that it would have few problems.  Come to figure out I was mistaken.  This game is a load of garbage.  The game will crash when trying to up my resolution to 4k.  Very rarely does it work.  Sometimes it won't crash, but the whole screen will bug out.  Whenever I do manage to get into races, quite a number of other cars' liveries are completely black; the only thing identifying them are the name badges.  I have also had a lot of difficulties with the paint booth.  The controls are just miserable to work with and it is easy to lose patience when trying to design a more elaborate scheme.   This game is so broken I cannot even fathom how it made it onto Steam.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/devchar96/recommended/345890/","devchar96","Dehvun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/devchar96/","64 products in account","When you buy a NASCAR game, you expect to make a lot of left turns. But this game fails to deliver even that; the basis for any NASCAR videogame.\n\nAs a big fan of the sport, I knew exactly what I was getting into when I bought this game. I had seen reviews, seen gameplay, and played the Xbox 360 version myself as a rental back when the game was called NASCAR '14. I saw it listed on here for only $10 so I figured hey, why not give it a try?\n\nRight off the bat I turned the music and voiceovers off. The music was terrible, pandering to the stereotypical NASCAR fan, who may have enjoyed it. This is a non-issue; turn it off and be done with it. Same with the voice, both on menus and the in-game spotter. The spotter was annoying and not realistic and the voiceover in the menus was simply unnecessary. After a few graphical tweaks, I was ready to take my car on the track and run a few laps at my local track, Phoenix International Raceway.\n\nAs far as driving goes, this game is solid. But that's as far as positives go. The camera angles are odd, none feel right to use on a PC. I had to play with a controller because the game is simply not optimised for keyboard + mouse. Fine, I thought, I'll keep trying. When I started a race at PIR I was immediately reminded of this games horrible AI. They will race you like it's the final lap at Daytona... Every single lap. Pack racing is the only option. The field does not spread out at all, which may be fine for people who are not huge into NASCAR, but for me, it was a massive problem.\n\nAt this point I started the career, thinking maybe the pack racing would be better at restrictor plate tracks. After a decent test session at Indianapolis I participated in the first race of my career. Restrictor plate racing at Daytona was almost unplayable. Between not being able to hold a lane and constantly having the AI try to run me off the track, I found myself rewinding from a crash every lap.\n\nNow on to the crashes. As far as a physics engine goes, this is one of the worst I've seen. At Daytona, crashes are minor and involve on car spinning and collecting other cars, which are somehow able to continue as if nothing happened. Hitting the wall does very little damage to the car, and when the cosmetic damage does get triggered by impacts it looks terrible, like a small child was rubbing the paint off a toy car on cement or with very minor collapsing. I don't ask for much when it comes to crashes. I'd like mildly realistic damage or a good crashing physics engine. This game has neither. Another thing I noticed is that, with any minor impact into the wall, the crowd roars, but is essentially silent at any other time. This, while realistic, was another inconsistency that bothered me.\n\nNASCAR '15 Victory Edition has decent graphics, but the lighting in-game is so absurdly unrealistic that it completely ruins it. Its as if someone bumped the contrast up to high, changed the color temperature, and somehow made every car have a matte finish. The screenshots clearly show this. In the garage, on the menus, and at certain tracks, the cars look excellent. But at other times they, too, completely fail to deliver.\n\nRacing games need to run smoothly in order for it to be a good experience. This game also fails to do that. I encountered a framerate issue when controlling the car from the third-person perspective in that it seems the car is rendered at a stable 60 FPS, but the environments - including opponent vehicles - render below that framerate and suffer from constant drops. It detracts immensely from the experience and makes it difficult to race.\n\nWhen it comes to sound, this game is not that bad. Engine sounds are decent. My only gripe with this would be that crashing into anything always makes the same dull bumping noise, and it doesn't sound remotely appropriate for stock cars. It sounds like bumper cars which, when paired with the less-than-optimal AI, is pretty much all this game is anyway.\n\nOne positive I found playing NASCAR '15 Victory Edition was the UI. The menus were crisp and nice looking, sounds were not bad, and KB+M/controller usage in menus was well designed. Because this game is simply a port a lot of menus had the typical ABXY buttons from an Xbox 360 controller. When playing with a controller, this was fine. With a mouse? Not so much.\n\nI did encounter a game-breaking glitch while playing though. Other reviewers mentioned this too, but using ALT+TAB to get out the game effectively breaks the graphics engine. Unless you play in windowed mode (which I personally dislike, but whatever) there does not seem to be a fix for this issue. It requires a restart, sets the game to a very low default resolution, and does not automatically correct itself. Frankly I am astonished a bug like this is in a finished game, but at this point I'm not even suprised.\n\nIn the end, save your money. Other reviewers list the $10 price tag as a pro, but its still too much to spend on a broken, half-hearted, unrealistic NASCAR game. There are better options out there. Hopefully DMR's new NASCAR game (NASCAR Heat: Evolution) is good, but I rarely have high hopes for NASCAR games anymore. Looks like I will stick to iRacing for now.","May 31","false","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

We had 11 cautions in a 30% race, there was also a bug that caused 1/2 of the cautions from AI drivers spinning out for no reason entering pit road. It was kind of amusing.\n\nAlso it seems the AI gets bunched up in certain areas of tracks for some weird reason, making you either slow down a lot or pass 10-20 cars on the inside which is unrealistic for the amount of times it happens.\n\nBesides AI, the game is a mix between arcade and simulation, I noticed a lack of realistic handling and the Force feedback is too poor to get a good feel of how the car is handling when you push the corners too hard also with the lack of sound from tires spinning (usually good indicators of how you should be on the throttle or off of it) so really the only gauge of judging a corner is just the visuals of where you are in the turn.\n\nI also noticed that when you brake, your car wants to turn right which made it hard running in traffic. Although this could be from the setup.\n\nSome Pros:\nI do like the feeling of career and how Mike Joy and D.W. give a breakdown of the race, I also thought the spotter and pit crew voices are a cool addition (keep in mind i havent played Nascar since NR2003 so dont know if other games had this).\n\nGraphics are acceptable, but at times they look blurry at a distance even on ultra settings.\n\nIf you do not have any Nascar games and have an itch to do some Nascar racing offline then I can recommend this for the price offered (it was less than $10 for me). If you already have Nascar 14 then I would stick with that.\n\nHopefully the new nascar game being announced this summer will be much better.","April 13","true","31.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With this I do believe in racing in a tank with levers to steer and or tabs with arrows showing left and right to control turns is for other types of gaming. But, thats just monuvers. Racing is with a  wheel or a so called half wheel to control turns like F1's gaming. The Nascar 15, 13, 14 and some other versions with a wheel you can drive it as you would feel driving your own vehicle. You just can't get into a go-kart and expect to drive it like your own personal car you must adjust to it and if you are able to adjust your vehicle to where, you can really control your car and make jumps, spins,  etc.. This game has control settings to assist you to set up your vehicle to your feel of driving in order to control it. This is a simulator game experiance. Your proper equipment to operate you vehicle is a good wheel controller.  I do recommend Logitech Gxx series which also, has settings for each different wheel game brand. So, don't expect to just jump in and win in these New Style Nascar games especally 15 there are settings and they use every inch of the race track and have fun. Go Nascar, Go....I love my Nascar is't for just gaming, it's a feeling of speed with proper PC equipment, and accessaries you can feel it. It takes time to master it and it will help anyone when playing Online.  This will help unless you really master the PAD controllers.

This game was NOT developed by DMR.  If you played this game, you should have noticed the ETX(Eutechnyx) Racing logo.  This game was abandoned by ETX, which was later picked up and "slapped together"  by DMR to give NASCAR fans something in the way of an up-to-date game  If you played NASCAR 14, then you know that this game is essentially a clone of it.  The only differences between the two are the drivers and their schemes, and the new Chase format.  Everything else is exactly the same.  There is information about this on DMR's site, with an open letter explaining this.  It just pisses me off that people are so quick to assume without all the information.  After reading that open letter, I had a clear understanding that this game would be like the former and set my expectations as such.  YES the AI SUCKS, almsot unenjoyable, but thankfully, there are unlimited rewinds, because you're going to need them.  The AI don't wreck on their own but only occasion they will.  3 and 4 wide at EVERY track, sounds like fun until you try it and realize that if you move out of your line for even a split second, someone behind you has filled that spot.  A good rule of thumb would be to never get caught in the middle of 3 or 4 wide, you will become a pinball.  The AI also apparently have the capability to always get a run on you, no matter how fast you're going.  You can have your car on the limit, and they still manage to squeeze their way past you.  The only options are to turn the difficulty down, but honestly, I can't tell a difference between 70% and 60% difficulty, or to start door slamming them as they pass you. That tactic works to make them panic and fall back behind you at the consequence of damaging your car.  You DO get a good sense of speed at most tracks.  It can look and feel like you're pushing your car to the edge.  The 1.5 mile tracks are about the best ones to get some enjoyable racing in.  Short tracks and road courses, they will wreck you at every turn, or straightaway, and fill any hole you may leave when you pull out to pass.  Superspeedway races can be frustrating, because it's more of the same like the short tracks where they run from low line to the wall about 5 rows deep.  You can get a head of steam, only to either back off or push the guy in front of you out of the way.  If you happen to find yourself in first, mirror drive your way to victory lane.\n\nIt's like clockwork the lines they will take to pass, so you can time your moves to block your way to victory.  When going into the turns, hug the yellow line until you come out of the turn, then drift out to the wall.  They will move to the inside, so run them down to the yellow line at the start of the backstretch, then they will move up to the wall, so you just stay in front of them.  Going into turns 3 and 4, hug the line again.  When you exit the turn, drift up to the wall, then block them low to the start/finish line.\n\nThe key here is to anticipate them.  They will ALWAYS duck underneath you on the straights.  Time your block, but be quick, because the outside line will move up to overtake on the outside, so it may be a bit of weaving between the high and low lines.\n\nPit stop strategies don't work because the AI make some pretty stupid choices of when to pit, like on the final lap.  They don't pit in their window so it's hard to gauge their strategy, if there is one.\n\nSomething else that bugs the **** out me is when this game is compared to NR2003.  Really?  I mean, I know NR2003 is good in a lot of ways, I've had it since April 2003, it's a computer sim!  How can you compare it?  NASCAR 13 thru 15 were ports from the console versions.  If I may say so, NR2003 is majorly outdated. Yes, it's moddable, but the physics are based off the OLD cup cars, so the cars don't handle or react to loose conditions like they would today.  Don't get me wrong, I still do quite a bit of racing on NR2003, even today.  But you can't compare a PC sim to a console arcade.  It has some sim qualities but it is based in a sim.\n\nI know it may sound like I'm defending a crappy game, I'm not.  I'm defending the devs who have yet to show their hand at a NASCAR game.  THIS GAME WAS NOT DEVELOPED BY DMR.  IT WAS PUBLISHED BY THEM.  All they did was finalize what ETX abandoned.  I will say, $20 is still a bit overpriced for what we got.  They could have just made a 2015 update to 2014, but I understand you  can't run a business without making money.  So, if you already had nothing good to say about any previous ETX NASCAR game, then save yourself the money and the negativity by skipping this one and wait until DMR releases their first iteration of NASCAR.","August 29, 2015","true","10.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","6"

When running in windowed mode, it will change resolution each time you launch, even if you don't change it back manually. And if you don't, you're dumb, because it picks tiny tiny windows for you. It also seems to change race settings if you exit between sessions: I quit after qualifying for a race, came back for the actual race, and apparently caution flags had been turned off.\n\n2- For whatever ungodly reason, yellow flags are off by default. Having an option to turn them off is perhaps understandable, but off by default? I cannot comprehend where that decision came from, and it WILL surprise people not looking for the setting. In fact, looks like the top discussion on Steam is about this.\n\n3- WTF is with cautions in this game? Another car taps me, I get a little sideways and recover, car behind me spins out, yellow flag... then I'm back to the back of the field somehow? Why? How? I kept it together, what am I being punished for? And the consistency of this is maddening. Even when I know I came out the wreckage in the 20s, it drops me back to 43. Every time.\n\n4- It's just an ugly game. Aside from having less blocky models, this is no better than early xbox 360 era stuff. Textures on everything seem rather amateur hour. And while the car models are ok, the track is terrible and the up close shots of my pit-crew's butts when I roll up for fuel displays some truly dire models and textures. Which is kind of inexcusable for a game wherein the graphics trumps basically all other features except for weak gameplay. Speaking of...\n\n5- I know NASCAR tends to be just parades these days anyway but come on, you had a chance to break up the sport's inherent monotony and you didnt. Even zipping around playing car-pinball is boring.\n\n6- Yes, there is an option to turn the music volume to 0. This somehow seems insufficient to remove the way-too-cliche country soundtrack: I want it burned. I want the Earth salted behind it. I want music that's interesting and perhaps inspirational, rather than just stereotyping this sport down to the bone.\n\n7- Also can't skip or remove the intro flashcards. I mean I get preventing us from removing them, but still gotta sit through them? Really? Inexcusable these days.\n\n8- NASCAR sucks lol\n\nHonestly, this is terrible. I got it on sale on a whim after spending some time with younger cousins playing one of the old EA ones over Thanksgiving, and hand-on-heart, this crap almost makes me nostalgic for some of that EA rubber-band AI magic. Or the pointless rivals crap.\n\nIf you're a fan of NASCAR, my review will be meaningless to you. If you're a racing fan looking at giving it a shot, do not. Do NOT. It's simply not worth it. I see that my fighting with the changing settings has bumped me over the 2 hour gametime refund time limit, so welp, there goes my $10. You, child, you can still escape this.","November 29, 2015","false","3.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Most of the issues that were prevalent in the last game have been removed or mitigated to its possibility. This is a fun arcade sim and it is worth the 20 bucks.  However you don't need this game if you're fin with just having '14. That being said, if you want to b up to date with the current year this game is a must. The handling is better, the ai is less aggresive to a degree and overall just plain fun. I've played all the etx games and I enjoy every one of them because I love NASCAR and I hav experienced the issus but they're not game breaking. Online is however, still buggy and its nearly impossible to find a race but i really don't buy nascar games for multiplayer. I just love career mode and single races so these games serve well for that purpose. If you're looking for a nascar sim, well just stick to iracing bcause this game is far from a true sim but its true to nascar as it can possibly be.","May 26, 2015","true","55.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That is, if you have a racing wheel. I haven't logged too many hours into this game, but my opinion is that playing this game with the keyboard is near impossible. I won the pole position of the Daytona 500. it wasnt hard to drive without other cars on the track. But come race day, it was impossible to race alongside other cars. this is because you cannot simply go into a turn at 175 miles an hour, you need to decelerate so that you do not run into other cars. With the keyboard, there is no way to smoothly decelerate and then maintain a certain speed. Thus, coming out of a turn, you either crash, or fall behind the pack. Another example. Martinsville speedway, the paperclip. You are constantly next to other cars, accelerating and decelerating due to how short the track is. Without pedals, you cannot maintain a speed behind another car and you let go of the gas, slow down, and then either hit the car behind you or fall behind the pack. I love Nascar and have a racing wheel coming tomorrow so that I can play it and Formula One. The career mode walks you through the Sprint Cup series, every single race, and as you progress, you can upgrade your car and earn new sponsors whose decals can be added to your car. I recommend it if you have a wheel or use a game pad maybe, but with the keyboard, you simply will not enjoy this or get to truly race next to other cars and be competitive.","May 27, 2015","true","35.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They have successfully updated the things they claimed this game would update. Aside from the little details they have changed the gameplay is essentially the same, but that should be expected considering they didn't claim it to be any different.\n\nI would recommend this game if you enjoyed the old games from Eutechnyx and if you didn't enjoy them this one will be no different. I do have high expectations of the new "sim" that DMi has began to work on and don't let this game make you shy away from that one in the future.","May 28, 2015","true","30.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've only played on career mode. I like the paint shop, and sponsors and color schemes, I like having 3 or more different paint jobs to race with. The career upgrade system is pretty good, better than what EA could cough up.\n\nNow the bad....\n\nThe AI is so aggressive, they will punish you if you make a mistake. They will run you over sometimes or just door the heck out of your car at Bristol. I guess that is kinda realistic tho. I just find it over bearing sometimes, I have had at least 4 races of the 16 in career mode ruined by bad AI decisions.\n\nQualifying is kinda like F1? All the cars are on the track, which seems weird since I know NASCAR is not like that...lol\n\nIf you can look past the half hazard AI and weird 3 round qualifying then the game is okay.\n\nOverall I will give this 7/10 Recommended if you like NASCAR.","May 24, 2015","true","39.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","0"

The sponsor will ONLY pay, even if you sign a contract, if you add his logo to the car...\n\nyou will have a budget of 10'000 forever, that means no development of the car, no upgrades ever...\n\nThe worst part is that to even get to this point you have to do 2 races with practice and qualifying which guarantees you are beyond 2 hrs of gametime and won't be able to get a refund over Steam!\n\nhere is a video of it in action : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfUomuS9sqI\n\nthe AI sucks... it has 2 modes... and both suck eventho you can basically set it at 5% intervals from 0-100% this is what it really is: 0-45% = they keep up the first round, then drop back... 50-100  they crush you in the first round and leave you in the dust.\n\nfurthermore there is very little to do other than race, setup is limited to a minimum of things on the car, I guess that is how it is IRL. but it sucks for a game as you kinda don't really feel you can change much on the performance, not anything that matters as the difficulty is the decider on wether or not you get in first or last...\n\nyou can not use any other controller than keyboard or steeringwheel, no Joysticks... So either go pay a bunch for a G27 or some crazy expensive ♥♥♥♥... or good luck with your keyboard and tapping the directional arrow keys, you will do that about 30-40 times per turn... so go practice for this game...\n\nHold Up arrow for 3-4 hrs, while you then go 30-40 presses on left arrow, count to 20, do 30-40 presses on left arrow, and when you counted to 10, you did your first lap of Nascar '15 VD Edition...  sorry Victory Edition\n\nGood game...

So it would be bloody hypocritical to say I wouldn't recommend it if I keep playing it.\n\nIf you like nascar racing on PC there isn't a ton of options. This game was reasonably priced and feels roughly like what nascar racing should be. Frequently frustrating but overall decent.\n\nGame issues are:\n- AI is pretty bad. Unpredictable and doesnt respect track space\n- Basic setup is frustrating and fundamentally different from AI setup. Slow in, fast off, you get run over going into the corner and slam into others as you drive off. Happens on 1/2 the tracks.\n- Needs more controller options. Game appears to be made for a wheel. Trying to play with keyboard is insane. Gamepad works ok but is not optimized.\n- Difficulty is all over the place. Beat Sonoma every time at 100% difficulty, cannot finish in the top 40 at Pocono at 50%\n\nI love nascar so I keep playing this.

This game could be touched up in one week to sky rocket sales i know ive built racing games. This is sad for gamers.

I'm not going to lie, im not a big fan of Nascar and have never been really interested in it, I mainly play the F1 games, but after watching Tiametmarduk play Nascar on Forza I decided that it might be fun to look for a Nascar game. So me and my friend both bought it and, at first, I was slightly dissapointed by the lack of ai on multiplayer. It was a bit of a shame but we gave it a chance and had so much fun. Three of us racing round, great overtakes and crashes. However this game has a lot of bugs. The ammount we found in the first few hours of plying the game was crazy. However the ability to create your own team and make custom paint scheme is superb and something that i think the F1 games are missing.\nOverall, there are a lot of bugs and glitches with this game and a lot of problems, but if you don't take its too seriously it is a lot of fun with friends.\nGameplay: 7/10\nAmmount of fun with friends: 10/10","May 21","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One on Sonoma lets you clip your car partially into a wall and JUST FLY AWAY.\nDon\'t worry goiz, its very hard to do accidentally.\nHeres a guide on how to do that glitch: When you start HOLD THAT RIGHT. We need to hit that toyota advertisement at an angle from the right side. if we do WE CAN BELIEVE WE CAN FLY R KELLY STYLE.\nWorth every penny if you are in to this kind of game, but worth $9.98 for that sonoma glitch\ntry that thing out when the drivers are coming back to finish a lap its hilarious","May 31","true","235.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then again, I am only a casual NASCAR fan, and the hard-core race fan is more likely to invest endless amounts of time into this game. Prior to purchasing this game, I've read a majority of comments, good and bad, to assess the legitimacy of this game. I feel that most of the negativity stems from the balls to the wall hard-core NASCAR fans. And those type of fans tend to complain about the minor things such as: lack of customization options, lack of commentary, repetitive commentary, and the inability to use a headset.\nMy two major complaints are the online aspect(s), or the lack thereof, and the physics of damaged cars. Lets begin with online gaming. In NASCAR '15, the AI is not bad. I have adjusted the difficulty level(s), as well as the number of laps, to the maximum levels. As a result, the AI acts realistically and accordingly, especially when I'm in the middle of a large group of cars. To be the best driver on the track, I've had to work my a** off, and I love that fact. There is no better feeling than knowing I earned a win against the best of the best; guys like Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Jeff Gordon.\nHowever, no AI comes close to holding a candle to playing against real people. I want to play my entire career against other people. How awesome would it be to race against 42 other people every time? That would be the ultimate gaming experience.\nSports games such as NASCAR and Madden Football  would be untouchable if franchise mode or career mode was available online. Some might say that such a thing is simply too much or impossible, but I disagree.\nAs for the physics, my only complaint is that AI controlled cars are capable of racing in-spite of their car receiving extensive physical damage to their car. I feel like it takes an act of God for AI controlled drivers to suffer from heavy damage.  Yet, the gamer will experiences the opposite effect of such physical damage to his or her car. Those who've played NASCAR '15 know exactly what I'm talking about. LMFAO!\nIn closing, I recommend purchasing this game. Most people will get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this game. At $9.99 + tax, this game is dirt cheap and worth adding to your collection. You may find some minor things to be unhappy about. However, the minor issues are worth overlooking. Personally, the two major complaints I discussed are the only real hangups of this game.","June 2","true","120.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
