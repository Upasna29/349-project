It's not difficult to see why. With tongue firmly planted in cheek its a beacon of humorous light in a genre that has much less thrills than it has humor in it these days.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=339881455\nTaking on the role of a homeowner who's only way to defend your home from the advancing shuffling hoard is to use an arsenal of plants else suffer the fate of having said zombies snacking on your brains. At its heart Plants vs. Zombies is a tower-defence game that exudes a simple charm that makes the game difficult not to fall in love with. Since tower-defence games are not generally my style of game it says a lot that I actually really enjoyed this offering and got reasonable mileage out of it. Offering a surprising amount of content once the player has blasted his or her way through the main campaign don't be put of by the flash style graphics as this is one of the better themed Zombie games out there to date.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=339880931\nI immensely enjoyed my time with this title and I am sure many others will feel the same.

Plants Vs. Zombies has been one of the only Tower Defense games that I give a higher rating than 7.\nThe Plants and Zombies are well thought out and creative ideas with some humor in them. The game is balanced(until those damn Yeti Zombies). And for the Genre, the final boss battle does require strategy in order to beat him(which many games just have you slash away without thinking.)\nAnyways, overall I feel this game deserves a 8.5/10\nBut it gets this rating for a few reasons, here are a couple.\nFor starters, the game is sort of a begineer's trap, a few waves and the bucket zombies are already causing a ruckus, another reason is because some of the plants are a bit too strong(as well as some zombies). For instance, the minigun Pea Shooter, that thing is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing monster. And for zombies, the snatcher(I can't remember what it is called.) They have been a reason I have lost many of times, and there is not to many ways to avoid them, it is only if the plant they try to snatch is a chomper, or a minigun peashooter. Rather than that, it's a done deal.\nAnyways, that was my personal review on PvZ and I defenitly do recommend to anybody.

Basically, the idea is very simple: defend your garden(s) against the relentless attacks of Zombies, trying to get into your house. The means you have at your disposal to do so, are ... plants. Plants in all varieties: from the basic grunt (aka the Pea Shooter) through the basic defense plants such as potatoes (halting zombies for awhile) up to plants that are capable of doing great amounts of damage, even inclusing kamikaze-like jumbing plants. Which is needed too: the Zombies come in different varieties and are more resilient than you'd expect from your average Zombie. But they are pretty brainless as well and just rugh at you, in ever growing numbers. There is a bit of strategy involved, however, first of all by choosing the 8 possible plants for a given level, and secondly by the actual planting. Since you have zes different lanes through which the Zombies come Marching In, it's important to keep everything well-covered.\nYou have one resource at your disposal: sunlight, which comes naturally (except in the night-levels) or, mostly, by means of planting sunflowers. The more sunlight you collect, there more plants can grow at the same time. No water needed. Simple, isn't it? Furthermore, the Zombies drop coin (they seem to go on a stroll with some plan...) which you can use to buy new slots for your plants, or some upgrades with a crazy neighbour.\n\nAnd that's it,  really. There is an extensive adventure mode, slowly revealing all the plants (over 40!!) and zombie-types, and there are great mini-games that give you an extended challenge. It's all so well done with vivid graphics, and so humourish that it's difficult to resist. It comes with a bunch a Steam achievements which I recommend heartily, since they let you discover some possibilities of the game you otherwise wouldn't have thought about.\n\nThere are some techical shortcomings which did bother me. The Steam-version is basically a port from the mobile platform versions, and to be honest, it's very badly done. There is only one fixed resolution (800x600 I think), no widescreen support, so the game uses only the middle portion of the screen if you happen to have a widescreen (which I guess most of us have by now). This is really appaling, and should long have been fixed by now. Some graphics configuration options might come in handy as well.\n\nGameplay: 24/30\nGraphics: 14/20\nSound: 7/10\nLongelivety: 7/10\nTechnical & stability: 12/20\nPersonal appreciation: 8/10\n\nOverall: 72/100","August 11, 2014","true","30.3"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","28","35","0","0"

The object of the game is to defend your home against zombies with plants. Sun jewels fall from the sky and you click on them. This gives you currency to buy plants to set them up in the path of zombies. If a zombie makes it to your house, then it eats your brain. The zombie enemies are diverse and quirky. Your plans that you defend your house with are equally fun and quirky.  The campaign is split into 5+ major chunks (front yard, pool, night yard, night pool, roof and so on). Each one of these major chunks has a few levels in it. Each level consists of 3+ waves of zombies marked on the bottom of the map. So its like an endurance sort of thing until the final wave.\n\nThere is plenty of reason to come back and keep playing. Especially since you pick your own plants. The mini games offer a lot of diversity. Things like bowling for zombies, whack a zombie, be-zombied, and even a mode where you need to make it through as zombies to eat brains. There is a ton of fun here for a week and then in a year another week of fun and in another year another week of fun.

The setting is your house where you are in charge of planting mutant plants to defend your home from zombies. You meet only one other character called Crazy Dave, 'cause his shop is, "Crazy!" This tower defense game will challenge your mind as you progress to more difficult levels. What Pop Cap Games had created is a game that is one of the most addictive of it's kind.\n\nYou won't grow tired with Plants vs Zombies as there is a variety of plants (towers) to use. Each plant can be used tactically, like using a Hypno-Shroom against a zombie. Just as the plants name implies it hypnotizes the zombie to fight for your side, obviously recommended for tougher enemies . There are plenty of other plants of it's ilk in this game to meet your strategic need.\n\nPlants vs Zombies has plenty of other challenges like, mini-games, puzzles and survival modes. The mini-games range from plant zombies that shoot back at you, to playing whack-a-zombie. The puzzle mode gives you a chance to play in different modes as the zombies or a breaking a pot game. (Where is Link when you need him?) Survival mode is similar to adventure mode; it just has more challenging levels. Then, there is a Zen Garden you can unlock as you progress through adventure mode. The goal there is to make a money farm for your grinding and to help grow a talking tree. So, yes plenty of other things to do long after you have finished adventure mode.\n\nWhat kind a game has so much replay value? My wife and son still enjoy playing it, years after it's release. It is a shame we won't likely be seeing a true sequel for the PC, but at least it's on your mobile phone. (Thanks EA...) Plants vs Zombies has plenty of fun for everyone of all ages. This game can stand tall for being one of the best games of it's genre and for the price.

The last time I played this game was about 2 years ago. I'm back playing it, though. If you want a awesome Plants vs Zombies game that isn't infested with EA then buy this. Or in general, if you want a awesome tower defense, go with this.\n\nThere is only one downside. This game works perfectly with Windows 7 and lower. I have Windows 8.1... So what does that mean?\n\nIt means that if you play with 3D acceleration and Fullscreen there would be constant frame drops (this isn't my computer, there are people on the steam discussion page that have the same problem.) and weird blocky pixelated shapes around the zombies, the plants, everything... and the game would look really pixelated. But if you play in windowed mode and turn off 3D acceleration then everything is fine. I'm able to play the game in a good 120 FPS.\n\nOverall, It's a really good tower defense.

I've played previously on the Ipod, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS systems, but using the computer was a new experience. If you haven't played this game before, trust me, it's worth the five bucks. This is a strategic tower defence, where you use plants to repell a zombie attack. Defend your house and your brains using the Peashooter, Cabbagepult, and many more, in locations like your front yard, night in your front yard, your pool in the day, your pool in the night, and your roof!\nPros: Good graphics, not too good or bad to distract you. The game is pretty much simple, so everybody can easily play. There's more than defense too! Minigames, A plant garden, a shop, and a giant tree you grow!\nThere's no cons I've discovered, as the gameplay and content I've completed on all four platforms is bug-free.

I just got the Golden Sunflower trophy today and all I have left to do is to get the remaining acheivements. The Game Of The Year edition adds so much more content that I had not originally played. Even though I had beat the game about 5 times before, I still wanted to buy this so I could beat all the mini-games, puzzles, and survival modes. If anyone is wondering why they should buy this, I have two reasons. First, the price on Steam is incredible considering the release price of the game and that this is the GOTY edition. Second, Plants vs. Zombies is one of my favorite games of all time because it is easy to play and has soooo much content in the game, in fact, you can complete the adventure mode twice! and still get new content.\nAlso, I love the Zen Garden, mine is completely filled and I check on it every other day or so because it is one simple aspect of the game that is just fun to maintain and doesn't take much time at all to do.\nI would give this game 10/10 for all the reasons listed above!","August 18, 2014","true","15.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Maybe ‚ÄúA Botanists guide to survive the zombie apocalypse‚Äù? Basically, the game is all about using different plants to keep various types of zombies away from your house. There are several different levels each with their own challenge.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  The story itself is very short, there isn‚Äôt much to say about it either. The game goes by pretty quickly but it is a lot of fun to play. And if you‚Äôre trying to squeeze out even more time, there are some great mini games to play. The ‚ÄúWhack a zombie‚Äù, might have given me carpal tunnel someday.\n\nGame Play:  This is a strategy game, so you will need to select the plants you want to use, then place them in various orders that will hopefully ward off the hoards of zombies. Most of the games start slow, and really pick up in pace.\n\nAchievements: As I do for all my reviews, I also make note of the different achievements in the game  and the work to get them. To be honest I don‚Äôt‚Äô really remember how difficult these achievements were. Most of them were unlocked as you played the game, although there were a few that required some setup. All in all, the achievements wouldn‚Äôt be a reason to get this game; this game would be fun with or without achievements. (I can hear everyone on my friends list gasp right now)\n\nPrice: Plants vs. Zombies is normally $9.99 and I personally put 81 hours into the game, so in my mind that‚Äôs a fair trade, although it never hurts to wait for a 50% or 75% off sale. Occasionally older games like this go on 90% off sales, so it would be best to wait till then to get the most out of your money. However you wouldn‚Äôt be disappointed if you simply bought it right away.\n\nConclusion:  I loved this game, it was a very simple, short game but I squeezed a lot of time out of it. As far as the game is concerned I consider this one a ‚Äúmust buy‚Äù, at some point in your steam life.","February 14, 2014","true","81.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is very easy to learn and complete and even though some of the challenges provide some higher level of difficulty it is not enough to give the game any sort of longevity.\n\nThe sound and graphics are heavily linked to the humor of the game which also happens to be one of the strong points of the game. Although the quality is that of a mobile game the artstyle is cute and interesting enough to forgive that.\n\nPlants vs. Zombies is a fun little game that most people will enjoy but few will love.

Some might argue that they're reminiscent of simple flash games, but I'll have to disagree. The quality of their games is pretty amazing - from gameplay to music. Plants vs. Zombies is no exception, I've played this game on multiple platforms already and it's always a fun way to spend time. The objective is to defend your lawn against zombies with poor writing skills using various plants. As you progress, more plants and zombies are unlocked and the game becomes more interesting. No particular skill is required as the game is quite easy in my opinion, even so, it's still pretty fun. Definitely one of the best tower defense games available!","July 13, 2012","true",""," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is a fairly average flash game in the tower-defense genre. It's a somewhat illogical mashup of your towers (plants) versus the attackers (zombies), in which you are defending your lawn, backyard, and roof against the attackers who want to eat your grains, then your brains. The levels are static and only change every 10 missions, which means the variation in gameplay comes from your tower composition and the rock paper scissors you play with the different kinds of zombies. It's not particularly well balanced as some plants are plain useless and most are situational at best. The actual campaign is quite short (but still manages to feel overly long), but you accrue resources at such a slow rate that you can be sure that there's a lot of grinding to be done to unlock everything, for those people that enjoy that. Somewhat underwhelming as a PC game, but probably worth playing on your laptop or iDevice.","March 25, 2013","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Plants vs. Zombies is a game that I wholy advise you to get. Sure it is just another tower defense game, but it's executed in such a way that you'll find yourself unable to ever get away from it (and this comes from someone who is practically sick of tower defense games).\n\nThe music is great, it loops but it's not annoying and you can very rarely tell if it has restarted or not. PvZ has a TON of humor and great characters. Give it a spin (try the demo even) but I really advise you to just go buy the full game.\n\nVerdict: BUY","November 30, 2010","true","24.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Right off the bat we're told that the player needs to stop the zombies from entering his home and eating his brains.  Yet, right after this the player is given control of planting vegetation in his front yard.  If you let a zombie into your home it eats your brain, even if you're in mid plant.  How is this possible?  If I'm in my home, how can I be planting plants?  You never actually see a representation of yourself planting said plants either.  Are they alluding the idea that I'm some kind of God, capable of planting plants unseen, and able to relax in my home at the same time?  If this is true, then why dont I just crush the zombies?  Why toy with them?  Zombies represent humankind, the plants clearly represent nature.  This game is telling every player to bring the world back to its roots.  Get rid of the brainless humans, and let the powerful, just plants (nature) rule the world once more.

Plants vs. Zombies is a game that I wholy advise you to get. Sure it is just another tower defense game, but it's executed in such a way that you'll find yourself unable to ever get away from it (and this comes from someone who is practically sick of tower defense games).\n\nThe music is great, it loops but it's not annoying and you can very rarely tell if it has restarted or not. PvZ has a TON of humor and great characters.

Now you, with your neighbour Crazy Dave (or you can just call him Crazy Dave) and all the seeds you could grab from the garden centre must stop the zombies from entering your house and EATING YOUR BRAINS!\n\nThere's a variety of plants to choose from which you earn as you progress through the game, and there's a vast plethora of Zombies to see and get eaten by, from regulars to those who look like Micheal Jackson. Gameplay's simple: Get some sunlight, plant some...plants, and kill some MOTHER, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING, ZOMBIES!\n\nIt's genuinely funny. Along with an artstyle so adorable it's probably illegal, just looking through the Suburban Almanac (a book that contains info on all the plants and zombies you've seen so far), there's certainly enough giggles in there alone, and that's not even mentioning the shenanigans Crazy Dave gets up too, when he's not flogging you stuff from the back of his car (spoilers!).\n\nI suppose the only real failing of PvZ is that it's designed for casual play, so isn't particularly difficult, both a blessing and curse. After a while, it does get a bit 'samey', even with new plants and zombies to plant and kill respectively. Eventually you'll get a routine going for each level, so it can become a bit monotunous at times.\n\n8/10 - Simple gameplay, nice artstyle.","June 27, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The zombies are cute in their varied ways (but certianly not in their looks) and the plants themself each have a distinct look and feel.\nThe gameplay is simple, yet allows for depth and is filled with variations. It is not just some new enemies and plants now and then, but five different battlefields and loads of extra modes.\nSpecial mention goes to the music. In addition to being good it is also dynamic and changes in respect to game events, something that more games need to employ.","October 15, 2011","true","57.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Build plants, stop zombies from eating your brains,and meet a crazy man? The game shows you which zombies you will face before you pick your plants, so you can make the wise choice. There is an amazing amount of plants to use, a ton of zombies to use them all on with their unique abilities and usage. As the game progresses it gets harder to decide which plants to pick for the onslaught of zombies to come. It actually does bring out a bit of hardcore gaming, but it is aimed at the whole family. This game won a Game Of The Year award and deserves it too, it truly a amazing game with little to no flaws, lots of humor and references to other real life material. It's worth your money by a long shot.","December 29, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A combination of strategy, adorable graphics, this game can be simple 5 minute quick play, or something you could play for hours. The learning curve makes it very accessible, while the possibilities (when you've unlocked a lot of the plants at least) of different combinations of plants in your arsenal gives you a lot of room for setting up an offence to match your personal style.

ANYWAY after playing this game you can tell them what YOU would do to defend yourself without fail: grow Plants. In this game, you must defend your house from countless waves of 25 different kinds of Zombies (all being sent at you by the Evil Dr. Edgar George Zomboss) using your arsenal of 40 Plants (plus 9 Bonus plants that can be purchased later on). As you play through Adventure Mode, you defend your Front Yard, Back Yard and even Roof (Both at Day AND Night)!

So for GOTY Edition I would have liked to have seen a HD version or at least some improvement.

The graphics are amazing, the soundtrack is one of the best gaming soundtracks I have ever heard and overall this is the best game Popcap has made to date!\n\nThere is only one con to this game. The Michael Jackson look alike zombie was removed in the Game of The Year Edition and was replaced with a 70s styled disco dancing, afro having, platform shoes wearing zombie. The Michael Jackson family threatened to sue Popcap for copyright of likeness if this was not done. I highly suggest you purchase a retail copy of the non Game of the Year Edition. Thankfully this update changes the gameplay in no form or fashion but definitely removes from the game's previous impecable personality!\n\nOverall 4.5 stars!","December 30, 2010","true","101.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Progressively getting more and more difficult.\n+In the same context of the previous positive, the levels also change as the game progresses. (Less aisles to place defenses. Day / Night. Fog. Square blockers [Places you can't put defense plants] Front yard, back yard, roof, pool etc.\n+Plethora of various plants you can choose from, level to level. [Same context, plenty of various zombies as well. That also get more challenging in their abilities or "tricks" you have to deal with]\n+Handful of mini-games to change the pace, when you're tired of this games equivelent of a story mode.\n\nHonestly, aside from the main reason I'm not recommending this game, I can think of very few negative aspects of game.  Which is namely the fact that I can't actually play the game for extended periods of time. Which I believe is more a personal aspect, as opposed to anything wrong with the game. As matches get harder, I find myself playing one or two levels and then giving it a break, and playing a different game.\n\nHowever, the extremely sad, and utterly heart breaking fact is that all of the above positives don't matter in the slightest, because you can't play the game. At all. Period. A recent update and it simply broke. You see the logo for Pop Games, and then you get a black screen. Nothing can be done except alt-tabbing out and closing, or alt-cntrl-dlt and closing the program that way. Such a huge let down. And it still hasn't been fixed, almost a month out (at the time of this review.)\nYes ... I waited almost a full month, giving them the benefit of the doubt that they were fixing this. As stated, this review might very well change, and quickly, assuming they fix this problem.

The main part consists of strategic fighting of zombies by the help of cute looking plants. On the side there are several mini games like zombie bowling and a slots game.\n\nDespite containing zombies this game is anything but scary and is easily suitable for people of all ages. The difficulty level increases per game, but is easy to handle if you practice a bit. When stuck look up the several plants and zombies in the almanac and come up with a new strategy to defeat the type of zombies bothering you.\n\nThe pros of this game are:\nVery cute graphicsEasy to understand gameplayHumorSuitable for all ages\nI can't think of any cons.

What do I mean?\n\nFirst off, it's charming. Cute, funny, bursting with character: It's just unqiue. Each zombie-type and plant has it's own little encyclopdia entry, often-times filled with the discarded dreams of zombie youth or a taste of plant family-drama.\n\nSecond, it keeps your fingers busy even when it's being easy. I don't know about you, but I HATE having down-time in my games. YOU are the one responsible for collecting resources with a clickity-click (along with coins to unlock items) and is a welcome change from the passive reception of wealth in the genre.\n\nThird, there are loads of little fun mini-games and extras that the game encourages you master. Zombie-bowling anyone?\n\n\nSo yeah, buy this game. The learning-curve is gentle (maybe a little bit too gentle!) and is a great starting point for anybody who is wondering what's so fun about Tower Defense games.","July 6, 2011","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Soon, he was getting the hang of things. I jokingly put handcuffs on him and forgot we had no keys. I told him to struggle, but avast no success.\n\nEventually, this 5 minute joke turned into an hour hunt scounging around a town for a hacksaw to free him, defending him from zombies and the elements. I fed him, gave him drinks and comforted him. In the end, he was never mad at me. He had complete fun with the hilarity of the situation.\n\nAs our supplies ran low, I told him the bad news once we had hit the last building in town. He too had realized we were at the end. He got on his knees and I asked him what was on his mind. We both knew what was going to happen at this moment. I legitimately felt sadness and cried as I trained my gun against his back head. The sun setting in the distance. I told him that one of us will have to walk this earth for eternity, and that I should be the one to suffer the curse. Instantly I felt nothing more then the cold air against my back neck as the echos of my gun filled the town. Zombies began to run towards me as I held out in an abandoned apartment building at the top hill of town. I made sure to spare no zombie, nor myself.\n\nI still walk this earth as we speak. Making sure to leave cans of beans and cola at every apartment building I pass. A tribute, and an offering to my shortly lived friend. Rest in piece Ryan (3).\n\n7/10 I kept finding blue beanies.","October 15, 2014","true","1.1"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

Spent many, many hours on both my brother's account and the iPad version, and have beaten the game many times because it was fun. However, this game isn't compatible with Windows 8 at all. It runs at 20 FPS maximum with 3D acceleration on or off, and I tried everything to fix it, but the only way was to play in Windowed mode, and it's looks very small on a 1080p display. If you don't own Windows 8 / 8.1 or even 10, buy this game, or the mobile version, you won't regret it. It's hours of fun guaranteed.\nMy PC Settings: i7 4790, GTX 970, 16GB RAM\n\nThe mobile versions, especially the iPad version, are much better. The mobile graphics are actually sharper(depending of your device) than the 800x600 Fixed PC resolution, and are equipped with many more minigames and ways to play the game. This PC version, to be considered a GOTY edition, lacks many things. The only good things that I see in the PC version is that you can have a maximum of 10 seed slots, unlike 9 in Mobile, and the Survival Endless rarely lags with all the zombies trying to attack you(My iPad 3 crashed several times on that mode).\nIf this game receives an update to support newer OS, then I will change my review to positive, but I doubt that PopCap will do that.\n\nI'm sorry if there is a mispelling.

The achievements rapidly become grindy, and gameplay is almost exactly the same from level to level. Though the developers attempt to offset this by introducing new mechanics, the forced second playthrough of the campaign and seemingly pointless records you must reach to complete the game really put a damper on the fun I got out of it. If it's exceedingly cheap (as it usually is), I might suggest you pick it up just for a casual break in between real games, but overall, I wouldn't buy this unless it's dirt cheap.\n\nIf that was all I had to say, I might consider recommending this game. However, the Mac version of it is exceedingly poor. I typically play on my PC, but when I tried it out on my girlfriend's MacBook Pro, the amount of glitches and crashes were simply astronomical. The game would crash roughly every ten or fifteen minutes, and gameplay would sometimes lag to hell and back. I did, however, sell a plant in my Zen Garden for $1,240,996 (they typically go for about $60-$300), so I got that goin' for me, which is nice. A glitch that works CRAZY much in my favor, however, is still a glitch.

So bad, I‚Äôm hesitant to even call it a port for fear of putting it in the same group as Sonic Adventures DX‚Ä¶FREAKING SONIC ADVENTURES DX IS A BETTER PC PORT! *puke*\n\nEDIT: Since so many people are downvoting this review, Im assuming theyre doing so because I said its a bad PC port. I should point out that I was incorrect; this is not a PC port, since the game was originally designed for the PC. Regardless, its still a terrible version of the game; ALL of my points (including that terrible PC ports like Sonic Adventures DX put this to shame) still stand. OK? So now you have no justification for downvoting, right? No "good" justification anyway...","April 2, 2015","false","5.0"," 6 of 33 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","6","33","0","1"

I loved it so much I decided it was worth dropping 10 bucks on. It wont boot, crashes when you try to run it. I have installed updates, uninstalled, reinstalled, rebooted, played with the config file, and sacrificed a virgin in an attempt to get this game working. Hell I caved in and even called customer support (2 hours no fix). Guess what works perfectly  with no issues: the pirated copy.
