THREE, Plus scenarios. I have played on of the Campaigns and it is pretty good so far.

Simply because there is nothing else like it available and for all its technical faults (of which it has too many to count) and being one of the most poorly optimized 3D engines I have ever played on - there is no other sandbox platform that does what it does.

At least we'd get a game everyone would be able to run and enjoy.\nOkay, the old engine could probably use some tweaking and optimization but it's not fundamentally different from the newer engine versions and yet my quad core CPU and medium rang graphics card still struggle to render a village environment in Arma 3 with viewing distance set to a meager 1.200m ... Imagine how terrific a viewing distance of 1.200m would be when flying an aircraft and trying to locate a ground target while also avoiding enemy AA ?! - That's right, it isn't ...\nIn Arma Gold I can easily turn up the viewing distance to 5.000m, have medium/high detail settings and still have nice frame rates.\n\nTo cut a long story short: this game runs like a charm and basically offers the same gameplay that Arma 2 and 3 have to offer.

Sometimes when you're looking down a scope, the character will fidgit arond making it difficult to hit an enemy. The standard controls can be strange, like V is to look down the scope and G opens your inventory. Your squad can be unresponsive at times. Also, when commanding a squad, it's really difficult to understand what every command does and in what sequence you're supposed to use them in.

There are 7 or 8 different missions you can choose from each one is randomly generated, so if you like Ambushes you can do those all over the map.

Animations and radio comms are still robotic and almost frustrating at times. The campaigns have great voice acting and a good story line but immersive cinematics are lacking and inferior to the original. I have always maintained that the release of this title was premature and incomplete in many areas, believeing that Arma 2 was what this title was intended to be, except released early to rake in some funds to finish developing it.\n\nThe user made mods and missions can be found at Armaholic[www.armaholic.com] and a limited few missions at [urlhttp://www.ofpec.com/]OFPEC[/url]. I recommend the Cold War Rearmed Mod[www.armaholic.com], Finnish Defense Forces Mod{/url], and [url]The Unsung Vietnam War Mod[www.armaholic.com].\n\nI am on the fence with recommending this one. For you folks with lower end PC's, defnitily grab this title and download some of the user made content to extend its life. There is not much of a community for this title anymore but there is plenty of content out there to get your moneys worth. For those who can run Arma2 or Arma3, I say move on to those.

The graphics have aged well almost 9 years on and still looks good even today on maxed settings, the only bad thing about this game is that Gamespy is not with us and this game now is only held together by single player. The lack of multiplayer does not mean this game is lacking content and you won't get board in a hurry: the single player is challenging and can cause some frustration at times, the editor is a fun tool and I have fond memories of putting two sides together and see who will win, but I do get board of it because I lack a imagination and sometimes I can't be arsed to put the work in to build a base or do some configuration. Overall I recommend this game because you can do what you want and also it offers more challenge than the corridor linear shooters today that claim to be true military shooters.

(Biased Opinion)\n\nThe game itself is amazing, the campaign missions are great. And I love how it's based off joint service branches. The Army and the Marines, but the developers when they made this was a bit un-informed on terms of the branches. The Marines never wore ACU's so therefore they maybe didn't know the difference between MCCUU's and ACU's. But I can look past that.\n\nAs in ArmA 2 there is a 3D Editor that I wish was installed onto this game, I can't line my FOB walls up correctly therefore wasting my time to make a Forward Opeartions Base. Probably just me, or could be others... The map likes to go invisible then come back to visibilty on the mission editor map which is so damn annoying.\n\nMultiplayer was shutdown a few weeks after receiving the game, that's a drag. I liked playing CTF and playing 'Realism Unit' missions with my lads. But that all soon came to an end, but it's still a great game to play single player with.

Here we have neither "warm lamp gameplay" and really good story, like in my so much loved Cold war Crisis, nor good graphics with advanced simulation at a modern level. Tons of lags and bugs from nowhere and plot "about nothing", even without a main character are present though. So, if you want the ultimale simulation, you should purchase A2 with addons. If you want excellent graphics unsurepassed ballistics and things of such sorts to the prejudice to the simulation itself to some extent, this is surely A3, if you want an excellent plot, neither lags nor bugs and probably something most challenging, then have a look at OFP Cold war Crisis (now it is called ArmA: Cold war Assault). Still recommend it, because of a good simulation for its time, outstanding music, quite attractive models and my overall love to BIS.","April 28, 2014","true","5.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 11\nArma - Gold Edition\nPurchase Date: 1/16/2014\n\nI ended up getting a bunch of the Arma games as part of a Humble Bundle.  I only really heard of Arma because of the DayZ mod that everyone talks about.   Normally this isn't the kind of game I would be looking to buy, but I appreciate that the Humble Bundle gives me a good excuse to try out some games I'd otherwise ignore.\n\nThe first thing I did when I started the game was go right to the graphics options.  Since Arma has been out for awhile, it looks a little dated, but this also means that I can crank up all of the graphics options to make it look as nice as possible.  Arma gives plenty of options to tweak, much as you'd expect from a modern game.\n\nSince I had no idea how to play or what I was doing, I made sure to start with the tutorial.  Arma provides a series of tutorial missions, starting with a basic obstacle course to run through.  It gave me the option to do a run through first without being timed, which I'm glad it did as it took me a little bit to get used to the controls.\n\nI had an issue with the default mouse controls.  By default Arma is configured to have this huge 'floating' area on the mouse.  This floating area defines how far you can move the mouse before the camera moves.  So it's kind of a sensitivity thing, but for me it just made the controls feel super laggy.  Luckily the options menu let me turn this all the way down.  I can't imagine why someone would want it configured otherwise.\n\nOnce I had the controls nailed down, I finished the obstacle course, with the drill sargeant barking at me as I went.  Next up was a shooting range, so I could have a chance to get used to all of the weapons.  The game offers various lanes, each with a different weapon.  The game gives certifications on each weapon, based on how well you can shoot.  First I trailed with a rifle, then a sub-machine gun, followed by a pistol.  I ended up doing pretty well with these, but then I bombed with the grenade launcher.  The last lane contained a sniper rifle.\n\nThe next tutorial introduced me to my squad, and consisted of me giving my squad various commands.  I found this part of the tutorial rather cumbersome.  I get that this is a simulator so it's supposed to be in-depth and give a lot of options.  But it also seems a lot harder to get things done than it should be.  I hit a key to toggle my whole squad, but it wasn't really obvious to me when all of my squad was selected.  I wish it had been a little easier to know which squad members were selected and which ones weren't.\n\nThe squad menu has an impressive list of options.  I can do things like order my squad into a particular formation, or move the squad members to a waypoint.  This took some getting used to; in particular I had a hard time getting my squad to enter a vehicle I had targetted.\n\nI should mention that the game is fully voiced, which sounds nice, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the implementation.  Some of the voicing was fine, like in the earlier tutorial where the drill sargeant was bossing me around.  But I didn't like the squad voicing as much.  A lot of the dialog is stitched together dynamically, where words were recorded one at a time, and then spliced into sentences.  When played back like this, it just doesn't sound natural, and it's kind of jarring.\n\nOnce I got the basics of squad combat down, the next tutorial put me in a tank.  This ended up being pretty fun as I rode around and fired at various targets with different weapons on the tank.  Again I struggled with the controls, and remembering which key is supposed to switch weapons.  I liked how the game simulates the different positions in the tank, as I went between driving, gunning, and commanding.\n\nI mentioned above about the dialog being stitched together.  This got really old when I was trying to command the tank to move back to the base.  I had a hard time telling which direction the tank was facing, so I kept hitting keys to rotate the tank.  Every time I hit a key, the game would bark that command to the driver.  I kept hitting keys in fairly rapid succession, and the game kept barking commands like I was directing some kind of demented Simon Says game.\n\nOnce I parked the tank, the final tutorial mission I took part in was flying a helicopter.  The mission starts out with the helicopter pilot telling me to get in and fly, and he'll join me as a co-pilot.  So I hopped in the helicopter and started up the engine, and the game proceeds to explain the controls.  So I take the helicopter up slowly as directed.  Then the co-pilot starts yelling at me because I left him behind.  Oops!  It was kind of hilarious because on one hand, the game is happily telling me how to fly, and on the other hand my co-pilot is screaming at me from the ground.  I tried to land the helicopter so I could let the co-pilot board but instead I ended up killing the co-pilot with the helicopter blades approximately .5 seconds before I crashed the helicopter and died.\n\nI ended up restarting the mission so I could get a proper start.  This time with my co-pilot in the copter, I took off and started flying around.  It didn't take me long to realize that I am pretty terrible at this.  I was doing okay until the game wanted me to hover, which I couldn't do at all.  I finally ended up skipping that step in the mission, and next the game had me go to pick up some soliders.  Instead I ended up crashing the helicopter.  Predictably I died.\n\nAt this point I was over my hour, and I didn't get to check out the final tutorial, which would have taken the helicopter into combat.  It's probably just as well I didn't try that one, given my meager piloting skills.\n\nSo I'm left deciding whether to give this game a thumbs up or thumbs down.  I'm going to be reviewing Arma II next, so I'll be curious to see how it differs from this one. I'm really pretty torn here because this was really a mixed bag of things I liked and things I didn't.  I can see where this game would be fun, and I know I barely scratched the surface of what the game has to offer.  But I also have to be honest with myself and realize that I don't see myself bothering to come back to this game.  So based on this I'm going to have to go with the thumbs down.","June 20, 2015","false","1.1"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","2"

I am going to give this another try later, but right now my first impressions are not good. For starters, I am playin gon a Windows 8.1 PC, and I had to fix a graphical issue that a lot fo other people have also experienced. It wasn't a big deal, but is an inconvience.\nAs for actualy gameplay, that's not too good either. The controls are uncomfortable and strange, and any sort of aiming is just bad. I realize that real life bullets don't always go where we want them to, but aiming felt almost usless and sometimes the sights didn't line up, I would shot at a target, and see the bullet hit the dirt off to the side of where I was aiming, or overhead, or underneath, and I was stationary and prone when firing.\n\nMaybe I just don't get it, maybe it's just too much mil sim for me, either way, I just don't like it.","July 29, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","1"

Is it because of the ugly layout? *sigh*\n\nHere are reasons why I don't recommend this game:\n\nFirst of all,\nTHERE WILL BE A GRAPHIC GLITCH\nif you're using an Intel HD4000 graphic card; the main menu will be totally black/missing textures. Replacing the original Arma.exe (downloaded from Steam) with the version 1.14 Arma.exe will sove the problem. Just search 'arma 1.14 exe' on google. Not a big deal.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere are the reasons:\n\nArmA 1 is the transitional game between the original OFP and nowadays ArmA titles.\nIt was supposed to present gameplay as ArmA 2 provided later on. Sadly, the game engine was not well-developped at the time. The AI is poorly implemented, and the problematic optimization results in frequent frames-drop issues.\n\nMeanwhile, just like ArmA 2, GAMESPY SERVERS ARE DOWN -- which also renders that the built-in Internet Multiplayer is no longer functional. Even let alone of that, ArmA 2 has more servers hosted than this game.\n\nVerdict:\n\nIf you want to experience Mil-Sim gameplay, which are also featured in ArmA 2 or 3 with more choices of weapons/vehicles, better graphics, better sounds, improved AI and fully functional multiplayer, and tons of spendid MODS, then you are strongly recommended to try ArmA 2 or 3.\n\nOnly if you're a hardcore fan of the ArmA games, this game does not worth that much.\n\nPS: ArmA Gold Edition = ArmA Armed Assault + expansion pack Queen's Gambit","July 15, 2015","false","2.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","3"

Game over. One bullet is all it takes. And vice versa. So you have to play it really careful. After the first few minutes of play time, as soon as I heard shooting I was dropping prone, frantically looking around hoping to be able to shoot the shooter before he got me. That's fun.\nOf course, realism has its drawbacks. Sometimes you spend like 10 minutes running from point A to point B, just to get to the action.\n\nHowever... the controls are clunky, there's a LOT of bugs (mainly graphical glitches, but also in scripted events and the like), the graphics are rather bland and boring, and the AI is stupid (I spent half an hour crawling in the dark - with night goggles - looking for a guard who was yelling: "he's over here, I can see him moving", only to find him all alone, standing still, with his back to me. As matter of fact, he was the only guard left. So, I shot him. Done.)\n\nAll in all, while this game can be a lot of fun, it frustrated me more than it gave me game pleasure. So...

It is a bloody joke, it has to be. It claims to be a realistic simulator, but apparently it's realism is based upon the fact it simulates you being a soldier with a light case of sclerosis, because it has the most convoluted controls I have ever had the disgust of using. The game doesn't control, I can't dare call this "controlling". For every simple thing you'd just do naturally, you have to scroll through menus. Every time. You wanna switch to another weapon? Scroll through menu. Want to give a simple order to your squad? Scroll through menu. Want to exit the vehicle you're in? Scroll through menu.\n\nAdding to the fun mechanic of "Scroll through menu", there's the fact your soldier can't even hold his weapon straight. Now, okay, I know keeping accuracy with a heavy weapon at a distance is tough, but even if your gun has a bipod, your character won't use it. He'll just keep shambling his arms along. Hell, even jumping on the ground barely helps the aim shaking on the sniper rifles.\n\nThe animations are a lot of times awful, if not non-existant, but those aren't that important. The tutorial missions were filled with bugs on my end, not a single one didn't have to be reset because an objective decided to not count as completed after I did so.\n\nThis game is a travesty, I know it's old, but doesn't make it any less crap. I'm thankful I got this on the humble bundle, if I had bought this at full price, I'd be ready to kill someone right about now.\n\nNow, on to first find a mod to make this game actually control and, if I don't succeed, move on to ArmA 2, see if that has ANY improvement over this.","January 24, 2014","false","7.2"," 6 of 24 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","6","24","0","0"

But now I see why ARMA 1 got such bad reviews when it was released.  The single player campaign is so terribly botched that it's unplayable.  Some missions are laughably easy.  Others are unwinnable because of scripting bugs.  There's even one that's supposed to be a night stealth mission but you can't win because it happens during the day.  And then there's the missions where it just suddenly says you won, probably because the enemies died flipping over their vehicle or falling off a roof on the other side of the map.\n\nIf you want multiplayer, get ARMA3.  If you want single-player get Operation Flashpoint or whatever they call it these days.","February 1","false","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
