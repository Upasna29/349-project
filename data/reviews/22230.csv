"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrFrogAddMe/recommended/22230/","DrFrogAddMe","Dr. Frog ☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrFrogAddMe/","500 products in account","Rock of ages is a game about rolling down a hill; to squish a little man, literally.\n\n\n\nIn Rock of Ages, there is a very minor story, hardly relating to the game. This isnt a bad thing because the game doesn't need a story to be enjoyed, however the story is humorous.\n\n\n\nThe core gameplay aspect of Rock of Ages is rolling your rock down a slope riddled with defences in order to smash down an enemy gate. The opponents, are not only people from history, also attack your gate and the player must build their own defences in order to slow down or stop the other rock. You gain in game gold in order to pay for defences, and to upgrade your rock.\n\n\n\nThe defences range from towers, elephants, catapults and even bombs. These are used to slow down the enemy rock, if enough damage is done to the rock, it shrinks, dealing less damage. The upgrades for your rock are simple, adding metal spikes or lighting your rock on fire, dealing extra damage. Damage is also decided by the speed of the rock when it collides with the door; the faster the rock, the harder it hits.\n\n\n\nRock of ages also has a few mini games, one of which is skeeball. Rock of ages also has trading cards, and very easy achievements, making the game apply to a larger audience.\n\n\n\nRock of Ages does things right\n\n\n\nIts story is humorous\n\nThe gameplay is overall enjoyable\n\nEasy 100% achievements\n\nThe co-op is good fun with friends\n\nThe mini games are mostly fun\n\nThe in game destruction looks good\n\nIts overall very original\n\n\n\nRock of ages does some things wrong\n\n\n\nIt can be repetitive\n\nSlightly boring to some older gamers\n\nThe Defences aren't overly effective\n\nThe respawn locations can really mess with the player\n\nLacks real substance\n\n\n\nOverall rock of ages isn't bad, it's just basic. The $10.99(CAD) price tag is way too high unless the player is planning to 100% it. Its a fun game to play with friends, however. It also makes the game lots more fun.\n","June 2, 2015","true","14.5"," 86 of 90 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","86","90","6","0"

Honestly, how can you go wrong with a game in which you control a gigantic boulder (of varying shapes and sizes - I must say the fist is my favorite), and use it to shatter your opponent's gate? Even better, you get to squash their defenseless, flailing forms immediately afterwards to an immensely satisfying whoopie cushion sound.\n\nIf that is not enough to satisfy, there are also trained war bovines, elephants, and mammoths for you to use and abuse in the defense of your fortress. There are also elephant-launching airships..  If you are like me, you may derive much more pleasure from their strategic placement to troll your enemies, whether they be human players (yes, this game has online multiplayer) or historical figureheads.\n\nHighly Recommend for some hard core laughter.","November 18, 2014","true","42.8"," 93 of 100 people (93%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","93","93","100","16","2"

You see, Rock of Ages is actually an accurate historical representation of medieval warfare. Instead of having men, women and children slaughter each other mindlessly over some petty argument, disputes were settled by using sentient boulders. Yes, rocks. As this round stone, you travel through the ages of classical art (t)rolling and smashing everything on your way! Just remember though, you are not alone. Just as it happens, the enemy team has sent away a boulder of their own, and you have to race down with them! Whoever splats (oh god I love that sound) the enemy general, wins.\n\nAll in all, hilarious visuals and sounds, fun gameplay, some surprisingly complex base defense features and absolutely fantastic multiplayer modes, together make this game a must buy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/22230/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nRock of Ages isn't exactly the type of game that you'll become instantly attracted to after the first glance, but looking beyond that and getting to play it will most definitely change your impression. The words that describe this game the best would be somewhere in the area of a tower defense with two ends where your only attack option to help you reach your enemy's gate is your giant boulder, boulder that you control. The story mode puts you and your customizable boulder travelling through time and space, starting with ancient Rome and ending with the Renaissance era, fighting different characters from each time and location such as Leonardo da Vinci, Plato or Napoleon Bonaparte. There is no real difference between all those battles except for the map where the battle takes place, but the short, humorous animations that introduce the battle are a delight, as they make fun of anything and everything such as the moment when Leonardo da Vinci realizes that kids nowadays play with boulders in a video game created using "computieres". There are plenty of such moments and even though there is no actual plot to tie-in those battles apart from the fact that your boulder is inexplicably rolling from one battle to the next one after you've defeated your previous adversary, you can return to each one of them at any given time in order to collect the remaining hidden keys, improve your scores or simply because you wanted to have a quick laugh at one of those animations one more time. Choosing your character and your boulder is easy and intuitive, having a simple option in the main menu that allows you to select those and apply them to all the modes, including Time Trial and Multiplayer.\nRating: 8.5\n\nGameplay\nRock of Ages was meant to be a tower defense game at its core, but that isn't the thing that makes it fun to play, as the boulder rolling mechanic will steal the show every single time you play. In theory a winning combination would consist of a valid strategy in tower defense in order to stop your enemy from reaching your gate and good boulder-controlling skills so you can get past your opponent's defences and crash into his gate, but that isn't exactly the case as for most of the times your defences will do nothing, but slow down your enemy's boulder for a bit and unless you're playing against the AI which is dumb enough to get stuck in random places at times, it is almost impossible for a human being to fail getting past any number of defences, so the game becomes more of a speed test, awarding the fast one to roll his boulder into the enemy gate, using the tower defense mechanic only to buy a few extra seconds. One more thing that influences the gameplay comes in the form of boulder power-ups, which range from the Angel Wings that allow you to perform one double jump to the Sun Upgrade which will deal considerably more damage if you manage to get to the enemy gate with your power-up still intact. After finishing the main story, you will definitely want to play against another human being as the AI's actions are predictable and there's no real challenge in defeating one of the animated characters one more time, and even if you do have all the maps from the story at your disposal in Multiplayer, matchmaking isn't as smooth as it could be, as you can spend entire minutes finding someone to play with and even when you do, it will become boring after a while since the fastest one on a map will always win.\nRating: 7\n\nGraphics\nThe game is built using the Unreal Engine, which makes it a pretty thing to look at, but even so it is far from realistic and the physics can sometimes be weird, bouncing your boulder into a different direction. The crash effects are decent and the boulder damage, while not the best, does its job showing you what you did to your boulder after smashing it into all those towers. The level design on the other hand, makes things seem legit, as Rome will somehow look as you'd imagine Rome in miniaturistic style where boulders are supposed to roll for some reason.\nRating: 7\n\nAudio\nThere is no voice acting, but the sound effects and grunts that the characters make sell the ironic theme of the game and make those short animations fun to watch. The soundtrack might not be the best, but it is certainly fixed to deliver the background ambient that fits the on-screen boulder-rolling in each of the stages, making those levels feel authentic to the period of time and the location where each of those characters belong in real history.\nRating: 8\n\nExtras\nThe story can easily be completed within 5 hours, but afterwards you've got plenty of mini-games, reasons to jump back into the action for the missing keys and the Time Trial mode which will keep you busy for a few more hours if you want to achieve the gold medal for each one of the maps. The multiplayer, even with its issues can be a fun experience, especially if you find someone to play with for a longer period of time so you won't have to go through the matchmaking system after each match. Apart from the Online Multiplayer, the game also features a Local Multiplayer component which allows you and a friend to play all the modes in split-screen, however on the PC version you will need 2 controllers in order to do that, something that most of the PC gamers don't have, and considering the fact that the game only uses the direction keys, the game could have been easily played on the same keyboard.\nRating: 7.5\n\nVerdict\nRock of Ages is fun and humours, so if you're looking for something different and with a healthy dose of parody humour, look no further, as this game will keep you busy for hours to come if you're digging its concept and you're willing to look past its flaws. There are limitations, without any doubt, and even with all the content package included in the game there was much more that could have been done, but for what it is, the game can easily keep you and a friend busy for an entire night, doing a bunch of different things and playing with the game's mechanics to try out new stuff.\nRating Overall: 7.6\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Rock of Ages at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=234","March 15, 2014","true","10.2"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

You play as Sisyphus, rolling boulders down various levels to break an enemy gate, while your opponents (a series of historical figures) are simultaneously trying to do the same to you. Rolling the stone is only half of the equation, though. In between rolls, you also have to set up defenses to hinder your opponent's progress towards your gate. It's an interesting mashup of genres. Aside from the gameplay, there is one other cool thing about the game - the cutscenes. Between levels, you are treated to very odd (but really funny) paper-cutout interludes starring the aforementioned historical figures. The scenes are reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's work from Monty Python, and are very enjoyable. All in all, this is a pretty fun game that works best in small doses (it tends to get a bit repetitive if playing for extended durations). The music is great too! I definitely say give it a shot if you're up for something different.","March 4, 2012","true","8.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Your workers make a new boulder every now and then and it takes a while to smash the enemy castle. The gameplay is somewhat balanced, although cow defences are sadly underpowered.\n\nThe game itself is worth buying for the sole reason of how climatic it is.

The game is a sort of duel between you and an opponent (either human or AI-controlled) in which you each throw boulders down a track toward your doors. Between rolls, money you earned from rolling your boulder can be spent on tower-like constructions to slow down, weaken and hopefully destroy your opponents boulder.\n\nThe game features a huge amount of very fun maps, to the point of which it could've been a full game without the tower defense aspect. The humor is, as said by others, Monty Python-esque, with 2D paper-like animations for characters. The campaign takes you through much of history, with plenty of genuinely funny cutscenes!\n\nThis is honestly a game I cannot recommend highly enough.

Just think about this :\nIt's a mix of action platformer and tower defense, which is quite a start\nThe most famous pieces of art in history are used as assets\nCutscenes are Monthy Python-esque movies parodying hisctorical figures\nYou can crush Leonardo da Vinci as Napoleon. And that's just an example\nMichelangelo's David statue is a boss, and it scratches its butt when boredThis is just a few examples of the crazy things that can happen in this game. And it's not just about the humor : the gameplay is also interesting.\n\nTo summarize it, it is a duel between two players (using crazy historical figures avatars) who both are on one side of a symmetrical map. The game alternates between a phase where you buy traps to set on your opponent's side, and a phase where you try to roll your boulder down your side of the map.\nYour opponent obviously has set up traps on your side (as you did on his), and you have to try taking as little damage as possible from them in order to damage the door at the bottom and eventually break it.\nAll of this in real time so you have to be quick as well.\n\nIt's a bit of a shame that the AI is fairly easy to exploit (a wall with catapults behind will usually wreck it). The AI also isn't the best at laying down the best trap combinations on your side of the map. Because of this the campaign will not resist you for long if you are a veteran gamer. Casuals should like this relaxed experience, though.\n\nIf you can find a friend to play with online then the true potential of the game mechanics shines through.\n\nThe game isn't very expensive anyway, so I still recommend it if you don't have a human opponent : the few hours it'll take you to see all the jokes and complete all the solo games modes are well worth it already.","September 24, 2015","true","33.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In this terry gilliam inspired world you are sisyphus the once banished king of ephyra who was doomed to all eternity to push a boulder hill only to do that exact same thing for the rest of eternity. But one day ol'sisy got the idea to instead use that boulder to escape his prison and from there go on journey through history to challenge famous figures in history against there giant boulders. People such as Vlad the impaler, Napoleon, and... a goat, okay sure why not.\n\nThe whole game is about getting your boulder down the hill to smash against the enemy gate to literally crush the opposition into a fine pancake and move onto your next challenge. The courses are usually filled with normal obstacles like houses and people, traversing the enviroment for the fastest speed is the name of the game. But when you face off against your opponent they will set up more dangerous obstacles, such as defense towers, catapults, and elephants. All that will chip away at the layers of your rock decreasing its impact and sending it back to the top of the hill for a second go.\n\nBut while your jumping and cereaning, the enemy will use there own boulder against your fort. You learn by your enemy that you have to create obstacles to stop the enemy boulder. The key being to find spechific spot that will slow down the deadly or just halt it all together. Its an interesing air of stragety and travesel that isn't seen very often in tower defense games.\n\nThe boulder fantastically designed, its starts off slowly and requires a lot momentum to leave an impact in the enemy door. Those few seconds of falling off a cliff or being stunted by an elephant will cost you time and force to win the match. There are also varietes of the boulder, such as the spike boulder and the fire boulder, that will give you some extra fire power on getting past enemies. And getting past enemies is not that hard as the enemy boulder doesn't seem to know how to properly get around obstacles but a well time jump will get you over nearly anything.\n\nThere are also boss battle in this strangely enough. Where you have to just aim for the right spot and ram into the bosses weak point to win. There pretty interesting from a design aspect but the gameplay around them amount to little then waiting for the right moment to strike, not really implementing much in way of stragety.\n\nRock of ages is fascinating look into a tower defense game. It has funny visuals, responsive controls, and never really gets to hard in the way of gameplay. It may not be the longest game but if you have a passing interest in running over queen elizabeth, well this is the game for you... ya weirdo.","November 26, 2013","true","2.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This game honestly stands out from most of my library just in the way of it spewing out the best form of crude humor, where fart jokes actually are well done, quite a rare find in anything, especially with how they seem to be thrown around now-a-days because of a target audience they seem to want to attract but it's not pulled off in any form of decent or amusing way, it's just there for the sake of being there. Now that being said on with my ramblings.\n\nIt steps out of the normal kind of game and steps into a comic like take on historic figures such as Plato and Aristotle, Napoleon, Leonardo Da Vinci etc, made into a tower defense video game, developed by the ACE Team. You are Sisyphus, a deceased character that was doomed to eternally rolling a cursed boulder up a hill only to have it roll back down before it can reach the top (Yes, I brushed up on my history for this), you suddenly get the bright idea to break out of your hell to then be the one rolling boulders over historical figures and amusingly squish them before they can squish you.. Which I must add, is more than satisfying. Especially with the little girly squeal.\n\nThe multiplayer is also an amusing little add with being able to squish friends or just random people in other lobbies. It's not only amusing but quite challenging due of different play styles which also goes through in story mode as each historical figure has different tactics and items they use more of. Time trials are a good way to get familiar with maps to get the fastest time around each track finally we come to skeeball, just when you thought this game couldn't get any better, they add in carnival games to the mix. What more needs to be said.\n\nRock of Ages is definitely one of the most unusual games I have played but one of the best. Sadly a bit short and lacking in the levels department in my opinion as I could have gone on for at least another 10 or so levels, but with solely that whinge aside, it is a perfect balance of amusing and challenging but not punishing and tedious.. I have not come across a game like that for quite some time. Honestly, this game is glorious and I would recommend it to anyone.","January 12, 2015","true","21.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The absurd cutscenes and the enjoyment of not knowing what to expect next are the main selling points, but the gameplay in itself is pretty fun too. It's simple, casual and fun for a couple of nights. It's not rocket science and there's not much room for finesse. Mostly you just roll away and hope for the best, but you can also set traps for your opponent. There's also a player vs. player mode.\n\nI think the game's definitely worth a couple of dollars, but don't spend your life savings on it - if the humor doesn't appeal to you at all, the game mechanics alone probably aren't that satisfying.\n\nI personally loved the paper cutout art style and all the funny little details. I didn't find the gameplay super addictive, but I wanted to complete one level after another just to see what crazy historical figure I was up against next, so in a way I was hooked right from the start.","November 9, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The premise of rolling a rock down (or up) a hill is simple, but the sometimes-challenging obstacles make it a fun game.  The cinematics and tone of the game are humorous and the levels are different enough to keep it interesting.  The difficulty is just the right blend of simple and challenging to keep it playable but not always a snore to beat.  I wasn't sure what to expect from the game, but I was pleasantly surprised.

With monty-python inspired comedy cutscenes and various cameos througout the game, it certainly rips a chuckle during the fun gameplay.\n\nSecond: the gameplay.\nIt's original genre cannot really be defined. It can gather people who love racing games and at the same time who hates it. Part of it is dedicated to the rock rolling towards the door, trying to avoid the obstacles placed by our nemesis. The other half involves you actually placing those obstacles against the rock of your own nemesis. Important of this kind of gameplay, as deducted, is guided by the multiplayer. And Atlus knew it well. In fact this is one of the few gems to support local split screen multiplayer on PC,\nNeedless to say i've had the most fun i've ever experienced when i brought a friend home to play.\n\nSoundtrack, graphics and the whole game itself is neatly served to be enjoyed with the rest of the game, only cons? It can get boring after some hours of gameplay, thankfully Atlus provided the game with 20 maps all very different one another.\n\n8.5/10","February 23","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your aim is to destroy your opponent's gate.\n\nAs you destroy your opponent's defenses, you accumulate money to spend on building upgrades. These upgrades can be either single-use power-ups for your boulder to make it stronger or more deadly. Or, you can spend the money on defenses like elephants, dynamite, and catapults that can knock your opponent's boulder off the map. You get to place these obstacles wherever you want on the map.\n\nSo, on one hand RoA is like a wacky driving game, but on the other it is like a tower defense game. The balance between these two is perfect -- it is fast-paced and really executes the central mechanics well.\n\nWhere the game really shines is the campaign and art direction inspired by Art History. Each level has you progress from ancient Greece, across Europe and through various artistic styles. In Italy, the levels have a High Renaissance art theme. There is Rococo in France and a Romantic (Goya-inspired) theme in Spain. And each level unlocks a new type of defense (dynamite, flying machines, ). for you to place in your. Perhaps the only issue is difficulty: it may be too easy as the AI is good at placing defenses but not so great at driving its boulder. But if you want more of a challenge there is always the multiplayer or the time trial mode (with scoreboards), so the game does not get old.\n\nBasically, if you like the look of the game from the trailers -- get it! It delivers.","July 7, 2014","true","84.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Somehow, it isn't here. They've done this weird vs. approach where you and an opponent throw boulders down the slope at each other's gates, first one smashed loses, and that's good enough for an arcade game. Along the way you smash dwellings, inhabitants, and similar bric-a-brac to get money, which buys you fortifications you can use to defend your gates against your opponent's rock.\n\nProblem is, the fortifications don't actually do much of anything to deter an incoming boulder—maybe they would if you had time to lay out defenses strategically, but because everything takes place in real time you're never given the chance to build your defenses with any kind of deliberation. So with the vast majority of the game's mechanics going un- or underused, it becomes a mad rush to launch your boulder first. Which quickly becomes less than interesting. It's entirely possible that the available defenses become more useful and engaging to play with in later levels, but the game doesn't hold my interest long enough to get at them.\n\nWhich is really too bad. The art and sound design are unreservedly fantastic, with this great whimsical Terry Gilliam Python-era animation thing happening.

I bought this from sales, about 2,00€ and it's just a robbery that you pay 2€ I could pay the 8€ easily, just so awesome. Good things about this game is Graphics, or what you can expect from this game. And the "copies" like THIS IS SPARTAA makes this game lots of funnier :) one minus about this games is that it could teach "How to make better defence." So I really liked this game and I hope you buy this game, and it's very fun game when you are bored. I rate this game 9 out of 10 and mark with "Definitely should buy" Thank you :)\n\nPS.

It is innovative, creative, very fun, addictive. Playability - and replayability - deserves an A++. It is something never seen before, at least not in recent times.\n\nThe music is fun, but after a while it gets annoying. Also the voices of the "little people" screaming when you run over them is a bit badly done. Those 2, however, are the only drawbacks I was able to find in Rock of Ages, and they are minor, they won't prevent one from having a terrific time playing Rock of Ages. I was very glad I got this game.\n\nThe graphics are very detailed. One can tell that attention was given to every detail in building the environment. That makes Rock of Ages a pleasure to play and, what is even better, makes it a game enjoyable by all ages.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","December 27, 2013","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a few little twist to make it interesting, such as an skeeball like target at the end of the course.\n\nThe second perspective is building the course.

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: Man, Atlus sure does publish a lot of weird games. This game is no exception to that. Rock of Ages is a game where you roll a boulder down a hill at a tower gate and try to break in; most commonly requiring three boulders; although requiring four if any one boulder gets particularly roughed up. This roughing up comes from the placement of towers in the pre-rolling phase that both you and your opponent go through. Yes, this is a tower defense game technically, but don't think you can win on strategy alone. It certainly helps; especially in a resistance-based setup involving the world's supply of Ballistae and stone towers, but there's more often than not a crafty way of bypassing these cheap setups with some crafty platforming.\n\nOne of the things that you'll learn while playing this game is that keyboard control is only half the story. Your main method of steering the ball is with the mouse, which feels quite natural and works well. The boulder, as one can imagine, has quite a bit of inertia to it, so you have to plan accordingly for harsh turns. You can see a mirror reflection of the stage on your side, but you cannot see the enemy's side apart from when you are rolling. While I would've liked an outline map of the other side, it's not too big of a deal. The stages themselves can either be as simple as a straight line or a simple one turn spiral down or as complex as a multi-leveled complex of paths. There are some shortcuts that you can take throughout the stages; some are easy to defend against, while some are more difficult, if not impossible. Nevertheless, you have access to the same shortcuts, so it remains fair.\n\nThis is one of the easier Atlus games that I've played, and the average player will find a reasonable difficulty curve to it. I have noticed a weird AI bug that came up a couple of times where the opponent got stuck in a reset loop, thus throwing the match. I'm not too sure on what causes that, as I have tried to replicate the bug, but to no avail. When the AI doesn't throw a match, however, you'll find that they are pretty decent at setting up their defenses and breaking through yours. There are boss fights in this game, but they're definitely not highlights. I've talked in the past about games that don't really need boss fights but still have them, and this is one of those games. They're not bad by any measure; they just feel out of place.\n\nOverall, I can recommend this game well enough on the gameplay alone for providing an interesting take on the tower defense genre as well as being a pretty fun strategy game. It'd definitely be even more fun with a friend. 8/10.\nP.S. cool kids use the Block of Ages\n\nStory: This game has roughly the storyline of a Terry Gilliam sketch, which is basically a sentient rock and his buddy travel through the years to become the best rock. Each stage has their own intro, which can be a groan-worthy reference to a meme, a very loose reference to an historical event, or just a general bout of silliness. Nevertheless, the ones that weren't solely based on predictable memes did get a laugh out of me. The cutscenes are worth a watch; that's for sure. 7/10.\n\nGraphics: The comedic nature of this game certainly does not stop with the writing. Remember the Terry Gilliam comparison? Pretty much all of the cutscenes in the game are done in Gilliam's style. The stages themselves have a very "painted" feel to them, and the skyboxes can be absolutely gorgeous with the lighting working with the paintings in the skybox perfectly. All of the characters are basically ripped from classical paintings, but it all feels consistent in the very weird (and very good) visual design of the game. Regarding the technical aspects of the game, it does run with minimal impact on my system at 1080p max settings at 60FPS. Shadows do that weird thing where it looks like blinds have been cast, which can be a bit distracting at times, but other than that, the game runs well enough. I'd imagine that a low end graphics card or maybe even one of the newer integrated graphics chips could run this game perfectly. 4/5.\n\nSound: I'm not an expert on classical music (nor do I claim to be), but I do recognize a couple of songs in this game, and that leads me to believe that the soundtrack is almost entirely non-original. That's not a bad thing, though; it fits very well and is often comically overdone for the scenario. The stage music does feel like something from the period that you're in, so that's something. There's no voiceacting, apart from some random mumbling and comically cliched screams. Again, the audio helps propel the very silly nature of this game. Even though it's not all original music, it fits well enough that I can still give the audio a 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are 8/7/4/4; cumulative score of 7.7/10. Definitely worth the buy and definitely worth playing with a friend. You're sure to have a good time.","June 16, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The AI for the first trips more than once, but it can be challenging nevertheless (more specifically, your enemy will be far less elastic than you in dodging obstacles and defenses, and later elephants will stagger his/her rock ad infinitum). Aside from the campaign, you have a challenge mode too\nI wasn't able to test the multiplayer mode, since there is no one on to have a match with, plain and simple\nI suggest you Rock of Ages if you are going to enjoy the artistic, pop-culture and history references, or you just enjoy a rather good indie game","May 30, 2013","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brillotron/recommended/22230/","brillotron","Satsuma Fernando","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brillotron/","347 products in account","This is quite an interesting strategy game, in which you repeatedly fling a big rock down a hill to smash in the gate of your opponents castle. In between each roll you then set up defences and obstacles along your hill in order to slow, or destroy, the other players boulder. There are a number of types of defence units to choose from, like walls, turrets, bombs and resource farms, that can all be used in various momentum-killing combinations. On top of this you also have to decide - do you buy the new expensive wall? Or do you eschew building defences and instead spend the money on setting your boulder ablaze? The upgrades provide a bit of risk/reward. So in Rock of Ages a match will stress your strategic-thinking, time management, platforming and the actual steering a heavy rock down a hill.\n\nThe game does have it's flaws, including some incredibly tedious boss battles, and none of the different systems run particularly deep. But as a whole, the game is made up of so many different game-mechanics cobbled together in such a fun way, that it is well worth having a try. I'd keep an eye out for it in the sales.","February 24","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: Man, Atlus sure does publish a lot of weird games. This game is no exception to that. Rock of Ages is a game where you roll a boulder down a hill at a tower gate and try to break in; most commonly requiring three boulders; although requiring four if any one boulder gets particularly roughed up. This roughing up comes from the placement of towers in the pre-rolling phase that both you and your opponent go through. Yes, this is a tower defense game technically, but don't think you can win on strategy alone. It certainly helps; especially in a resistance-based setup involving the world's supply of Ballistae and stone towers, but there's more often than not a crafty way of bypassing these cheap setups with some crafty platforming.\n\nOne of the things that you'll learn while playing this game is that keyboard control is only half the story. Your main method of steering the ball is with the mouse, which feels quite natural and works well. The boulder, as one can imagine, has quite a bit of inertia to it, so you have to plan accordingly for harsh turns. You can see a mirror reflection of the stage on your side, but you cannot see the enemy's side apart from when you are rolling. While I would've liked an outline map of the other side, it's not too big of a deal. The stages themselves can either be as simple as a straight line or a simple one turn spiral down or as complex as a multi-leveled complex of paths. There are some shortcuts that you can take throughout the stages; some are easy to defend against, while some are more difficult, if not impossible. Nevertheless, you have access to the same shortcuts, so it remains fair.\n\nThis is one of the easier Atlus games that I've played, and the average player will find a reasonable difficulty curve to it. I have noticed a weird AI bug that came up a couple of times where the opponent got stuck in a reset loop, thus throwing the match. I'm not too sure on what causes that, as I have tried to replicate the bug, but to no avail. When the AI doesn't throw a match, however, you'll find that they are pretty decent at setting up their defenses and breaking through yours. There are boss fights in this game, but they're definitely not highlights. I've talked in the past about games that don't really need boss fights but still have them, and this is one of those games. They're not bad by any measure; they just feel out of place.\n\nOverall, I can recommend this game well enough on the gameplay alone for providing an interesting take on the tower defense genre as well as being a pretty fun strategy game. It'd definitely be even more fun with a friend. 8/10.\nP.S. cool kids use the Block of Ages\n\nStory: This game has roughly the storyline of a Terry Gilliam sketch, which is basically a sentient rock and his buddy travel through the years to become the best rock. Each stage has their own intro, which can be a groan-worthy reference to a meme, a very loose reference to an historical event, or just a general bout of silliness. Nevertheless, the ones that weren't solely based on predictable memes did get a laugh out of me. The cutscenes are worth a watch; that's for sure. 7/10.\n\nGraphics: The comedic nature of this game certainly does not stop with the writing. Remember the Terry Gilliam comparison? Pretty much all of the cutscenes in the game are done in Gilliam's style. The stages themselves have a very "painted" feel to them, and the skyboxes can be absolutely gorgeous with the lighting working with the paintings in the skybox perfectly. All of the characters are basically ripped from classical paintings, but it all feels consistent in the very weird (and very good) visual design of the game. Regarding the technical aspects of the game, it does run with minimal impact on my system at 1080p max settings at 60FPS. Shadows do that weird thing where it looks like blinds have been cast, which can be a bit distracting at times, but other than that, the game runs well enough. I'd imagine that a low end graphics card or maybe even one of the newer integrated graphics chips could run this game perfectly. 4/5.\n\nSound: I'm not an expert on classical music (nor do I claim to be), but I do recognize a couple of songs in this game, and that leads me to believe that the soundtrack is almost entirely non-original. That's not a bad thing, though; it fits very well and is often comically overdone for the scenario. The stage music does feel like something from the period that you're in, so that's something. There's no voiceacting, apart from some random mumbling and comically cliched screams. Again, the audio helps propel the very silly nature of this game. Even though it's not all original music, it fits well enough that I can still give the audio a 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are 8/7/4/4; cumulative score of 7.7/10. Definitely worth the buy and definitely worth playing with a friend. You're sure to have a good time.","June 16, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You might have played reverse tower defense games like Anomaly: Warzone Earth.  But have you played one that has both?  That's what Rock of Ages is about.\n\nIn each level, you control a boulder and the objective is to knock down the enemy's gates by repeatedly running your rock into it.  The problem is that to get there, not only do you have to navigate your boulder through a winding course in a physics-based game, the enemy is continuously setting up devices to block your way such as catapults and elephants with stone towers on their backs.  If your rock is damaged enough, it loses mass and will do less damage to the gate and if it's damaged even more, it can eventually break apart.  Not only that, but you have your own gate and the enemy has his own boulder.  So now you have a tower defense game, reverse tower defense game, and a racing game all packaged up into one as you and your opponent are trying to outdo each other in defenses while trying to destroy each other's gates as fast as possible.\n\nThis was a surprisingly fun game with many unique levels and ideas that gets even better with the fact that it has not only online multiplayer but local as well.

Sure, you may have seen your fair share Japanese zombie dating sims, but that is case a of cultural difference. This game, is really, very, extremely weird.\n\nRock of Ages is a bizarre mix of platforming and tactics. You play as Sisyphus, a former king from Greek mythology who trapped in hell, where he is doomed to roll a boulder up a hill, only to see it roll down again time and time again. One day though, Sisyphus snaps and he is done with his torture. He takes his boulder and rolls it over Hades, promptly killing him and he immediately escapes Hell. So begins the destruction of the entire history of europe as you roll your boulder over famous names like Charlemange, Napoleon, Leonidas and even Gods and Angels.\n\nYou play the game like you play Monkey Ball. You roll a ball down the hill. You can control the ball, and you can make it jump. The goal is to smash the enemy's gate, while you try to stop the enemy from smashing your gate. You can do this by building obstacles in your opponents path. Obstacles like fortress towers, siege equipment, cow launchers, explosive barrels and elephant soldiers. All in all, the game itself is rather simple in its execution. It is the presentation that sells it.\n\nTalk about creative use of preexisting material. The entire artsyle is based on classical, antique, medieval, renaissance, and enlightenment paintings. The soundtrack is comprised of geniously remixed versions of classical pieces by Mozart, Beethoven and others. The sheer outlandishness of the style will take you by surprise and will keep you entertained throughout the entire length of the game. Which isn't all too long, unless you go full masochist and try to collect all hidden items. Or you can indulge in multiplayer duels. That's nice and all, but I think this game is so silly you should just try it for kicks.","April 4, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/22230/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","205 products in account","People told me this game was fun. And it was.\n\n"Rock of Ages" is a half-strategy, half-reflex and speed reliant destruction game, where you build defenses to protect your gate, while also trying to hit your opponent's gate with as much force with your boulder as you can. And it's really fun! The controls are smooth, the level layout accomodates the different strategy and action playstyles, and the enemy AI can be pretty relentless during some levels. It's a nice blend of challenge and fun.\n\nHowever, there are some problems. While I enjoyed the cutscenes, some of the jokes presented fell flat or got old very fast. Like the girly shrieks your enemy would cry before you'd flatten them. Or the pop-culture jokes that were shoved in here and there. The animation and style are great, but I didn't like the humor that much.\n\nOn top of that, while the graphics look fantastic in this game... the color pallette isn't the most spectacular. There's some good crimsons and golds and crimsons and greens for certain levels, but there are some that are really dirty, unpleasant pallettes like blue and gold that just aren't that colorful. But, again, that's my own taste.\n\nAnd finally, the game can be a little TOO easy sometimes. Some levels I got through in one try, because their structure didn't stump me, but f***ed the living daylights out of the enemy's AI. And the bosses, while creative, are all very simplistic and really REALLY easy. You literally cannot die when fighting a boss, and the structure is find the weak spot then hit it three times.\n\nDespite its flaws, I really enjoyed playing Rock of Ages, and earning what achievements I did. It's addicting fun you can get hooked on for a good weekend or so. And I'm giving Rock of Ages a 7/10.","April 6","true","5.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Rarely do game trailers accurately reflect the hilarity and fun factor of a game, so I did not expect anything like what the trailer shows. Boy, was I wrong about this one.\n\nThis game is simply incredible. Hilarious, one of the best soundtracks of any indie game I've ever played, and clearly inspired by the animations that are everpresent in Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes and beyond. At twice the price, this game would be a good buy, at the regular price, it's a downright bargain.\n\nI think that this game would be much more popular if there was some way for people to know what they're getting into. This is hilarity and fun at its finest. My only, very minor complaint is that the controls can be a little bit difficult. However, you're guiding a giant boulder, so I weigh in on that as being built in to make the game challenging.\n\nLess than an hour in and, already, it's one of my favorite indie games. This is really saying something, at least for me. 9.5/10 - I simply will not have a better time than I have in just a half hour of playing this game.

The gameplay is really interesting, switching between rolling a rock down a twisting path to reach the bottom and smash a door, while taking as little damage as possible, then setting up obstacles for your opponent's rock and trying to hit them with projectiles. The story levels take about 3 hours, and is mostly fun but have mediocre bosses, and you can also play online with other people - however I have not touched this so I do not know how it runs or how full/empty the server is.","October 18, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the oppenent is also trying to reach the player's gates, one must defend their pathway.\n\nThe boss battles were fun, yet the boss battles didn't seem to get more challenging as I reached near the end of the game. There was only 4 boss battles, making this game feel sort of shor in Single Player. I haven't even checked out the Multiplayer yet.\nOverall this game was a fun to play.","March 4, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yes, the game is about rolling a boulder down a hill to break down a gate, but what seperates this game from other (rolling the ball down the hill ?) games is the art direction, style, and humor which reminds me of the old Monty Python and the Flying Circus skits.\n\nI played the game when it first came out and haven't touched it much after, but then the game was very easy. This would be my only complaint. They could have patched the game to change some things to make building defenses actually useful, but I can't truthfully account for the developer's actions. At 10 dollars, you can't go wrong, in my opinion with this game.

First of all, the song's not in the game, so that's weird. Second, they appear to have taken the lesson of the four nonsense words that the song starts with ("gunter glieben glauben globen") to mean that the dialog in the game should be gibberish. Interesting choice. Finally, in place of power chords, a strong beat you can clap to, and exciting lyrics that seem to simultaneously entreat and inspire, this game includes a rock that smashes stuff. In sum, I'm incredibly confused, but that's okay because this game is amazing. I guess you could say it "rocks." Rock of Ages, still rolling, rock and rolling, gets 10 out of 11 rocks.","December 29, 2011","true","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Alas, I only had enough for two copies, and my bro got th'other one. Please, support the ingenious minds behind this (dare I say perfect?) diversion. While you're at it, pick up God Mode (same publisher) and Zeno Clash (2) too (same developer); the former is an arena-horde survival game based in Greek Mythology, the latter is (one of) the best first-person melee games ever made and is comparably goofy to Rock of Ages (because "WTF-esque" isn't a proper term) .\n\nIt is truly a shame that certain companies *ahem AHEEEEEMMMMUH* gouge gamers for little innovation; ATLUS has backed games/ACE has created games that I've enjoyed more, lately, than any others - to word it legibly, they're some of my (indeed, it seems) favorite games of all time.\nI cannot say enough good things about this game; that lack of words drove me to use, er, memes.\n\nTo be sure, I want to preserve this game for as long as I can; I'm certain my playtime will run something like *Do One Mission, Don't Play Again For Two Days* just to ensure I savor it for as long as possible. To know that this game has an ending... I die.\n\nNO EXAGGERATION OR IRONY OR SARCASM;\nI am GENUINELY impressed with this game (perhaps even more so at how much I've allowed the game  to  impress me, not even that big a fan of Monty Python (or comparable games (is Super Monkey Ball comparable? I don't know...)(nor am I fan of bowling or tower defense; this hybrid though))...).","December 20, 2014","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The idea is to roll your boulder to the enemy base and destroy the door before he breaks down yours. There's a little bit of strategy involved; the game lets you place things like buildings and cows on the map to stop or slow down the boulder (if you aren't careful your boulder will also stop dead in its tracks).\nIt's a very simple idea and it gets the job done. But I did expect a little more from the guys from Zeno Clash. It's not a bad game; it definitely has its moments (the graphics and sounds are great, for example), but not enough to keep me interested for hours.\n\n[Rating: 74/100]","November 6, 2011","true","5.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This in turn makes most of the tower defence aspects laughable.\n\nAfter you learn of this critical balance issue in multiplayer it becomes a mad dash race to the finish and the actual tactics of defence building serves no point.","January 24","false","2.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The reason is the game just doesn't change enough as you progress. The first few levels were OK but it was extremely repetitive and not in a good way. As the difficulty increased so did my frustration. The map changes each level an you have to spend a run or two to figure out the paths and shortcuts along the way. This means you generally lose the first three times you play it. Of course the AI knows exactly where all the shortcuts and cheats are so it blocks you from taking them, but as you are still learning the map you make a lot of mistakes.\nI played for nearly two hours and am done with it.","February 25","false","1.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Basically, if you play the first level of the game, you've played them all. People keep saying "Monty Python-esque" but I don't see it. I suppose if you think Monty Python's humor was solely based on using historical paintings to make ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes, then you would consider this game to be very Monty Python.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty basic: you control a boulder and you try to roll it towards the enemy's castle. Defenses are placed in your way to slow and destroy your boulder. The game is also a race, the enemy also is trying to destroy your castle's gates and you place defenses to slow the enemy boulder. Sounds fun, right? Defenses are pretty flimsy and easy to get around, so when facing the AI's boulder, all you really have to do is make a few choke points. So as a tower defense, its really ♥♥♥♥ing poorly designed.  There aren't any punishments for falling off the stage, so the player is prertty free to go as fast as possible, and take large leaps across the map, making any defenses placed by the AI completely useless. Controlling the boulder is pretty easy so there's no real challenge in making these leaps above defenses.\n\nThe game becomes super repetitve and there aren't any rewards for the player. Sure, you get to watch a silly cinematic, but on the whole, they're really ♥♥♥♥♥♥.","January 1, 2015","false","1.7"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","10","25","0","2"

Think of a tower defense where you can just go around the defense unharmed. That's Rock Of Ages. The multiplayer would be fun, but the problem is the lack of money, tiles for unit placement, and viable strats are very few and far between. The different rocks are worthless for the most part, and there is too many useless units you can place down on the ground.\n\nSingle player story is funny, but it's the same thing over and over. Boss fights are pretty lack luster as well. Sadly the only thing this game has in common with Zeno Clash is the music.

The gameplay is full of original concepts you will find quite literally nowhere else, and I admit, at first I was gripped.\n\nThe honeymoon period, however, wears off quickly, as the game begins to throw more and more unfair, unbalanced tripe unintuitive gameplay elements that weaken the core experience, and the single-player mode drags fairly quickly; there's only so much some quick satire of history can do for me.\n\nIf you can pick this up for a song, go for it, but don't expect it to entertain you long.

It's kinda fun, but unfortunately the game gets very old, very fast.\n\n5.8/10 - It's painfully repetitive.\nIts gameplay is (almost excruciatingly) simple. And by simple I mean repetetive. And by repetetive I mean painfully repetetive to the point that if you played one duel you have essentially finished the whole game's plot to entertain right then and there.\nAt least the actual core gameplay isn't half-bad if you're a person who sort of liked the Monkey Ball franchise or anything of that genre (which I sort of did as a kid) and it does have multiplayer. Even then it's not worth $9.99 in my opinion. Just get it on a sale.","September 2, 2013","false","1.0"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","8","25","0","0"

It's pretty thick, too. People everywhere make weird noises, debries flying around. Very good quality. The music tracks are great and some of them are well known orchestras.\nThe gameplay is funny and interesting. It requires quite a bit of skill to navigate the rock through the course, I've always been a fan of games such as Marble Madness.\nEach run turns out differently, depending on what defense objects have been placed.\n\nIn multiplayer a lot of skill is asked.

The boulders can be knocked off the map as well as destroyed causing you to have to remake the boulder and send it on it's merry way again.

This game is in fact so much fun!\n\nThe core of the game revolves around controlling the boulder around (or better to say down) the map and hitting the enemy gate at the end. Simple right? Actual strategic skill and planning take place very soon, when you are able to build defensive to stop the enemy boulder from hitting your gate (and so do the enemy). There are quite a lot of maps to play, each of them require a bit diffrent style of playing (some of them you need to rush, whereas some of them require careful planning, for example). Now imagine this packed into a satiric story with hillarious art style, animations and historical references and you get extremely enjoyable single player experience.\n\nNow consider everything already mentioned, add another game modes - skee boulder, where you collect points by hitting objects and try to finish faster then your opponent with scoring high multiplier on the target board, or obstacle course, in which you try to get to the end faster avoiding the defensives that AI builds - bring your friend - and prepare to be suprised how much enjoyment will the game give you.\n\nSure, (almost) nothing is perfect and you will experience some minor bugs (nothing gamechanging, really) or get stucked from to time on the loading screen. Game will get repetitive after some time. But that won´t stop you to come back to laugh over it with your friend or solo.\n\nWorth trying if you are interested in single player, a must-have if you have someone to play with.\n\n***** 8/10\n***** 80%","July 19, 2014","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The picture seemed too uhm... not special and attention catching.\nThen it came on sale one weekend while i was looking at my quence and it came up so I took a look at it.\n\nI fell in love with this game as soon as I saw the trailer!\nIt looked like it was pulled out of a Monty Phyton movie or the Flying circus series. Both the cut scenes and levels.\nSo I bought it and played as soon as it downloaded. Even at the full price it is worth every penny.\nHowever I feel the story is a little short. Might be that or I just love it too much and want more of it.\nBut I enjoyed this game alot and I loved the graphics and soundtrack. I loved my rock. Especially when I saw the option of choosing its face! So now my rock has the cutest little smiley face.\n\nAnd now the good and bad.\n\npossitive:\n* Easy to play even for n00bies.\n* Cute rocks\n* Great and funny levels as well as cutscenes.\n* Gandalf was run over by your rock in a cutscene.\n* 4th wall breaking by a certain someone.\n* Awesome and fun soundtack.\n* When you win you get the most satisfying splat noise ever as you run over your enemy.\n* There was paid alot of attention to detail. Even the ground has patterns and everything looks amazing.\n* The price is also very resonable for what you get.\n* Trollface stone, snowball stone, pumpkin and a block. How is that unenjoyable?\n* The "Nooooeh" scream the people make is halarious.\n* Actually there is historical value as well as jokes.\n* The entertainment i had and will still have with this game is amazing. I have laughed and smiled alot.\n\n\nNegative:\n* I would like more levels.\n* The last couple of levels in a row had the same music. It was good music but still...\n\n\nWho would love this game:\n* People who like Monty Phyton.\n* People who loves funny/weird games.\n* People who likes a somewhat comical wiev at history and historical persons.\n\nWho would hate this game:\n* Peoplw who don't find Monty Phyton funny at all.\n* People who don't do weird or funny.","January 18, 2015","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And oh Lord, is it a fun time~\n\nFor me to explain the story here would be a bit of an injustice (especially seeing as nearly every time I try to explain something awesome I accidentialy make it sound very, very stupid), but you play as Sisyphus. You know; he's the man in Hades doomed to push a rock up a hill for all eternity. But anyway, what follows his escape is a romp of insane, destuctive merriment that you should play for the humor alone.\n\nWhat's that? You don't like Monty Python-esque humor?\nTough ♥♥♥♥. Play it anyway, because the gameplay is a fun take on tower defense and is quite addictive. It's not FTL levels of addictive mind you, but hey, neither is heroin.\n"THAT WAS OFF -TOPIC!" said the people reading this "review."\n\nBut I digress. If you have some money to burn, some time to kill, and an odd desire to crush things with a large stone sphere, this is the game for you. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll pull your hair out when the enemy lines up row after row of exploding barrels to stop your boulder. All in all, I heartilly recommend this game.\n\n8/10","October 14, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Extremely silly, funny and enjoyable little indie game. It has a certain Monty Pythonesque humour and it does induce some strong desire to crush everything, that's basically all you ever need to know about this game.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty easy and simple, you control a massive boulder with WASD keys and jump over or towards things with Spacebar. Your objective is usually to destroy the enemy's gates and crush the git into a gooey mess. And in the meantime you can build some defenses to slow down enemy's boulder such as catapults, cows, elephants, towers and fans. You can also upgrade your boulder with the money you make from destroying things. There are of course bonus levels and boss fights too. It's all good fun. The game also supports multiplayer, haven't gotten into that so I can't say much.\n\nIf you want a small, cheap and fun game to waste some time and have a laugh, this would be definitely the best game to go for.","July 4, 2012","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved the hell out of Zeno Clash 1 and 2, and there was even a Rock of Ages minigame in ZC2. I figured I'd give this game a shot, and I was massively impressed by the quirky, humorous animations they chose to use for the cinematics. I found myself laughing out loud (when I was alone in the room, so you know it's sincere) during several of the animations. The gameplay is unique too. I haven't played any other "first person ball-rolling" games, but a Steam curator described it as "a mix of Super Monkey Ball, tower defense, and Monty Python" and I have yet to find a more succint way to sum it up. Definitely worth the purchase, as it is fun and will give you a good laugh as you roll through the ages as the rock-rolling hero Sisyphus.","October 31, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're playing, essentially, as one person building traps to place in the way of your opponent's boulder, then you roll your own boulder down their side until you smash against their gate, while trying not to get destroyed along the way. The story mode starts out pretty easy but turns surprisingly hard at one or two points once you start facing against ballistas and such. The war game mode is the meat of it, and it's a blast.\n\nI did have one or two complaints though. Firstly, the kind of humor in this game can be hit or miss, and for me it was a definite miss. Secondly, the boss segments in the story were by far the most boring parts of the entire game. It's not even clear at first what you're supposed to do, and when you do figure it out it's repetitive and dull, making you wish you could just get back to smashing open gates. Third, I kept running into a bug when resetting levels where the sky view on the war map would get stuck and refused to move until I realized it was detecting the W key as being constantly active; hitting the W key once fixed it, but it was still annoying.\n\nApart from that, I still haven't found anyone to play multiplayer with, at least through random matching. You'll need a friend or two with the game to make that aspect work.\n\nStill, those minor complaints aside, this is a really fun game. Not one you'll sink tons of hours into, but one you'll have plenty of fun with for a while, and can come back to once in a while to relax while smashing things up with your giant rock.","August 18, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a simple enough concept, and playing it is pretty straight-forward.\n\nAt the same time, the enemy has a boulder that is running through your course, and heading towards your gate. So you deploy obstacles in its path (towers, catapults, and others) to either slow down or destroy the enemy's boulder.\n\nGetting a solid hit on the enemy's gate is pretty satisfying, as keeping speed with all of the obstacles present can be a real challenge. The later levels will have you cursing. But you can do the same right back, and it is funny to see the enemy's  boulder get pushed over the side by fans or catapults.\n\nThe art style is cool too, sort of like Monty Python with all the animated art figures.","July 16, 2012","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is simple, has a great art style, and above all:  fun.\n\nThe tactical aspects of setting up your defenses in single-player to chip away at your opponent's boulder could use some refining.  It's mostly just cramming defensive structures into a few strategic points and hoping for the best.  If you can get your boulder down the range before your opponent, you've already got a big advantage.  However, rolling your own boulder towards the enemy and smashing anything in your way is great fun.\n\nThis game has a great art style that compliments the feel of the game well, taking elements from art from the various ages and working them into a funny parody that left me laughing at just about every cutscene.  It's very much like the Monty Python animations.\n\nThis game is definitely worth the money.","December 27, 2011","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You lay traps for your opponent as well as they do for you, making this an oddly fun game. There are only two downfalls to this game. One, the game is, for the most part, fairly easy. Sure, it doesn't take much for one to buy and play this game but there isn't much of a challenge for those looking for it, though there is multiplayer. Second, there are collectables in this game: Keys. These keys, early on, are easy to get and put in places which you must creatively think how to get. That being said, the later keys are unfair to get, especially the one on the last level before the final boss.

This game is in fact so much fun!\n\nThe core of the game revolves around controlling the boulder around (or better to say down) the map and hitting the enemy gate at the end. Simple right? Actual strategic skill and planning take place very soon, when you are able to build defensive to stop the enemy boulder from hitting your gate (and so do the enemy). There are quite a lot of maps to play, each of them require a bit diffrent style of playing (some of them you need to rush, whereas some of them require careful planning, for example). Now imagine this packed into a satiric story with hillarious art style, animations and historical references and you get extremely enjoyable single player experience.\n\nNow consider everything already mentioned, add another game modes - skee boulder, where you collect points by hitting objects and try to finish faster then your opponent with scoring high multiplier on the target board, or obstacle course, in which you try to get to the end faster avoiding the defensives that AI builds - bring your friend - and prepare to be suprised how much enjoyment will the game give you.\n\nSure, (almost) nothing is perfect and you will experience some minor bugs (nothing gamechanging, really) or get stucked from to time on the loading screen. Game will get repetitive after some time. But that won´t stop you to come back to laugh over it with your friend or solo.\n\nWorth trying if you are interested in single player, a must-have if you have someone to play with.\n\n***** 8/10\n***** 80%","July 19, 2014","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very fun on both singleplayer and multiplayer, however the AI can be a bit easy.\n\nThe main concept of the game is that there are 2 players, each with their own half of the map. While your boulder is being constructed you can spend money on different defenses to ensure that it is not easy for the other player to send their boulder down to your castle doors and destroy them and kill you, winning the game. When the boulder is constructed you can spend further money on different boulders which have their own unique abilities or use the most basic boulder for no cost. On your way down the map you can destroy enemy defenses and other obstacles to gain money but this will deplete your boulder's strength, making it less effective against the enemy gates.\n\n8/10","January 2, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game plays by giving offense and defense. The offense is rolling a ball, while the defense is setting up structures that will try and stop the opponent. The result is a fun game with a balance on tactics and skill. The game also sports a silly style as shown through the cutscenes. Each historical figure recieves a Pythonesque treatment with cutout graphics and crude animation and almost nonsensical situations. Art periods are spanned, from Greek to Rococo. The style of cutting out historical paintings and drawings is the basis of the game's graphics for 2d pieces, though in gameplay, well made 3d models are used that mimic the art period. Music is mostly famous clasical pieces and original tracks to compliment the historical theme of the game. In addition, extra modes such as Skeeball and Online multiplayer provide extra playability to the game's core. Rock of Ages is a game to enjoy!","March 2, 2012","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/willdotwhite/recommended/22230/","willdotwhite","The British Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/willdotwhite/","142 products in account","Sisyphus, an immortal Greek Titan, has a job to do. For the rest of eternity he must push a giant boulder up a hill in Hades until a magical enchantment causes it to roll back down to the bottom again. Understandably enough, Sisyphus eventually decides this un-life isn’t for him and swiftly breaks out of Hades, taking his giant boulder and some Titan buddies with him.\n\nRock of Ages is a hilariously chaotic mixture of Insane Obstacle Course and Tower Defence, alternating between guiding your boulder into the enemy gates to break them down, and building medieval weaponry to stop your rival boulder from breaking your own gates. It’s a genuine pleasure to watch your hastily erected dynamite finish just in time to blast your opponent completely off-course with white-knuckle timing.\n\nAs you progress through the campaign by massively interrupting famous European historical events, you unlock more Tower Defence items to stymie your opponents efforts and more rock types to destroy the enemy gates which does an excellent job of keeping the gameplay of Rock of Ages fresh and delightfully experimental; will only using War Mammoths stop your opponent wrecking your gates more than wall after wall of dynamite?\n\nRock of Ages also shines in the cutscenes between levels with both a unique art style and hugely funny direction. Famous characters and events are played out on screen in a 2D mumble-speech cinematic, with the famous opponents (normally accurate, although Plato and Aristotle probably never came back from the dead) highlighted in a massively dramatic way. It brilliantly furthers the light-hearted and joyfully silly theme.\n\nIt quickly becomes apparent when playing Rock of Ages that it is a game wholeheartedly about the joy of play. Each level is short enough that progress is never too far away and you will never guess what the game is going to throw at you next. With a depth of silliness that will bring a smile to any face Rock of Ages is a pure joy to play and happily provides many hours of shameless fun.","April 26, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your goal is to get your boulder to the enemies gate and crash it down. But before you control your boulder, you and your opponent are given time to set up defenses like catapults (which damage boulders) or Elephants (which can push your boulder off the map). When the set-up time expires, you can control your boulder and try to dodge your enemies defenses to get to their gate. The singleplayer campaign is split with about 90% of these "break the opponents gate" maps and about 10% boss battles, which really don't work as well. The game also has a 2 player VS mode, as well as a race mode where you try to get to a goal as fast as you can. The game also has a cool Monty Python animation style in its cutscenes, and it has some oddball visual humor as well. It works well in Single Player, and the AI is pretty fair, but if you want to get some more legs out of the game it's worth it to play the VS mode with a friend.","September 30, 2012","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is simple, has a great art style, and above all:  fun.\n\nThe tactical aspects of setting up your defenses in single-player to chip away at your opponent's boulder could use some refining.  It's mostly just cramming defensive structures into a few strategic points and hoping for the best.  If you can get your boulder down the range before your opponent, you've already got a big advantage.  However, rolling your own boulder towards the enemy and smashing anything in your way is great fun.\n\nThis game has a great art style that compliments the feel of the game well, taking elements from art from the various ages and working them into a funny parody that left me laughing at just about every cutscene.  It's very much like the Monty Python animations.\n\nThis game is definitely worth the money.","December 27, 2011","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I spent like 10 minutes in the lobby for War, trying to find someone to play against, and even playing against AI to wait, but still, nobody joined.

And sadly, that's about it, with one major exception, the Monty-Python-like cutscenes before and after each match. The rest is just varied levels without too much to break it up in between. It can be fun to come back to, but it's also rather difficult, so your mileage may very. Decent controls and setup though, however it needs more you can do to defend and attack, more depth in general. 6/10","April 9, 2013","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your goal is to get your boulder to the enemies gate and crash it down. But before you control your boulder, you and your opponent are given time to set up defenses like catapults (which damage boulders) or Elephants (which can push your boulder off the map). When the set-up time expires, you can control your boulder and try to dodge your enemies defenses to get to their gate. The singleplayer campaign is split with about 90% of these "break the opponents gate" maps and about 10% boss battles, which really don't work as well. The game also has a 2 player VS mode, as well as a race mode where you try to get to a goal as fast as you can. The game also has a cool Monty Python animation style in its cutscenes, and it has some oddball visual humor as well. It works well in Single Player, and the AI is pretty fair, but if you want to get some more legs out of the game it's worth it to play the VS mode with a friend.","September 30, 2012","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
