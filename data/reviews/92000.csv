Upon playing the game, I realized this is not much more than a repetitive tech demo for water physics. The gameplay is alright, but I found it to be quite boring. When I finally attained the ability to manipulate water, I found it to be lacking in functionality, and discovered that it is only useable on the final boss and in a few rooms before it.\n\nI also realized, that in order to attain 100% completion of the game, you need to be able to accomplish a difficult and unclear task on the first attempt. After failing the task once, it can not be attempted again. The only way to get 100% at that point, is to manually delete the save and to restart from the very beginning. This can be tedious to do as the task is found at the end of Act 1 or the beginning of Act 2, so you have to play for quite a while to get back, and you also have to reattain every medal that you might have had at that point, which in my case was all but two or three.\n\nThe game includes a feedback option that allows you to choose aspects of the game that you did or did not like. Upon researching the company that made the game, I found out that they went bankrupt and that the feedback is now meaningless.\n\nOverall I'd say that this game is extremely disappointingly repetitive and lacking in gameplay, but I suppose that it is worth its low price.","November 25, 2013","false","6.8"," 213 of 266 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","213","266","0","0"

However, the developer has gone back and addressed most of the complaints and the result is a fun, technically impressive game that is well worth the money when on-sale. The controls, gameplay, and graphics are all above-average for a budget game and you will see things being done with water physics that you won't see in other games of this type.

Yes, the water physics and look is gorgeous, but that is it. The rest is absolutely awfull. They should never have made it like this, why not just make a physics engine video and spare the money on making this atrocity.\n1. Cutscenes -> huge ton of them, first you have a cutscene, then walk 2 meters (no joke, 2 meters, or even less), another cutscene, another 2 meters, another cutscene, another 3 meters, yet another cutscene. This game is filled with useless cutscenes that could have been done differently. There are cutscenes hidden as a dialogue, as camera feeds, as danger, they are everywhere to the point where I spent 15 times grabbing and letting go of my mouse every minute.\n2. Voice acting is just bad, main protagonist is so irritating I wanted to kill her myself, and the male support role jokes in so many stupid ways that I would smack him through the radio. There is difference between being a smartass and being a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you make a completely stupid joke as you're about to die.\n3. Bugs, oh so many, game is brutally linear and nothing wrong with that, but even being linear and with everything shining at you at where you're supposed to go, I got myself stuck several times to the point I couldn't find a way further. Small room, nowhere to go, nothing to shoot/press/do.\n\n1 hour wasted, 0.49€ wasted.

Oh, all right; the game is actually about shooting people in first person view on a sinking ship, but that's really besides the point. Hydrophobia utilizes a proprietary engine (the "HydroEngine") that realistically renders the ebb and flow of liquids, and this feature is the game's main attraction. Watching the waves crash around is fascinating; it really is quite impressive technology.\n\nThe rest of the game is quite ordinary, however. The PC version is significantly improved over the original released on the XBox,  and features entirely new levels and a story that actually closes satisfactorily. But it is nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before and - once the thrill of watching the water move drains away - there's little reason to come back to the game.","November 25, 2013","true","6.1"," 71 of 90 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","71","90","0","0"

The water will flow from one room to the next, raise, lower, put out fires, and electricity will damage anything near it. Its a lot like being in a Zelda water dungeon.\n\nThis is a good game with gameplay mechanics that are on par with big budget games like Uncharted and Batman: Arkham Asylum. It has the ledge climbing, destructible environments, swimming, camera hacking, wall cover, sneaking and even a Navi, which is similar to Arkham Asylum's detective mode, which will let you find encryption codes on walls, open doors from a far, hack consoles with a mini game, access cameras.\n\nThere's a great balance between problem solving, shooting and exploration. There are only a few guns and really you won't need any other gun but the default phaser that you can hold the trigger to charge for bigger damage. There is a cover system, but I rarely used it. The downside for some purists would be the aim seems off since there's a 'target lock' system. What I mean is aim near something you can shoot and it lights red and will still count as a hit. Its not the best, but it stays in the realm of good. Even though the game encourages you to drown foes, electrocute them, blow up barrels and so on, it didn't really seem like I killed anyone in cool ways other than exploding barrels.\n\nThe controls feel good, aim, shoot, move, move camera, roll (although I never used it once), jump, sneak, weapon wheel, diving, emerging, sticking to cover and so on. The heroine's movement is just a little stiff, but that's one of the only downsides to this game.\n\nThe story is good for an indie action game, terrorists have taken over your cruise ship and you need to stop them. You've got a helpful voice that chimes in and tells you what to do, but it never feels like too much instruction. There are things left for yourself to figure out. There's even a nice waypoint to guide you in the general direction if you chose to use it to make the game easier for you to stay on task. It will always show you a dot on the screen where you need to go, but getting to that point is on you.\n\nThe game looks great, with really nice water effects and camera sprays. The voice acting sounds good and there are an over abundance of cut scenes at the start, but they ease up in frequency as the game goes on.\n\nI've got the game on PSN and PC. Graphics wise I'd say PC is better, but it seems to be a beast on my PC's processor and not the graphics card. It is a game best played with a controller. The downside with PC is the camera feels chaotic.\n\nThe game is short and sweet. The whole single player campaign is like 3 - 4 hours (I completed it for PSN) and at less than $5 I'm fine with that. There are challenge rooms to extend the game's length. It doesn't overstay its welcome and its a game that makes me want to play other things that the developers come up with, but alas they're defunct as of 2012.","August 7, 2013","true","6.3"," 46 of 58 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","46","58","0","0"

Still, all of these feel a little unpolished, awkward when playing, resulting in a mediocre game at best.\n\nLong version:Dark Energy Digital spent years with developing a game engine with fluid simulation, and Hydrophobia was supposed to showcase its capabilities. Sadly, the game tanked so hard that it drowned the company, but not before they salvaged some of it by releasing the Prophecy update that more or less ties up the loose ends of what was originally meant to be an entire trilogy.\n\nNot that there is too much story: set in the somewhat near future– where overpopulation has caused the rich to flee to a floating city, away from society’s increasing problems– we play as Kate, a system engineer who ends up in the middle of a terrorist attack. She spends about 3-4 hours trying to survive while getting off the most damaged parts of the ship, aided by the mandatory tech guy guiding her from afar.\n\nThe game mechanics are basic third-person action adventure: climb, jump, shoot the two available enemy types (normal and heavy trooper), and try to use the water to your advantage when it is not trying to kill you. It’s not really boring, but the level design does get repetitive.\nThe showcased water mechanics work well; at least up until you get the power to control it. (Despite what the store suggests, that happens only about 10 minutes before the end of the game.) This was intended to be used only in the upcoming games, and they didn’t really have much time to put into it, so it’s rather awkward to control and just looks ugly, in stark contrast to all other water mechanics.\n\nCould Hydrophobia be a better game? Probably, but we will never find that out. As it is now, it is still enjoyable, to a degree, but it will feel lacking in all areas, if you decide to try it.","December 31, 2015","true","7.3"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","36","47","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PROMISEDCAKE/recommended/92000/","PROMISEDCAKE","RetroGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PROMISEDCAKE/","155 products in account","Straight up, I don't recommend this as a game. This is one of the most average third person shooters I have ever played. It's not necessarily a bad game, but it's not worth playing if you aren't going to buy it for the water effects/physics. If you are okay with a tech demo, then consider getting it.\n\nHydrophobia: Prophecy was developed by an indie company, so straight away you know that it won't easily compete with the best TPS games out there.\n\nIf I had to compare the entire game to other games, I would say that they took the climbing mechanics from Tomb Raider/Uncharted and made the sinking ship level from "Tomb Raider: Underworld" into a game.\n\nThe game was made for almost no other reason than to show off the engine. It has dynamic water with physics that are incredible. You can shoot out windows to flood rooms even more and the water can either help you in combat or it will just make things more difficult. Unfortunately the game is short and doesn't really speed up. The game is apparently the first in a series, but when you are playing a 4 year old game, you know that there won't be a sequel any time soon.\n\nThe gameplay would be far too unacceptable if it weren't for the water mechanics. It's essentially a corridoor shooter with an upturned bucket of water over it. Most of the time you'll die because you didn't know what the game wanted you to do. The waypoints and tips from your work partner who is known as "Scoot" are overdone as they literally tell you how to get through each section of the game. The character development is so weak that it shouldn't have even existed.\n\nThe controls are okay most of the time, but the camera does not want to go under the water, so it really limits how far you can look up or down, which is really annoying when there are 3 metre waves flying everywhere.\n\nThe story is just a lame excuse for a giant city on a boat to start sinking. Basically a bunch of terrorists claim that in order to save the world, they need to kill everybody on board. The story is weak as anything I'm afraid.\n\nThe water is definitely the main focus of the game, as waves crash against you and send crates floating in all directions. I especially love it when you open a door and the water from the room you were in slowly seeps through. The water can appear almost gel-like at times, but since it was an innovation that literally tested the water (heheh), I can forgive it.\n\nThis game could have shown how water can really change up the gameplay of a game, but unfortunately, they didn't make the mechanics good enough for it. The potential was there, but the presentation was sub-par.\n\nUnfortunately, no other games used this engine and other engines are starting to produce better effects, which is making this game even more obsolete and mediocre. Some things just don't get better with age.","January 22, 2015","false","2.1"," 51 of 73 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","51","73","2","0"

Compared to other games published in 2011 that I've played, this is not supposed to happen.\nSomehow the game crashed, probably due to the processing of the graphics.\nControls:\nYou will always be sprinting, even at the beginning of the game where you're in your residence. Its annoying, really. You can always crouch to walk to avoid sprinting.\nWhen you use the flash light, there is light but your character is not holding any flash light. I'm assumming the light comes from her headband.\nI'm using a Logitech F310 gamepad with this game and overall, I think the controls are okay.\nMap:\nThe map interface design is very weird. Interesting, but weird.\nThe map control using the F310 gamepad is weird. Moving the map using the gamepad is very troublesome.\nI have not tried it with a mouse though\nCharacter Background Development:\nYou will know that the main character, Kate has a water-related phobia. (as the name of the game suggests)\nYou will wonder what the word Prophecy in the game title actually means.  No story was developed around the word Prophecy.\nWhen you dive, having less than 50% of oxygen left, you will hear things. (this annoys me a lot)\nThrough the end of the game, you will not know what happened to Scoot, Kate's partner who guided her throughout the game.\nYou will wonder what S.A.R.A. is and when were you introduced or atleast warned about it.\nYou will end up with a major cliffhanger playing this game.\nThis is a game I'd recommend to new game developers, to learn what not to do in designing the game, learn from the mistakes made making this game.","January 27","true","11.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

When it runs well it's a pretty fun 3PS, but there's weird bugs all the time, and you can just randomly die with very little warning (because of a fire thats under the water you can't see).\nI like the storyline, not to give away spoilers but it's kind of bioshockish, but I can't be bothered to read 400 journal entries, so I can't say for sure. What I get from cutscenes and character conversations is pretty interesting.\n\nThe controls are pretty terrible though (at least the underwater ones) when you're swimming and you press spacebar the camera will freak out like a cat in a tumble drier and spin uncontrollably while you push your head against whatevers above you. If there isn't anything above you, then you'll IMMEDIATELY surface. Press C to go down, which immediately pins you to the floor. Swimming is pretty rough, and this is compounded by the fact that the game celebrates its water physics. The cover based shooting isn't bad, cover to cover works, I don't get what sprint does, except that she leaps forward about 5 feet then resumes regular walking speed. Also the majority of my deaths were from her not quite making a jump correctly, or invisible fireballs in the water (or from trying to get a stupid diary near fire that pretty much insta kills you). Rarely did the AI have a hand in any of my injuries.\n\nThe enemy AI is dumb as a box of rocks, and will scan every square inch of where you aren't. They'll miss constantly, which isn't always a good thing as there always seems to be 400 exploding barrels and electrical boxes nearby. Though there's a point where you have to "stealth kill" using an exploding bullet (yes, I typed that correctly) but the stupid thing hits the corner of a pillar every time and never goes where you want it. In more open firefights its useful, but the thing is supposed to be stealthy.\n\nI like this game, I do, but the bugs kind of kill it, and honestly if this was from a bigger developer, or not under 50 cents I don't think I'd reccomend it. I might pay a few bucks for it, because it is pretty good, but its just kind of a let down for much more.\n","November 2, 2015","true","0.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","12","14","4","1"

The endboss is hell to deal with, but not too difficult once you figure it out (don't run out of barrels or you're screwed). The ending itself is... episodic. It wouldn't be a problem if a sequel was in the works, but this is highly unlikely so our best chances of satisfaction lie in getting a spiritual successor to a pretty great 10-hour game that has many surprising qualities that make it oh so worth playing. It even managed to take me back to my earlier days of gaming.\n\nThere may only be one general path to follow at all times with some side/backtracking included, but I never noticed because of how expansive the ship that 98% of the game takes place on felt. The in-game map is very useful, by the way.\n\nThere are tons (72?) of collectibles (objects, documents, Malthus documents) and medals.\nWait, stop running! What's that on the shelf? Go grab it. Awesome, document 24 out of 48 found.\n\nThere are multiple ways to take on enemies.\nCan you not, to save your own life, shoot a moving target? Aim for an explosive barrel (boom), electrical conduit (electrical boom), gas tank (flaming boom), or electrical wire (zzzap) that's conveniently hanging above a large puddle of water.\nTired of taking cover during shootouts? Flood the room by shooting holes in breakable walls and windows. Have fun aiming up, down, and all around as enemies shoot you from every direction while completely underwater.\n\nThe game's story and lore lies in the hidden messages left on the walls (think Bioshock) by the Malthusians--eco-friendly terrorists who love the environment more than your life (prepare to be disturbed). These messages can only be viewed using the MAVI scanner--a badass tablet that can hack cameras and consoles (fun, but tricky to get 100% perfection); download ciphers to unlock encrypted doors; reveal how much water will fill the room once a door is opened; and open the door 'cause ♥♥♥♥ that fire.\n\nThe in-game database is basically your bestiary or encyclopedia of Hydrophobia.\nFound a bottle of sleeping pills in your apartment? Read about it and learn more about this attractive female you're playing as. Or say "♥♥♥♥ it" and continue your shooting spree.\nScanned another hidden message left by the Malthusians? Read one of many interesting excerpts from "From the works of Thomas Malthus".\n\nHate universal ammo (think Deus Ex: Invisible War)? How about a reversal? Universal gun, baby! One gun; five ammo types (rapid-fire, gel, sonic, energy, explosive).\n\nThe following lag fix may or may not work with other games aswell. Use at your own risk.\nCtrl+Shift+Esc (Windows Task Manager > Processes) > Right-click Hydrophobia: Prophecy > Set Priority > Normal.","July 16, 2014","true","11.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

It has a quite simplistic gameplay, where nothing is original, but, on the top of all - it is so short, that it looks like demo-version, and not a complete game.\n\nI've already finished that game once (not on Steam), and I'll do it second time, but only because I've been a bad boy, and need to be punished.\n\nWhat exactly do I have against that game, you may ask me? Well, the same thing we all have against cheaters and other freaks in the multiplayer: they destroy our hopes to have a good time.\nNow goes the major spoiler: this game ending, when normal player is only warming up to some contest. Remember that we were promised by blurb? Control above the water! Just look at the title screen: there you are, a water-driving superwoman!\nIn the game, there are only three acts, and the first two of them can be counted as a prologue. You start normally, step by step you're getting the game's mechanics, climbing and diving through the first trials, saving some powerful ammo for the rest of the game. Then goes the first serious shootout, where you probably might use some of the powerful shots you've collected. Then you learning to control water... two more rooms, and then BLAM! - the boss fight! And that's all!\n\nThe Hydrophobia could have been a very good game... but it seems that over 95% of resources were spended strictly on the engine. We don't have enough game there, just a little prolonged presentation of that precious engine.\nIt usually can be finished in less than 5 hours... But there is a Major Bug with savegames (there are single checkpoint system). Every now and then when you're restarting Hydrophobia, it drops your savefiles to the pit of Oblivion. Sometimes they returning... after 4-5 reloading. Mostly - don't. There are other bugs, as well, but loosing the savegame looks like the game feature, which is more fluent than water itself!\n\nI hate that game for what she could be - a very nice looking, smart-enough sleep-taker. But in our reality she's just a soother. 5.5/10 mark. You'll be much better with the Bioshock and Tomb Raider titles. And if you're really want some challenge,,, find Heavy Metal FAKK 2 - that's a real deal!","September 15, 2015","false","5.4"," 50 of 87 people (57%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","57","50","87","14","9"

It's a platformer with mild shooting elements set on a floating city beseiged by Malthusian-inspired terrorists.\n\nThe game is surprisingly feature rich for a small title like this, and the water effects are particularly impressive. You can open doors to flood rooms or drain them, you can use water to knock down and stun enemies, and you can also use water to overcome environmental hazards like fires or stray electrical wires. There's also a novel hacking minigame.\n\nConsidering the length, I'd appraise the game at $5.00 to $7.50 at most, and anything equal to or beneath that price point is a steal.\n\nThere's a plot, but it's told mainly through picked up documents.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/recommended/92000/","yukichigai","Y|yukichigai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/","463 products in account","If I had to sum up Hydrophobia in three words it would be "two-thirds awesome".  What I mean by that is that the first two acts of the game are really quite good, mixing together something that is a blend of parkour, exploration, and wonderfully detailed water physics.  It's only in the third act that things go a bit pearshaped.\n\nFirst though, let's talk about the good.  The most obvious is, of course, the water physics.  Oh man does this game spend a lot of time on water physics.  It flows, moves, cascades, splashes, washes over things, shows visible eddies and flows, and pushes things around as it is manipulated.  Most importantly though, your character reacts to it believably.  At no time did I feel like I was witnessing some badly out of place animation or hacky changeover from walking to swimming physics.  That also helped with the game's immersion greatly, which is good because the world presented in Hydrophobia is fairly interesting.  Though it doesn't go into much detail about the history and backround of the world, the game's areas are rich with ambiance and little touches that make it feel well designed and deep.\n\nAnother tally in the good category are the game's "puzzles", such as they are.  While less a matter of clever puzzling and more a matter of "find the thing you need to shoot, push, or interact with", there's a lot of creativity involved in getting to those things sometimes. There's a clever little hacking minigame that comes up where you basically match a waveform, which is delightfully satisfying without being too easy.  More often than not it winds up being some mix of water trickery or environment climbing a la Prince of Persia, which brings me to my next good thing: your character's parkour moves.  Much like the interaction with water, at no point did I feel like I was watching some crap animations play out while my character progressed along the game's expected linear path.  Movement felt smooth, limber, agile.  The controls for all this climbing could have been explained better, but once I figured them out it was easy enough.  It's satisfying to watch too.\n\nOkay, so on to the other stuff: the bad stuff.  What's bad in this game?  The combat, mostly.  To be fair, in the first two acts it's not bad so much as just there, enemies serving more as other obstacles to get around.  The interior of the ship is littered with environmental hazards you can use to trip up enemies, which is amusing, and if you have to shoot it out with them the single gun you get is decent enough.  Where it becomes a problem though is the third act, because the third act is focused almost exclusively around combat rather than all the exploration and water puzzles you'd been getting good at.  If combat was a bit snappier and less, well, repetitive and tedious then it wouldn't be so bad.  As it is the transition makes you feel like you wandered into the wrong game by accident.\n\nWith that going badly for it, the third act makes things worse by committing a few of the big no-nos of game design.  Probably the worst example I can think of is spawning more enemies in areas you just cleared as you get closer to them.  One area in particular was utterly maddening, as I would clean out the area before proceeding across a rather narrow exterior walkway, only to come around and find a guy popping into existence just in time to shotgun me in the face.  I don't mean he came out of a nearby door (there weren't any) I mean he literally appeared in a formely empty space and started shooting me.  In previous acts the additions of new waves of enemies was justified by your actions activating alarms, with said enemies coming from nearby doors.  In the third act all pretense is dropped, and the game suffers greatly for it.\n\nI can't comment on the final boss, other than to say that unlike virtually everyone else I found it ridiculously easy (water powers, throw barrel, repeat).  I do think it was a bit out of place given the rest of the game at least.  The ending is a bit abrupt - you can tell they were trying to sell this as being episodic or needing a sequel - but it at least has some resolution to it.\n\nThe only other thing I can say gameplay wise is that the game's "water powers" are squandered in the most tragic of ways.  Though the controls are a little counterintuitive, the biggest problem is that you get them for an incredibly brief time.  While they aren't amazing, they are at least impressive, and yet I had maybe a half hour of gameplay to use them before I'd reached the end.\n\nWith all of that said, I still had fun playing Hydrophobia. The core of the gameplay is fun, the story is a bit simplistic but engaging all the same, and the characters are memorable and easily likeable/hateable as appropriate.  As I said, I love the ambiance of the game, and I would enjoy seeing more content set in the same world, be it a sequel or something else.  I think I got my money's worth out of the game, but I hope that if there is a sequel the developers keep the puzzle-exploration to combat ratio a bit more consistent throughout it.","July 26, 2014","true","14.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Villain defeated but the boat is still messed up with you in the thick of it, having just taken the antidote to remove your awesome powers (WHY???) .\n\nForget magically controlling liquids, you rarely get enough time with it to appreciate it to its fullest.\nHydrophobia is a water game.

And several mechanics enabled this: Ammo types, environment damage, puzzles that were simple but worked, good aiming and movement(minus platforming, see further on), an interesting setting and mystery. This game however suffers from a massive lack of full content leaving a primary ability you get later in the game the most short lived part of this game. It feels like this game stops at "End of Chapter 1" and never continues. Huge disappointment.\n\nThe other thing I had insane problems with were two platforming Assassin's Creed/Uncharted/Tomb Raider spots, that required you jump from one climbing spot across a gap behind the character. The camera and controls made this near impossible and incredibly frustrating. You have to hold ‘back’ on the controls to have the character face where you want to go, but once you press ‘jump’ your character finds you still holding the ‘back’ direction so she doesn’t leap far enough forward, meaning she falls, usually to her death forcing you to restart. Luckily, instantly dying was sometimes negated in the second instance of this by landing on a surface not far enough down to instantly kill the character, but you’d still have to climb all the way back up to try again… and fail.\n\nIf these guys ever expand this game into a full story, and get rid of or fix the stupid platforming crap then this game would be worth a full $60 bucks as a real AAA game. But for now, pick it up on sale and spend a few minutes playing and then never play it again.","September 15, 2014","false","3.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

That said, excellent visuals and comfortable controls are its best points, and its background story is better than most games.\n\n\ntldr: Overall I would take this game as an interactive story with puzzle elements than an action-oriented game, and for $0.49 it is worth it.","September 16, 2014","true","4.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It combines light platforming, combat and puzzle elements, none particularly amazing but which work when taken as a whole. The visuals and water physics are mind-blowing at times, and the story has some philosophically interesting (if not terribly original or in-depth) overtones. I believe it was ported from XBL, so a controller might come in handy.\n\nThe main drawbacks are 1) the very short length, and 2) the fact that some of the coolest stuff in the game is held out until the very end, such that you hardly get to use it. Combat isn't bad, but it's simplistic, revolving around different types of ammo fired from the same weapon. The developer having gone under means this one is probably a relic now. Still, it's a good budget title and well worth the few hours of gameplay it offers.","November 17, 2014","true","6.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But don't let any of that distract you from what is now, today, a polished product that is genuinely fun to play.\n\nIn short, Hydrophobia:  Prophecy is an action-adventure game with strong platforming elements, set on a huge ocean liner, or rather in the bowels of a huge ocean liner.  The gameplay is fairly standard.  You are able to shoot, with a variety of different projectiles at your disposal, but it's not a shooter by any stretch.\n\nThe level design is great, the controls work, defeating enemies and overcoming environmental challenges feel satisfying, and as mentioned above, the price is likely to be right regardless of where you choose to buy it.\n\nSCORES\n\nGraphics - 82 %\n\nWater effects are brilliant;  the main character has terrible hair though (plastic dreadlocks on what is otherwise a gorgeous model), which I found somewhat distracting throughout.\n\nSound - 70 %\n\nIt works;  nothing particularly noteworthy though.\n\nExecution - 75 %\n\nThe game, in this iteration, is a good execution of its core concept.\n\nThe storytelling via cinematics and viewscreens placed around the ship is effective.  You dislike the bad guys;  though sadly their politics are never as deeply explored as it could have been (likely owing to the trilogy being scrapped).\n\nThe free running-style gameplay and acrobatics work and never pose any problems, such as unexpected falls or missing jumps because of problematic surface detection.\n\nOne does feel that the setting (a huge ocean liner) could have been more interestingly presented, and it doesn't feel all that much like you're inside a huge ship on the ocean (regardless of copious amounts of water).  Again, it is likely that this concept was originally meant to be explored further.\n\nThe water manipulation powers from later in the game also feel a bit tacked on, as they obviously were, considering they weren't meant to be in the first episode at all.\n\nAddictiveness - 80 %\n\nI wanted to continue playing, and I did, and I pursued some achievements, and I enjoyed myself.  That sentence has about two "ands" too many, but hey, the game is a bit like that.  You never know if you're close to the end and you don't really care.  It's fun getting there, and that's mainly what matters (in my opinion).\n\nOverall - 75 %\n\nIt's cheap.  It's good.  Buy it if you're into third-person exploration games with some shooting and a lot of acrobatics.\n\nThe achievements all appear to work, which I know is important to some people.  There are collectables, again, if that is your sort of thing.  I just wanted a thrilling experience with an unsual setting, and I got what I wanted.\n\nI'm looking forward to doing another playthrough at some point.  And that's really the best recommendation there is.","February 10, 2013","true","8.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

OK, but they feel a little clunky.\nAnimations sometimes (not at all always) felt a bit stiff, most apparent during cutscenes.\nJournal entries (who seems to be quite alot about what the protagonist feels and wants) and speech isn't always reflecting each other that well.\nMap in the MAVI was not that easy to follow (not that you had to look at it since there wasn't many places to go except forward).\nSometimes while climbing, you get a fixed camera angle.\nYou can't always look in the direction you want, seems like the water and other objects can block the camera so you can't look up for example (unless ou use the MAVI)).\nSometimes the camera angle makes it so you can't see enemies while they can still shoot at you.\nIf you stand to close to the edge of ventilation shafts, you will start to drift/float out of the vent shaft and fall down.\nSo many collectibles it get's a bit tideous. Especially when some of them doesn't add anything ( IEY! I found a jar of pills that I can... uh, ok, just look at?).\nThe choises you make doesn't seem to have any impact on the story... but it gives you a 'Medal' (yet another collectible)!\nReplay value; I'd say not that great unless you're an achievement junkie.\nNot to spoil it too much, but I found it a bit sad that I didn't get to play around with the water abilities more.\nConnclusion:First off I have to say that I was impressed with the water.\nHow it moved and what you could do with it.\n\nAlso I really liked the MAVI for some reason. It however was a tiny hard navigated/find the correct button for at first (my fault for not looking up the controls in the options menu) and the map in it wasn't maybe that easy to follow.\nBut it was some fun elements used with it. Hacking security cameras, finding hidden messages etc.\n\nI would have wanted to have a longer campaign...\n...and also I might have quite a list of cons...\nStill however;\nI believe this is a very solid game and absolutley think I got my moneys worth out of it.\nMaybe because I played on Hard without the permanent objective marker. Plus I also at first tried to run around everywhere getting all objects and documents so it might have taken me a little longer that some.\n\nAnd I'd really like to see a sequel.\nMaybe with a little more polish to some of the cons above and I'd probably say it would be worth quite a bit more that what they charge for this baby.\n...but sadly seems like the studio has been shut down, but I still hope that someday this title will re-emerge to the surface for us all to enjoy.","July 19, 2015","true","7.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

Although it initially appears that you can at least get entertainment from how terrible the writing and acting are, the actual gameplay quickly ruins any good will you could poissbly have towards it. This is, hands down, the worst game I've ever finished and one of the worst games I've ever played. It's utterly beyond me how anyone could possibly give this mess a positive review.\n\nPros:\n- 3 hours long. The tortue is brief.\n- The shooting and Uncharted-like platforming controls are functional.\n- You have a magic tablet that always knows where you should go. It suffers from Borderlands 1-esque "walk through this mountain" directions, but generally cancels out the poor level design.\n\nCons:\n- Terrible voice acting. The main character in particular expresses almost no emotion.\n- Terrible story. It's your standard misguided future ecoterrorists ruining a supposed utopia. Characters appear and disappear, what should be major plot points are thrown out after two seconds of discussion, and the ending resolves absolutely nothing. A sequel was clearly planned, but never happened.\n- Uninteresting world. It's a boat, and almost all of it looks the same.\n- Constant spawn in. Enemies just appear wherever they want, particularly after you press switches. They do very little damage and die instantly to your basic, infinite rounds, which means the game is basically whack-a-mole.\n- Awful controls. You get the games big physics power in the last 20 minutes, and the buttons to switch to and from using it simply don't work. I had to mash the key for it up to 10 times in order to switch, which is a huge problem during a boss fight. Walking and swimming are also bad.\n- Poor level design. If not for the aforementioned magic tablet, this would have been a 20 hour game from me never knowing where to go.\n- Crap hacking minigame. Match the wave displayed on screen by waving your mouse around.\n- Terrible physics. Water does not work the way this game thinks it does, which is a big problem when the game is entirely based around its water physics. I had repeated issues with water flowing in to closed areas and magically not filling them or with the flow between two rooms somehow never levelling out. Once I had a roomfull of water simply disappear! The barrel physics and whatnot are pretty bad as well, which is surprising since this supposedly used Havoc. Might be collision issues with the environment.\n- Stability and performance. Steam vents do a number on the framerate. I had two crashes and once instance of a trigger not firing and having to restart.\n\nHydrophobia: Prophecy is a terrible game that isn't worth your time even if you get it for free. There's no enjoyment to be had after the first half hour. If you absolutely must play with water physics today, find a bathtub.","May 13","false","3.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

It's only an average third-person shooter, with an unfortunately short-lived exploration of a unique mechanic (water manipulation, towards the end of the game). Sell a few Steam cards, nab it during a sale, jump in with low expectations and enjoy a few hours of fairly impressive water simulation whilst shooting suicidal baddies (no really, that's their whole gig, convincing people to kill themselves, you'll see it all throughout the game, not advised if suicidal).\n\nThe good attempts:\nDynamic environmental element. Remember the old firefighting games? Replace fire with water then briefly give you control over it, that's Hydrophobia.\nCharming dialogue. While it doesn't do it very well, at least it tried something a little more lighthearted and fun compared to some other games.\nEmphasis on environmental awareness. Not in the save the world propaganda, but in keeping an eye out for electrical wires and the standard explosive tanks sitting about. It was nice that these options were available and encouraged through the unusual point system.\nScan/MAVI view. This was a neat little trick to hide stuff in the environment without it being terribly obvious, and could have been used better, but where it was used, it was alright. With a longer game and better level design, it might have been better.\nThe bad attempts:\nVoice acting. This wasn't the worst, but it was absolutely along mediocre lines. The main character, who with more development might have proved interesting, was especially average. Her partner in crime, Scoot, was somewhat better, but not by much.\nPlatforming. This is probably the most offensively poor part of the game, I think. When it works properly, it's passable, but when it fails due to needing to be very precise, it's just frustrating. Fortunately there were only maybe three spots that made this especially noticeable in the game, but that's three too many, in my book.\nGame length. I'm not sure how this game's development went, if it was extended over and over to get the water simulation down or what, but the end result was much too short and the most unique gameplay element introduced way too late. Even trying to find everything in the game in a single pass (which to be fair I didn't manage), I beat it in about 4 hours. For $5 that's not too bad, and on sale for $.50 that's especially okay, but you probably won't find yourself replaying it.","December 18, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was really shocked at the quality in this super-budget title!\n\nIn the game you play a female protagonist in her linear adventure in a floating city. She is led through the bowels of the city's utility systems by a male co-worker who speaks in her earpiece.  He is watching most everything you do via the many security cameras in the city.  The exchanges are quite humorous now and then (and one time VERY humorous!).  The city is under attack from a villianess-of-the-week and her many rent-a-thugs.\n\nThe game has controls similar to the Tomb Raider reboot although not quite as polished.  It also has Batman Arkham Assylum Detective vision for solving some simple puzzles.  The game also throws in some Half-Life 2 styled electricity and water puzzles.\n\nThe thing that impressed me the most in this game are the water physics.  If the developer is reading this, my hat is off to you my friend.  The water physics are -=AMAZING=-!  The best I have seen in ANY videogame!\n\nGun combat is not great but passable.  Fortunately this little missy is very tough and can take quite a few hits.  Combat in flooded rooms adds a new dimension as enemies are difficult to see on the other side of the water's surface.  I was frequently diving and surfacing to keep up with the enemies as they appeared above and below the water-line.\n\nI have not finished the game but I believe I am very close.  It is a short game, maybe 8 hours.  I read in the forums the final boss fight is a pain.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ -=Excellent=- value for your money.\n+ Novel gunplay situations in flooded areas.\n+ Varied gameplay from platforming to combat to environmental puzzles.\n+ THE FREAKING WATER PHYSICS!  Holy crap it is amazing!!\n+ Occasionally amusing banter between the main characters\n+ Documents and objects to collect along the way if you are into that.\n+ Graphics are quite good for a budget title.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Platforming is a little rough around the edges.  Character animations are a little stiff at times.\n- Environments can get a little samey as you make your way through the maintinence chambers under the city (where most of the game takes place).\n- While the main character looks nice, some of the other character models do not look so good.\n- Some of the environmental (Half Life 2 style) puzzles will test your patience.

Forums indicate that this is somewhat random and may be passable by messing with video settings.  The problem there is your card/driver/settings should never impact the mechanics of the game, and the issue is a jump that can't be made due to distance.  Very odd, and it was the nail in the coffin for this one.\nUp until that point I almost had to stop playing it several times because the number one way the game lives up to it's name is by making you sea sick.  The camera follow is abysmal, whipping around randomly as you go in and out of water, up and down from ladder to platform, and even just trying to swim around under water.  The violent thrashing of the camera, and some times inability to look past a very confined point when you need to look around is just terrible.\n\nHad those two issues been addressed in the years since release, it would at least be an enjoyable play with some engaging visuals.  It has a good balance of strategic shooter and light puzzle solver familiar to other games of the genre.\n\nPast that however, you note a couple other problems.  For one, it's very short.  Given what I read from those who were able to play the whole game, the killer point I mentioned is quite near the end.  That means the total play time is 4 hours or less.  Also, while they clearly had a great back story to the game world, very little of it is shared in the game.  This leads you to feel lost while things are being talked about in a very matter of fact way.  While not entirely unusual in similar games, the fact that bad guys just appear out of nowhere with no reason (didn't come in by door, just popped up) is off putting.  It's also quite obvious the bad guys must have gills, because unlike you they can stay under water indefinitely.  There is also the matter of the water control powers.  Apparently you get those right at the end, so I never got to experience them, but saving something like that for the last 20 minutes of the game?  Odd choice in my opinion.  In the end, other than the sea sickness there really is never a sense of fear of the water, which makes one wonder if there was an element the developers just failed to convey given the implied back story.\n\nAll told, if you take a sea sick pill and get the game on a super steam sale for $1, it will pass a couple hours, and how hard can you complain for $1?  Well, I guess about as hard as this review...","June 20, 2015","false","2.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I was wrong. Its pretty much just a shooter. That wouldn't be a bad thing if it were good at that. The mechanics of shooting just barely qualify as competent.

It has its ups and its downs and a full load of meh. So, let's break it down. Warning: Minor spoilers, but nothing that really gives away the story.\n\nPositives:\n- The water physics: they are definitely cool and a major positive. I wish more games would make such use of flowing water physics to affect the characters and environment. It is fun to use water flooding to disorient your enemies and sweep them off their feet, it's neat how the intensity, direction, and depth of the water flow affect your own movement and so on. In some cases, you can see flooded compartements behind glass barriers, and if you shoot out the glass, that water floods into an area to have several effects. Similarly, some destructable leaky bulkheads can be shot out for similar effects, in some areas even completely filling the corridors and compartments you are in, which can be a danger but finding an air-pocket is usually not too hard.\n- Use of the environment as weapons: not just the water, but leaky gas pipes, explosive panels and barrels, electrical panels and wires... all can be used strategically to trap and take out groups of bad guys.\n- The "Mavi" device: I found the way you can use it to scan and control somethings in the environment as well as see invisible messages and such pretty nifty. Not awesome, mind you, but cool enough.\n\nNegatives:\n- The voice acting: it's very weak, and I'll be surprised if you don't find the main character's voice to be whiny and annoying.\n- The keyboard and mouse controls: if you play this game, you'll definitely want to do it with a controller. Controlling with a keyboard and mouse is just really wonky. It's not perfect with a gamepad but it is much better and will save you a lot of frustration, especially later in the game when it comes to controlling water.\n- The final boss battle is pretty terrible and frustrating until you figure out what to do. It's darned near impossible with keyboard/mouse controls.\n\nThe meh:\n- The story is really weak. It wanted to be something good, but the writers didn't pull it off well.\n- The gameplay in general. It's not terrible but it isn't very good either. It tries to combine a lot of things: cover-based shooting, tomb-raider style climbing and platforming, and a bit of "magic" in the form of a nanobot infection giving you the ability to somewhat control the water. But it doesn't do any of these these things particularly well.\n- The challenge room is pretty dull (unlocked upon completing the game), and the gameplay is not good enough to make it much fun. Only worth playing if you must go for 100% achievements.\n\nThis game doesn't do a lot, so don't expect a lot. It wanted to be something amazing and utterly failed at that, but there is fun to be had.  I think you can easily get several hours of enjoyment out of it for $0.99 when it's on sale, but don't go in with high expectations and you won't find yourself being too disappointed. Again, playing it with a controller is pretty much a must.","September 29, 2014","true","16.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are very good, especially the water and the way it flows between rooms. The near-future sci-fi setting is above-average and shows quite a bit of promise.\n\nUnfortunately, the bad points significantly outweight the good for this game. The controls need quite a bit of work. For simply walking around they're fine, but the jumping controls are extremely spotty. I died far too many times because the character wouldn't jump or would jump the wrong direction. Also, the cover system doesn't work consistenly (won't always go into cover when you need it, randomly can't shoot around corners, sometimes randomly jumps out of cover) which makes some of the firefights later in the game quite frustrating.\n\nThe sci-fi setting, as interesting as it is, is woefully underutilized. The game supposedly takes place on a floating city, but you never actually see it (the quick glimpse out the window at the beginning notwithstanding). For all I know this could be in a secret underwater base or in tunnels deep below a conventional city.\n\nThe water powers are a cool concept, but the clunky controls combined with the fact that you don't actually get them until almost the end of the game and that there is only really one power was a big letdown since it was one of the selling points of the game for me.\n\nFinally, the biggest weakness of this game is just how short it is. I blew through it in 4 hours without a walkthrough and with dying a significant number of times due to the controls. There is no closure on the story (unless it's in a hidden video after the credits). Sure, you stop the bad guys, but what happens to the city?\n\nI feel like the concepts behind this game are solid, the setting and the basic gameplay ideas are spot on, but the poor execution and lack of content really hurts this game.\n\nUnfortunately this game is from 2011 and it's been a long time since the last update so I'm not confident that there will be any further improvements.

The flaws -- mostly m+kb control-related for me -- need no pointing out, and were apparently pretty glaring on first release, but it was expanded and improved, and I'll list the high points that really stand out for me:\n\n1) Story and plot development. The slow way the player is introduced to the world of HP is just fantastic. No big cinematic intro or information dump on who your character is or where you are, and it's only through small details like pictures or found documents that some background is unveiled. When the bombs start going off, you're just as clueless as your character, rushing around to put out the next fire or repair a sub-system. I'm really impressed with how well the plot unrolled, how involved I became with the character, and still think about the unanswered questions.\n\n2) Graphics and water effects. Great stuff. Much of the gameplay revolves around the excellent and ever-present water effects, and I became just as anxious as the character about drowning.\n\n3) The 'Mavi' device; what a nice in-game tool: A tablet-like device that your character holds up, and that displays an enhanced wireframe view of your surroundings, with objectives and points-of-interest highlighted. An intuitive and well-designed HUD element, that's only there when your character deploys it; every time I used it I congratulated the devs on thinking it up.\n\nWell, those are enough. For $2 & a short 7 hour campaign, there's more than enough reasons to give Hydrophobia Prophecy some attention. Runs fine under Win8.","December 24, 2013","true","7.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

See, it's one thing to advertise a game with having an ability, but it's another to save this until the last chunk of the game.\n\nThere are some well implemented ideas, unfortunately, none of which go well with what the intended vision might have been. Combat mechanics are awkward, some of the controls a tad unresponsive, and you're never completely clear on exactly how you're supposed to accomplish certain tasks. Oh, and you'll likely die a lot from trial and error trying to either figure out how to solve a puzzle, or drowning. Usually the latter.\n\nI like the cover mechanics, although it's probably best to stick with the Sonic Rounds, since not only are they the highest accuracy, but they also don't have ammo, and you charge them. And you can use them underwater. Of course, your enemies can use shotguns underwater... which is kind of cheap if you ask me.\n\nI wouldn't say this is a terrible game, as there are elements that do work... sort of, but I probably wouldn't recommend this, unless they decided they really, really wanted to try this.\n\n[SPOILERS]\n\nNow... if they had allowed you to use your "waterbending" powers a lot sooner, like say... I dunno, before the end of the first act, I think it could have easily been a much better game. Alas, that's not the case, and unfortunately, there's only a few short segments where you can try out your new powers, and it's incredibly short lived.\n\nPlus the ending is kind of like they were trying to close it as quickly as possible. It's awkward.","June 25, 2015","false","20.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's extremely atmospheric and it's got great visualizations (particularly the water effect- no kidding, right?) and sound. Here's the break down:\n\nTHE GOOD: Stuff I liked.\n\n1. The Water\nThe water is, as the name implies, the cornerstone of this game. It is the reason for the game's interesting atmosphere and environment based puzzles. The physics, graphics and visualizations (movement of waves, transition from surface to underwater, water on camera, etc) are superb. Best water effects I've seen in a game. Period.\n\n2. The Environment Interaction/ Movement\nI really enjoyed the layout of the levels and their design in general. There was a decent mix of swimming and climbing, giving each zone a level of depth that I don't often notice in other games (save for some of the ones I mentioned previously). Or maybe it's just because I was actually able to interact with it to such a high degree that made it interesting. This includes shooting out glass doors, blasting through bulkheads and raising the ambient water level. Very cool experience.\n\n3. NAVI Mechanic\nI really enjoyed the NAVI mechanic. The protagonist comes equipped with a transparent PDA gadget that acts as your GUI in the game, keeping all your notes, grants access to your in game menus, highlights secret messages in the game and enables you to do all your non-combat trickery (hacking, opening doors, etc).\n\n4. PRICE!!! $$$!!\nI think I bought the game on sale for $0.50? So in the end it was money well spent. ^_^\n\n\n\nThe BAD: Stuff that was 'Meh.'\n\n1, Clunky Movement\nSo, while you can do all this neat stuff like roll, climb, swim and cling to cover... the controls felt somewhat unresponsive. Often I'd lose the ability to shoot around cover and have to back off and re-cling to get it working again. Likewise, occasionally the game would ignore a command to dive, roll, or jump. The fact that it occurred sporadically made it that much more of an aggravation when these missed commands would pop up... particularly in a heated, combat situation!\n\n2. *Occasional* Camera Angles from Hell\nAgain, these didn't happen very often but when they did it was really difficult to get out of them. It most often happened while swimming and most usually in tight corridors. Of course, this is a typically problem of any game with a high degree of mobility in a given environment.\n\n3. Backtracking\nI don't mind a whole lot of backtracking personally. Given the NAVI's ability to help you perceive new things in the environment and the changing level of water, I'd rank this game about equal with such games as Legacy of Kain and Chrono Trigger. OF COURSE, there's backtracking... the designers want to show you how a place has changed. So I don't think it's a problem, but a lot of other reviews did.\n\n4. 'Easy' Combat...?\nI played the game on Normal mode and died a total of 2 (maybe 3?) times while in combat. The badguy AI is fairly responsive in my opinion: when you don't shoot at it, they sneak closer to you. When you do, they scramble for cover. They try to flank you, etc, etc. They don't do any of this quickly, but they do it. They also deal enough damage that you can't go barreling in guns blazing very often either.\n\nBut, if you're like me and you rock the sneaky/cautious/clever game style, you'll probably breeze through the game since there's ample opportunity for you to use environmental hazards to your advantage. This is NOT Call of Duty, Counterstrike, or anything resembling a "real" shooter. It just happens you can shoot things.\n\n5. Voice Acting\nI've seen a lot of bad reviews because of voice acting... but honestly, I've heard a LOT worse (none come to mind this instant, but we've all heard worse). Plus, there's not a whole lot of it. I actually think the worst voice acting comes mainly from the protagonist (which is unfortunate) because I thought the acting of the antagonist and your plucky tech support ally were decent enough (if not reading from a very unimaginative script).\n\n\n\n\nTHE UGLY: Stuff that's unforgivable (imho).\n\nIn order,\n\n\n1. Repetitive game play and goals.\nThe whole game is about finding keys to locked doors, almost without exception. This sucks. I'm just glad the environment was fun to navigate to make me forget that this was all I was doing. Blah.\n\n2. Very few upgrades/collectables/etc.\nYou pick up about 3 'new' abilities that you use sporadically throughout the game. There was also about 6 different types of ammo you could collect... but you really never needed it until the end of the game. This is one extremely crucial difference between this game and the likes Legacy of Kain and Prince of Persia (also games like Metroid, Castlevania and Megaman)… you never really feel like your power level advances.\n\nThere is one HUGE exception to this complaint however, which brings me to...\n\n\n3. INCREDIBLY SHORT GAME!\nThe final and coolest upgrade you get in the whole game is discovered and unlocked LITERALLY minutes before the game ends at the one and only boss fight. Not only is it a cruel move to throw a new game mechanic at you without giving you sufficient time to practice using it, but you also don’t get to enjoy it for more than a few minutes! Unforgivable! >_<\n\n\nOverall, if you can snag this game for less than the price of a bottle soda at the gas station AND have a few hours to kill, you may as well pry what fleeting joy you can from it’s very beautiful, if somewhat flawed and arthritic fingers.","November 16, 2014","true","5.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Another thing i liked about this game was the hacking system which is simple but effective. Needless to say, the water looked awesome and the physics to go along with it worked well. The game looked and played amazingly, and the voice acting was passable. The only issue I had was a bit of frame rate drop near the end of the game, which is understandable considering all the water physics.

So, going in with my expectations low I was surprised to find an OK game here.\n\nWhile HP has several flaws, none of them are game braking or frustrating, other than the occasional micro stutter which can be distracting. Being a huge Tomb Raider fan I see it's influence here and can only guess that the dev team wanted to make a TR game in water. While the TR-ish foundation is there, the puzzle solving, jumping and climbing, and combat, all of these are under utilized and so sporadic that most of the time you're just left to play in the water, which is the main focus of the game anyway. Although I have to admit, the effect is kind of cool...YAY!! *splash splash*\n\nOverall, the lite game play elements/mechanics are done just well enough without feeling like a chore and I did find the game enjoyable enough even with the barely there story and the meh voice acting. Surprisingly, it actually kept me entertained enough to finish the game in one sitting. If you're a TR fan or enjoy that type of gameplay, I would say give it a try at $1.24, you could do worse with your money.","January 3, 2013","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did not expect much, but at least the game met those expectations.\n\nIt is the start of a new century. The story follows a young women named Jane Wilson, a surprisingly fit lady who works for a nano-robotics company. It is revealed at the start of the game that she is hydrophobic, which is ironic, since this game involves lots and lots of swimming (more on that later). She needs to stop a terrorist organisation focused on destroying her workplace and everything it stands for. The gameplay brings nothing new to the table. It is a third-person shooter, with a single weapon but with multiple types ammunition. The most useful ammotype in the game (and arguebly the most powerful) is the sonic blasts. Unfortunatly this renders the other ammotypes nigh useless, creating a great imbalance in the gameplay. As I said previously, the game involves alot of swimming. While underwater, I often found myself fighting the unintuitive controls. There is a mechanic which restricts the amount of time the player can spend underwater, before returning to the surface for air. One can also get involved in bouts of underwater combat, which is less exciting than it sounds.\n\nSpeaking of combat, overall, it is definitely on the feeble side. The best way to clear out enemies, that I have found, (keeping in mind that I played it on hard) is to headshot them with sonic blasts from behind cover. This is not really a game where run and gun tactics are that effective. Taking cover is always your safest bet. In general the combat is not that difficult   and can be quite repetitive. The game uses an interesting way of pointing you towards objectives. The player uses a transparent tablet-like device and holds it infront of the screen. This presents a sort of augmented reality that indicates the location of objectives. This device is also used for hacking. Hacking is more rudimentary than it sounds and is just used to open doors and hack security camaras. Sometime the player needs to hack control panels. This involves a minigame, where the mouse is used to control the amplitude and the wavelength of a wave. The player needs to match these variables to those of a another wave. This is also very easy, but surprisingly fun (I am a bit of a geek :-) ).\n\nAnd then there are the powers. The pictures of this game leads one to believe that they are an integral part of gameplay. Unfortunately they are not. The powers are only introduced near the end of the game. Making the players experience with them far to short to justify their existence. Speaking of too-short, this game can be completed in six hours if you are playing on hard difficulty. And much quicker on the easier ones. This is much too short for my taste and makes me feel that the developers shouldn't have released this game in its current state.\n\nNow for the million dollar question (or whatever you pay for the game)\nIs it worth it?\nFor 5$, no.\nFor 1$, yes.\n\nI give it 5\10","July 19, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Personally I had a great time playing this game and it was alot more than I had expected for the price. The game mechanics and controls are great, in fact they're alot better than most games i've played. Shooting while hiding behind cover was well done, and I enjoyed the underwater gunfights. Another thing i liked about this game was the hacking system which is simple but effective. Needless to say, the water looked awesome and the physics to go along with it worked well. The game looked and played amazingly, and the voice acting was passable. The only issue I had was a bit of frame rate drop near the end of the game, which is understandable considering all the water physics. Overall I throughly enjoyed this title, and consider it one of the better game purchases i've made. I find myself wishing there were a sequel, as not many affordable games turn out as great as this one. Would definately recommend!","December 9, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hbarkas/recommended/92000/","hbarkas","h.barkas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hbarkas/","1855 products in account","It's an indie game and you can see it was created on a tight budget as the ending feels a bit rushed for my taste. Nevertheless is it a surprisingly good game with some interesting approaches to gameplay mechanics e.g. hacking terminals and of course the phantastic water. As you'll do a lot of platforming it is worth mentioning that the movement controls are solid. As Hydrophobia was first released on XBLA it supports Xbox controller although playing with keyboard and mouse is no problem at all. What you get on steam is a reworked version of the game with better graphics and one different character model with new voice acting - I like the original scottish accent better. Please compare Xbox vs Pc version on youtube. The game code feels not very optimized for Pc . I play titles like Metro Last Light or Crysis 3 with ease in max settings in 1920x1200 while my HD 7950 doesn't get noisy whereas Hydrophobia seems quite taxing in max settings. So if you own an older pc or a low spec laptop you may be forced to turn down the graphics settings.Checkpoints are well placed and fair meaning you don't have to replay lengthy sequences if you're dying. The only bug I noticed was a clipping error in chapter 2. You will get  as average gamer 6 hours of gameplay out of it.\nIf you're asking yourself if it is worth buying - definitely. If it's on sale you can get it for a few cents so why would you miss out on it? There are  choices far worse you could make. My conservative rating is a solid 7 out of 10.","April 5, 2015","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There will be no sequels.\n\nNot sure why people love to rip the game to shreds. The combat is tight, the story is pretty cool. The voice acting is somewhat dreadful and the game does end with you saying "WTF." It's a testament of Man; that development studio poured themselves into the game. Was not well-received. The company was dissolved (er, I think absorbed somwhere, actually). The game is released to Steam. People bash it because it's an unfinished game (in terms of story).\n\n</3","February 19, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The water looks stunning. The voice-acting is good, though the story could use a little more kick & depth to it.

The environment and art direction was exactly what I was hoping for. The futuristic cityscape and impressive water effects go together very well indeed! The controls were a little bit wonky during the final parts of the game, but it's still a very fun time. It's a short three-act story, which was supposed to be continued in future instalments. Unfortunately, this is looking unlikely at the moment. It's a bit of a shame, in my opinion; so many questions were set up for the potential sequels only to end on a cliffhanger. What a waste for the HydroEngine. The water was so very pretty.","June 23, 2013","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was well aware of this games reputation for not being all that great. Most of the conversation revolved around "pretty water", "short", and "boring gameplay". While I mostly agree, I have played worse (and uglier) games and for $ 0.49, it was an adequate game experience.\n\nLOOKS:\nThe game is fairly pretty graphically but the main character and most character models are trite and boring.Overall, I was surprised how nice the graphics were despite my (purposely) lowered expectations. Of course, the games claim to fame, the water, is fantastic. It rolls, splashes, pours through doors, and ripples quite realistically. It even reacts to explosions and your sonic gun.\n\nSOUND:\nI don't have too much for sound. It mostly adequate. Rushing water sounds nice, explosions are...explody, etc. However, the voice acting is awkward and annoying. This mainly applies to the protagonist and "Scooter" as the others were at least passible. The problem is compounded by the unnatural dialogue that just didn't flow naturally.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nIt's an OK game. Not really much  of a shooter as it's very light on enemies. It too linear to be a real adventure puzzle game. You never really have to think too much. The computer screen tools used in game is a nice addition to spice up the game some. I just wished they did more with it. The weapons are adequate but the intial weapon is all I ever needed.\n\nCONTROLS:\nSolid.

I felt that it was a good backdrop that was unfortunately underutilized. Furthermore, several story elements were hinted but not actually exploited fully. Pacing was awkward and there was no real character development to make you care about anyone dying (including your own character). All of that, along with the weird almost drowning as a child thing that never was explained, really amplify the "we intended to do so much more" vibe of the game.\n\nBUGS:\nI did notice a few odd graphical glitches. After dying once, the level seamed confused as to what state it should be in (i.e. pre- or post- explosion) so it compromised and gave me the pre-explosion level with the post-explosion decorations. Also, I think I failed to quit properly once and it erased my whole game. However, it was merely took 10-20 mins to get it back as I already knew the way and you can (blessedly) skip cutscenes.\n\nSUMMARY:\nNot great by any means. Play if you want a diversion.

It may say I have 11 minutes played, but I actually beat the game using offline mode and we all know how amazing steam's offline mode is. At any rate! Review is for the game and not this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRM the entirety of gaming is bound to now which is killing off a lot of what made gaming good.\n\nHydrophobia! It is an awful game... Just, its so bad. I might actually make a video review. The story is pedantric and juvenile, the mechanics are flimsy, swimming is terrible... Shooting is the worst part and it is virtually all you do, the climbing is so linear its not freeing at all and feels more bound than games without it. This is just the worst game I've played all year.\n\nPRO's:\n\nNeat water!\n\nCON's:\nGraphics: - Repeat assets looped over and over.\n- Saturated motion blurr nightmare on max. It... Actually is worse when you turn it off even.\n- Effects look like they came from the 2000's... Not in the good way either.\n\nAudio:      - Random cranekd the FRICK up noises blended with quiet inaudible sound ques you need to turn it up for                  leading to what I like to call bleeding ear syndrome.\n- The voice acting is just, the worst. The security friend guiding you sounds like he's from some 90's narrated arcade game, the woman they hired to voice act actually managed to portray the quality of cardboard in her voice acting... She literally sounds like a cardboard being, not a human being just... Cardboard. Awful this woman should never work in voice acting again, it was just horrific.\n\nGameplay:- Ho boy! Swimming screws up, jumping mechanics tell you to jump straight back when you get barely enough distance to make it a foot while doing this. Shooting is just... You get this one pistol where one mode is good, sonic, the first one which is a charge up mechanic. You get semi-automatic rounds which do less damage than mildly charged sonic rounds... Then you get these "silent kill remote explosive gel rounds" I ♥♥♥♥ you not they are how you stealth kill, with explosions, which have a drop off effect where instead of lobbing just fire STRAIGHT to the grounda t the end of their range.\n- Moving is like pulling fricken teeth in multiple instances. I mean gosh damn, climbing is so straight and singular it's like a GOP meeting up in here. You can barely deviate at all and are locked into one certain path. Often youa re asked to "Hold S and jump backwards!" Which is inadequate for ANY of the jumps it tells you to do on PC at least. Literally, it does not close the gap. I had to fight around the system and jump in different ways each time... If you picked up this crap, simply stand up on the beams and jump straight. There's a point near the end of the game where youa re forced into a long climb sequence in this plaza place where its not so simple... You have to actually come at it angularly as it will not allow you to directly jump and it INSISTS you get back down on the beam then jump backwards which fails each time. I dunno if this is a PC thing only but yeah. It happens.\n\nStory:          - The game doesn't end. It literally resolves nothing, you beat the last boss and... No explanation.\n- The only thing worse than the voice acting is the character's depth\n- The game LITERALLY does not end. You don't know what happens to anyone other than the last boss...\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME NO MATTER HOW CHEAP\n","December 17, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is what the game's antagonists (terrorists) are trying to get rid of by placing bombs at several places to have it completely destroyed by water.\n\nNow, here comes the interesting part: Kate, the girl you control, can manipulate water. While you have the usual cover-shoot-cover-style gameplay you also have the option to move water - this looks and feels amazing thanks to the technology incorporated in the game that makes sure handling water is as fluid and dynamic as possible.\n\nThe game can be difficult at times and being an indie game it does not have top-notch voice-acting. Also, being an indie game it is rather short - doing a complete walkthrough can be managed in 3 or 4 hours. Nevertheless, I recommend this game especially due to the regular discount it receives - another proof why we should look for some indie titles in between those AAA titles.","March 7, 2014","true","4.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

So, I wouldn't say this good, but this definitely is not bad.\nFirst, the story and setting is nice. The overall shooting gameplay as well. I just wanted to play with water more in story.\nSecond, games should not be judged by their length. This one is just ~3-4 hours long, but if it would be 8 hours long, we all could see that developers just wanted to put stuff in it, so their game is longer. I respect them for not doing it and revealing all their ideas without putting silly stuff in as well.\nSo buy while it's on 90% discount.

It's not very long, and it doesn't have a proper ending or wonderful plot, and it does have some fiddly bits.\n\nHowever, if you go into it expecting a tech demo, I think you'll be much more impressed.  The water effects are great and create a great atmosphere.  You also have an augmented reality tablet which allows some interesting mechanics.  Overall it's a fun world to dip into for a bit.  I wish the developers had had the opportunity to continue the story and polish out the rough spots.\n\nEven at full price I think Hydrophobia Prophecy is worth purchasing, though not by a wide margin.  However, it's frequently on sale very cheap ($0.49 at time of writing), which makes it easy to recommend if the water effects catch your eye.","March 5, 2014","true","6.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I also heard talk of there being a few problems with the elemental physics, like the random placement of electricity or the amount of fire in the water, but you have to ask yourself, why wouldn't a big ship-city be filled full of oil and napalm, and have exploding barrels in every room?\n\nI'd also like to thank the makers for giving me the opportunity to hate the characters of this game with such passion! from their horrible grinding voices and the way they move, right through to their terrible (or just never mentioned) back stories. The people who made this game must have worked so hard!\n\nI read a few bad reviews, but come on guys, I know there's been a lot of complaints about the special powers that you only get to fight the last boss with, which I know is one of the reasons you bought this game, but you did get 5 minutes to play with the powers in that moving blocks to make a bridge room on the way there, so don't be greedy!  and while we are talking about it, I thought the pushing 4 buttons at once system (using the controller), to use your water magic gave us excellent control, and the lack of a tutorial for how you use them just made the game delightfully challenging, like when I fell down that elevator shaft to my death 20 times in a row.\n\nWhen I first started playing and found that it was just another game based around a silly gimmick with boring linear fps and cliche wall climbing gameplay and rubbish graphics that was made to demonstrate their water physics engine to prospective buyers, I was disappointed, but by the end when I'd pulled out all my hair and was crying into my hands, I really began to appreciate this game.","April 9, 2014","true","7.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The water physics and effects are impressive, the graphics are pretty good, and the voice acting is decent.  I would stop short of calling it "Great".  Your inside a ship and environments all look the same for the most of the game.  The controls could be better.  Gunplay can be fun, but I wish they emphasized stealth aspects more than straight up battles.  The story is passable, but the ending leaves a lot to be desired.  You can play the whole thing in 3-4 hours, but this was designed as a downloadable game for consoles too, so there was no expectation this would be a full fledged AAA.  Besides, you can pick it up for only a few bucks.

First of all, it's the ONLY boss battle in the entire game.  Secondly, it's at least two to three times harder than any other part OF the game, and requires the mastery of a completely new skill you only gain ten minutes beforehand.  Thirdly, it appears to have no checkpoints throughout its excruciating length.  Fourthly, it's inconsistent as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and what worked the last time won't necessarily work the next (half the time I successfully threw explosives at the boss robot, the other half I merely succeeded in blowing MYSELF up).  All I can say is: THANK GOD FOR YOUTUBE.  Oh, and your reward for beating the boss?  One of the briefest and most abrupt (and I don't mean "John Carpenter's The Thing" kinda enigmatic; I really do just mean ABRUPT) end cut scenes ever.  Rarely before have I witnessed a final fifteen minutes of a game which seemed so...tacked on, and thoroughly unsatisfying.\n\n\nAnd maaaaan...I was really looking forward to defending this game against all the naysayers.  I'm still gonna thumb it up and give it a reasonable score, but ONLY because it was so enjoyable (borderline ENTHRALLING, even!) earlier on.  If you don't mind a 4 to 6 hour game with an ending you probably couldn't be ♥♥♥♥ed completing, feel free to pick it up on sale (i.e. for LESS than five dollars).  For those who require a bit more narrative closure, you may want to give this wishy-washy mess a bit of a miss.\n\n\nVerdict: 7/10.\n","January 6, 2015","true","6.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's really a marvel at its best considering that water is usually the most looked over element in a video game.

Once Kate gets hydrokenisis (not a spoiler since it's in the screenshots), you barely get any time to really get how it works before you're expected to use it for the boss battle. There are a whole lot of great things about this plot that aren't given a chance to be explained. Malthusians as the terrorists, with calvinist beliefs mixed in there (calling all non-malthusians 'reprobates' meaning doomed to die), an implied overpopulation, the idea Kate is living in a ship due to that... all great ideas, but never really explored to its true potential.\n\nI guess I wished for a first level like Half Life's, where the player wanders around Black Mesa and gets an idea of the place before everything gets crazy.\n\nThe plot summary suggests there will be character arcs, and there aren't. The only thing that changes is that Kate stops yelling whenever she has to go balance on poles. Kate's goal changes inexcplicably part-way through (I suppose her boss being killed might have something to do with it, though he was a jerk to her anyway) from ignoring curing herself and finding her friend to chasing down the bad guy.\n\nAnd it just kinda... ends.\n\nThis is one of those games where the controls sometimes flat out ignore what you tell it to. Which is especially frustrating considering how unforgiving it is. (There is no saving, just checkpoints.) On that note, this was another game where the hints couldn't be turned off, and they were always brought attention to by an annoying sound.\n\nI'm normally not bothered by voice actors, but Kate's voice actor was incredibly distracting.\n\nThe fact is, this game does a lot of things right, which makes the things it does wrong even more frustrating.

Essentially a D-rate Tomb Raider clone, the gimmick here is water and how water influences the game's environments, puzzles, combat, and physics. Unfortunately, the water is overhyped and not enough to make a sub-par gaming experience worthy of your time. While the developers deserve credit for listening to player feedback and releasing two updated versions of the game after launch, the game is currently still plagued with bad design and technical issues like poor collision detection, missing textures, dumb AI, and game-breaking bugs (for some).\n\nGameplay and level design are outright bland. The single enemy type in the game (save for the "final boss") can be easily dispatched with by using your default weapon. There are electricity and fire hazards that can be used to inflict environmental damage upon your foes, but the same tactics are used in every skirmish. The touted ability to control water doesn't even occur until right before the final boss, and at that point it really only seems to be there for that battle. What initially seem like clever and unique puzzles end up being recycled many, many times over the course of the game. With regards to level design, for a ship that is purported to be as large as a city, there are not many places the player gets to see that seem to have had much movement or life in them. The few room variations seen are mostly non-specific server-type rooms and innumerable hallways for the sake of filler. WIthout an in-game guide telling you where to go, it would be very easy to lose yourself amidst the incredibly similar rooms.\n\nControls can be broken into three areas: water, surface, and climbing. Within the water, controls are jittery; hindered by a camera that is cumbersome and erratic, particularly near the water's surface. For a game with such a keen focus on water, having sloppy water controls is unforgivable. On the surface is where much of the combat is found, it is uninspired. Surface controls are heavy and tank-like, and it can be difficult to get out of the way of enemy fire once it starts. When climbing, objects that can be mounted or climbed on are almost always bright red, eliminating much of any thought while moving vertically in the environment.\n\nWith regards to the writing, the main character and her unseen ally are unlikable. What I imagine the developers were going for was a protagonist/radio ally kinship like Lara/Zip/Alister had in Tomb Raider: Legend. However, between the writing and voice acting, hearing what any character has to say quickly becomes irritating. The game's overall plot manages to be confusing in its brief 3 hours. While it is clear that the ship you are on has been invaded by terrorists and you are trying to make it through said ship, anything beyond that is lost due to poor storytelling.\n\nWhile this game could have brought some interesting concepts to the action-adventure genre, the ideas that were to set it apart were poorly or badly executed, making this forgettable game one to pass on.","March 19, 2014","false","3.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

The controls are pretty intuitive and it does a good job of easing you in without requiring much of a breach in immersion to explain what you need to do as it has several unique mechanics like hacking by matching wave amplitudes or using sonic bullets to break glass walls. Easily a recommend for fans of third-person action/adventure. It is a short game, split into 3 Acts of about 1 hour each, so be aware of that in your consideration.","March 9, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Some neat enough concepts (or takes on established concepts) in there with the MAVI and the "Tower water power".  I really enjoyed the absence of vile language and the non-sexualisation of the main character Kate, both dialogue-wise, and in her appearance.  There was no derogatory talk about women.  And it didn't bother me at all that there were no "civilians" visible in the game.  They weren't necessary.  Water effects were a bit strange, but were a fair attempt at reflecting fluid dynamics for that kind of enclosed environment.  Sufficient ammo, and a single weapon (disregarding the water power) ... and that was a pleasant change.  A nice and simple ammo-chooser interface.  Potential to use the environment against your enemies ... (classic exploding barrels everywhere!).  And there was a delightful absence of bloodiness ... with the exception of underwater shooting.  Boss level wasn't too hard.  I didn't find the story immersive, but I wasn't after that kind of experience anyway.  I just wanted a bit of a change from CoD and Skyrim ... and this was an enjoyable single evening's entertainment! ... especially in view of the current $5 price-tag.  Does the "Prophecy" part of the name point to a sequel?  I'd consider getting it if there was.  8)  Thanks, developers, for the effort you put into this game.  :D\n\nRead some other reviews now.  I didn't know this was an indie game!  Even more kudos to the crew!!!  8)","April 4, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's basically a first-person platformer/shooter with water - lots and lots of water. It's also very short (a few hours), so keep that in mind as well. It has a lot going for it and is definitely a cool game and concept, but the mechanics and gameplay didn't quite meet my expectations. The controls, in particular, I felt were needlessly complicated. The game also didn't run all that well on my PC, despite other more recent games running just fine. Also frustrating was the final boss fight, which was way more difficult than it should have been due to the aforementioned control problems. I also experienced game-halting bugs at more than one point in my playthrough, which could only be resolved by restarting from a checkpoint (which thankfully, are placed liberally). In summary, the overall setting and concept is cool, but it is hampered by spotty controls and a few too many bugs and glitches for my taste. Worth checking out for cheap price.","October 2, 2011","true","4.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

She has a tomboy look going on from a design aspect but that doesn't help in her case because our protagonist is annoying and generic in this game due to poor writing. Her voice actor is terrible as well. Even worse than the voice acting for females in Guild Wars 2.\n\nSo yeah, the world the game is set in looks nice and is well presented, the female protagnist though is generic and just not interesting.\n\nConcept:\nVery unique concept this game has, I like it. Water is the main elemental focus here, not many games do with the developers had in mind with this game.\n\nHowever, they obviously did something very wrong since the company who made this game went bankrupt and the game engine they designed for it.\n\nThe gameplay is interesting at first, but ultimately it is just plain, bland, boring. The characters suck, Kate is a junk protagonist, her partner scoot or whatever his name is has halfway decent voice acting but he is boring as well. His animations are terrible as well.\n\nGameplay:\nInteresting at first, gets boring though. The main aspect of the game, "Water" is not used as much as it should have been, since the developers made a engine based around real physics water the water powers you gain don't show up until late in the game, very silly move on there part to feature the main reason to play the game later on. It should have been available at the start or near the start of the game, would have been more interesting.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game looks pretty on my fairly powerful rig, I was very impressed with the HydroEngine that the developers of this game made, they may have gone out of business but they deserve praise for there work on the engine at the very least, I like it.\n\nSound:\nNot great, below par to be fair. Just doesn't seem good, voice acting is very terrible, music is generic, sound effects does have its moments of being good but most of it is junk, the enemy gun sound effects are a joke, something outta' a cheesy laser tag game.\n\nStory:\nThe story is crap. Very basic but not in a good way, the female antagonist sucks, not interesting at all with her overplayed acting and predictable reasoning. Our heroine had potential to be pretty cool, but the voice acting, writing and animations are all pretty bad.\n\nEntertainment:\nThe game doesn't have very much entertainment for the $9.99 asking price, I paid only $3.99 for a retail discount and even that seems a lot to ask for, ya know for something that is basically a tech demo for a great innovative game engine. The main reason to play the game would be for the neat water physics, no game has water animations quite like this game, much potential could be had if a major developer like Capcom or Namco got a hold of this engine, but that isn't the case.\n\nReplay Value:\nThere is no value in replaying this tech demo, except of you want to experience really nice water physics.\n\nConclusion:\nThe HydroEngine has great potential, the developers should be proud they made a unique game engine with a strong focus on water, If the engine is up for sale, I hope the buyer is a well known or ambitious developer team because the potential to make a crazy hack n slash action game with rpg elements with a water wielding male protagonist seems like a great idea to me. I would love to work on such a project myself if I had enough money and talent to make such a thing happen, I think it would be a very unique concept for a market filled with so many generic first person shooting games.\n\nTHE GOOD\n*Ambitious tech demo showing of a unique game engine.\n*Great and Innovative game engine, the HydroEngine is a unique idea with a poor tech demo showing it off.\n*Pretty graphics from a former indie developer, on max settings the game looks good. The water is the star though.\n*Fun physics in general.\n\nTHE BAD\n*Main female protagonist is not likable, very boring, even if the character were male he would still be boring.\n*Bad voice acting from almost every character in the game.\n*Generic storyline.\n*Bad writing.\n*Combat is boring.\n*Platforming is boring.\n*Missions are boring.\n*Support characters are boring.\n*AI is extremely stupid.\n\nScore:\n\n4.4/10 ~ I do not recommend this game at the price point of $9.99, it is barely a game. If you can get it for under $5 I would still be very stand offish against it, but to experience the water in this tech demo might be worth it.","March 28, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For instance, when you open a door, water from one room will flow into the other and be cut off once the door is shut. Then a wave will bounce back-and-forth across the room until it settles. But other than that this game is bad.\n\nIt's a standard third-person cover shooter with awful aiming. Every now in then it adds in a hacking mini-game like from the Rocksteady Batman games, or a "platforming" element like Uncharted 2 & 3.\n\nThe game is riddled with sound bugs, where character dialogue overlaps each other, or characters voices don't come from the correct world locations.\n\nThe only unique thing about it comes in the last 10 minutes of the game when you get the ability to manipulate water. It's used for 1 puzzle and the final boss fight. That's it.\n\nIf you love fighting juggalo-looking enemies using terrible shooting mechanics, bland stories, buggy audio, and bad voice acting, then you should play this game.","April 12, 2014","false","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Your main weapon is a weird charging beam that one shot's all enemies when you charge it so I don't really know why there's actual ammo when you kill everything in one hit.  The game's main draw is water physics, which is underwhelming.  The water is still scripted to only fill rooms at certain parts and while not annoying, doesn't really add anything to the experience.

Why people are calling it a tech demo, I don't particularly understand. It IS a full game - there is a beginning, a middle, and an end. However, I can understand that being instantly thrown into the action with little explanation could grate on peoples nerves.\n\nI don't want to say it's Kafka-esque, because that would be giving the game far too much credit, however, the brevity of the story and the nature of it - you're more or less transformed into a bug in this huge maze and you're afraid of getting squished, I  can see some sort of draw to that sort of thing. The game does have non-stop, run faster, finishfinishfinish mentality that's lacking in many games. That doesn't always come across as a good thing.\n\nAs it's been said before, the water manipulation is a pretty cool feature, but of course it could've been done better. It is smooth in terms of being visually appealing. My biggest issue? The controls. Maybe I'm just not used to third-person games, but pretty much this is the big mood killer. It really, really will frustrate you enough to break something that can be played in a single sitting into multiple play sessions, not because you don't enjoy the game visually, but because you're sick of having to press the exact thing in the exact 0.2 second timeframe they give you to do it. At times it works, at other times, it doesn't work at all.\n\nI give it big ups for having a female protagonist that isn't overly-sexualized. This is something people complain about all the time, and it's really not an issue here. The character is pretty, but not flawless and not the commonly associated "Bimbo" flavor you have come to expect from most action games of this type. No overly enlarged breasts, no bouncing wiggling parts for fan service, and the clothes are modest. I really, really do have to give the game points for this - it's something that's not seen often enough and is expected in nearly any game with a strong femal protagonist.\n\nThe storyline is obtuse, I can't help but feel like there was probably more of an introductory chapter that got chopped out of the game, and that there was much more planned for it that never came to fruition because the development company went belly-up. It's like an early-release title that they just slapped on an "Oh well, finished" tag. They could've issued patches to make the controls less clumsy, they could've opened it up to be played around with and have mods created, they could've done multiple things - bankrupt or not, but they just didn't.\n\nAnd it's short. At most, on the hardest setting, you might get 8 hours of gameplay out of this, and that's only because you're going to die a LOT. Get used to dying, but then feeling really stupid when you figure out where you were supposed to go; it's  almost always completely obvious.\n\nThis game had so much potential, it still DOES have so much potential, it's not ugly, the main character is pretty cool, the atmosphere is in high levels. Sure, I would recommend it for 0.50 - I would recommend it for 1.99 - but not for the full asking price. A very long, great start to something that just failed.\n\nOn a final note - the voice acting is bearable. Except for at one point when Alex (The female protagonist) randomly switches to a full-on English accent from a rather non-descript American accent for no apparent reason whatsoever. This only happens for a few sentences, but it still had me shaking my head.\n\nIf you get it on sale - pick it up, it IS an enjoyable play, but not without its flaws, and within the price range that it almost always runs (Cheap - Very cheap) I can't say I'm disappointed with it. If only they had been able to finish the game - again, it is a full game, I don't know where the tech demo comparison comes from - but opening it up to the community to make their own mods and patches, to create with it, could have possibly saved the company by making it a cult classic. Instead, it's an obscure budget game with atmosphere in bounds and some weird idiosyncrasies that would have taken almost no effort whatsoever to fix.\n\nSo what happened?\n\n6/10 - Like it, but won't play it again. Well worth it when it's on sale for 2.00 or under or if you get it in a bundle, otherwise, just play something you know you already like.","July 21, 2014","true","4.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

I installed it this morning, beat the game in under two hours and had enough time to get ready for work... Quite frankly i'm disappointed, i was excited for a game with extremely realistic water physics, which is really the only point the game delivered on.\n\nThe game provided no backstory to the main protagonist Kate. The opening cinematic showed her in some kind of cave flooding with water, and every single time you dive under water  you hear a young girl crying and calling Kate's name.  I was hoping to progress through the game and learn more about her, and the man who pretty much guided you through the entire game, but alas, i got unending quips from him and an almost unlikeable main character.\n\nThe gunplay (if you can call it that) is mundane, you get one gun which can take 6 different types of ammo, but there are 3 you'll only ever really use. The enemies are equally as forgettable. All we know about them is that they are terrorists trying to get a hold of nano technology to wipe out the human population leaving very few "faithful" survivors. We are still left wondering at the end of the game how they got on the floating city ship, which is hard to believe i'm actually on considering all we see is the inside of it for the duration of the game. The water physics like i said before are all this game has going for it, they are incredible, so i commend the devs for that. However,  when getting your powers near the end of the game (which you use for about 10 minutes if that),  the water physics become clunky and buggy. I disagree with some of the other reviews though, they are not hard to aim as  there is a reticle on the ground for where the pillar of water will come up,  and the final boss was easy, to my disappointment i beat her in about 3-5 minutes if that.\n\nThe swimming controls could be better, especially during 2 specific sections of the game where you have to  place floating barrels under a submerged cargo container to lift it so you can progress through the level.  I feel like if i tap shift it sends me to the bottom of the water filled room i'm in. I really wanted to like this game, i really tried too, but between the jackass in my ear spouting one liners every 3 minutes for the first hour or so, and the fact the game gives you no backstory at all, with clunky controls, i couldn't. I don't know if i'm even going to start it back up to complete the challenge room. I can't really recommend this game, it leaves a lot of unanswered questions, too many for me at least, and with no real reason why.","May 11","false","1.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I dunno about any of that. "Jaw-dropping"? This game wasn't even *bad* enough to make my jaw drop, let alone be amazing enough to induce jaw dropping as they imply. "Floating city"? This game could have been set inside an underwater facility for all that it matters that it's a floating city. In fact, I'm incensed that it isn't because 'floating city' implies a more interesting setting than a simple underwater facility and this game is NOT INTERESTING in any aspect.\n\nThe story is insipid, worse, there's no conclusion whatsoever. The final boss battle ends and the game does so as well, abruptly and without denouement of any kind.\n\nYou see the little splash image of the protagonist using some kind of water powers? That's almost a lie. You don't get those abilities until the last 10% of this game, and you only really get to use it for one move in the final boss battle.\n\nThe crappiness of this game really comes out when you are trying to do anything more complicated than standing still and shooting. When the action gets hectic and I need to dodge, aim, shoot, and use the water powers in rapid succession, it's like the game gets confused and faints. Inexplicably, she'll get stuck pointing her gun in one direction and not only am I unable to shoot but I can't change direction anymore either. Moving the mouse moves the camera freely around her but does not change where she is actually facing or aiming (not that it matters, since I can't shoot).\n\nThis game has absolutely nothing of substance to offer as an experience. The only interesting thing about it is technical: the water uses realistic fluid dynamics. The best I can say about it is that it is not "offensively bad" like, say, Surgeon Simulator. Unfortunately, unlike Surgeon Simulator, this game is simply not fun.\n\nIncidentally, this will be the very first game I've ever given a Not Recommended rating. Make of that what you will.","May 6","false","12.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

I bought it during a bargain sale when it was 0.49 euros because earlier i saw a trailer and liked it but didn't have the money. Graphics are great, no doubts there. The gameplay length is reasonably long for such a low-priced game. The water physics resemble From Dust's physics, and your character reacts to it as you would expect, you almost feel the water pushing against your body. However, the storyline is so incredibly dull that i didn't even play until the end. The combat is so simple that if you die once you truly must be new to the game. The game gives repetitive tasks and makes you walk past every place you go twice. Although it's camera hacking system has beaten Watch_dogs, you don't hack much aside from scouting the enemies and using terminals. It's only use is to find out where to shoot. It has so many enviromental ways to kill your enemies that you won't even need to shoot directly at anyone. You get a sound gun and don't even loot the enemy's guns after you kill them. All and all this game is a 7/10 at first glance, slipping to a 4/10 for repetitive and dull gameplay.","November 13, 2014","false","1.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

This game tries it's hardest to make the game mechanics work like some big AAA game like Assassin's Creed, looking at the parkour mechanics, I think it actually tried mimicking Assassin's Creed. Now by mimicking, I mean flat out mimicing, like Shadow of Mordor level mimicking, I wouldn't be surprised if they took some of the coding out of an Assassin's Creed game and tried using it. Sadly, it doesn't work in their benefit, the jumping is terrible, I always end up falling and dying, the climbing is terrible, you can't even move the camera around while doing it, it just snaps back to it's original position. The enemies, oh my god the enemies, I'm going to make a list pointing out all the flaws of the enemy AI:\n1.) AIMBOOOOOOTS!!!!! Every single enemy has aimbots, no matter how far away you are from them, they will NEVER miss, and this gets even worse when you hear:\n2.) Enemy detection mechanics. The enemy will be able to detect you from literally a mile away, even if they're looking the opposite direction, they will spot you. This one time the enemy was on the other side of the room, I was in "stealth mode", and they were looking the opposite direction, they still turned around when I came out into an opening and shot me.\n3.) Knockdown. Whenever the enemy is shot with a near fatal strike, they fall over, now normally this would be fine if they put some icon over them to tell you that they aren't actually dead, but instead you'll walk away from them thinking that they died, only to be killed when they get right back up.\n4.) OP. Later on in the game you fight stronger enemies who have all these stupid traits on them, so not only do they have the sense of Peter Parker, they have the strength of The Incredible Hulk too.\n\nBack to the review, the game itself is very boring and tedious, you usually have no clue what you're doing, the gameplay is repetitive (Get to destination "A" and shoot bad guys along the way, maybe pick up a barrel), and also there's some more in depth things that break down the game as well. During the game, who am I kidding, I'm not even going to put a spoiler text in here, no one is going to care about this, during the game you unlock more weapons such as Gel Ammo, SMG ammo, Full Auto Ammo, and more ammo I didn't ever care to use because they're useless, the ammo you start out with is infinite and is more powerful than all the others if you use it correctly, so it's like you go throughout the whole game never feeling rewarded. The "Stealth" mechanic that they "implemented" into the game is literally useless, there is no such thing as 'Stealth' in this game (as I previously stated during my rant about how terrible the enemies are).\nAlright, let's list the Pros and Cons.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing water graphics, maybe the best I've ever seen, also to pair with it has semi good water mechanics, to the point where it deserves it's\n-Good graphics for an Indie game\n-Decent voice acting\n-Boob physics\n\nCons:\n-Boring gameplay\n-Glitches\n-TERRIBLE ENEMY AI\n-Gross animations\n-Repetitive objectives\n-The story isn't even there\n\nI really wouldn't waste my money with this, even if it's on a killer sale.","November 18, 2014","false","2.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

It just makes you desperate while using them.\n\nThe positive points of the game:\n-Gorgeous water, graphics, physics, fluity, all the game is water related and yes, it's a nice experience.\n\nSadly, that's ALL the game has to offer, in my opinion.\n\nNow, for the negative points:\n-The game is insultingly short, you can easly finish it in 3 hours at best if you dont have any issues with your saved files.\n-Yes, there are issues and bugs with the save files, not fixed for the time being. They go from the game not wanting to load them, to my case, where the loading screen would just stay there in an endless loop. I had to restart Act 1 and Act 2 on two sepparated occasions thanks to that.\n-The plot is non-existent. The characters are bland, unappealing. 90% of the stuff that seems to be happening is never explained. Yes, there are documents scattered around, but it's not like they add much. Some videos or characters that totally seem plot-relevant, never appear again. The ending follows that half-baked fashion to the extreme. It feels like the developers had a lot of ideas for the plot and never finished one. I also cant stand the antagonists of the game, specially the main one. This is more of a personal opinion, but I think their motivations are almost ridiculous, unspired, stupid, even. Their attitude and the way they talk it's irritating. It's not because I cant stand villians being bad and cruel, but because I rather confront villians who are bad for the sake of being bad, than these kind of so half-baked ones.\n-The gameplay is most of the time annoying and unresponsive. You have to swim, of course; well, it's kinda bad. Climbing it's okay. Shooting is also okay. But one mechanic you gain almost on the end of the game (shame on that too), that should be the coolest one, it's almost broken and so, you dont feel like using it. The enemies are also totally irritating. They are always saying the same sentences, dubbed by the same guy, spaming one after another, like broken toys. Being shot doesnt feel like you've been hit at all, so it's hard to track down where the bullets are coming from; sum to that the fact that in the final areas of the game, enemies wont stop popping out of god knows where, coming one after another, being sometimes more sneaky than ninjas and catching you off guard. And believe me, it's not because they've been programmed to do that. It's just buggy, and it feels buggy. When you die 'cos of that, well, it doesnt feel good. The game also has a "sneaking" mechanic but, MEH, never found it useful, even in the very specific areas the game tells you to sneak around, it's not that necessary, it doesnt work that right. And I love infiltration games, all be said.\n-It has some replay value: you have collectibles to find, Hard difficulty, and a challenge room after you've beat the game. But still, given the fact that it's not much fun to play it, why do this? I know I wont.\n\nSo, unless you are curious about the water and the game is on sale (I got it for 50 cents), I wouldnt recommend buying it, I dont think anybody would be much pleased with what's going to find.","March 6, 2014","false","4.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Melovinci/recommended/92000/","Melovinci","Icarus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Melovinci/","483 products in account","Hydrophobia Prophecy isn't very good. But before I get into why, it's not completely awful. Considering it's a 2010 game, the graphics aren't bad, though not amazing. But it's the water physics that is this game's shining crown and glory. The water flows, pours and ripples naturally, not too clear and not too murky. When you open doors or break glass with varying water levels, the water flows from one area to another in waves and levels out. Dark Energy Digital have produced a very good water physics simulator in their HydroEngine. It's just a pity they didn't put as much effort into the game itself.\n\nWhy did I think this game was bad? Hydrophobia Prophecy aims to be a cover-based, stealth shooter, similar vein to Deus Ex but without the RPG elements. But the stealth elements are absolutely horrible as cover is the only real element that provides stealth. Because the stealth is so bad, the game becomes a generic, watered-down, cover-based shooter. You have 1 weapon with 5 different ammo (i.e. stun, single shot, auto-fire, remote detonation grenade and remote detonation shock grenade). Majority of encounters involved me shooting a guy enough times in the face before he killed me, waiting for my health to regenerate before moving onto the next guy.\n\nHydrophobia Prophecy is only worth having a go if you're interested in water physics in games. Otherwise the game is not very well done due to many flaws and bugs, only being about 3 hours long, poor design and poor mechanics. Dark Energy Digital went under after low sales of this game, which is unfortunately what happens when you produce a sub-par game. More unfortunately is their response to some negative reviews which can be read about in this article. Looking at the title image below, don't get fooled into thinking this is an action game where you use your magical water power to defeat the bad guys. The below image represents about 8.5% of the game, 6% of that being an awful, awkward, out of the blue boss fight.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/10/03/hydrophobia-prophecy/","October 3, 2014","false","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Also a lot of the good content is in the 3rd act (which is the finial act). The game is about 3 ~ 4 hours long and keeps you wanting to play it.

The weapon your given has unlimited ammo as long as you charge it as the first ammo type you get and personaly I dont have a need for the other 4 types of ammo  with targets down in 1 or 2 shots. The story is borderline a Tom Clancy game, Everything is peaceful, terrorist f*** things up and you need to fix it. Though all this the main character actually just feels like her role before all the issues hit. She isnt a sharp shooter and on normal she is very weak, she feels and plays like a regular person(besides her ability to hold her breath). Control wise this game is almost poor. Walking and swiming feel clunky and if the water isnt deep enough to swim over but still too deep to walk around you get some intresting bugs. This game has a stealth system but if the water gets too deep you make a moan and alert everyone near by. so far the game preformed decent until Act 3. Act 3 i had my mouse not respond 3 times in a row from an awkward bug i got while swiming and aiming. Overall the game looks nice, i just wish the combat and movement were a little less clunky so I could enjoy it. Now here is my biggest issue, at the time of writing this I am 2.2hrs in and the game is ALMOST OVER. luckly I got this on sale and didnt pay the $5 (I think this is still $15 or $20 on Xbox). So beware this game is EXTREAMLY SHORT and your in for about a 3hr story and a challage room(which I havent tried yet). But if your a Developer looking for an engie to handle water physics this is wonderful engie to use and should give this a shot.","December 24, 2014","false","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But it's an interesting game as well that has a bit of challenge too it.  The game has a variety of aspects to it: a bit of puzzle solving, a bit of shooting, a bit of creepy giggling dead girl (stay underwater for a while...you'll start to hear it), and of course...water physics (and of course no game with a female protagonist can avoid the all mighty overamped boob physics).  The water actually reacts in what seems like a realistic way including waves rolling through and walls of water flowing down hallways when doors are opened.  It's a great game if you're waiting for a new game to come out and need something to hold you over for several days.

Sadly, though, it runs out of both pretty quickly.  A few more mechanics would have made it amazing, but it works with what it has.  This leads onto the game's major flaw: Hydrophobia is very short.  One can understand why this is, though, the game's levels explore its limited mechanics thoroughly, and more would have become repeditive.\n\nThe controls are a little bit awkward, it's clearly a console port and doesn't handle keyboard and mouse so well and has some weird accelleration.  It also ran my laptop very hot with the settings turned up to mid-high, but there wasn't much stuttering.  The game could probably be optimised somewhat.  If the developers had have spent more time polishing the game, it would have been quite excellent.\n\nOverall, it's an entertaining little game.

This game isn't a buggy mess or unfinished or a slog as I would have expected from the score.\nStorywise however it could use some work, the dialogue could use some improvement especially in the introduction which has some very shakey voice acting.

Honestly, the story was pretty good and the plot was interesting. Where it really fell short for me was how long the actual story mode was. You can beat it in a few short hours with not a ton of effort. Personally I am happy I bought this game, and it is one of those that you will play about once a year just to beat it again and be reminded of the story. I'd rate this game 4/5 stars because the concept is really cool, it just simply does not give you enough game to explore and get in depth into the story.","April 9, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sadly, though, it runs out of both pretty quickly.  A few more mechanics would have made it amazing, but it works with what it has.  This leads onto the game's major flaw: Hydrophobia is very short.  One can understand why this is, though, the game's levels explore its limited mechanics thoroughly, and more would have become repeditive.\n\nThe controls are a little bit awkward, it's clearly a console port and doesn't handle keyboard and mouse so well and has some weird accelleration.  It also ran my laptop very hot with the settings turned up to mid-high, but there wasn't much stuttering.  The game could probably be optimised somewhat.  If the developers had have spent more time polishing the game, it would have been quite excellent.\n\nOverall, it's an entertaining little game.  Don't expect it to be taken away by it, but it's worth the few dollars you'll pay for it.\n\n","May 11, 2014","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Graphics have been improved, sound has been improved (though I disagree with replacing the voice actor for Scoot: the original was much better!), controls are open for both gamepad and mouse/keyboard (both with their pros & cons) and the gameplay has benefit a lot from the extra time/funding the development team had for this version.

Playing style is similar to Tomb Raider, climbing around ledges to progress to the next area, with some basic 3rd person shooting vs enemies with poor AI. Weapon variety is poor but opportunities for environmental kills keep it fairly interesting. No huge Tomb Raider style puzzles though. The big draw of the game is the water physics. As the ship falls apart and water rushes in knocking you off your feet, there is a sense of panic, trying to get to safety before you drown. The story and voice acting are decent, but some plot threads are left unfinished. Feels like the first part of a larger game. Its unfortunate that the 3rd act goes all action, ending with a fairly frustrating boss fight. You get an interesting new ability very late which ties into the story, but don't really get chance to play around with it before the game ends.

I'm just puting this out there to say Do not buy this game. Whatever little money it's asking for, it does not deserve. I'd understand the level of quality from this if it was a free mod for a game that someone made quickly in their spare time. The voice acting is mediocre at best.

It does not suck.  Despite the bad reviews I couldn't pass it up on sale for $0.49.  This game has some neat features in it.  The main issue is that there's really no need to use the neat features.  The game is very linear so there's never an opportunity to experiment using different abilities to clear an area.\n\nWhat I liked: The use of fire, water, electricity, gravity was done pretty well.  The manipulation of world objects wasn't really as limited as most games.  If you see a box it can be moved, thrown, blown up, etc.  You can use bad guys and world objects equally to create havok.\n\nThe animations were pretty good.  The character struggled through hip deep water, sloshed through knee deep water, and gasped for air appropriately.  The character acts like it's running out of air when the breath meter gets to a certain point (swimming more erratically and paniced) Cover animations were decent and there were even fairly good proximity animations which alot of games tend to ignore. (Stand close to fire and the character shields her face.)\n\nThe story wasn't blockbuster but was fast paced. There were a lot of cutscenes too, which I'm a fan of.  I want to see things unfold, not just hit a button and proceed.  Makes it more cinematic.\n\nWhat I didn't like: The boss fight was challenging but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Also slightly confusing.\n\nThe level design was pretty weak.  There isn't really any sense to the layout of this place.\n\nTwo achievements are for 1. getting all the objects and 2. getting all the medals.  There's no indication of how many you missed.  As far as I know there's no list of medals that can be obtained either. You just play and try to get them?  Not cool.\n\nYou couldn't use abilities creatively enough.  You get a chance to open doors with hazards behind them as a learning part of the story, but then really never get to do it again.  Using the handheld tool you can see if there's water or fire or nothing behind a door but if it's off the path it's either locked or malfunctioning which means it might as well just be another wall.  You can shoot out glass doors, which is great fun, but pointless since there's nothing to do but then just move on content with the knowledge that you just shot a door.\n\nThe bad guys weren't intelligently placed.  They just kind of showed up in places that made no sense here and there to make you shoot things.  The bad guy placement was so bad that the majority of boss fight baddies can be left to the boss to take out.\n\nAll in all it's another linear shooter.  If it's linear, and a shooter, 99% of the time it'll also be generic.  It'd be worth it at $9.99.","May 19, 2014","true","8.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But for the low price it went down to, it's a bargain. As I'm writing this, it's just 1,24€ here (on -75% daily deal). The reason to get it is the fantastic water physics implemented that I haven't seen done so well in any other game. You'll enjoy the really natural look of the water filling the sinking ship you're in. It rises, it has currents, waves, very naturally flows out of flooded rooms as you open the door, releasing the water... The surface ripples according to all water movement and reflects the light beautifully. However... this game is very short. And the action aspects (shooting, that is) aren't done so well. The weapons are kinda lame and it generally feels pretty static compared to typical action games. I consider this game a demonstration of the impressive water engine and it's a shame they didn't put as much work on other things.

Where this game stands out is the water is a character of it's own. You have to fight against water and use water to your advantage. There were many flaws in the game (blow up power, but the ship still has power; water is electrified, but only effects you if you are close; etc) that could have been better planned out. There are also a few glitches still, for example the audio from your character is not in the same spacial location as your current location. I also liked this game because it focused on story and not on thousands of collectibles and achievements. I recommend this to anyone who is willing to forgive some flaws for an inexpensive day of gaming.","December 24, 2014","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These serve to make the game infuriating, as you bumble your way around a sinking ship; being shot at by everybody you meet. What’s worse is the game’s supposedly ‘unique’ water powers don’t show up until basically the end of the game, and they are SUPER lame. All you can do is pick up stuff and toss it around using giant pillars of water. And as soon as you get these powers the game is basically over after a very annoying boss battle.\n\nHonestly, the game sucks. It’s basically a half-baked piece of crap. The game has a very interesting premise, and with more work could have been a good game. Sadly the game falls very short of anything close to fun, and can only be described as an annoying experience that you keep waiting to get better, when you finally expect it to get good, the game ends.\n\nMy recommendation is to not get this game, if for some god awful reason you want this game get it while on sale.","December 21, 2014","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These serve to make the game infuriating, as you bumble your way around a sinking ship; being shot at by everybody you meet. What’s worse is the game’s supposedly ‘unique’ water powers don’t show up until basically the end of the game, and they are SUPER lame. All you can do is pick up stuff and toss it around using giant pillars of water. And as soon as you get these powers the game is basically over after a very annoying boss battle.\n\nHonestly, the game sucks. It’s basically a half-baked piece of crap. The game has a very interesting premise, and with more work could have been a good game. Sadly the game falls very short of anything close to fun, and can only be described as an annoying experience that you keep waiting to get better, when you finally expect it to get good, the game ends.\n\nMy recommendation is to not get this game, if for some god awful reason you want this game get it while on sale.","December 21, 2014","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Short story/campaign. Decent graphics with some interesting and unique gameplay. The story just kinda throws you in, you don't really understand much about the character. If the game was just a "tech demo" for water physics, it fit it's purpose, although you don't really see it completely until the end. Having said that,  Dark Energy Digital steamlined the dynamic water in and made it part of the gameplay aesthetically well.\n\nSome pitfalls is the very unintelligent AI which gets stuck swimming into walls, and almost always knows where you are no matter what—and sometimes they can shoot through objects you're using for cover. The game has some lack luster controls, and the heroine is the most annoying I've ever encountered aswell—having a distaste for her within the first few sentences she said. At the end of the story her "partner", or whomever, had said something about the terroists being there, but other than a few seconds in the beginning of seeing him, he becomes just a voice in your head like a Cortana. Not making him more important to the story, or his death more part of the story really bugged me. He just eventually stops talking to you. They could have done that so much better.\n\nAmazing water effects aside, it felt very broken at certain parts, but it's an aging title(3 years+). I've played better in that time, but for it's price it was something different and entertaining to play despite some minor frustrations.","January 3, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are also a few glitches still, for example the audio from your character is not in the same spacial location as your current location.

Though they appear "shiny" and can make it rather difficult to play, they aren't horrible and can be much worse. Like many other people have pointed out and a big part of the game, the water details are stunning even when set on the lowest texture setting.\n\nGameplay: When it comes to rating a game I try to stay positive, but let's be real now. The controls are god awful. There are plenty of alternatives the developers could have used to make the controls simple and easy to learn. Instead, I have to smash my keyboard to get off from cornering the wall. The story line isn't too bad, but is overly cheesy.\n\nSound Effects and voice acting: Sound effects are neat-o. The voice acting isn't too great but at least they were putting in an attempt. Believe me when I say I have heard MUCH worse.\n\nOverall Score: 3/5.

At times the game reminds me of the film Posidon Adventure. The game is very good at making the player second guess themselves, and ask questions. Now while this level of exploration is not consistant, for the parts that it is in makes this game highly enjoyable.\n\nThis game for me personally is a showcase (eventhough to my knowlege it is not), a showcase of the possibilities for games made by larger companies.

The game starts on a giant ship which houses tonnes of people. You play as a mechanical engineer who is trying to foil the terorist attack on the vessel.\n\nThe game is relatively cheap at $5 (I got it for about $1 at sale :D). The main selling point of the game is the water mechanics. You can control the flow of water to open paths and even defeat enemies. The water graphics are really good (it looks and moves fluidly).\n\nNow for the bad points. Although the water graphics are good, other models (ie. characters, environment) seem somewhat bland. The voice acting isn't that great either, nor is the story unfortunately. The biggest problem I had with the game were lag spikes. Alot of lag spikes. Although it's a single player only game, it lagged and even freezes (for a few minutes at a time) on me in several areas even after lowering all the graphical settings to bottom. I play games like retribution and crysis  fine with minimum lag, but this game struggles to run for some reason. The third person shooting is also clunky as the movement controls aren't great.\n\n\nOverall, the game does try to be unique with the water mechanics, but it doesn't make up the the under par graphics, story, controls and bugs. I haven't finished it (due to the bugs), but after spending 2 hours in it I'm not really compelled to play it.

The platforming and puzzles are not too confusing and feel rewarding. However the story was rather short, only 4 hours or so and it leaves a lot left for the player to think about as the ending is confusing and felt rather rushed. The combat works pretty well, with cover mechanics and different ammo types, along with the power to control water which is great fun. The combat can feel rather awkward and clunky sometimes as the enemy AI is usually stupid. The guns didnt really sounds like guns either, more like someone making the sound effects with their mouth, but overall the combat was pretty fun.\n\nIn conclusion I think Hydrophobia is a good game for what it's worth (5 bucks, currently 99 cents as I write this review), and looks very very nice. However A sequel or an expansion would be great to fill up those plot holes.

She does verbally freak out when an area floods, but other than that stays calm as water rapidly floods and while she swims past dead bodies and such.\n\nThe whole reason I got this game tho was the amazing water physics, and to me, they more than make up for the shortcomings of the game.

I just get the feeling that it could've been better. It's fun to play, though. If you aren't a fan of underwater combat and other things of that nature, I'd say avoid it. If you're going to buy it, I would suggest getting it on sale. The story is kinda "meh", but I've seen worse. It seems like one of those games that's more about gameplay than story. Still, if you think it looks interesting, I'd say give it a shot.","April 2, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat could use some improvement, but overall it is alright. The main problem is the climbing. If you do not run Vsync, you are going to have a very bad time. If you don't believe me, try to compare. You have to run it with it, it makes the combat so smoother, and you cannot complete the game without it, so make sure to enable it. The other lacking part is the story. Bland, boring, and most of all, it doesn't have an ending. It has no closure, and it kinda just rolls to the credits, which is a shame, because it seems like a cool world. You are on a giant ship, and it starts to flood from a terrorist attack. That is pretty much all they say. You don't know why, you don't know the characters, you only really learn your name from the character talking to herself (Which I still don't know what it is.)

It's something you have to pay attention to.  I didn't find the story really all that boring, I'm just disappointed that you don't get your powers until late in the game when they're a bit irrelevant.  (I'm so used to shooting my guns that I don't know if I'll use the powers much.)\n\nI also liked that the main focus, water, had life to it.  It wasn't just something that was everywhere and utterly useless, you could actually use it to progress in the game.  Need to go up one level but no stairs/ladder/etc?  Can't go through a door because there is a fire right in front of it?   Shoot a wall and ride the flood.   Need to get to the next part of the story and don't feel like killing your way through a group of 10 guys?  You guessed it, OPEN THE FLOOD GATES AND SHOOT DOWN SOME POWER LINES.\n\nToo many indie developers go for generic, popular themes such as the ever popular Zombie shooter or some post-apocalyptic world that has little to no back story as to how things happened (or it takes forever to know the full story).  It's refreshing that they did their own spin on a futuristic dying Earth where the problem was over-population and not some catastrophic apocolyptic event.\n\nFor $5($0.49 during steam sales), this game gives you your money's worth and 8 times out of 10 you'll enjoy playing this for a few hours.  I got this through a Humble Bundle, so I didn't pay more than $0.10 for it, therefore take what I say with a grain of salt.","April 7, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A bit more character development would have been nice and few threads of the story were left hanging in the end (but then again it is possible that a follow up game was planned to deal with these somehow, dont know). That out of the way the main protagonist has at least some character and motivation in it.\n\nSo in a nutshell decent game - quite worth it on sale and if you have nothing to play then might be even be fair trade at it's full price.","April 13, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lame fact: this is the irrational fear of water, usually as a result of a rabies infected animal bite.  Why is this relevant?  Because the game has no bite.  Neat and interesting ideas yes, a reason to keep playing it no.  Some games i feel compelled to complete it to the point of 100% as far as achievements go (not because i consider the achievements the defining element, but because the game was that enjoyable).   At this point, the graphics are dated, and some would even consider the physics outdated.  It comes off as an experiement, or proof of concept.  Maybe if the game had been longer, or a little more polished it wouldn't come off that way.  As it is, it's dime store knockoff of Tomb Raider and Uncharted.\n\nIt is a decent game...if you can get it in a bundle.

It's not necesarily a bad game (at least if you have a responsive keyboard and mouse--something I did not have a majority of the game), but the entire story feels rushed. The ending is just kind of there and I found myself questioning what even happened to every main character--except Mila. The voice acting and music is mediocre, but they do their jobs fine. The highlight of the game would have to be the visuals--especially the water. The game isn't very difficult (I played on hard mode and only took more than an hour and a half  because my keyboard was running low on batteries), but the difficulty could be both a good or bad aspect depending on the player. Overall, the game isn't great but considering it's $4.99 and goes on sale for $0.49, it's a solid buy. In short, I give Hydrophobia a solid 75/100 and a buy it if you have the extra change.","December 6, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the price it was exception value, on sale for $0.49 - can't go wrong, but it would be worth up to $8 I'd reckon, I always wait for sales, this one was absolutely worth it, much better than Hard Reset.\n\nThe game is fairly linear, but the environmental mania with barrels and electricity make it really interesting.

Personally I still like the game a lot and enjoy playing it. I think that this can be a very good and enjoyable game if you dont expect this it to be something its not and like this kind of games in general.\n\nThis is not a AAA game with all the aspects being of top quality. It doesn't have the worlds best story-line or a lot of new and innovative gameplay elements. This is the kind of game that you play for fun or to relax after a hard day. If you like 3D adventure games with a little action here and there, like I do, this could be the game you are looking for. For the most part, this is really just an simple modern adventure-game with fun and quite repetive gameplay. It's for you to decide if that is a good thing or not. Most of the gameplay is jumping, running and swimming around and solving some, for the most part very simple puzzles. In the later parts of the game there is also some shooting and similar action. One thing I liked so much about this game is that it is still relatively low on action, witch makes it one of the kind of games that there are still not too much around these days for those who like 3D-adventure games, but not a lot of action/violence.\n\nAnother thing that separates this from the masses is the gender-roles seen in this game. While most of the games we see have protagonists that are white, young, macho straight men with big muscles this game brings a protagonist that seems  new and refreshing being more of a masculine woman. Of course, there's absolutely nothing wrong with macho men but for those gamers that don't identify with that kind of gender expression or simply like change this could also be seen as a good thing about this game.\n\nProbably the best and most innovative thing about this game is still the water and the effects associated to it. The water is really fun to play with and I really enjoyed wathing it wave from room to room. The behavior of the water is more realistic than I have seen in any other game up to this day. The water, fire and electricity really make the athmosphere of the game and are beautifull to look at.\n\nIt is worth noting that these are just my subjective experiences and views of the game and I also have not finished the game entirely yet. This is also the first game review that I have ever written! :)\n\nFor the price I bought it (0,49 euro) and being an indie game I would say Hydrophobia is a really fun experience and even has a few new elements that I enjoyed.","November 19, 2014","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Minimal explanations, no clear resolutions, a combat system that's almost as clunky as the one in Ride to Hell: Retribution, and no clear explanations for the opening or endings. Oh, and did I mention there's only like four hours of gameplay, tops? However, the game's one saving grace is that the water physics and graphics are phenomenal. I mean, they made an engine just for the water graphics and physics, and it acts like real water. Damn, that is some FINE water. 10/10 would tap this water (sorry not sorry). Is this game really just a less sucky Water Temple? Is hydrokinesis contagious? Is Hydrophobia actually an advertisement for Aquafina? I'm going to go with yes, no, and I can't think of any other justification for this game (another yes). Overall, I give this stagnating, glorified aquarium a 4.10.

Here's some thoughts.\nFlow and mood are excellent. The scenes were well-directed.\nPuzzle-solving was... it would have been good but there was a lot of hand-holding; you basically follow a carrot on a stick through the whole game, which feels largely on rails.\nThey sold the game based on the idea that you'd have cool hydrokinesis powers, but you only have them for the last 15% of the game if that.\nThe hydrokinesis is cludgy to control and not all that useful. You can't use it from cover and it's less powerful as a weapon than the sonic stun bullets you use for the other 85% of the game.\nYou also get real bullets but they suck so I never really used them. The sonic rounds have more stopping power and accuracy so why would I use semiauto or fullauto?\nThere's some stealth for about 5 minutes but you end up shooting everyone in the face anyway.\nAfter the game ends you unlock a "challenge room" but I don't care.\n\n\n\n---SPOILERS BELOW---\nThere is one boss fight, a robot gun thing. When you kill it, the antagonist gets electrocuted, you cure your water-power poisoning, and then it fades to black, roll credits.\nYou never get the deeper explanation of the conflict, just "crazy cult wants to cull humans". you never meet up with your pal who helped you through the first 75% of the game over the radio.\n\n\n\nI'm glad I played it. I'm also glad I got it on sale.\nI want more in the world of the game but I know it won't happen.","May 15, 2015","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I think of it.\nWarning! Long review is long. You have been warned.\n\n-Default Gameplay Mechanics: 7/10\nThe default buttons are a bit annoying, but they can be remapped. Way points are misleading and don't help when you're stuck.There are things you have to look at very closely to be able to progress. The cover system sometimes doesn't wanna work so the character doesn't go for cover. Diving underwater sometimes happened randomly when I didn't want to dive. Health regen system, which is common in many games, makes an appearance in this one. The boss sometimes glitched out (see Boss Difficulty below).\n\n-Resolution: 10/10\nMany resolutions to pick from. I was able to play it with my laptop connected to my big screen TV via HDMI on full screen.\n\n-Maximum Overall Graphics: 10/10\nHands down, the best water graphics I've ever seen. Ending cutscene had the worst graphics in the entire game. Water graphics could easily make up for it.\nNOTE: The game is all about the water.\n\n-Storyline: 6/10 (SPOILERS)\nA metropolis floating on water is attacked by a terrorist group known as Neo Malthusians. You, the character, are trapped and the area you are in is flooding. With the guidance from your buddy working the security cameras, you find a way to **escape**.\nIt was good for the first 2 acts then suddenly became wtf on the second half of act 3. And it only has 3 acts. The game can be beaten in less than 4 hours if you know what to do. My first playthrough was 4 hours. And that's not beating it 100%.\n**It has a horrible ending with no resolution of any kind whatsoever. After beating the boss practically nothing happens**\n\n-Normal Enemy Difficulty on Easy: 9/10\nThe enemies were pretty easy. They did get some cheap hits every now and then. It's hard to tell if an enemy is dead or down from a certain distance.\n\n-Boss Difficulty: 6/10\nThe last and only boss is ludicrously powerful. A woman (who can be assumed as the terrorist leader) takes control of a machine that has a mini-gun, rocket-type projectiles, and grenade launcher. It sometimes glitched out to the point where I had to restart the battle almost 10 times. When it tossed out bombs, it covered a large portion of the room and they're very hard to see so I didn't know where was considered safe. Getting cornered for one second is almost guaranteed death unless you're lucky to survive.\n\nPrice: $4.99\nA bit high price for a short game. I got it when it was on special for $0.49, so I don't really regret it.\n\n-Overall: 6.5/10 - Pretty much the MetaScore (for once I agree with it)\nI liked the game. The majority of the storyline is good and it's not too long to beat. But, it had some painfully obvious problems (everything mentioned above). If the developer/publisher company didn't go bankrupt a couple of years ago, they could have made this game so much better.\nI'd recommend it, but honestly, you'd be better off buying it on sale for $0.49 than the regular $5 price.","June 30, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kind of like a level based Resident Evil-ish stirred in with a bit of Budget Raideresque climbing and jumping.\n\nWhat do you get for your dollar or so on sale?

He11 yeah I would!\n\nThis is not the action game of the year, but it is a complete and working title that does exactly as I expected.\nIf you want something that is not super pricey, and yet can still return on your dollar (literally less than a pouch of crisps).\n\nBuy it on sale if budget, or "engine concept" games interest you.\n\nDo not buy this if you want a $30+ polished supergame.","February 26, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I got the game for 49 cents or something like that.)\n\nCons:\n\n-Controls. It seems like the game wants to be played on a controller rather than M/KB.\n\n-Gameplay seems uneven. It seems like the devs put a huge emphasis on the first act/ act and a half of the game but then just gave up near the end. I would have liked to have mini-bosses for each act.\n\n-Story is nothing to write home about. Terrorists being terrorists and what not. AND SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS!\n\nConclusion:\n\nI'm going to recommend this game despite it's flaws with the stipulation that you buy it on sale. The game is short. I beat the game in about 5 hours.

The platforming and puzzles are not too confusing and feel rewarding. However the story was rather short, only 4 hours or so and it leaves a lot left for the player to think about as the ending is confusing and felt rather rushed. The combat works pretty well, with cover mechanics and different ammo types, along with the power to control water which is great fun. The combat can feel rather awkward and clunky sometimes as the enemy AI is usually stupid. The guns didnt really sounds like guns either, more like someone making the sound effects with their mouth, but overall the combat was pretty fun.\n\nIn conclusion I think Hydrophobia is a good game for what it's worth (5 bucks, currently 99 cents as I write this review), and looks very very nice. However A sequel or an expansion would be great to fill up those plot holes. I do reccomend this game if you want some thing short, fun, cheap and well designed.","November 27, 2013","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's obvious that there was a $10 price tag in mind, but the game does such a good job of immersing you, that you quickly forget. The water physics in this game far exceed anything else on the market, and the company makes full use of the engine by giving you just about every scenario possible. Unfortunately, it's a short game and rather lacking in the story department. I was expecting it to amount to something more spectacular (like seeing the actual exterior of the ship) rather than the same old rooms for six hours, but no. Instead you're left trying to outrun rapidly flooding hallways all while gunning down some rather extreme liberators, as the world's population is far beyond sustainable.

After a few restarts and a lot of tweaking of settings I managed to get Hydrophobia to run by sacrificing the graphics and pretty much everything else.\n\nWhen the game starts, it throws you immediately into the story. Hydrophobia: Prophecy is set on a city sized boat called Queen Of The World, sometime during the mid 21st century. Queen Of The World is  having some sort of anniversary celebration (whether anniversary of it’s founding or anniversary of completing a trip around the world I’m not sure) and out of the blue, the main communications server goes offline. Kate Wilson, a systems engineer, goes to investigate. With communications down a terrorist organization called the Malthusians hack the main security computer and a series of explosions rip holes into the hull.\n\nOverall, the game seems quite well made with only a few minor bugs (some of the items float randomly when picked up rather than staying in your hand) and a dynamic liquid system that I haven’t seen anywhere else. However, one thing I can criticize is that the level design is quite confusing, often leading me to walk off in the wrong direction with little reward for doing so.\n\nAs a summary, Hydrophobia: Prophecy is a promising title and from what I’ve seen in my 77 minutes in-game it is well worth its $5.00 price tag, despite its few issues.","July 20, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat could use some improvement, but overall it is alright. The main problem is the climbing. If you do not run Vsync, you are going to have a very bad time. If you don't believe me, try to compare. You have to run it with it, it makes the combat so smoother, and you cannot complete the game without it, so make sure to enable it. The other lacking part is the story. Bland, boring, and most of all, it doesn't have an ending. It has no closure, and it kinda just rolls to the credits, which is a shame, because it seems like a cool world. You are on a giant ship, and it starts to flood from a terrorist attack.

On Low settings for Water, this games Water effects are as good or better than any other game I have ever personally played. This is another one of those games from not one of the monster gaming companies that is further proof of the creative talent of the human mind. This game is good times. 5 out of 5 stars.","April 19, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's something you have to pay attention to.  I didn't find the story really all that boring, I'm just disappointed that you don't get your powers until late in the game when they're a bit irrelevant.  (I'm so used to shooting my guns that I don't know if I'll use the powers much.)\n\nI also liked that the main focus, water, had life to it.  It wasn't just something that was everywhere and utterly useless, you could actually use it to progress in the game.  Need to go up one level but no stairs/ladder/etc?  Can't go through a door because there is a fire right in front of it?   Shoot a wall and ride the flood.   Need to get to the next part of the story and don't feel like killing your way through a group of 10 guys?  You guessed it, OPEN THE FLOOD GATES AND SHOOT DOWN SOME POWER LINES.\n\nToo many indie developers go for generic, popular themes such as the ever popular Zombie shooter or some post-apocalyptic world that has little to no back story as to how things happened (or it takes forever to know the full story).  It's refreshing that they did their own spin on a futuristic dying Earth where the problem was over-population and not some catastrophic apocolyptic event.\n\nFor $5($0.49 during steam sales), this game gives you your money's worth and 8 times out of 10 you'll enjoy playing this for a few hours.  I got this through a Humble Bundle, so I didn't pay more than $0.10 for it, therefore take what I say with a grain of salt.","April 7, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The most interesting thing in the visual side, is the water, wich looks great and wich is also simulated very nicely, more on that later. The game starts out in the protagonists apartment, showcasing a futuristic but messy home, of an engineer living on some boat-a-majig. There is snippets of lore scattered around the world, but I found it to be largely uniteresting, and uninspired. It seems as if it is set in the futuristic setting everybody and thier mom uses, with white walls and sharp edges. Also the simple colouring, as you might see in titles such as Mirror's edge, is used here. Oh Mirror's Edge, released in 2008; much supirior in terms of visuals.\n\nMy first impressions was: "Alright, nothing I haven't seen before, but it seems as if it could be okay".\n\nAaaand not really. The game is just sub-par in every aspect. It shows interesting gameplay concepts, but fails to utilise them in any way. For example gunplay: I like the idea of the whole one gun thing, where you have a single gun whose primary ammotype is an infinite charge style ammo, wich is cool, big fan of that, but it just feels slow and the gun has no feel to it. The sound design behind the gun is pretty bad, and the enmies are dying in a satisfying way. Mostly they insta-ragdoll, and flops to the ground, and if you play like me, and use the infinite amme thing, they will only be stunned, and get up, needing another shot, before they are dead. In the last act just before the boss, they then introduce a very cool feature, where you can manipulate the water to grab stuff. They use it in one, yes ONE (1) puzzle, and then they throw you at the boss, wich is incredibly easy, you dodge a thing shooting at you, and then when it cools down you shoot it with one of the ammotypes, to stun it, and then you grab a barrel and throw at it. Meanwhile mobs comes at you sometimes (oh yeah, and these are the same enemies you have been fighting the whole game, there is zero enemy vararity). This cycle repeats three times, whereafter the thing explodes, and the bad guy randomly dies.\n\nThe story was bland, if nearly non-existing, and very forgetable.\n\nNormaly I wouldn't shy away from recommend short titles, but this thing just doesn't have anything going for it, and you can find much better games, for the same price, and even some of the titles wich it is inspired by, in a sale.\n\nThis game is defenitly a no go, even if you got it in a bundle or something, I would say that theres way better things to do, thant to play this game. Play some of the other games from the bundle.\n\nTl;dr: boring, short, uninspired, don't buy, sorry :(","July 6, 2014","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As others have said, its kinda Tomb Raider-y, but the adventure elements are kinda sparse it feels like, so its a lot of just shooting and going from place to place.\n\nThe powers you get are pretty good, and I think well implemented, but a lot of the time there's not much call to use them, and when it makes/requires you use them its kinda annoying (it works better as 'hey you have these powers, think of cool ways to use them', rather than simply 'use power a to accomplish thing b')  Didn't like the boss fights at all, not sure I was at the final boss when I quit, but it was a rather annoying fight (I never really cared for boss fights which use infinitely spawning goons as a challenge.)\n\nStory/setting was good, characters were good, voice acting was kinda ok (though I wouldn't say it was great), gameplay was meh. I'd probably give it a 3/5, there's entertainment to be had, but not derived from the gameplay.\n\n(*btw most of my time on record in the game is just because I left it running for a while after changing input on my tv)","June 21, 2014","true","86.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great graphics and great water simulation! It is a bit short, the final portion of the game feels a bit rushed, but it is still worth playing.\n\nThere are some issues:\n\n- Windowed mode requires a launch parameter.\n\n- Sometimes, upon game launch, the saved progress will not be loaded ("Load Game" will be disabled). Just exit and launch the game again until the progress gets loaded correctly.\n\n- Some in-game medals are glitchy, requiring restarting the entire playthrough, or even wiping the entire progress. Getting 100% achievements in this game is too annoying, repetitive and time-consuming.","July 3, 2011","true","29.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The water effects are the best I have ever seen, and the story is actually pretty cool, if not a bit hokey. The voice acting is awful for the most part. Gameplay wise, it's solid enough but even at the end (which I cannot beat due to incredibly cheap boss design) I was losing touch with the controls. What is that secret sauce which some games lack and thus never create a transparent, intuitive connection to the player? As much as I loved working my way through this game, warts and all, the fact that I shall probably never endure the suffering required to beat it, means I shall feel forever cheated.","September 11, 2012","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Will not knock your socks off but it has enough unique(ish) twists and gameplay to be worth it on this age of generic shooters. About 6 hours of campaign with little side exploration - as much as this is possible as game is relatively linear. A bit more character development would have been nice and few threads of the story were left hanging in the end (but then again it is possible that a follow up game was planned to deal with these somehow, dont know). That out of the way the main protagonist has at least some character and motivation in it.\n\nSo in a nutshell decent game - quite worth it on sale and if you have nothing to play then might be even be fair trade at it's full price.","April 13, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of them are pretty facepalm worthy. The gameplay isn't half bad though. That seems to be its redeeming quality. It's a little frustrating at times, as in not always clear where you need to go or what you need to do, but that happens in some games. Not a big deal. I haven't been confused enough to check a walkthrough or anything. I bought it on sale a while back and honestly I'm glad I did. It has interesting ideas, but less than great execution. I just get the feeling that it could've been better. It's fun to play, though. If you aren't a fan of underwater combat and other things of that nature, I'd say avoid it. If you're going to buy it, I would suggest getting it on sale. The story is kinda "meh", but I've seen worse. It seems like one of those games that's more about gameplay than story. Still, if you think it looks interesting, I'd say give it a shot.","April 2, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here's some thoughts.\nFlow and mood are excellent. The scenes were well-directed.\nPuzzle-solving was... it would have been good but there was a lot of hand-holding; you basically follow a carrot on a stick through the whole game, which feels largely on rails.\nThey sold the game based on the idea that you'd have cool hydrokinesis powers, but you only have them for the last 15% of the game if that.\nThe hydrokinesis is cludgy to control and not all that useful. You can't use it from cover and it's less powerful as a weapon than the sonic stun bullets you use for the other 85% of the game.\nYou also get real bullets but they suck so I never really used them. The sonic rounds have more stopping power and accuracy so why would I use semiauto or fullauto?\nThere's some stealth for about 5 minutes but you end up shooting everyone in the face anyway.\nAfter the game ends you unlock a "challenge room" but I don't care.\n\n\n\n---SPOILERS BELOW---\nThere is one boss fight, a robot gun thing. When you kill it, the antagonist gets electrocuted, you cure your water-power poisoning, and then it fades to black, roll credits.\nYou never get the deeper explanation of the conflict, just "crazy cult wants to cull humans". you never meet up with your pal who helped you through the first 75% of the game over the radio.\n\n\n\nI'm glad I played it. I'm also glad I got it on sale.\nI want more in the world of the game but I know it won't happen.","May 15, 2015","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
