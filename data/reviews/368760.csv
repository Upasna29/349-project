It's a bit on the short-side and rough around the edges but there's a bit of replayability.  I like the graphical style and learned a few things.  Worth noting the target audience age group - don't expect Skyrim, but a cute little game.  I approve!","July 8, 2015","true","0.6"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","19","19","2","0"

During five chapters, you control him as he does quests, speaks with friends, enemies or merchants, spares with friends, fights enemies... Oh hey, didn't I already tell that?\n\nIn reality, the game is set to educate people about the Vikings and their culture. Given the fact that developers are Danish and that their games are used in schools, it's kinda normal to see an opus on the Vikings. While the discussions are aiming to make you learn about their cultures, some objects can be inspected to give more information and even the items out of time are educational. And I'll say the same thing as for Slave Trade: it's not documented enough.\n\nAnd they finally fixed the sailing game: it is easier to sail. The fighting is also easy to understand. Tempus is still there as the time traveller giving some information.\n\nThe only problem, apart the lack of documentation? THE CONTROLS! Everything is done with the mouse. You click on a point and Erik goes there... without the camera moving. If you need to see correctly, you have to right click. And it's frustrating. Really frustrating. It ruins the stealth scenes.\n\nAlso, people are searching for Lothar, because nearly nobody found him. Was it part of a cut content? Or is Lothar the German warrior?\n\nBut, hey developers, don't worry, I enjoyed the game. I wish I could play a little more kid Erik though. And my ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the lack of documentation comes from my archaeologist/historian background, add to that that I work in the digital education and you get that particular critic. The gamer in me is more disappointed by the controls.\n\nI hope that the Plague will arrive soon, mainly in my Groupees library. Because I really want to play it. And write a review about it. And write an article on my blog about it in my native language.","September 16, 2015","true","5.9"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

I only learned 4 or 5 facts I didn't know before and I only remembered 2 or 3 because these were interesting. Some facts I feel were left out though\n\nWhy thumbs down? It's way too short! 2 hours with\nrunning up and down the stairs twice to get something! I do\nthink there are maybe two other endings which I did not\nplay yet, but still, I expected more.\n\nAbout the gameplay: the gameplay is only with your mouse\nand you can play it with just one hand. And the fighting system\nisn't really challenging or interesting.\n\nIt was a fun game to play, just short and unchallenging.","July 1, 2015","false","3.2"," 48 of 73 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","48","73","5","0"

It has a lot of clickable stuff where you can read about different stuff in the viking world. I knew most of the facts, but for someone not from Scandinavia there might be some new things to learn.\n\nFrom a game perspective there is a lot of hunting for little coins, hammers (that let you choose specific viking deities when ever you collect 3 of them), talking to people, doing small quiz-like dialogues, spot errors in the form of items not belonging to the time etc.\n\nWhere it lacks is instructions on how to play. For example it took me some time before I found out how to spin the camera (hold right mouse button down), the voice acting is in Danish, but text is in English, which might be a problem for kids, also voice acting clearly isn't super professional.\n\nIn the end I will recommend this game to promote educational games, I think games like these are really cool and I don't mind it being short, the price point might be a tad too high though. If you expect a Telltale quality adventure game this is not it.","July 28, 2015","true","1.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Vikings turnsout to be the masterpiece of the series. The graphics look just slightly better than the other parts but have some nice additions like night & day maps and different seasons. Also the Danish language fits perfectly to the Vikings history. The game has even some interesting gamemodes like stealth, turnbased fightmode or a trading simulation. Surely there are many easter eggs and collectibles in this game with some extra achievements. The hardest was to beat Lothar which is the 3rd enemy during the Germans invasion. Altogether a fun game and lots of impressions","February 21","true","3.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/368760/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","Playing History: Vikings is the third, and currently last, release in the Playing History series. While this installment is yet another point and click like its predecessors, the game has gotten a major graphical overhaul and many new mechanics that make it stand out beyond the previous titles. This includes the ability to maneuver the camera, and completely explore a level without having to transition to, or load another screen.\n\nYou will take on the role of Erik, starting during his preteen years up through his early adult life. Along the way you will meet many friends and foes, and you will engage in a few mini-games; sparring, delivering trade goods, sailing, and more. The title focuses more on having a storyline rather than presenting any facts, although pupils will learn about Aesir and Vanir gods and goddesses, along with tip-of-the-iceberg quality information about viking beliefs and customs. One aspect that is rather annoying, is that the voice overs are done in a different language; which I suppose was the developer's way of trying to add authenticity to the game, but instead it distracts from reading the dialogue more often than not.\n\nDuring your journey throughout the five chapters, there are coins and hammers to collect, as well as Chrono-Busts to perform; as in previous titles, you still have the Chrono Goggles that you can use when you see an item or person that does not belong within the time period that the game is set in. Finding these items gives you bonus facts as rewards, and for every three hammers you collect, you get another skill from the gods, however the coins do not grant anything other than achievements. If you take into account all of the collecting, the game will last around two hours; without collecting, you're looking at roughly 40 minutes of play time.\n\nAlong the way, you will also unlock several skills to use in combat, and you will have the choice between two skills each time. The combat in the game is very simple, but there is one battle during chapter three that is so difficult that the developer even said he did not complete it... which makes me wonder why, if the creator of the game cannot even beat it, is it even present within a title intended for children. Winning or failing the battle makes no difference in the long run, but it's still a major pain for any achievement hunter.\n\nFor the most part, Playing History: Vikings is a fun little game, and it plays far better than either of its predecessors. The aforementioned battle, and the silly sailing mini-games, are the only real frustrating points of the gameplay. While the developer claims that the target audience is intended for 8-14 year olds, I would say that due to the complexity of the game, it's better suited for 10-14 year olds. Younger children may find themselves frustrated with the sparring and sailing mini-games. For the price and the content within, it's not a bad game at all, although the game is sorely lacking any music or soundtrack.\n\nRating: 3.5/5.0 - Average, can take it or leave it.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","March 22","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
