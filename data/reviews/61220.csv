Very linear though, get pushed down the 'tunnel' but the older havok effects are still nice. Basically get 3 weapons throughout the game. Assault Rifle, Sniper Rifle and RPG. Just point and shoot with no fancy bullet drop and such of course. Controls are a bit backwards but remapable (press e to use ironsight) Voice acting is acceptable.\nNow to the main problem. The length.. This game lasted all of about 40minutes on hard. I'm really quite shocked. :)\n\nWould I recommend it? Not really, no.

Visually it's a mixed bag... as I thought the weapon models were okay and some of the texture work passable... but the character models are simply bad. The level design is bland, the interaction near non existent. The voice over is HORRENDOUS! The music is equally just garbage. The A.I doesn't even look at you while shooting, cant' figure out how to move around a car and is more or less cannon fodder for the very short time that this game lasts.\n\nWhich won't be long... and if you ran through it, it'd last even less. The cut scenes are badly drawn 2D images accompanied by the horrible voice acting and a story that more or less has a group of militia make their way through a city after being attacked by aliens. The aiming... works... but it doesn't matter as the game is brain dead. The controls are limited and in my case, for some reason, even though I was playing with a keyboard/mouse it would send rumble feedback to my connected 360 controller... without any option to turn that off.\n\nIt's lazy, poorly done, lacks any kind of polish and just serves to remind me that not every game is worth playing.","March 14, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

When they are in cut scenes and should be yelling MOVE MOVE MOVE or GO GO GO, their just talking in normal voice as if they could care less, its cheesy, then again its a cheesy movie, but sadly I think the game was trying to be serious.  Works great with the controller and once again ITS FUN!\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99","December 20, 2012","true","2.3"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

The game worked out fine on my high performing laptop. But those cut-scenes were like straight out of a comic strip. So when it transition from comic strip cut-scene to an actual graphically cut-scene, it left me scratching my head and thought of "why this" type of questions. But besides all that, it was pretty decent. It tried to be like the movie but it definitely wasn't. Only the aliens, the ufos, and LA were true to its form. The voice acting was meh. The Battle: Los Angeles movie had a better cast than this video game (no offense). All in all, wait till this game goes on sale. It's not worth the $10. I bought it for $10 because I thought it would be removed soon due to licensing issues. (Looks at Konami about their licensing issue with Saw the video game on Steam).","March 5","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
