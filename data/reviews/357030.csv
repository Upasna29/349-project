"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/357030/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Excubitor is the debut game from Tesseract Interactive and is published by Kasedo Games. For those of you who may not know, Kasedo Games is the digital first division of Kalypso Media who are famous for among other things their fantastic Tropico franchise. Among their other titles are Imperium Romanum Gold Edition, Skydrift, Crookz – The Big Heist and many more. Therefore, before I even had an opportunity to sit down and play the game I had reason to be quietly confident that I would be presented with a potentially great new indie title.\n\nAfter playing for a sufficient number of hours to experience the game and to be in a position to review prior to release I have to admit that I was not disappointed. Fans of the tower defense and bullet hell genres will rejoice when they get their opportunity to play Excubitor.  It manages to marry the combination of the two genres perfectly together to create an exciting title that is bursting at the seams with action but providing a significant chunk of strategy as well.\n\nPROS\nTight gameplay: The action is fast and furious. Players will be roaming across the map building turrets while also using their Hammerhead to destroy enemy ships. Players will need to become highly proficient at tower design and controlling their craft in order to succeed. Both are equally pivotal to your success throughout the game. Players really cannot choose to forego one over the other given the enemies have a multitude of different pathways in which to attack you and your base and everything happens simultaneously across various points of the map.\nGreat boss battles: The boss battles are some of the best that I have come across in either the tower defense or bullet hell genres. Fast action and even quicker thinking are the rule of the game here. Each boss has different strengths and weaknesses so the player will have to discover what they are as soon as possible if they are to avoid an otherwise inevitable death. Each boss had me thinking hard and sitting at the edge of my seat as I discovered methods to defeat them.\nVariety leading to increased replayability: If you thought that the only strategy occurred during the actual battles think again. There are important choices to be made between combat rounds. This includes the weapons and the modules that you choose to upgrade your ship with. Each of the 17 upgradeable weapons has strengths and weaknesses that can determine the outcome of an entire battle. As too will the choice of modules – whether you upgrade shields, armour, weapons, etc. The choice is yours but make the right ones. In game you have 9 turrets that like the weapons and modules of your ship unlock as the game progresses. There is a ton of variety in the game which allows you to try different strategies increasing the amount of replayability of the game.\nVery challenging: The game has been expertly designed to make it challenging yet extremely fair. There are four difficulty levels as well as a NewGame+ mode which as expected is even more difficult.\nSolid amount of content with room for expansion: Excubitor lends itself well to future DLC in the form of additional levels, weapons, turrets and more. The game comes packed with 4 different areas each containing a number of levels before you get to the end boss fight. Given the vast replayability on top of a good amount of content the value – content proposition gets a solid tick.\nCONS\nNot very newbie friendly: The game starts off easy enough until you reach the boss fights. Then the difficulty spike is quite significant even at the most basic difficulty level. Veterans will rejoice in this fact yet newbies will be hard pressed to progress further into the game. They may find themselves frustrated at the complexity of the boss battles.\nSound: If there is something to be disappointed about in regards to the presentation of the game then it is in the sound department. I feel I am being petty here but there is no innovation in the sound department.\nBasic UI: The user interface is a little on the basic side. I wasn’t expecting anything superlative and it gets the job done but again its nothing that we haven’t seen before. It doesn’t need to be and again I am certain that many may feel as though I am being petty.\nCONCLUSION\nIt’s very rare for me to put a significant number of hours into a game before it is released to the public. I’m not a huge fan of betas or early release games (not Early Access games that are purchasable by the general public). However, Steam credits me as having spent over 140 hours in the game as of writing. While there were periods where I was idle within the game I’ve definitely spent over a hundred hours in the game (and reset achievements twice so as to show the game off to friends as new). That speaks volumes to the amount of enjoyment that I have already received from Excubitor.\n\n\nFor similar reviews, fantastic giveaways and our stellar community reviews please visit Steamified[www.steamified.com].

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/357030/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Product received for free\n\nTarget Audience:    Experimental Players who wants something different in the tower defense/shoot em up genre (on sale)\n\nSummary:\nA little bit different in the tower defense and shoot em up genres, Excubitor is a mixed bag of gameplay. On one hand, you've got a game that does try a little bit of something different, and when it really opens up the level design with some new and interesting concepts and challenges, it really can bring the fun factor. The game has its moments of fun, where you get a new weapon to play with and you try something completely new. But it's also weighed down by some repetition, and a lack of oompf in terms of gameplay: nothing really strongly stands out in the genres in terms of mechanics in the end. And the game left with a little bit of motion sickness at times.\n\nIt's one of those games that will not make purists of the genre happy: there's little quirks here and there will all of its mechanics, and that's going to annoying some people, where the action of the shmup comes face to face with the slow strategy of tower defense. If you're a gamer that likes a game going off the beaten a path a bit, but still being in familiar territory, then this is worth a look. Otherwise, it's one of those titles that I'd wait for a sale on.\n\nVideo Review:   https://youtu.be/ue6q0NbvsKs\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nWhen the level design goes off the beaten path, it can be pretty fun, as you're dashing around, trying to juggle things before your big ship gets destroyed.\nYou'll have some fun, even in the repetition. It does have an addictive quality to it at times.\nA good collection of weapons. Upgrades do make a reasonable difference, and the upgrades do make a reasonable difference.\nDo like the strafing adding a bit of skill into the mix.\nControls seem a little bit different at first, and it does take some getting used to, but compared to other games out there, I did enjoy the challenge that it presented. But it's a hit or miss kind of option.\nThere's some nice details in the visuals. While they can clash at times, each art asset seems reasonable for what they are using here.\nNegatives:\nIt lacks oompf. This is in particular when attacking and hitting enemies and the sounds/effects that play, it's just doesn't have that spark.\nSometimes, it feels like the choices of turrets really doesn't matter. This has to do with the fact that you really can make up for any weaknesses of your turrets in the end.\nDifficulty on normal seems a little low. If you're a veteran of either genre, play on hard.\nReally needed some better sound design. Turning off the sound, and I really didn't feel any gameplay differences.\nDying needed consequences. It does take a while to spawn, but it didn't cause that many problems.\nThis may be unique to me, so keep that in mind. But while playing, the 360 movement plus the visuals ended up making me a little bit motion sick.","May 26","true","7.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","4"

Using your ship to fly around the map you'll be abe to fight off incoming waves of enemy ships using deployable turrets. During missions you'll also need to protect a ship called Antares. If this ship is destroyed it's game over.\n\nThe game features 17 weapons in total and each of them has 3 upgrades for you to purchase in the armory. There are also a wide range of turrets available for you to construct as well. There are also points on the map that you'll be able to interact with that will often aid you in the game as well. These include factories that will mine resources, fans that will destroy any incoming enemies and many others to discover.\n\nThe game's control felt very fluid and the game was equally action packed. The game is also quite beautiful to look at as well.\n\nI imagine the game won't be for everyone but it's definitely a fun (and challenging) game that will no doubt please fans of bullet hell games and tower defense games.\n\nWe decided to give the game 3.6 stars out of 5 in our review and since we liked the game we'll be giving it a recommendation here on Steam as well.\n\nWe also recorded a gameplay video which you can find below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLtCnSuK1O0","May 26","true","2.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"
