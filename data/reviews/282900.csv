Yes I play Japanese videogames, yes I watch a little Annie May, and hell I even listen to Hatsune Miku. However, I'll be deep-fried in damnation before I tolerate uguu moeblobs crying over baka oniichan and the lack of senpai-noticing. That's not what this game is about though. The art might give you that impression, and there is some fan-service, but I dare say the best qualities about HN are the characters and writing.\n\nHN is broken up into 8 chapters. Typically there's plot, then shopping, more dialogue, random people handing you "plans", dungeons (both forced & optional), and then more plot. It's a standard setup and if you know what you're doing and/or skipping dialogue this game can be quite short. I wouldn't recommend it though, because the actual game portions aren't the greatest. From what I've read, this edition of HN is a massive improvement over the original in terms of exploration and combat. This must mean the first version was really dire.\n\nGetting around is handled via a map-screen, with dungeons representing the only "on-foot" portions. While the dungeons include various niceties like no random encounters, the lay-outs tend to repeat quite often. We're talking the exact same lay-out, and the enemies that populate them tend to be the same creatures you already fought, except stronger. There's no other way to say it, the dungeons in this game are weak. At least they're short, and they aren't bogged down by elevators, lots of stairs, and mind-numbing puzzles.\n\nThe combat fares a bit better. It's turn-based and over-time you develop combos. There are three types: rush for building EXE meter (super moves), power for straight damage, and break for taking down shields. There are a variety of other skills like healing, buffs, and so on. The roster of playable characters eventually blossoms to over a dozen as well. It sounds like a lot to take in, but for the most part this is not a difficult RPG. There's very little strategy aside from "use a lot of super moves" and the ever-important "heal when you're low on HP". If you're getting slapped to heck and back, it's probably because your level isn't high enough. Late-game grinding isn't really a hassle either. A lot of optional super-enemies drop enough exp to level multiple times in a single battle. I suppose the level of difficulty can vary greatly, depending on how much leveling you do. Some players might find more entertainment in avoiding optional fights, so that every regular encounter is hard-fought. Eventually though you're going to become OP, you can't resist it.\n\nMost of the grind in this game is in finding all of the materials. Those plans I mentioned earlier add things to the game. New equipment, new abilities, more dungeons, and so on. They require materials stripped from the cold dead flesh of the monsters that you kill. This is best tackled with a guide. The in-game "Nepedia" is nice, but it pales in comparison to a guide from good ol' gamefaqs and the always handy CTRL-F.\n\nMaterials (along with corpses) can also be turned in for quest rewards (if applicable). Quests are interesting in that completing them can raise & lower shares. The gals of HN are always talking about shares and their importance in the console war. This never really becomes a factor until 1) the ending and 2) the acquisition of hidden characters. It's something to keep in mind. I guess I should mention that aside from the ridiculous "millionaire" achievement, HNR;B1 isn't bad if you're a completionist. Doing everything (aside from some DLC) in the game took me less than 30 hours. I have played through the Vita game as well. That first play-through took about 30-35. If you don't skip cut-scenes, the length is more than reasonable.\n\nNotice the lack of character discussion in this review. Yeah, I'm not going to spoil the best aspect of the game. The cast of Neptunia is great, and the voice-acting (both ENG & JPN) is very well-done. I mean okay yeah, it's cute girls, some of whom transform into something exceptionally form-fitting, but the dialogue is rarely dull. Aside from a couple (expected) interactions, the cast doesn't get too hung up on the standard Annie May tropes either. Call me shallow, but I also got a kick out of all of the videogame references.\n\nThe most amusing one to me is Neptunia herself. The other goddesses are Leanbox, Lastation, and Lowee. Since the plot of this game involves a console war, you can guess what those names refer to. So what's the deal with Neptunia? Back in the mid 90s, Sega was planning a console that combined the Genesis & the 32X. It was called Neptune. Honestly, I can't think of a better system that represents Nep-Nep, she is quite a random character.\n\nSo yeah, I recommend HNR;B1. As far as J-RPGs go it's not particularly great, but it has so much charm I can overlook its faults. Also, it's appropriately-paced and the port isn't too bad (although I had to switch to XP compatibility due to constant after-battle crashes). Don't write this game off simply because you visited the community hub and saw a few questionable images.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 2, 2015","true","33.2"," 724 of 818 people (89%) found this review helpful 187 people found this review funny","89","724","818","187","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wuv_u/recommended/282900/","wuv_u","suu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wuv_u/","264 products in account","tl;dr: An extremely basic and grindy RPG with cute characters, funny dialogue, impressive English dub, and a pretty depth lore. Give this one a go if you're very patient and have a few days to burn.\n\nGameplay: The Gameplay is a turn-based system where you and your enemies take turns beating each other up and magical or physical attacks, sometimes both at the same time. The higher your combo, the more abilities you can use. There's a shop in every city that's indentical (The shop that is) and sells gear for your Party Members. There's also plans, which are basically upgrades you can get which will change the game or different characters, but you need materials for said plans. To get plans you have to visit through dungeons and collect loot, kill enemies, and explore. There's roughly 7 or so dungeons that are all very different, but they get copy-pasted for roughly 40 or something dungeons. Same with enemies, so it can get repetitive very quickly. Some Dungeons such as the Snow-related ones are also too big and don't have enough enemies. Plus, lots of treasure can go un-noticed due to the painful amounts of white everywhere.\n\nCharacters: The characters in Neptunia are so good and likeable that there's even fans who pretend to be them, kinda odd, but kinda charming in it's own unique way. The Characters themselves are also charming, it's very silly with dialogue. You don't get to pick who you send out to talk, or the words which they say. Instead you're pretty much just watching them talk to each other, sometimes with voice to go along, other times just text. To move on to the next text box, you need to press Enter on your Keyboard. I found myself pressing Space by accident and ended up skipping tons of important dialogue, the skip is just so fast that it literally skips all of it within just 2 seconds. Kinda annoying, but it's a habbit that you can break easily.\n\nDungeons: The Dungeons are the classic turn-based RPG game, they look really pretty and large, but only a small portion is where you can play. Enemies are randomly strewn about in the dungeon, who will sometimes follow you and attempt to take you down, or you can sneak up on them and get the first-turn of combat, which is very useful against those stronger boss-like enemies. As I noted earlier, the dungeons are very limited and are copy-pasted a ton throughout the game, same with the enemies who are just retextured with different colours. The enemiy choice for some of the Dungeons make no sense. Like, a flower in a dystopia Tron-setting.\n\nEnemy Design and Item Design:\nSomething which immediately freaked the ♥♥♥♥ outta me was the enemy models. THEY ARE ODD! A giant walking Flower with an angry face, a man who is part-plane, a weird flying face that shoots out steam. Pretty bizarre stuff, but it also sort of gives the game it's own style and charm. The kind of charm where a Game-Show Host shows you different Enemies from different games and asks you which one is which. You see a Part-Man, Part-Plane and immediately you know that it's from Neptunia. The items, like weapons and costumes also look wicked cool. Classic giant Japanese weapons, can never get enough of them.\n\nI'm afraid that's really all there is to the game. It's a very simplistic game that should probably be just 10 hours long. But they manage to stretch out longer, while keeping new surprises coming towards you in terms of story and dungeons (even if those dungeons are copy-pasted, they add small changes each time).\n\n","January 28","true","46.5"," 162 of 170 people (95%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","95","162","170","13","4"

This first installment feels... shorter than the game its remaking but that may have less to do with the game and my own experence with Victory knowing exactly what to do...\n\nAs a remake it takes the entire combat system from the first game and chucks it in a bin, replacing it with the more enjoyable combat system seen in later installements.\n\nFor those not familiar the combat system usually involves a party of three(Four in later games) being placed inside a circular area - characters are able to move freely and you're encouraged to keep them spaced apart as enemies can and will hit multiple targets cluster together - and you're free to do the same. A usual array of special attacks, skills and ultimates are there to fill the standard kit - however your normal attacks are broken up into "Combos" which can be fiddled with and swapped around to your liking.\n\nNeptunia also keeps its notable game references and forth wall breaking humor. I personally enjoy the campness of the story and chracters, its what kept me with the franchise so far. Its lighthearded tone and utter refusal to take itself - or indeed anything else seriously is closer to a breath of freash air than most of the dower affairs I've seen on the release list lately.\n\nTake it as a bit of unchallening junk food - like the JRPG equivelent of Dynasty Warriors.\n\n-Port Report-\n\nThe ports is.... okay?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vladdypoon/recommended/282900/","vladdypoon","Vladimir Poontang","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vladdypoon/","121 products in account","In short:  This is a very closed world JRPG style game which features a cast of cutesy girls who  beat up monsters minding their own business to harvest XP  save their world? It’s very reference heavy and joke heavy in a large part thanks to Meme Overlord Nep. You’ll feel like a massive weeaboo and lose respect of friends and/or family but at least you’ll have fun doing it. Pick up the game if it’s on sale, it’s worth it even if to just try the style and the franchise. I will say though I have started mk2 and its combat is the same and fairly repetitive.\n\nSo where do I start with the Neptunia? It's an amusing game, that's for sure and to sum it up it's more or less references to other games the game. For starters place names are named after consoles or based off places in other games. Monsters exist that look like the enemies in space invaders or like Kyubey from the Madoka Magica anime. Items have names from the final fantasy games. Throughout dialogue there are vague references (vague for copyright reasons I would assume) to consoles, people involved with games, websites, anime, manga and I doubt anyone would pick up on all of them, it's actually pretty good. I've been told that the later games actually get a more references, memes and typical game tropes thrown into them and that is amazing.\n\nPositives   Interesting and likely to get a giggle now and again.\nCute and quirky “animu grills” doing “cute things” If that’s your style and you’re down for that.\nDid I mention the insane amount of references and jokes the game makes relating all sorts of “geeky” things?\nI feel like the word Nep could be used like the word Smurf was and that relacing any verb with the word Nep will make it an innuendo. (Just me? Okay.)\nEnglish dub is actually very, very good.\nNep-Nep sings the Final Fantasy victory fanfare on levelling up sometimes and it’s amusing.\nNep is bit of goof ball  and MEME OVERLORD  making for a funny experience.\nGood sense of humour.\nNegatives    It is a huge grind from start to finish it feels. After the first half of the game you really get tired of the grinding and need up put it down.  There are ways to speed up the grind to your desired speed however, I won’t mention it here; I’ll leave that up to you to look into.\nCringe factor is a thing. Rarely something gets said and you just go “ohhf yeah, no”\nHoly ♥♥♥♥ do I feel like a massive weeaboo playing this game sometimes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aceofcharts/recommended/282900/","aceofcharts","Ace Of Arrows","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aceofcharts/","38 products in account","My Background/Experience With This\nAt the time of this writing, I have 80 hours on record, have all the DLC, have cleared the main game, and am working on the bonus content.  I also have the vast majority of (though not all) of the achievements.\n\nDifferences from "Hyperdimension Neptunia" (Original)\nSo you see "Re;Birth1" in the name, and you wonder, "Does that mean it's a port or a remake or something?  Is it any good?"  So for those with that question, this is a ground-up total remake (not simply a port) of the original "Hyperdimension Neptunia."  This is an important point to make; it's important to note that Re;Birth1 is a different overall experience from the original game, feel-wise, in a very good way.  Here are some of the more pertinent differences:\nThe Scout System from the original game is totally gone and replaced by the Remake System.  I could launch an explanation of what both are and why the Remake system is, in my opinion, better, but you can find info on that stuff in Hyperdimension Neptunia Wiki if you want several paragraphs explaining specifically what each system does.\nThe dialogue has been improved over the original, and has more recent references.  This is a plus.\nThere was no moving around in-battle in the original, where you can in Re;Birth1.  This is also a plus, as it makes battles feel more involved and tactical, as your position becomes important.\nIn-dungeon abilities have been changed from the original to match Neptunia Victory; that is, you can now jump (in the original, you couldn't), and the Search Sphere has returned (it wasn't present in the original).  This is a plus as well.\nFrom what I've seen of the original, Re;Birth1 is significantly more open-looking and far more colorful when you're inside a dungeon.  In the original game, dungeons felt extremely claustrophobic and drab.  This, too, is a plus.So in my opinion, this is not just good, but great as a remake.\n\nLet's address all the pros and cons that aren't difference-based next.\n\nPros\nThe game is hilarious, and I love the video game references.\nAny grinding that you may discover needs done is typically minimal, as experience tends to be relatively easy to come by if you have half a brain in your head for picking a grinding location.  You won't be spending days grinding for any of the main story bosses.\nBoss fights are not ridiculously easy; they take effort and time to clear the first time you do them, which is exactly how I think boss fights should feel, so I list this as a plus.  Even once you get farther and have specials to carve huge chunks out of boss health, you still have to mind your tactics, or things could potentially go south - there is no such thing as a total pushover boss unless you're clearly overleveled.\nA relatively large cast of recruitable characters.  Naturally, nothing is quite Suikoden and its Stars, but the cast of Re;Birth1 is all lovable for their own reasons, and you won't have a shortage of people to use for the game's last leg or its bonus content.\nThe DLC characters are not "just there," they are actually fully voice-acted and have full skill-sets.\nCons\nSome of the game's bosses have HP regeneration (notably, some of the already tough ones have it).  I have never enjoyed any enemy that has inherent regen that cannot be cancelled, and unfortunately, Compile Heart seems to love doing this.  The bosses already tend to have enough HP, so why not just give them more HP instead of forcing the player to outdamage their healing?  I've had a few incidents where I could have defeated a boss through sheer force of will in a battle of attrition if they simply didn't have regen.\nMissable Plans.  Yes, you can try for them again in a New Game +, and you do have to play the game through at least a few times to get everything anyway (such as getting all of the CPU Candidates), which helps the game's replayability.  However, Plans that a player may need in order to make things should not be impossible to acquire past a certain point in the game.\nI felt that Credits (money) tend to be just below my comfort level to come by on a base level until late in the game when you can really figure out how to farm for it.  You get just enough by default that you have to really consider what you need to buy on each shopping trip.  I grant that there are a few ways to make more money at large (such as the plan for Credits Up, or making equippable CDs that have Gained Credits Up traits), so it is likely this way deliberately; still, although Neptunia remains no match for some of the more stringent games I've played in terms of making money, it still feels just a bit restrictive.\nPersonal Tilt\nI think that Neptunia is charming, engaging, humorous, and most importantly, fun to play and and difficult to put down once you pick it up.  I'm a very picky RPG player, being 32 years old and remembering the old days of flying an airship around on the world map, and few RPGs really live up to my personal standards.  Neptunia Re;Birth1 is absolutely an RPG that I enjoy playing despite its few shortcomings, or I would not be in my second playthrough grinding for the super-hard Colosseum battles, nor would I have stuck Re;Birth2 on my wishlist.\n\nBottom Line\nIf you love RPGs or anime, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is definitely something you want to play.  I highly recommend it.","August 6, 2015","true","82.8"," 68 of 72 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","68","72","2","0"

Do I review it as a PC port? Or a series I've never played before? Or as a guy who's a big fan of Disgaea and other games like this on the PS3 and generally a bit of a weeb?\nYeah, so instead I'm just gonna write about the stuff I like about Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 and was less keen on. Not all of the features of the game are in here, and the technical stuff like the porting and whatnot is almost certainly in more detail in other reviews. These are just my opinions.\n\nThings I like:\n-Good looking on PC\n-60fps\n-More polished gameplay than previous installments\n-The turn based style and combo system works well and keeps you involved\n-Grinding feels less of a slog than similar JRPGS I've played, with the quest system giving more reason and reward for it\n-Lily system can create good character combos and adds to the game quite well\n-Plan system is pretty nice\n-Great artwork\n-Excellent animation\n-Love the music (even the song on the title screen is catchy)\n-A decent roster of likeable characters, especially Nep.\n-Pretty damn funny, with a lot of densely packed humor and references\n-Fourth wall? What fourth wall?\n-Cool enemy types, from giant robots and dragons to Otakus, Mario pipes and visual novel screens\n-Iris Heart :)\n\nThings I don't like so much:\n-The game has a bad habit of occaisionally dropping steep difficulty curves on you with little warning\n-Less awkward or not, grind IS necessary\n-No real ability to see what areas or enemies outlevel you until you've dived in\n-I kinda wish there was an ability to click on an enemy and see their stats, moves and abilities like in Disgaea\n-The 4-way movement feels a little strange in 3d at first\n-KO'd party members don't get XP, which can leave some characters (healers like Compa especially) as cannon fodder if they get downed too much\n-No NISA :(\n\nAlso wanna add that what with HNRB;1 being Idea Factory's first PC port, the game has had issues with other players, including crashes and the like (I've been fine, but others have had issues). However, the devs have been listening to peoples problems and have been working pretty hard on patching the problems, and there's been a lot of support from the community on it too.\nIn addition, the DLCs are pretty well priced in my opinion, without being game breaking but still adding to gameplay. In addition, the promotional offer when the game came out was a great deal and shows that these guys have the right attitude when it comes to bringing their game to a new market and new customers.\nGenerally, Idea Factory have been pretty cool with the community here on Steam and have been doing their best to earn new fans and treat them with respect. Hopefully their example could even persuade other similar devs like NIS to set up on here, but I digress.\n\nBasically, I like the game a lot. It's funny, cute, pretty decent and I really hope to see more of it on Steam.","February 10, 2015","true","52.2"," 63 of 69 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","63","69","0","0"

You'll just notice that some charaters are missing, but that doesn't matter since this is this is basically a prequel. (Except the 2 DLC characters; Plutia and Peashy.)\nSecond, this is an enhanced remake of the very first Hyperdimension Neptunia game for PS3 that utilizes the battle mechanic from Victory.\nThird, please play this game in Japanese, not some bad English dub where they don't even say Japanese honorifics. There are several segments where the English voices simply fail to play leaving you with just dungeon BGM and subtitles with no voices.\n\n-Characters - 8.5\nNeptune (Purple Heart), the CPU of Planeptune (representing the Sega Neptune), which is depicted as a modern-futuristic city, with skyscrapers and various streets. Nep-Nep is probably one the best female JRPG leads ever. Constant fourth-wall-breaking, pudding loving, happy go-getter. The main protagonist in most games She has a childish personality and lots of energy, and likes to jump headfirst into danger. However, her personality completely changes once she transforms into Purple Heart, taking on a much more serious and mature character.\n\nNoire (Black Heart), the CPU of Lastation (representing the PlayStation 3), a heavily industrialized steampunk-style city. Noire is the tsundere type character that wants to get things done. She has a very individual personality and likes to perform things by herself in her own time, yet is quite forgiving and fair. She initially has a strained relationship with Neptune, who acts as her rival.\n\nBlanc (White Heart), the CPU of Lowee (representing the Wii), a frosty, forest style city covered with white snow. She tends to get very loud and angry quite easily despite her harmless appearance. Her short temper is matched by her foul mouth, which can easily be demonstrated in almost any conversation involving her. She is flat-chested, and easily gets frustrated when reminded so.\n\nVert (Green Heart), the CPU of Leanbox (representing the Xbox 360), a very rocky and mountainous area, with green grass at the base of the mountains. Vert, in some ways could be considered the most caring of the four, due to her gentle way of speaking and/or ways of helping. She is quite intelligent, but overestimates her strength, and is less informed about Arfoire's monsters compared to the others. She displays signs of arrogance, and has a rivalry with Blanc, partly due to Vert's large breast size. She is also a closet otaku and has a huge liking for videogames. Sometimes it is hinted that she is a lesbian because of the way she acts around IF (or Nepgear in the anime) but hasn't been confirmed.\n\n-Gameplay - 7.5\nThe battle animation is very fluid and smooth being a huge step-up from the original game. As you level up a character, you unlock more powerful combos. Although some enemies may look similar to others from previous dungeons, level-wise, they are much more hardened. The tutorials may seems really annoying, but they really do help a lot, especially if you're new to turned-based JRPGs.\n\n-Story - 8/10\nIt's your pretty generic and cliche "protagonist loses something (in this case, her memory) and must get it back in order to have world peace or save the world" or something story. But in addition to that, the main characters search for four things called Key Fragments (not from World of Warcraft) to release a tome called Histoire from her seal if she has any hope in remember who she really is. For the most part, it's pretty enjoyable, the character interactions make it that much better. The 8 chapters of the game are carefully planned out, so other than the battles, there's nothing really repeated.\n\nSide Note\n-It is stated several times about the importance of Shares. Share is a term describing the amount of influence a CPU and her formed nation has over a place. The amount of share is influenced by the amount of faith and belief people has over a CPU. In addition to influence, the CPU's powers depends on the amount of acquired share. CPUs can be incapacitated if they have insufficient shares, though this is proven wrong gameplay-wise. Although in this game, that's not the case. Pretty much, all you need shares for is to get the CPU Candidates as party members.\nNepgear - Planeptune: 30% Shares for plan / 50% for being able to craft said plan.\nUni - Lastation: 30% Shares for plan / 50% for being able to craft said plan.\nRam & Rom - Lowee: 30% Shares for plan / 50% for being able to craft said plan.\nLeanbox doesn't give you anything which really sucks for Vert. :/\n\nCons\n-There is a ♥♥♥♥-ton of grinding. Sometimes it takes hours of grinding to get to a decent level where you don't get immediately thrashed by starting the next story boss. So if you don't like grinding and crafting, you could either get a trainer, or just suck it up.\n-Having 6 people in a party rather than 3 is sometimes pointless. When you're fighting a tough enemy, sometimes you can miscalculate their moves. This could probably mean a quick death for one of your front-line party members. Now if said party member dies, you're unable to swap out to the other pair (like Pokemon), thus severly handicapping the fight in your favor.\n-There is no autosave so you have to save very often. So if your 3 party members die during a fight, that's Game Over. It's complete overkill, dragging you all the way back to the main menu signifying you seriously messed up in life.\n-This is a console port so it has gamepad buttons where it should be keys (if you play on keyboard like this pleb) It will be confusing at first, but that doesn't mean this game is unplayable, just a tad bit more complicated.\n\nI can't wait for Re;Birth 2 and Re;Birth 3 for later this year.\n\nAlso Broccoli and Ran-Ran are the best.","March 18, 2015","true","34.7"," 117 of 152 people (77%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","77","117","152","17","8"

Those "reviews" are hardly a review. So let me give you my subjective unbiased and totally unfunny review of HyperD Nep Rebirth1. It's a JRPG through and through. What kept me interested and playing was the gameplay. Believe it or not.\n\nWhat are you doing in this game? You play as teenager girls having an adventure by visiting dungeons, fighting monsters while they break the 4th wall more than enuff to make fun of popculture and videogames. The game follows a simple pattern: Follow the story as visual novel, go to dungeon, fight monsters, beat a boss, continue following the story as visual novel. Repeat. What spices it up is the sheer amount of items, dungeons, monsters to craft, visit and customize. You constantly meet new interesting characters with their own style of combat, abilities, items and weapons that will join your party and help out in combat.\n\nCombat seems not very interesting at first, but the more you play, the more you progress, the more diverse characters join your party and the more weapons and items you create, the more combat opens up to you and makes you realise how complex it actually is. I couldt explain it here in a very long wall of text, but I suppose finding out yourself is what makes it fun. As a quick summary, let me just tell you that you will meet a ton of characters for your party, each with their own style of combat, skills, strengths and weaknesses. The game allows you to have 3 members in the front and 3 more in the back as well as giving you free reign over which characters you want to pair, which abilities you want them to use and more. This leads to countless combinations that will keep combat fresh and exciting.\n\nCombat too got its downsides. Status Ailments (poison, paralyze, etc) hardly get applied, element types (fire, thunder, ice, etc.) don't really make much of a difference and sooner or later you will find equipment that simply ignores guardpoints and deals heavy damage to HP anyway. (Keep in mind I haven't played the additional content that increases level cap to 999 and adds super enemies to dungeons etc. yet. If the downsides dissappear because of that I will update the review accordingly)\n\nIs this game grindy? Yes and No. Level Progression is fast and returning to previously visited dungeons isn't boring since you will be able to alter the monsters/items in each of the dungeons separately. You will find lots of new Plans for new Items  to craft constantly that makes you want to return to dungeons. You maybe reach a point in the story where you have to fight a boss that gives you a bit of a hard time, but you don't need to level up much to be able to make the odds even unlike other JRPGs.\n\nWho should buy this game? If you don't mind slight but not too extrem grinding, its for you. If you like an interesting and entertaining story with many diverse and distinct characters, its for you. If you like videogames and popculture then its for you! If you like anime? Yeah its for you! If you don't like anime but a deep and interesting comabt system, give it a try!","May 9","true","131.6"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","98","39","40","8","0"

I just want to say that this game...this is not just a game  for me. This game has a soul. The community of this game is really kind and friendly. I met so many friends thanks to this game. Really good kind friends who are always happy to help and who are really interesting, and funny to play with. This game was always with me . When I feel  bad this game made me feel better. When i was alone this game is always with me. This game helped me to forget the  painful past and healed my wounds. The jokes are sometimes perverted and sometimes just funny or jokes which break the fourth wall and the cute voices, clothes and movements when you are just farming a dungeon. All this will make a cute smile on your face :) The game is like a visual novel: it's really interesting  to read the dialog and the story is really good. Sometimes I just think what would have happened if Neptune didn't lose the divine battle and didn't lose her memory... probably then all goddesses wouldn't become good friends and evil would've probably won... The game is like a rpg: you must to farm bosses to level up because if you are not a high enough level you will not pass the main boss of any chapter. You must to grind mobs to get an item which you need for a plan to craft some cool stuff which you need. Yes for someone this is can be boring but for me this is just cool :P This game is all about plans because without them you can't continue play. Plans which unlock dungeons which add new weapons, clothes, rings etcetera to the shop. Be ready to waste a lot  of  your time to grind or find a boss,mob or hidden chest to get the item which you need for plan. You can finish game really fast if you play only for the story but if you want to get eveything and beat game to the end prepare your nerves then :P The Music is really good , sometimes i just stop in dialog to listen to the music :D I like that for some harder bosses has different music than the normal bosses. I will link some music exactly from this game but if you want more music for Neptunia check my profile.\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 OST Here you can find almost all the songs from this game! In the end i can say first of all of course i recommend  this game. Second of all i love this game <3 and if you love this game too we can become good friends! This is not just a game this is my life....\nSome challenges for me:\nComeplete eveything:reach 999 level, all achives, all ultimate weapons, all bosses and colliseum bosses, EVERYTHING!- done ✓ ✔ √","March 27","true","450.1"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","38","41","4","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Didymuss/recommended/282900/","Didymuss","Didymuss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Didymuss/","194 products in account","Overall\nAn absolutely brilliant game. I bought this on Steam release because it looked entertaining for the ~£12 it was on sale for at the time of pre-purchase, and have not regretted a single moment of it.\n\nIs it the best game ever made? Nah, not at all. We all know that is Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth and it always will be.\nBut is it a fun, enjoyable game? Definitely, easily one of the most fun games I've seen released on PC in a while.\n\nIt is a game made for people who have enjoyed games for some time (a wide array of games, really), and also those who enjoy Japanese culture, like anime and manga, and pokes alot of fun at both.\n\nFrom here on out I shall refer to the game as "Neptunia" because it's alot faster to write and I am a lazy man.\n\nNeptunia is very JRPG. If you've not played a JRPG before, you won't know what I mean, so don't let this comment worry you, just don't be expecting anything remotely western in the game, aside from the localised language, since the Japs have very much their own style of making RPGs and have many similar traits across them.\n\nDespite this, the developers have gone into the game with an air of sillyness, making a fun game without making something heavy or something trying to be more important than it is. The developers have just tried to make a fun, silly JRPG, and have succeeded in doing so.\n\nNeptunia makes light of many things from the games industry, such as how daft the very vague "console war" was that everyone pretty much forgot about a few years ago, as well as almost constant references to other games through quest descriptions, moves, character names and so on. Even my beloved Valkyrie Profile is referenced in one of the colluseum battles through rewards,  there is a Laeventeinn sword and "Pinch Revival"item.\n\nPort Quality\nIt's pretty good. My one gripe with the port is that it doesn't support any resolution past 1920*1080, which is just lazy, but this pays off in a way, since I like to stick something on to watch while I'm grinding in the background.\n\nOh, actually, I thought of something else. The volume options are tied to save files, which is completely idiotic, and as such the game is always on max volume when you boot it up.\n\nOther than these two issues the port is great. Allowing Japanese voices is brilliant, especially when the English voice actors are trash-tier and make a mess of everyone. Honestly, the Japanese voice acting is the only option, their voice actors are a god-send.\n\nApparently with the port some stuff like graphics have been upscaled for more high-def pantsu. As it stands I've not played Neptunia on the Vita so I can't comment on this.\n\nGameplay\nAll of the story elements of the game are portrayed in a Visual Novel style, that being images of each of the characters standing around talking infront of a backdrop with a textbox of what they're saying at the bottom. There is sadly only one cutscene that takes place at the start, and occasional special images shown to illustrate something important happening. Only not really since these images seem to be thrown in at random, though usually to introduce a character in some shape or form.\n\nAs aforementioned, it is a JRPG, and as such you can expecting grinding. The grinding in all fairness isn't completely necessary, though it can be quite difficult to avoid. Gaining levels naturally makes things easier and there is an alchemy system which requires item drops from enemies.\n\nThe battle system is surprisingly in-depth. It uses a turn based system very similar to that of Final Fantasy X, though not as refined, and you have to choose between three attacking moves that all do different things; Break destroys the enemy's armour bar, essentially a bar that, once depeted, means that the enemy will take more damage from all other attacks, Power, which is raw damage, and usually comes after breaking an enemy's guard and Rush, a weaker Power attack that adds more charge to the .EXE Drive. (I find that, once the .EXE Charge Plan has been made, rush is very much redundant and if Power makes the targeted enemy's HP go down more than the armour, it is faster to use power attacks).\n\nThe .EXE Drive does two things; it can be expended to use super moves, and if there are enough levels of charge, it allows you to use Combo Finishers. The Combo finisher function in the same way as the standard combo, it is just one extra move.\n\nThe major problem with the battle system is that it introduces all these concepts through help dialogue and play, but the game takes forever to actually implement them. All the different moves are gained through levels so you get the moves at estimated points in the game, but it takes far far too  long for you to get them all, leaving the battle system feeling incomplete for about 3 hours, at least.\n\nThe Alchemy System\nThis gets its own header because it is a rather large portion of the game. The alchemy, or "Plan" system, isn't too special, in its own right, but does essentially hold all access to all of the late game and non-storyline content. There are standard plans to make inbetween tiers of weapons and armour, all of these items during story I feel are sadly rather redundant, but they can look nice.\n\nSpeaking of looking nice, there's a rather large amount of outfits to find and make, so you can dress your characters however you fancy, except nude, since the Neptunia girls are all classy ladies and dress properly, even while cosplaying.\n\nYou know how I said all the end game content is held in the Plan system? Alot of the end game dungeons are missable (as of roughly chapter 6), as to get required plans for enemies for drops for future plans, one must get the dungeons as early as possible. However don't worry too much, since one can New Game+ and will more than likely need to if one wants to get everything anyway. NG+ and Google are your friends here, just be wary for spoilers if you plan on googling during playthrough 1.\n\nEverything else\nIf I've not made my point yet, Neptunia is a great game with an extensive amount of post-story content. It's really very good and I've been playing it pretty much solidly for two weeks or so.\n\nAlso, very mildly related, but it must suck being a younger sibling, living in your older sister's shadow. Especially when your older sister is Noire and is absolute perfection.","April 7, 2015","true","209.2"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","85","41","48","9","2"

Multiple times throughout the story I literally laughed out loud because of some of the written jokes in the dialogue. Seriously, don't skip over the dialogue unless you've read it already, there are some really clever jokes thrown in there. I even woke my neighbours up at 2 AM in the morning because I laughed a bit too loudly. The story itself is very well written, with lots of 4th wall breaking and jabs at clichés. As for the main plot itself, it's nothing spectacular, but the way it's executed makes it one of the best stories I've ever seen in a single player game. Period. And seeing as I got the best ending, I was more than satisfied with the story I've played and helped develop.\n\nThe CharactersAll of them have very likable personalities and character development is quite apparent. All the good-guy characters and bad-guy characters fulfill their roles quite nicely, though I feel like some of the support characters had sloppy execution and weren't exactly consistent and it felt like the writers just didn't know what to do with them. I'm specifically talking about the brothers, of course. Other than that though, I feel that the character execution (for the most part) is done rather well.\n\nThe GameplayThe gameplay is a traditional JRPG. It's also quite a grindfest too. But really, the grinds aren't that bad. The game is generous with XP, provided you're the right level and at the right territory and gives you plenty of opportunities to level up. Combat itself works insanely well, with each move being well-described as to what it does and the boss battles are pretty balanced, yet challenging. The item system is also well-done. The shop system is constantly updating with new items for your characters and the game NPCs give you "plans" to craft new items for the store to purchase, so it's basically constantly-updating. I like that! There are three issues I have with the gameplay though:\n- The tutorial screens are very confusing and do a very poor job of teaching the player how certain mechanics work. Seriously, the tutorial screens just ended up confusing me more than teaching me, and I ended up learning everything by playing the game.\n- Some areas are rehashed. Yep, while playing the game, you'll often see dungeons being copied and pasted with different monsters. A bit of lacking in the originality department.\n- By the end-game, the grinds can actually be quite menotenous and overstay their welcome, as grinding for the level enough to defeat the final boss is actually quite boring.\n\nBut the negatives I have with the gameplay are what I consider minor things and overall didn't affect my enjoyment of the game.\n\nSound DesignI don't have any comments on the music. None of the songs seem to stick out (except Vert's theme, that one is really catchy~), they all just compliment the situations and nothing else. Voice acting fits every character's personality insanely well, at least for the Japanese audio. I don't know how it is with the English audio and I am not gonna switch to it just to find out. I prefer to listen to the characters in their original voices. As for the sound effects, they're sharp, they're satisfying to listen to, especially Neptune's Cross Combo.\n\nPresentationThis game definitely isn't what I would consider "a game with the k00l GREEEFIX" because it isn't. The textures are as basic as you can get, enemy design is also some of the most basic designs I've seen, except for Arfoire, which is the only detailed enemy character in the entire game. As for the playable characters, they're the best designed characters with the most depth, obviously, which is all so pleasing to look at. For, you see - every cosmetic item you equip physically shows up on your character, be it a swimsuit or a pair of cat ears.\nThe framerate could be better though. The framerate never seems to be stable for me. Most of the time it's 60 FPS, but sometimes it starts to drop to 10 or 15 and then suddenly back to 60. I am going to guess that it's just the game's terrible optimisation with my AMD card, because that's a really common trait in games these days...\n\nBut despite the negatives, the presentation of this game is what I actually consider quite average. Nothing very...spectacular, really.\n\nFinal VerdictThis game was definitely worth the purchase.\nReally addicting gameplay coupled with likable characters and hilarious writing, this game is what I would recommend anyone to try out if they want to have a laugh and to have some fun.\nIt is a game that I stayed up all night to play not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES ALREADY! And I don't regret any second I've spent into playing this game!\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 gets a score of:8.8/10.0\nFANTASTIC! Recommended even for full price, but even more so when on a discount! No reason to pass this game up if you aren't a fan of anime or JRPGs.","June 17, 2015","true","48.6"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","32","40","0","2"

Erotic games with semi-naked hot women drawn in anime art full of either text or mediocrely bad gameplay?\n\nWell, Neptunia has somewhat similar ero content, is a mix of visual novel and turn-based jRPG with good gameplay that easily BESTS any of those games.\n\nTHIS IS THE ONE AND ONLY ‘Waifu Simulator 2015’ RIGHT HERE!!\n\nIt’s an actual GOOD game overall, starting from the beginning:\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia was a game released years ago for the PS3, it had an AWESOME concept, but poor execution. The game is about a world called Gamindustry, 4 countries, 4 goddesses, each goddess representing a gaming company. They engage wars against each other aka the Console Wars. It’s mostly a moefest (filled with cute girls) full of parody, funny references, puns and jokes.\n\nBut the original was quite boring with very long convos, unnecessary things, complex and demotivating mechanics and most of all, a terrible terrible battle system. I got tired of it after 10 hours on the PS3 because of that and the DLCfest nonsense it had. Even the framerate was bad.\n\nAnd then someone had the very good idea of remaking the original game under the name of Re;Birth for the PS Vita. And THEN someone had the BRILLIANT idea of releasing a port for the PC. And there we have it: an awesome and simplified game with an actually good battle system, good mechanics, good game design, an awesome soundtrack, and a huge cast of playable characters!\n\nSpeaking of the soundtrack… I heard the music in this game is mostly recycled from Neptunia Victory, the 3rd original game. Most likely that’s why this game doesn’t have an official soundtrack release, if anything, just a mini-album with the only new 6 only Re;Birth-exclusive songs. And I heard more things were recycled besides the music. But that’s fine to those that (like me) haven’t played Victory, and I also heard Victory has some annoying’n complex mechanics anyway (like Share balance). The soundtrack is awesome, specially if you didn’t play Victory.\n\nThis game has simple mechanics and if you miss something then, most likely you don’t really need it and you can get it on New Game + anyway, which the game encourages you to do because you get additional digital storage space needed to unlock Plans. Plans are game-changing things that enable you to unlock dungeons, items on the shop, outfits, weapons armor, make enemies stronger/weaker, etc etc, even unlocking new characters later on.\n\nAlong with the unlockable dungeons, the game has a LOT of dungeons, but they only have like 7~8 layout & landscape variations. Although this isn’t much, at least you get acquainted with a dungeon easily once you already know a certain layout, and the enemies are different though they have their variations and I’d say they vary enough.\nGrinding is required as each story dungeon that has a boss, is about 5 levels stronger than the previous one, it can be challenging if you ignore fighting a lot.\n\nYou should play this game if:\n-	You like anime\n-	You like jRPGs and want a solid experience\n-	You like hot and cute girls and don’t mind seeing 95% of the time… girls\n-	You’re a Steins;Gate fan\n-	You like Hatsune Miku’s character designs\n-	You like crafting items like in Atelier games and gather materials but with more simplicity\n\nYou should NOT play this game if:\n-	You don’t like anime and use the term ‘weaboo’ with ease\n-	jRPGs don’t appeal to you\n-	You don’t like to grind, even if just a bit (the DLC characters do help a lot in the first 5~10 hours of the game though, starting from when they join)\n-	You don’t like high-pitched voices\n-	You mind with some "artificial content" like few dungeon layout & landscape variations\n\nAll in all, it’s an awesome game.\nMight edit my review later, as also I still need to play the New Game +","February 24, 2015","true","58.5"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","24","28","2","0"

I hope I won't die of diabetes before I finish the game.\n\nFor those who are new to the series, Neptunia is rather a casual type of JRPG. The gameplay is simple and straightforward. You explore dungeon, collect items and beat up enemies for their spoils. If it's on the quest lists, you'll get reward for your hardwork. The unique part about the game is the "Plan" system. Basically, you 'synthesize' items to open up new options that allow you to adjust the game to your likings like: Gain more EXP, Change Item Drops in dungeon exploration, Open up new dungeons, Make Enemies Weaker, Make Stronger Dungeon Boss Appear and many more.\nDuring battle, you can move around within your moving range to attack your enemies or keep distance from them. Your main attacks have 3 types: Rush, Power and Break. Rush attack is about dealing as many hits as possible, but it helps you increase your EXE Drive Gauge to use for your EXE Drive type attack and your finishing combo. Power attack type speaks for itself. Break attack focus on decreasing the enemy defense gauge which reduce your attack damage while the gauge is up. Skills also available for dealing more damages or to attack multiple enemies in area. As you progresses through the story and acquired more characters, they can be paired up with one of the battling character for character coupling special effects and attacks during battle.\nStory is mainly lighthearted...because it's filled with comedies and 4th wall humors. Despite that, there are some seriousness to keep things up.\n\nHighly recommended for those who just want to play something casual and enjoyable in terms of both gameplay and story~!\nps.

This should be offered to sick patients. Buy this game if you wish to achieve enlightenment or wish for healing.\n\nAs for the actual game? It's about 45 hours long for the first playthrough, NG+ goes by a lot quicker. A significant portion of the endgame content is locked behind the DLC's, but due to the cheap cost, that isn't a problem. The plot is cute and funny, you can tell that it doesn't take itself seriously at all. The game takes the lighthearted mood and runs with it.\n\nCombat is better than most JRPGs. While you can game the system a bit with Neptune Break, the combo system allows for a lot of different attack chains, and the break system is pretty cool. Item crafting is fun, though I recommend using a guide for it to avoid frustration.\n\nOnly downside is heavily recycled assests and the horrendous English dub.\n\nOverall, it's a great experience.

Re;Birth 1 is a niche JRPG that clearly knows its audience, and the premise is extremely silly - four goddesses referencing Sega, Playstation, Xbox and Nintendo fight over a land called Gamindustri through the power of shares, and the constant video game and anime references are usually genuine and funny, although sometimes also forced and cheesy. I often found myself crumbling into laughter out of nowhere simply due to the absurdity of the overall situation I was in. Aside from its charm and humor, nothing particularly stands out about Re;Birth 1, but it's still an addicting game with decent overall mechanics.\n\nYou'll spend a fair portion of your time with the dialogue sections between the characters, all of which are fully voice acted presuming you use the Japanese voiceovers. With English however, only some scenes have voice acting and its quality is lower overall, thus I made the switch from English to Japanese about halfway through my first playthrough. You won't find anything particularly deep or engaging in this story, but it's bound to get you into a good mood with its themes and humor. The goddesses are charming with each having their own distinct traits, and some of the jokes catch you completely off guard, like one of the default equips for the Xbox referencing goddess being a ring that has a red glow to it with only three fourths lit.\n\nThe gameplay itself revolves around leveling up, gathering items and fighting various monsters in simple dungeons for easily obtainable drops to unlock items, equipment, optional dungeons and new powerful enemies as well as to modify the game mechanics. All of these actions use up points called MB, as in memory, which you can only get a limited amount of on each playthrough. However, the game has a New Game+ system that always carries over everything you've bought or unlocked except key items, letting you regain MB every time while still retaining all your unlocks. Unfortunately, many dungeons and monsters use the exact same layouts and models respectively, sometimes with slight variations, making the otherwise unique and charming game lean too much towards quantity over quality. Still as a result, the sheer amount of things to unlock and the need to gather items and drops from different places and monsters combined with the pacing of the story keeps the gameplay fairly addicting.\n\nThe battle system is turn based and relatively simple. You've got your elements, ailments, buffs and debuffs along with three types of attacks including ones that quickly build up your special meter called the EXE meter, ones that do the most damage and ones that deplete the opponent's guard meter, causing them to take more damage when its empty. You also have special moves that use dedicated points called SP, and powerful EXE drive moves that use the EXE meter mentioned earlier. You can also freely position yourself within a specific area and most of your attacks have an area of effect, being able to hit several enemies at once. At the end of the day though, you'll generally be maximizing your EXE meter build for constant EXE drive usage along with occasional buffs and debuffs, and that's about it. The combat loses a lot of its potential due to the imbalances of the system.\n\nAll in all Re;Birth 1 is an alright game. It lacks polish, and having more unique dungeon and monster designs as well as balancing out the battle system would have helped overcome that issue. Still, I can recommend this game to those RPG fans who already know they like this kind of stuff and are willing to look past these flaws, as well as people who are looking for something new and quirky since the premise of the game alone can be very refreshing.","January 21","true","58.8"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

Though it would be nice if there were more options.\nWindow mode as a max of a resolution of 1600x900. Fullscreen is basicly borderless fullscreen. Fullscreen uses native resolution (in my case 1080p).\n\nOutside of that I have not come across any other issues regarding the port performance.\nI can't really say much about keyboard mouse support since I use a controller.\nThat said the lack of a button overlay when in events was quite confusing at the start (skip button, backlog and stop) and was a bit of a try buttons out with what their function is.\n\nIn my honest opinion IF did a far better job porting their game than Square Enix did with FF13.\nFF13 may not have had crashing issues but FF13-2 did after selecting a timeline in the historia crux.\nSide note to that: At least the ingame menu doesn't lag on neptunia.\nRounding this up: IF is in the right direction with their port of neptunia rebirth 1 and i am looking forward to rebirth 2.\n\nNow onward to the game itself.\n\nStory (generally summorised)\nThe game takes place in the world of Gamindustry where 4 goddesses each with their own respective country fight over rulership of Gamindustry. Our main female protagonist Neptune is one of those 4 goddesses and basicly got chosen to be the scape goat of the four by a mysterious figure in the background which made the other 3 goddesses gang up on neptune. Neptune falls down from the sky and lands right on Planeptune (basicly the country she represents) and loses her memories.\n\nCurrently as i am writing this review, i am in chapter 2 of the game and the story so far is basicly to my liking.\n\nCombat\nNot sure if the whole combat mechanics are original the closest thing i can compare it to is probably valkyrie profile (not confused with chronicles). But basicly its to my liking and it doesn't really get boring fast.\n\nExploration\nThe game is for the most part lineair regarding exploring. The dungeons are short at the start (which isn't bad because it gives the story a nice pace) but they do get longer as the game progresses further.\nThere isn't really an open world that u explore, you basicly get dungeons handed to you by the story and select that through the overworld (the overworld is pretty much Gamindustry as a whole).\n\nGameplay\nThe game is for the most part a mix of a visual novel and JRPG/strategy game.\n\nGraphics\n2D design of the characters are nice and unique in my opinion and thanks to live2D they become even more alive onscreen during the visual novel story parts. In dungeons the characters are all in 3D and look great.\nThe only less detailed part of the game is the textures of the dungeons, they aren't bad but can't say its amazing.\nBeyond that characters and enemies alike both look great.\n\nDLC\nAre the DLC worth it? Well the only DLC i bought were the extra characters because... why the hell not.\nI'm not sure what the additional content really entails since all of them have the same description.\nDo note that the extra characters are kind of powerfull.... It's better to use them as a backup rather than main party members.\n\nDiffeculty\nIn my opinion the diffeculty is set right. Not too diffeculty but also not too easy and with the planning system you can decide if to add tougher monsters in dungeons or even buff the monsters that u previously already defeated.\nThis game does entails some grinding but there probably will be an experience booster plan in later chapters?\n\nMusic\nI like it, don't mind the repetition in certain area's. Battle music is nice and i believe there are 4 different tracks for that? Not sure.\n\nVoice Acting\nDone nicely (using Japanese dub myself). nuff said.\n\ntl;dr\nThe game is great and optimisation is done properly.\nIt's a like it or don't like it game which can be very risky.\nThe game has dirty jokes and a lot of references and 4th wall comments.\nIF did a great job porting this and i really hope it only gets better.\nLooking forward to Re;birth 2.","January 31, 2015","true","57.1"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","2"

There's a world map from where you can travel to dungeons in which you run around as your designated party leader to explore, fight monsters, find items, and progress the story.\n\n- Technical Stuff -\nThe recommended PC specs to run the game sound a bit misleading to me. It's a PC port of a PS Vita game. I think anyone with a decent Toastmaster 3000 MkII can run the game fine.\n\nOn my rig, the game runs at a silky smooth 60fps, probably more if I had a better computer screen.\n\nThe video settings are only Resolution and Fullscreen Mode.\nThe game says that the max resolution is 1600x900, but that's pretty misleading.\nRunning fullscreen actually runs the game in Fullscreen Windowed mode, and if anyone actually pays attention to their game settings that means that the game is running at the native screen resolution.\nFor me that means 1920x1080.\nRunning around in a dungeon, I can clearly tell that the 3D models (which I must say look really nice in this port) and pretty much the rest of the game is being rendered in 1080p.\n\nThe only thing I can tell as far as I can see that is affected by the resolution options is the character portraits used during conversations, which move via hybrid animations to make them seem more alive.\n\nGiven the lack of video settings, unless you know how to use your GPU's control panel to force video settings, your game will either run perfectly or your hardware's outdated.\n\n- TL;DR/Verdict -\nBUY THIS GAME THERE ARE CUTE ANIME GIRLS","January 29, 2015","true","1.5"," 37 of 55 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","37","55","6","2"

The dialogue, especially Neptune's is funny. It literally makes me laugh out loud at times. The theme is awesome. When you put yourself into the frame of mind that this is a game world, things make a lot more sense and it really fits together. Being able to craft plans to adjust things in the world really works in that it fits with the theme of the game. If you want to increase the difficulty, decrease the difficulty, have alternate items drop in dungeons, it's done by crafting.  I really like the disc development where you can customize based upon what chips are added to the disc. Chips are drops in the world that when added to the disc (level requirements and type) will impact the character.\n\nThe combat is okay for what it is. I do like the transformation option to shift into the stronger CPU form. I'm not a fan of all of the monster graphics... some of them do look sort of lame. But they are computer / game themed so I can deal with it.\n\nThe one dislike I have about the game are some of the voices during the battle. They sound "childish" with things like "ouchy" in a little kid's voice. I think Plutia's is the worst during battle... "what should I do?" Makes her sound helpless. I wish they were more like IF's "who wants to get beaten first?!".\n\nI'm sure there's more I can add, but I need to get back to Gamindustri while I have time to avoid the responsibilities of the real world.","April 12, 2015","true","53.8"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","4"

One of the few problems that new players to JRPGS or the HDN series may face are the problems with unbalanced boss fights or the typical road block boss fights, needless to say - don't get discouraged if your losing to a boss, most of the time its a matter of changing around your items or preventing certain status changes like paralyse which could be the key to winning.\n\nFor the most part, fans of any Jrpg series will find the rpg and battle system fun and challenging, however a few points could have been improved during development such as long portions of story, followed by multiple boss fights without a chance to save is problem.  Also during the game several issues could appear which initiate scripted events which could cause 'game overs' far too easy, such as unlocking the coliseum which starts an unavoidable boss battle in Planeptune which is considerably difficult if unlocked too early in the game.\n\nOverall","February 1, 2015","true","56.5"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","24","32","0","1"

Following this idea, Re;Birth1 is filled with meta, fourth wall-breaking humor, and a good bit of charming self-awareness. Pretty much every character and party member you encounter along the way fits into some sort of anime or gaming archetype — Neptune, who represents the fourth (imaginary) console, is the high-energy, childlike protagonist, while Iffy is a smart tsundere who can get quite flustered at times — and Re;Birth1 actually does a good job of balancing character versus caricature. That's about where "good balance" ends, however.\n\nOne cheeky addition along the same self-aware vein is the “remake” system, which changes aspects of dungeons like enemy difficulty and the types of items that appear. It’s good in theory (insofar as it’s self-deprecating), but in practice, it’s not all that fun to go through old dungeons again just to get new items. I didn’t think grinding was at all necessary, either, so “remaking” a dungeon to increase the challenge didn’t make a whole lot of sense.\n\nGrinding is made unnecessary, by the way, due to the relative ease of combat. It’s of the basic turn-based, open-movement variety, and I found it functional, yet underwhelming. The only strategy I really needed was to have my healer heal between attacks and kind of brute force my way through things, though a few harder fights were more satisfying. A partnering system that allows one party member to loan her battle perks to another while staying out of harm’s way adds another dimension to battle, but it’s not really necessary, and ultimately, it just made battles easier, not more exciting.\n\nThe story and dialogue both suffer from the same identity problems that permeate every other aspect of Re;Birth1, being simultaneously irritating and endearing at times. If a monster was clearly too hard for the area, I realized it before the characters sassily pointed it out, and I don’t need a dozen mentions of the word “tsundere” to realize which characters fit the archetype. Again, the ideas were there, but they were either too shallow or too frequent, rendering them moot. But I also found it adorable and loved playing as a group of dorky girls, at least for a while.","April 15","true","56.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/laurentious/recommended/282900/","laurentious","Laurentious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/laurentious/","78 products in account","So this game is basically an adventure comedy game that is a parody of the real life console war, it’s full of jokes, puns and a whole lot and I mean A LOT of references of things ranging from games, movies, comics/manga and popular cultures (mostly Japanese culture though). Personally the thing that kinda bothered me with this game is the amount of anime fanservice (boobs) they shove into your face, if they did a little less of it I might recommend this to non-anime peoples unless you tolerate those things like I do. While the story isn’t exactly great but the comedy aspect of the game is what the game is best at.\nPros:\nHilarious jokes and they actually keep creating new ones instead of recycling jokes which is one of the things I enjoy the most in this game\nReally good turn based combat system, at first it’s started as a simple system but it gets tougher and you have a lot of strategizing to do as you progress in the game\nThe lily system adds more depth to the combat system as it can help boost up your characters depending on whom they are partnered with\nThe plan system is really useful and can help you create things that you previously can’t buy in a shop and make them available for purchase in the shop. You can even make the monster easier or harder depending on your preferences with it\nThe soundtrack in this game is awesome\n\nCons:\nThe port feels kinda bad imo, the prompts are in controller mode so I was really confused as what button to press and I have to ditch trying to play with the keyboard and mouse completely but it’s not exactly impossible to do if you try hard enough. (Although I got to say it ran really good though, no hitching or whatsoever)\nEng dub is severely lacking, basically it’s fully voice acted from the start until the first boss then after that it’s complete silence. There are parts after that that are still voice acted but it’s so little, maybe this won’t bother most of you but some people like me prefer to hear English VA\nThere’s a lot of backtracking involved because you need to gather things only some dungeons have and those things you need can really help you in a battle from creating a plan, not to mention some dungeons are connected in a chain kind of way where you can only get an item from a certain dungeon 1 and that item can help unlock dungeon 2 where you might get plans/items to unlock dungeon 3 from dungeon 2 (Dungeonception in short).\nSomehow money in this game is very little and you have to constantly work on side quests in order to get them\nA lot of the areas are recycled, a few of them are just extended but they are basically identical. To people who want to see new environment and not the same looking area over and over again you will not like it\nBE WARNED the game is currently buggy to some people, I’m just one of the few lucky people who didn’t encounter a single bug in the game. If you don’t want to risk buying a broken game I suggest waiting a few more months until they patched up the bugs\nEdit: Seems like they patched out all the major bugs already, good job IF ;)\n\nSide note: This game also taught me that pudding is one helluva of a drug","February 18, 2015","true","88.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","19","24","3","3"

It's a very kawaii-desu game not to be taken seriously because the entire game almost feels like a parody, which isn't a bad thing. The voice acting is very well done, and you can switch between English and Japanese at any time. You will not go 10 minutes without one of the characters breaking the forth wall. The story is based on some war going on since the beginning of time called "The Console War." I know Blanc is supposed to represent Nintendo, Noire is representing Sony, and Vert resembles Microsoft. I am not sure who Neptune represents, however, probably the Game.Com. Anyway, they fight to keep the Gamindustry peaceful or something. The gameplay however, runs great in upscaled 1080p but only supports 8 directions if you are using a controller, unlike the Vita version. It is similar to Final Fantasy where you touch a blob and go into battle with 3 different monsters. You are able to walk around in battle, and use a variety of attacks, but it is still turn-based. When a character is killed, they will usually say something very funny like "I'm still single!" or "I'll be back!" Pure Genius.\n\nVery Fan Service-y Game!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumflufftornado/recommended/282900/","bumflufftornado","bumflufftornado","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumflufftornado/","766 products in account","A summary of pros and cons for this game can be found at the end of my review.\n\nRe;Birth1 was first released for the Playstation Vita as an upgraded remake of the original PS3 Hyperdimension Neptunia game. This version stands very well on its own for players who are not familiar with previous entries in the series, and contains enough improvements to be a worthwhile experience for those who have already played the previous games. Idea Factory have also added in trading cards and included achievements to sweeten the deal.\n\nThe story of Re;Birth1 is set in the world of Gamindustri in which four goddesses fight over control in the Console wars. You play primarily as a goddess named Neptune who has fallen from the sky and lost her memory. Together with new friends you depart on a quest to figure out who you are. The story is filled with humour and references to other popular games, yet never felt forced or cringe worthy. Spoken dialogue is available in both Japanese and English although subtitles for the Japanese were not appearing during combat. I found the English dub to be very serviceable (minus a few odd choices) and I especially loved Compa’s voice.\n\nThe game consists of an overworld map and dungeons. As the player progresses more dungeons are unlocked through the story and crafting mode. Additionally, the crafting mode allows the player to add in new game rules, such as easier battles and more experience, as well as crafting new items, weapons and a large amount of outfits. My main criticism with the game is the repetitiveness of the dungeons. Many levels look the same and have to be run through multiple times to grind out items. A little more imagination with the locations would have gone a long way; however it is worth noting that this did not hinder enjoyment of the game too much.\n\nThe battle system is notable for it’s a combination of turn based combat combined with free roaming. Each turn characters have an area in which they can freely position themselves before attacking, increasing the level of strategy for each fight. Characters can be equipped with a number of different attack styles and special skills based on player preference as well as the combinations of characters you send in to battle. It is also worth mentioning that the game functions a lot better with a controller as selecting options in battle with keyboard and mouse can get a bit fiddly at times.\n\nOverall this is a game I would fully recommend to fans of JRPGs or anime who are looking for a game that funny and light hearted while still dipping its toes into serious RPG territory.\n\nPros: Great story filled with humour and game references, loveable characters, options for Japanese or English dubs (the English dub is actually quite good for the most part), a fun and engaging combat system, cheap DLC that actually adds useful characters, controller support, trading cards and backgrounds, achievements.\n\nCons: Repetitive level designs, requires a reasonable amount of grinding for items and levels, some fights are very challenging without DLC characters or the aforementioned grinding.","April 7, 2015","true","57.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

The story and character interactions seemed somewhat reminiscent of the Disgaea series.   As I’m a rather large fan that series I was sure that the story would keep me going through the game. But that wouldn’t be enough to make me recommend it to friends.\n\nThat first night I put about two hours into the game advancing the story and figuring out the basics of the combat.  The second night I played about four hours and advanced the story. The third night I started doing the mini-quests and messing around with the dangerous enemies in dungeons.  I had about twelve hours in the game at that point I had just finished chapter three and started chapter four.\n\nI’m now thirty hours in and just started chapter five. The story seems to be a little short but the amount of side content is huge.   At this point, I’m very happy with the battle system and still find enemies in the side areas to reasonably difficult however the enemies in the story line dungeons have been trivialized due to my doing side goals for so long that I’ve wound up severely over the level the dungeons are designed for.\n\nThe odd part it I didn’t find myself to be grinding the whole time I was collecting drops from gather spots or enemies for items or weapons.  The few times I wasn’t doing that I was trying to do the dangerous monsters to challenge myself.\n\nThe Combat in the game is designed really well preventing you from face rolling through enemies unless you’ve really leveled up.  The combat uses a three attack type system divided by break, power, and rush.  Enemies have a guard bar and a health bar while the guard bar is intact they take reduced damage from all sources.  This is where break attacks come in they do minor damage to health in exchange for dealing high damage to the guard bar.  Power attacks are the opposite they do a great deal of damage to the hp but almost no damage to guard. The rush attacks focus on building the EXE gauge which deals with finishes and large damage super attacks.\n\nThe game is absolutely a blast for me and I wish that I had heard of the Neptunia series sooner.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that is interested in it.  It also has plenty of references.  “Go Ancient Dragon, I choose you!”\n\nTl;dr The game is a blast but it’s easy too get lost in side content and make the story content to easy.  Totally recommend this game for anyone that enjoys comedic story’s like Disgaea or games with some depth to the combat system.","February 7, 2015","true","63.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/recommended/282900/","vallinek","Vallinek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/","82 products in account","Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a remake of a 2010 RPG game released on the PS3. Originally a PS Vita game, it was later ported to the PC and released on Steam.\n\nThe game is a rather unusual take on the so-called "Console Wars" where the consoles are represented by their Moe Anthropomorphisms - Goddesses of four lands: Planeptune, Lastation, Leanbox and Lowee. Fighting each other in Celestia, three of the Goddesses decide to gang up on Purple Heart, knocking her off and causing her to fall down to Planeptune. There is found by a young nurse named Compa who takes care of her injuries, as well as turning out that she lost her memory. Then they are contacted by a magical sealed tome called Histoire who sends them on a quest to find the Key Fragments neccessary to free Histoire, as well as unite all the four goddesses to fight together against a bigger threat.\n\nThe gameplay is basically your typical turn-based jRPG with minor tactical elements. Your characters and enemies take turns performing attacks, using abilities or items. It's rather simple to get a grasp if you played any other turn-based RPG. Outside of dungeon exploring and fighting, you can use shops, view the gallery, accept and complete quests, or use special "Plans" to add or modify existing content in the game. The difficulty feels just right - it's not as hard as old-school jRPGs, but also not easy enough that you will be bored (unless you specifically overlevel your characters for the upcoming fights). The game even hands you certain Plans that make the enemies tougher or easier, so there's always some way of tuning the difficulty a bit if you want a challenge or - the opposite - want to focus on the story. Majority of the content is grind-based, however, so if you care about exploring everything, you'll have to level up your characters quite a lot.\n\nThe story is quite engaging, with you traveling and exploring different lands, trying to stop the main villain from realizing her plans, interspersed with constant humor and jokes about either the characters themselves, whatever gaming cliches may appear, or just plainly ignoring the fourth wall for the sake of fun. All of the characters represent either a console or a game company, and they're a very likeable bunch. Of course, it's full of fanservice in one way or another, but what would you expect from a game that creates Moe Anthropomorphisms of game consoles?\n\nThe graphics are good. You might notice blurred textures here and there, but it's nothing big, and it's pretty to look at. The only reason you might not like it is if you don't like anime style.\n\nIn the sound department, we get mostly electronic music or rock, with quite a lot memorable or downright awesome themes. It's definitely worth listening to even outside the game.\n\nAs far as the DLC goes, it's kind of a mixed bag. DLC characters like Plutia and Peashy join early, when your party is rather small, and provide a lot of additional firepower that makes the early game a little easier than normal. The "additional content" DLC, when all of them are purchased, introduces a lot of new dungeons and Colliseum battles, while extending the level cap from 99 to whopping 999. But, as you can guess, all of this content is purely grind-based, so if the only thing you care about is the story and not watching your characters grow stronger, I would suggest against buying this DLC.\n\nThe game also pretty much requires New Game+ in order to unlock everything, since one playthrough does not yield enough MB (Megami Bytes) to craft every Plan you can get.\n\nOverall, this is a great game, featuring adorable, likeable characters, nice graphics, great music, interesting storyline, as well as lots of humor and content. I heavily recommend it to anyone who likes jRPGs that don't take themselves too seriously or cutesy games.","July 20, 2015","true","74.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/recommended/282900/","SkyeF","Flutter Skye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/","413 products in account","When I saw this game the first time in the store, I was like "Oh, another pure fan-service game" But for some reason I really wanted it, I just had an inch that this game will be great, and soon a friend gifted it to me along with all the DLC, and I was right. The game is just amazing.\nFirst of all, the game manages to defeat a problem a lot of RPG's have - Being repetive and boring.\nThis game includes a remake system, allowing you to customize pretty much everything using plans. Want to have different enemies appear in Avenir Factory? Find the plan in one of the stages, obtain the required items, and activate the plan; you just got tougher and different enemies in that place~! Feel like the game is too easy? Get the plan to weaken the enemies, obtain the items, and activate it~ now the game is easier! There's a lot more to this too, but there's too much to write it all. Getting and activating the plans is a lot of fun.\nSo here's the main way of attacking, when you press "Attack" during a battle, you have 3 commands:\nRush - Doesn't deal a lot of damage, but fills the EXE Gauge a lot faster. If you have filled the EXE gauge by at least 1, you can unleash addition EXE attacks, which you can fully customize to what they do. The EXE Gauge also allows you to use special moves called "EXE Drive" they deal a lot of damage, and also have a really neat attacking animations.\nPower - This type of attack deals the most damage.\nBreak - These attacks are best used in order to lower the Enemy's Defense. The lower their defense is, the easier it is to defeat it And if you break the defense completely, they will be really weak and can be very easily defeated.\nEvery characters turn, you can attack up to 4 times. The first attack is always pre-determined by the character, however.\nAll three types of attacking are fully customizable. Want the 2nd Power Attack have a chance of inflicting poison, and the 3rd Break attack have a chance of freezing the enemy? You can definitely do that~! As you progress further in the game, you unlock more moves for your attacks to customize, making the battles a lot different.\nIn other words, the battle system is pretty original, and really fun to play with. You won't feel bored during them.\nNow for the artwork and models~ The artwork is drawn pretty nicely and looks beautiful. The Models for the game are also very good, and have a nice Anime'ish look on them. The animations for all of the things (Walking, EXE drive, jumping, etc.) Are pretty nice and varying too.\nNow for the voice actors for the characters~ The game developers have taken very good choices. Both Japanese and English Vocals are adorable, and perfectly fitting for the personalities and looks of characters, which is a big plus.\nThe Japanese Voices are 100% Complete, however the English ones don't seem to be. They seem to be about 70% complete, however, the remaining 30% which isn't dubbed seems to be in the less important parts of the game, so it isn't a big problem either.\nAnd now for the music~ It's just beautiful. Each lands music theme is fitting into that Land's looks. As an example, Lastation, which is full of machinery, has a energetic theme which sounds like it has machinery inside it. It's hard to explain it, but I can guarantee that it sounds great.\n\nAnd now for the characters~ They're all different, and have great personalities. Almost all of them show character development. A lot of them seem to be pure fan-service (Especially the CPU Forms) but that's kind of the charm. Most of their personas change when they enter they CPU form, causing pretty funny and great (and creepy in the case of a certain character..) conversations.\n\nAnd the final part~ the story. It's really neat, it might seem to be boring at first, but in reality, it's really good. Even though, this game is basically a mockery of the Gamindustry- I mean,  Gaming Industry, it still manages to give it a unique story and charm, I didn't get from games in a long time. The game has also two endings, which is pretty great, as it gives variety. After you beat Story Mode, you can start New Game+, allowing you to use all of your levels from characters/money/items and start Story Mode all over again. NG+ is best to obtain the CPU Candicates, and just have lots of fun~! And if you're a completionist like me, 100% the game.\n\nThe game has a lot of references to other games/Companies, and most of the side characters have names after them, Like Marvy (Marvelous AQL) Iffy (Idea Factory) Compa (Compile Heart) and so on. And the Fan-Service is basically a joke about how a lot of people think that Anime is basically all about breast size and so on.\n\nIn other words, this games makes a lot of funny jokes, mocks the gaming industry in a funny, subtle way, has a great story, amazing music and vocals, radical battle system, makes a lot of references to various games/anime, and lots of replayibility and fun.\n\nI've spend 84 hours at the moment of writing this review, and I plan to spend a lot more, as this game is really addicting and good. And I think it has became my new favorite game.\n\nI'd definitely recommend getting it, especially if you like jokes and/or Anime. You will love it.\n","August 26, 2015","true","136.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

L-Stick, R-Stick, D-Pad and all the buttons and bumpers have to be rebound, which can be a royal pain in buttock. It might just be because my computer is utter wank, but I've noticed the game also seems to have some graphical hiccups at times. But as I said, my computer IS wank.\n\nOn the other hand it's Neptunia, Re;Birth1. Instead of a remake it's more akin to a full overhaul of the original, keeping the main story plots and a few features present while tossing out a few more muddled elements. Is it better than the original? Gameplay-wise I'd have to say definitely without a doubt. Story-wise and dialogue-wise is more subjective, though overall I'd have to say yes. Unfortunately due to real-life events there's no more Nippon Ichi/Nisa or Gust, so tears shall be shed there.\n\nThough we do have Broccoli now.\n\nIn the end, despite the hiccups I'd recommend getting the game. It's Neptunia, and Neptunia is the beautiful grace of the Goddesses, descended upon us feeble masses. But would I recommend it over the PS Vita version? No, the problems of the Steam release can take you out a good amount and the Vita is a better experience for that.. Plus it's portabler. However the Steam version is still more than worth your time, I'd recommend it any day as long as you don't have a crippling phobia of key-rebinding or pleasure.\n\nLADY NEPTUNE BE PRAISED, FOR SHE IS THE GREATEST.\n\n","January 29, 2015","true","144.5"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","20","31","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/myrhdin/recommended/282900/","myrhdin","Myrhdin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/myrhdin/","269 products in account","I had been looking to get some of the Hyperdimension Neptunia games on PS3 for the past few months, as I assumed such a long series meant those games were selling and had to be somehow popular. A faithful viewer from my stream actually gifted me the remake of the first game of the series on Steam, and here I am reviewing it for you.\n\nJust a little bit of background: I'm somehow versed into Japanese culture, I really dig J-RPGs, I don't mind listening to Baby Metal or Hatsune Miku, I watch a decent amount of animes and I can't wait for my next trip to Akihabara.\n\nIf you are looking for a difficult and rather serious RPG game, Re;Birth 1 is not for you. The game is good, but it has its limits. The game is all about humor and references to the video game culture/history/industry. All characters are basically a personification of whether a console, a developer, a publisher or even a single game. It's sometimes really hard to guess who is who, especially for non-initiates (I'm not sure Marvelous AQL rings a bell in many Western heads).\n\nThe localization of the game left me with a mixed feeling, somehow. I started to play the game in English, but I had to switch the voices back to Japanese very fast, as the English voices felt totally out of place. Maybe this is just due to me being so used to watch animes with the same type of art in original version with subtitles. The texts were actually accurate, with a good use of video-game references. Some sentences were not reflecting the complete Japanese text (a 30 seconds long voice-over in Japanese summed up in 5 words in English), but this is still a job well done.\n\nRegarding the game itself, you should note that there will be a lot of history-related dialogues: Re;Birth 1 seems to have put a massive emphasis on story-telling, but it sometimes feels a bit over the top. I have recordings of me "playing" the game for more than 30 minutes without even pressing a button, just listening/reading dialogues between different characters. You have options to automatically scroll through dialogues or to even skip them in fast forward. I wouldn't recommend skipping on your first playthrough, but don't hesitate to do so on your NG+ run. Some figures to highlight this point: my first/blind playthrough took me between 35 and 40 hours, my NG+ run in fast forward took me less than 10 hours, including some item or boss farming... Even if NG+ is faster as all your progression from your first playthrough carries over, it's still a massive difference.\n\nRe;Birth1 is divided into 8 chapters. Most of them are divided like so: opening dialogue, event, mission, carry the mission in a dungeon, report back to the main city, new dialogue, new mission, boss fight, dialogue to introduce new area/town/dungeon, new chapter. If you are looking for an open-world game which is not a corridor simulator, you might want to look elsewhere, as this game only offers you the possibility to travel through an overhead map, totally static. The areas you get to explore feel really dull: I unlocked 36 dungeons over the course of the game and I think I didn't see more than 7 different area settings. Most of the time, the new dungeon you explore is going to be a copy of a previous setting, with a different spawn point, a different layout with sometimes an extra level, and a different set of monsters.\n\nYou'll be most of the time exploring a dungeon to gather items from its fauna, which is a core element of Hyperdimension Neptunia: Re;Birth1's gameplay. The storyline will tell you to explore a bunch of areas, but those are just the tip of the iceberg, as you can unlock many other dungeons through crafting, which requires items gathered while hunting down monsters. In your adventures, you will be unlocking plans, which will allow you to craft new items, new costumes, new armors, new weapons and, somehow, new dungeons. For each dungeon, you will also get the possibility to unlock extra options, like adding more enemies or turning them into super enemies. Who says new enemies means new items, which will help you to craft new recipes. This idea, which might sound extremely silly to many Westerners, is actually like paradise for players used to grind their way through J-RPGs or completionists. You have hundreds of items to create, hundreds of recipes to craft and some of them are extremely tricky, especially the ones connected to the game's DLC.\n\nItems have a massive impact on the gameplay, and can turn an extremely tough fight in a walk in the park. Crafting better weapons or armors for your characters can obviously directly impact a fight, but sometimes, just unlocking a better healing potion can make a difference. As long as you didn't unlock the item through crafting, you can't buy it and the storyline won't unlock it for you. You will have to leave the story aside at times to take the time and farm up ingredients for crafting recipes.\n\nThis part of the gameplay is in my view meant to get you to overcome the difference gap between your character level and the difficulty increase in the storyline. A rule of thumb for leveling in the game is that you need to take around 5 levels between every boss you have to fight. The issue lays in the fact that the dungeons are extremely small and that you sometimes need to grind a lot waiting for the monsters to respawn to get your EXP. A good alternative is, as said, to go and explore other dungeons to maybe unlock new recipes in the mean time. It's still a grind, but you add an additional objective to your grind, which will be completed much faster and far less frustrating.\n\nThe monsters you'll be facing will, like the dungeons, look a lot a like: the bestiary is very limited and offers mostly recolorations. You'll be facing rad, blue, yellow, orange flowers. You'll slay green, red and blue Mario pipes. You'll tear apart 5 different types of visual-novel games screenshots. But each of them will drop a different item that you might need for a recipe or another. I can only recommend you to check out the guide section connected to this game to get an entire drop list and make your life a lot easier. Combats will most of the time be easy, but necessary.\n\nThe combat system itself will leave a different impression depending on the player. Some will find it boring, some others will find it extremely entertaining. I personally really enjoyed the turn-base aspect of it, even if it was sometimes hard to get a grasp of why your opponent would be allowed to get two turns in a row or why specific choices made you fall back a bit further down the "turn to attack" line. You have many options to choose from in combat: the deities can take their HDD forms and improve their statistics and their movesets, all characters can decide whether they want to use skills (heal/buff/debuff/attack/resurrection) or a string of attacks. If you decide to attack with your weapon, you'll be offered the possibility to use three moves in a row, each one can have a different impact on your target. Some skills are meant to reduce your foe's defense, others to directly target your enemies HP bar and the last one will increase your EXE gauge, which will allow you to use super attacks once you get enough energy. The animations for those skills are pretty impressive, and you can even create combination attacks between characters through the friendship system built in the game (Lily ranking). Some will try to fill up their EXE gauge as fast as they can to brainlessly spam super powerful atacks, some will play around buffs and debuffs to weaken their foes. It's all up to you, but don't hesitate to spam the HDD transformations. Because lollies.\n\nAll in all, this review can sound a little gloomy, but the game is still worth a try, it will keep you busy for a little over 60 hours if you want to go for all the achievements, it offers a lot of content (even if it's sometimes just duplicated) and you get all the fan service and references an Otaku can dream of.","May 16, 2015","true","61.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The story really just boils down to "what if game companies and consoles were anime ladies", but the writing is amusing and the little jokes and nods towards the companies (the Wii girl has incredible defenses, the Xbox wears a red ring, etc.) are a nice touch. The battle system revolves around setting up combos, choosing from weak attacks that raise a meter for powerful attacks, attacks that reduce the enemy's guard, or high HP damage above all else.\n\nThe world, art, and locations look very pretty, and the music is enjoyable, but there could stand to be more variety and many dungeons are "The dungeon from before but with an extra path and area added". The enemies are standard RPG fare, with the occasional anime joke or game parody such as Mario's pipes or Pac-Man ghosts. The game also boasts crafting recipes that allow you to add items to the shops, access new dungeons, or change the items and enemies that can be found within a dungeon.\n\nThe only real concerns with the game are the grinding and fanservice. With the former, you'll often reach a boss and find yourself suddenly outgunned, and needing to go back until you've gained a few levels, with one early boss apparently enough to send people to forums, convinced that victory is impossible. Regarding fanservice, most early introductions include cutscenes where the only animation is jiggling, and certain outfits and attacks will mean upskirt city. That said, if you're looking at this game, it's probably a selling point for you.\n\nIf you play, keep in mind that the "camera reset" button lets you skip attack animations.\n\nalso noire is best waifu honorable mention to blanc","March 8","true","67.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","1"

Of course, if you do not care about the achievements, it’s fine, but for those who do care, they have lots of works to do.\n\nI will hereby try to cover as many aspects and features as I possibly can:\n\nThis product is also called HDN re birth 1 for short, as a tactical role-playing game, players take control of 3 characters in the front line while keeping 3 others as reserves in the rear. With different combinations players can create their own strategy, when facing challenging foes or bosses this can evidently prove helpful. However, you can defeat the bosses that are powerful more easily if you just train your characters, augmenting several levels. But a strategy is still recommended as it entertains your intelligence, this is also the point of playing games with identic genres.\n\nNow let us see its in-game equipments, including weapons, items and crafts. Weapons here varies a lot, this keeps upgrading your character’s attack output in general. As to items, the system of HDN re birth 3 also keeps track on your level and gives you different items that you might need in different situations. Healing potions for instance, varies from 1000-10000 points and 30-100% of healing, these potions can be used for high level or low level characters depending on their efficiency, as far as I’m concerned, this feature is also found in other role-playing games, but since I haven’t experienced many so far, I still pointed it out. Furthermore, crafts, or plans as named in this game, are very important features, plans are your best friends, they can unlock powerful weapons, useful items in addition to many dungeon maps.\n\nAbout CGs and Soundtracks, both are well designed, although nothing extraordinary, they do make the players immerse into the game. Especially CGs, they actually did point out the funniest and important events into a more specified way.\n\nThank you for reading this review up to here, I hope that this helped you a bit, however, if you find anything interesting in any of my explanations or introductions, I suggest you to give this game a try ^^, be aware that you might get addicted very soon …… ^.^.","April 15","true","37.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hollownerox/recommended/282900/","Hollownerox","Hollownerox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hollownerox/","293 products in account","Despite what you might think just looking at the screenshots this game actually has less fanservice and anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t than you'd expect. Sure there is fanservice scenes spread throughout, but the real core of the content is the parody aspect of the game and the 4th Wall Breaking antics of the cast.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, the Hyperdimension Neptunia games are an affectionate parody of the game industry. Much of the humor is based around references that go from the obvious like Mario, to the almost ridiculously obscure like the SNES-CDROM ordeal. That's not to say that is the only source of humor, indeed much of the fun comes from the surprisingly diverse cast with each character having their own little quirks that make them stand out.\n\nAs for game mechanics, it is fairly basic turn based system, however there are some notable features that are pretty neat. The order in which each character on the battlefield fights is determined by their stats, once it is their turn the player is allowed to move a certain distance with the character (once again determined by stats, which can be changed via equipment and the usual level ups), and then the character can use a basic attack with a range that is dependent on what weapon their using. The basic attacks are split into three variations, Break, Power, and Rush; each with their own uses in a battle that is best explained in-game. Each character has a variety of skills that are usually just special attacks, healing abilitites, or buff/debuff techniques, these drain the characters SP bar once used. The characters also have access to EXE skills, which are super moves that tend to make fights much easier. The first EXE skill is obtained when a character reaches level 25, and is essential to boss battles. Note though that EXE skills can not be spammed since they use up a bar on the EXE gauge, which has a max of 4 bars and can only be filled by giving or receiving damage.\n\nAlso important to point out is that character are seperated into two seperate groups, the CPUs and the Makers. The CPUs are unique in that they have a second form in which their stats are boosted and in general just become all around better in direct combat. While the Makers have a wider variety of skills that are better in the support role, though they are still capable of dealing good amounts of damage. While most people tend to just stick with the CPUs since their HDD modes make fights easier, some battles require the skills from the Makers that the CPUs lack. Combined with the Lily Rank system and the bonuses those grant (for example the heroine's (unlockable) sister Nepgear allows the character she is paired with to deal damage pass the limit of 9999), and you have surprisingly deep party customizing options.\n\nIt should also be noted that level grinding is very much needed in this game due to boss difficulty ramping up at certain points. The grind isn't too bad, but it isn't uncommon for the idea of level grinding to turn off a few people.\n\nThe PC port is actually quite good considering it was done by a Japanese developer, basic but in no ways unplayable. The framerate is a massive improvement from the PS3 titles, and the graphics actually look like they belong in this generation of games now. Note that in the option menu the resolution states that the max is 1600x900, this is only for Windowed mode and as long as you have the game in fullscreen it should default to your monitor's resolution. If you are having issues you can try going into the program files and editing the .ini configuration file manually to set your resolution (make sure to set the file to Read Only after doing so). There are also some issues with DLC at the time of this review, but the DLC are minor additions and are not necessary to enjoy the game at all (though the addition of characters with an HDD mode like Plutia do make some sections easier).\n\n*EDIT* As of right now the resolution and DLC issues appear to be fixed (at least for me) so the previous section is irrelevant now.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are a fan of JRPG's or just a fan of Anime related products then Neptunia Rebirth is a decent addition to your steam library. The upcoming games that will be released have the same forumla with minor changes (biggest being the addition of a fourth party member during battle), but it is worth getting them for the different stories and humor alone; so those are also good purchases if you want your money's worth.","February 3, 2015","true","48.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Player292/recommended/282900/","Player292","Scyther","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Player292/","189 products in account","Oh boy, how do I write a review for this game. Let me just say I just finished collecting all the achievements and it took me about 60 hours. I'm normally not an achievement hunter, but I had to do it for this game. Let me explain:\n\nI grew up playing games like FF5-10, Chrono Cross, Legend of Legaia, Suikoden, Legend of Dragoon, Tales, Xenosaga, and etc. Those games were my childhood. Unfortunately, the golden age of JRPGs is long gone, and I do miss it.\n\nNow if those games are like a fine bottle of vintage wine, then this game is like super concentrated Red Bull. Is that a bad thing? Absolutely not. This game is fast paced, linear, and to the point. Dungeons are tiny (and recycled) compared to traditional JRPGs and everything is streamlined, but don't let these things deter you. It works for this game. Sure, the game doesn't have a deep story. It doesn't have heavy character development, and there's no exploration really. But you know what? There's no angsty protagonist whining about his repressed emotions towards a love interest either.\n\nWhat this game does have is an enjoyable and fast paced battle system (think Tales mixed with Eternal Sonata with a pinch of Star Ocean). The crafting and "remake" system reminded me of Disgaea - you can add dungeons and stronger monsters, change item drops, break the damage limit, and even raise your credit and exp gain. The 2D artwork is gorgeous and has some animations to accompany the dialogue, which I found was a nice touch. The game does not take itself seriously and neither should you. It makes fun of gamer culture while breaking the fourth wall on a regular basis. It has loads of sly references to classic JRPGs and games in general. The costume and weapon designs are also nicely detailed. And yes, there's a lot of fan service, and some, I admit, was a bit too much. Some might be turned off by the "loli" aspect of this game, but it's really not that bad.\n\nPlaying this game brought back a lot of memories for me, and maybe nostalgia was the driving force behind my achievement hunting. From the over-the-top finishing moves, to one of the characters humming the Final Fantasy fanfare after battle, the entire game is a "parody love letter" to JRPG fans.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game and I can't wait for the sequel to be ported to Steam later this year. However, for those people looking for a "deeper" and "more enriching" JRPG experince, I recommend FF7 and 8 currently on Steam.\n\nSome tips that the game doesn't explain and I had to find out "accidently" (based on using an Xbox controller):\n\n1. LB lets you skip any battle animation, including the basic combo moves. This really sped up the grinding during the later stages.\n\n2. Pressing "X" puts the current dialogue scene in fastforward mode. Press "X" to return to normal speed.\n\n3. Pressing "Y" lets you review the dialogue in case you missed something.\n\n4. Party members in reserve during battle will heal over time, and thus switching out characters when they are in low health is a viable strategy.\n\n5. Enemies take more damage in the back and the sides.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm going to return to this game and finish up the Coliseum battles. :)","February 7, 2015","true","67.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Noire look in shock "EH?...Fine..." she sigh after two hours they are all in there pjs telling scary stories vert was first telling a story about a ghost that kills goddess and eat their souls for fun "So to this day no one knows where it is or what is it but they say its coming here for us you don't you where it its it might be in here right this second" Blance just sit with a blanket covering her she turn her head to see Netunia, Uni, Noire, Nepgear, and her sister hugging each other in one group she just stares then she hear foot steps thinking its Plutia she look out into the hallway to see plutia getting carried by Hideki "Uh?"\n\nThank you ghost-minecraft, I wish I could ERP with you at least once in my life","March 8","true","22.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","3"

The gameplay is enjoyable and rewarding. It has a decent plot, with lots of loveable characters. My favorite part was all the hilarious one liners and references to other games. Even though I only have 50 hours on this game (because I'm stupid and saved at the wrong time), there are countless hours of fun. I actually enjoyed it so much, I'm probably gonna get it on my ps vita and play through it again (once I finish the other games of course).\n\nThis is no ordinary JRPG. I highly recommend it and it is by far worth the $30 (even though I payed $15).\n\nI have now picked up the second game of the series and am playing through it now.

Its not your standard RPG, and it does have quite a few funny moments, especially plays on other video games. Not as many plays like the original (Miss the scene where they run into a 'Street Fighter') but honestly, that I can go without, cause the battle system alone is easy to pick up on. Plus you can 'create' new dungeons. If you don't, you'll be stuck with just the story dungeons and you will get your butt handed to you by bosses if you don't try your hand at some of the extra dungeons (I learn this the hard way).

The humor is sometimes hit or miss, but often a hit, despite the fact that most of my otaku cultural knowledge is second-hand. The basic premise, if you don't know, is that the console war is fought not with business meetings and product sales but with anime girls who draw power from their market share.\n\nCombat is turn-based, but it's the fastest turn-based game I've ever played. Transitions from one turn to the next are completely seamless, the AI takes no time at all to line out moves, your movement is resrtricted to a radius around you rather than distance so there's no cancelling moves over and over to reposition yourself and once locked in combat, your character will attack four or more times with an assortment of thirteen pre-equipped moves you can swap from on the fly, yet you'll soon develop combinations for specific situations that means selecting the given moves is as simple as the press of a button. Fighting something with a full armor bar you want to whittle down? Try AAAA. if its guard is at half so you want to mix up guard breaks and damage? Go for AAYY. Shields down? AXXX. Enemy is too evasive or you need to try for a crit? AYYY. There's no scrolling through long menus to find whatever it is you need.

The idea is neat, but the environments never really truly capture the "spirit" of any of the companies being represented and there's a real lack of creativity in bringing these lands alive in that respect. Which brings me to the game's biggest issue: Its lack of variety in locales and recycled dungeon designs. You'll see nearly every type of environment in the first 5 or so hours of the game, and from there, almost nothing but repeats, which will also be the case for most enemies and bosses as well.\n\nCombat is turn-based and fast, and you're given a myriad of options on how you want to outfit your characters' equipment and combo loadouts. Boss battles can be long, drawn-out, and at times strategy intensive ordeals that rarely, if ever, require grinding to overcome.\n\nThe progression in terms of the game's difficulty is a fairly balanced curve most of the way, with the player given many opportunities to tip the balance into their favor by either gaining a few extra levels, or utilizing the game's "Remake" system which can allow you to craft new items to buy, add more powerful enemies to duneons, and change what items appear. Again, there's not much grinding involved at all in order to complete the story, and most sidequests can be ignored if you so choose.\n\nThe only real grinding in the game involves needing to run back through areas to collect items which may be necessary to craft new Plans you've come across. The game leans a bit hard into this system and it at times can drag things to a screeching halt, but again, beyond the basics and a few nice things here and there, you don't necessarily HAVE to engage with it.\n\nWhile flawed, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a solid JRPG and will more than please those looking for something a little different in the genre.","February 9, 2015","true","37.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

And neps, whatever that means. If this interests you, try it out.\n\nSomewhat Serious Review\nAs a bit of context, before playing this game I had only heard bad things about the Neptunia series. That its gameplay was bland, its plot was terrible, its characters walking fanservice otaku-bait, etc. I only bought the game because it went on sale and I wanted to see for myself whether these claims were unfounded.\n\nAfter finishing the game, I had to admit that they were right. All those claims above are indeed true to a point.\n\nNevertheless, I enjoyed the hell out of this game, way more than any game I had played recently.\n\nThis is because, despite its shortcomings, Neptunia has managed to create the most compelling characters I have played in a while, and I say this with complete sincerity. Each character is a caricature of anime tropes but they meshed together so well that I didn't even care. It was fun to see them interact back and forth about inane random Japanese crap while breaking the fourth wall with abundant anime/manga/game references. The plot is very basic, but I found myself continuing to play onward just to see what the characters would do next. The experience is similar to being on an anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ forum but without the virulent hatred, if you can relate to that. There isn't really any deep character development, but I still found the characters relatable and likeable, and this had nothing to do with the "plot." Hell, you could take out all the fanservice and It'd still be great (at least for me.)\n\nThe actual gameplay portion of the game is decidedly lackluster. You will be playing recycled maps with recycled enemies using the same damn move over and over again. Luckily, the game seems to be aware of this and gives you a good deal of tools to combat the grindy experience. There are in-game mods ("plans") that do things such as weaken the enemy and massively increase the rate your super moves ("ex drive") charges. Furthermore, there is a skip-all-combat-animations button, that is a godsend for grinding exp and drops. Once you start picking up the pace, and reliably killing large exp "dangerous" enemies, the game becomes almost laughably easy. It'll take a while to get there though, so keep in mind that the early chapters are still a fairly large grind. Overall, whether you're going for 100% completion or merely completing the story as fast as possible the game caters to you either way at the expense of combat difficulty.\n\nThe soundtrack is nothing special, and somewhat grates on the ears after a while, but it does fit with the upbeat tone of the game and has an acceptable variety of tracks. The voice acting however is excellent. I only played with Japanese voices, but the voice actors did a very good job of capturing the personalities of the CPUs. The game would not be as enjoyable as it is without the quality of the voice work.\n\nFinally, there's a good deal of fanservice if you're into that.\nIf you're bothered by it, I will warn that it only gets increasingly prevalent in the sequels.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a real love-it or hate-it type of game in a real love-it or hate-it series. There are some glaring gameplay issues and the humor is not for everyone.\n\nNevertheless, against all my better judgement, I really love this game.","March 8","true","54.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

A little game called Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 instantly catches my attention,  to which I would share with my comrade about how cringe it was, making all sorts of comments about it. This is when a bet was formed, my comrade had challenged me to a 1v1 on League of Legends, which led up to one hell of a bet. It was simple, the loser was given Neptunia for free from the winner, to which the loser would have to put an active 15 hours into at minimum.  Needless to say, I got ♥♥♥♥ing destroyed.  I accepted my fate with my remaining dignity and downloaded the game overnight, being mocked and teased all the while. The next night, my time had come. Booted up the game, saw the anime-esc opening sequence and nearly killed myself on the spot, but I dared to tread on, I still had 15 hours to go. During this opening scene, scolling between dialogue of 4 unnamed Goddesses having an argument for god knows what, land or some ♥♥♥♥. Then the flat chested whitey called the green one Thundertits, I actually ♥♥♥♥ing laughed, I was not expecting that at all. At that moment I knew the game had changed, this may not be so bad after all. Got into the actual game, find out it's a turn based RPG-esc game, end up actually enjoying it immensely. I hid this fact from my comrade, ended up hitting the 15 hours in two days. It's been a good month now, 65 hours in, comrade thinks I am weeaboo scum and abandons me.  IT ALL STARTED AS A PRANK BRO, PLEASE SEND HELP.\n\nPros\nYou get to stare at animu tiddies for the entirety of the playthrough, zoom feature included. Wink Wink.\nEnjoyable cast of Characters.\nDecently fair combat and fun combat, can get repetitive with the big bosses at times. (Even worse if your cast of Waifus can't actually kill the boss, so dying and coming back to it is a pain in the ♥♥♥.)\nThere is a Waifu for everyone. Name your preferance, you got it.\nCheap DLC.\nTop Nep.\n\nCons\nNoire's voice is like listening to nails on a chalkboard on an amp.\nSome bosses have infinite MP, so they can spam their most powerful move almost every turn, while leaving you with a dead healer every time.\nPartial grind-fest for those special items and weapons.\nFlat Chested women.\nPotential loss of friends, respect from remaining friends, and embarassing your entire family tree.\n\nDave rates 9/10, would Nep Nep again.","March 11","true","72.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imouto-chan/recommended/282900/","Imouto-chan","愛 ♥Imouto-chan♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imouto-chan/","724 products in account","Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 is a JRPG that throws away any serious story for nothing but references and jokes yet still manages to be somewhat enjoyable.\n\nNow the story is as generic as you can get; the main character Neptune is a goddess that fell from the sky, hit her head really hard and has amnesia. Along the way she meets other characters that join her party trying to help her get her memory back, some of these characters are other goddess's that before they met Neptune all hated each other but they learn to get along. There's a bit more to the story than that, but that's basically the gist of it; Neptune literally takes any serious tone and throws it out the window every chance she gets and at first it's funny but eventually it just gets old.\n\nThis game is broken up into eight chapters; typically the order of events goes story, look at new items at the shop, view world map events, go to newly revealed dungeon and repeat all of that. What helps to shake this up a bit is when you're in the dungeons you can freely roam around and instead of getting into random battles you see the enemies roaming around just like you are. When you come in contact with an enemy it starts the encounter, but you can also attack them instead of touching them to get the advantage and have your party members start off the fight. When you're in combat you'll notice right away you can freely move around within the specified circular area, this is the combat zone and you're enouraged to keep your party spaced apart because enemies can hit multiple targets but so can you. Though you can move each character around individually the combat is turn based, so once you move you have to attack or skip your turn; there are three types of attacks that all build your .EXE meter (Which is basically your super meter). Each attack type has different properties, rush type attacks generally do little damage but hit a lot of times in one action and they're used to build the .EXE meter, power type attacks do tons of health damage in usually one swing and don't build .EXE meter very well nor do they do a lot of guard damage, and lastly break type attacks are used for destroying your opponents shield and don't do much health damage nor build .EXE meter that well. You'll also unlock special abilities like heals, spells, or buffs that use SP as your characters level up so you can have defined rolls for each party member like healer, damage, support. Aside from healing when you're low on health there really isn't a lot of strategy involved in the combat, build .EXE meter when you don't have any to use super moves at the end of combos, destroy enemy shields with break attacks than spam power attacks to finish the fight. This game also has a ton of plans you can complete and if you go after all of them it'll take a considerable amount of time, they generally add a new piece of equipment or an accessory you can purchase from the shop but some of them change enemy types in a dungeon or give you more experience/credits from fights.\n\nThe soundtrack wasn't that bad, I wouldn't say it's anything memorable; but it really fit the game and some of the tracks were quite catchy.\n\nThough it might have an alright soundtrack this game's graphics aren't anything worthy of praise, the character/enemy models look alright but the environments are really uninspired. Each dungeon has a "theme" and each of these "themes" has about 3 layouts that don't change and look identical to the others in the same "theme".\n\nI would recommend a purchase to any fan of JRPGs that really enjoy grinding because that's honestly all this game is, a massive grind fest from leveling up to farming materials for plans to get stronger items or unlock optional dungeons. If you're not a fan of JRPGs or if you're not into very grind heavy games than I'd say either get this on a very good sale or skip it all together because there honestly isn't an intriguing story to keep you hooked if that's what you're after.","April 26","true","54.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

While the video was good for a quick laugh, the game itself didn't capture my intrest. In fact, I would've forgotten about it if it wasn't for a Splatoon Gmod video called "Squid-nanigans". In it, the main character of this game, Neptune (based on the Sega Neptune), encounters an Inkling and.....chaos ensues.\n\nThis lead me to do a little research, and eventually I had the motive to buy this game(but not at full price). Christmas comes around, I get steam money, it was on sale for 6 bucks, bought the game and.......I spent 6 hours on it and didn't touch the game for at least 2 months.\n\nNear the end of march, I decided to give the game one last shot, to see if I can try and find a reason to keep going. Thankfully I did, as I made some serious progress, and I realized that this game is actually good. Very good. In fact, It's surprizingly good. And I'm not even halfway done yet!\n\nPros:\n-The EXE attacks are amazing.\n-The regular special attacks arn't to bad either.\n-Compa.\n-The characters are chock-full of personallity.\n-The world of Gameindustri is based on video games.\n-The battle system has plenty of variety.\n-Compa.\n-Lots of side quests to keep one busy between major story events.\n-Foruth-Wall breaks. I like those.\n-Me laughing the whole way through, especailly when it comes to Neptune and her pudding.\n-Did I already metion Compa? What I'm saying is that I really like Compa (and Blanc, and Nepgear, and Noire, and Neptune, and 5pb who is my real favorite character but she's not in this game so Compa will do, and...).\n\nCons:\n-The voice acting goes up and down in quality.\n-Some of the items in the shop are more expensive than they should.\n-A glitch that causes enemies to become self-aware and not attack on their turn.\n-The game in general can be hard without DLC or if your characters arn't at a proper level.\n-The simple fact that I had to rewrite all the changes I made to this review because my laptop is literally a SELF-AWARE A$$HOLE THAT SECRETLY HATES ME!\n\nWould I recommend this game? The box says yes but I don't really know. It depends on what kind of gamer you are. I mean, if you're the kind of gamer who's willing to look past the fanservice, likes RPG's, Video game references, fourth-wall breaks and a storyline that doesn't take itself seriously and focused more on comedy, or just really wants to see some of their favorite game consoles as godesses/anime girls, then who knows? Maybe this games for you. If you don't like any of those things, then get ready for a bad time(insert Undertale reference here).\n\nSeriously though, I need an actual computer.","March 5","true","35.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

After falling from Celestia, Neptune meets Compa and eventually IF as she works to find Key Fragments that are spread throughout GameIndustri! Unfortunately though, Neptune has lost her memory and can't recall who she is.\n\nReBirth1 is a remake of the original Hyperdimension Neptunia, and while the original game was a bit of a mess at times to play through, this is not. That doesn't stop ReBirth1 from being pretty hard. You'll find it quite useful to make use of the new Remake system to add in new dungeons so that you can get a bit of an edge on the bosses.\n\nThe PC version features some issues however - the lip syncing is a bit off, the game doesn't like to run (without crashing) without being in compatibility mode, and some lines of text get cut off in their text boxes. This doesn't stop the game from being quite enjoyable from the numerous video game references spread everywhere. It does unfortunately seem like we won't see a fix for this PC issues though. Regardless, it's quite easy for me to give this a recommendation with it having both an enjoyable combat system and enjoyable storyline.","October 16, 2015","true","31.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

(Nice to see a not so deep RPG.)\n+Art style is nice, nothing original but nice.\n+Characters are very entertaining.\n+Costumes! (Yes this is a pro for me, shut up!)\n+Interesting battle system, nothing super original but what it takes from other games is really good.\n+The port isn't amazing but it's still better than most ports out there, hell even AAA games aren’t this decent.\n+Option menu is decent for PC.\n+Runs in 60FPS. (Or at least tries)\n+1080p support. (Not perfect 1080p it’s upscale)\n+Fully rebindable keys/controller with the ability to bind 2 buttons to one function.\n+Mouse controls and mouse controlled menus.\n\nCons:\n--The game is short with a lot of filler and grinding. (If you’re into that it’s that fine, I was)\n--Battle system is good but can get repetitive. (This is just an average thing for RPGs)\n--New game plus doesn’t give your whole party back; you have to get them back through the story again. Not the DLC and unlocks though. (This is really annoying to be honest)\n--True ending is a bit of a pain to get without look it up. (Nothing to bad, at least it wasn’t like Agarest: Generations of War)\n--Voicing can get annoying due to very little quotes recorded. (Nothing to serious but when you’re angry at an optional boss some quotes will make you mad as hell.)\n--No graphic settings other then resolution. (Not a big deal)\n--Frame drops across the board. (At least for me, nothing below 30FPS though)\n\nConclusion:\nI actually enjoyed this game quite a lot, which is suppressing because I’ve heard and read that the original PS3 version was just terrible. I can honestly say that Idea Factory did a damn good job upon this game plus the port was big surprise, I was ready for another Dark Souls port.\n\nDisclaimer:\nI like anime… so take that as you will.","February 19, 2015","true","88.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

You'll want to use a controller, I use a PS3 controller through motioninjoy and I have no issues with it. You have to select it in the game menu as usual before it works.\nThe game is NOT 1080p, the resolution goes upto 1600x900 I think, but when you play fullscreen, it upscales it and the game itself looks fine enough. The character sprites in the VN style dialogue sections show a bit of annoying blur, same as the 3D ingame stuff, but nothing too bad. Considering the art style, its tolerable, but not excusable.

You'll want to use a controller, I use a PS3 controller through motioninjoy and I have no issues with it. You have to select it in the game menu as usual before it works.\nThe game is NOT 1080p, the resolution goes upto 1600x900 I think, but when you play fullscreen, it upscales it and the game itself looks fine enough. The character sprites in the VN style dialogue sections show a bit of annoying blur, same as the 3D ingame stuff, but nothing too bad. Considering the art style, its tolerable, but not excusable.

Ah, and with lovingly crafted art, music, and the ability to control the action, vidcons are the ultimate combination of the high arts. While I tend to play the stoic, I will be the first to admit that vidcons have driven me to cry, to scream and shout, to feel actual hate; such is the power of this force beyond our wildest reckoning. And here I am, before you, to tempt your tongues with the taint of such a tantalizing topic. And the Japanese, the true geniuses behind the world of video games. Pah, I throw my scorn upon such incompetents of the West who would mock the true art of the Japanese with "games" such as Baldur's Gate and Madden. Perhaps the West is not as intelligent as the East, but this is a matter for another day. Japan has given us such masterpieces as the Final Fantasy series, Star Ocean, Wild Arms, and of course, Arc the Lad. Yes, some of the finest vidcons in the world were created by the Japanese. I come to you today to ask you in all earnesty, what is your favorite vidcon? I will reveal mine after the grand debate has illustriously begun, but not before the first poster falls victim to my plot of discussion.","January 31, 2015","true","22.9"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","56","19","34","9","0"

The story is very funny and the characters break the fourth wall quite often mentioning the player(you) and the video game itself; while even giving references to other franchises like Pokemon.\n\nIf you do not care for side quests/objectives and only the story, then the game can be cleared in less than 10hours but if you want the true ending it will take atleast two playthroughs plus nearly all side dungeons. The regular trash mobs should never give you a problem but the bosses can kick you around a decent amount.\n\nAt some points you may have to go back and grind some to be able to take some bosses on, if you cannot afford healing items or taking too much damage. The attack animiations are pretty flushed and the cinematics for supers are well done. Most of the time the enemy AI seem to just attack whoever is closest to them and does not use their own abilities frequently enough. And constantly clearing dungeons can get repetitive as there are no puzzles to solve, objects to interact with, etc.\n\nThe game offers plenty of playable characters but you may only have 3 on the field and three on the bench at any given time. All characters can be customized by crafting/buying outfits from the stores or getting clothes in chests through dungeons.\n\nIn summary, this game can be a breath of fresh air if you've been looking for an rpg with a little twist to it. And you can have lots of fun following the story and watching the cinematic attacks. I'd recommend this game if you are also into tactical-turn based rpg games. In my opinion it is not quite worth 30 dollars though so catch it on sale.","October 28, 2015","true","51.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you do not like any RPG, go out of here.\n\nWith the remake of the first Hyperdimension Neptunia it is now possible to enjoy the series without having a Playstation. I am very happy with it.\n\nThere is a really solid gameplay. Dungeon-selecting and a TBS-Battle-System with some extras. There are no random encounters. The difficulty of this game is not that hard.\n\nA system makes you able to add different content. For finding the right materials you can add dungeons, equipment, outfits and enemies or even change the strength of them. So you are able to change a part of the game as you wish.\n\nLike most RPG the focus of the game is the well explained story. Well it is true that there is a really nice story\nbut I must confess the core of this game is the humor. There is a ton of game references, which usually makes you grin.\nCharacter names, quotes, jokes, eveything is there.\n\nThe whole story is explained with dialogs like a visual novel. There is much to read, but in the end it is always funny. Between the battles it is always relaxing just to read the dialogs.\n\nNep-ko should really eat her eggplants, because they are so healthy.. uhm nevermind..\n\nThis game is one of the few games I really wanted to have for release. The price was really worth it.\nIf you like RPG and are interested in the Console War in Game Industri, then you should buy it.","February 16, 2015","true","57.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The endless fight between Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo and now Sega.\n\nThe nicknames of the 4 goddess are the color of the consoles like, Green heart is Xbox, Black Heart is Playstation, White Heart is Nintendo and Purple Heart is Sega.\n\nYou control the goddess Purple Heart or Neptune that suffers from amnesia after a fierce battle between the other goddess that too her out. Neptune meets Compa, that is a reference to company that made this game; Compile Heart. Later in the game you meet IF that is a Reference to the publishers; Idea Factory.\nThe game is kinda huge, and with lots of dungeon crawling.\n\nYou have the ability to create custom moves with Discs and such. Every Goddess have a HDD transformation also called Hard Drive Divinity, that makes them even more powerful.\n\nThere are DLC to get 2 other Goddess on your team almost from the start, Peashy(Yellow Heart) and Plutia(Iris Heart).\n\nThe game have loads of humor and it's VN style is loveable.\nThe only sad part is that, it's grind based. So you have to grind up by doing quest to earn Exp and money for new gear.\n\nAdditional Infomation :Developer: Idea Factory, Compile Heart, Felistella\nPublisher: Compile Heart\nGenre: Singleplayer, RPG, Anime, Dungeon Crawler\nReleased on PS Vita: 26 August 2014\nReleased on Steam: January 30, 2015\n\nFollow my Curator page :http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/\nThis review is written for :The Panda's Corner","January 8","true","8.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The RPG lover in me is left wanting more. The actual gameplay amounts to, breaking the enemy's guard, and then use your strongest attack until the enemy is dead. If you are not on the same level as the thing you are fighting, you're dead. And you'll need to grind. There are plenty of enemies that give a lot of experience so once you find those enemies you can get a lot of experience quickly.\n\nThe actual gameplay of this game is not that fleshed out. You can move around and position your characters before you attack but the game does nothing to make you change where your characters are standing. An enemy MIGHT walk out of range from your party members and you MIGHT have to move them over an inch to attack them again. But there are no enemies that force you to move out of the way of a devastating attack. There are no enviromental hazards that force you to plan your movements during fights. Nothing like that. So being able to move your characters in fights is basically pointless.\n\nThere's no real nudity in the game but there is a lot of cleavage and mention of breast sizes so it does well to titlate and make you laugh. But it doesn't do enough to challenge you in fights outside of: Are you high enough level? Ok you win. In conclusion, the fanservice is good, the gameplay is not. That being said. I can't really NOT recommend this game. I didn't get exactly what I wanted out of it.

Re;birth 1 removes the bland and tedious of the first game (but still enjoyable) and replaced it with goodies from its mk2 sequel, primarily its semi free-roam battle system, as opposed to the original's FF-sqeue turn-based combat, all while still maintaining its charm and eyecandy fans have come to expect and love. Console jokes and character conversations also include references and jabs at the first game, giving players who played the original PS3 release a good chuckle or two.\n\nBeing a Vita port, the game doesn't run on native 1080p, but it's not a deal-breaker. In fact, I find it very well optimized for a port aside from its post-release issues and glitches. Gameplay is fluid and 'breathing' character portraits bring life to its cast during dialogue. Best played with a controller, a KB+M is fine but navigating character movement and camera angles with two sets of movement keys while inputting commands isn't fun.\n\nHighly recommended to anime and VN fans, or anyone who falls into the niche JRPG segment of the market.\n\n","February 3, 2015","true","21.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Finding the original PS3 disc is a pain and costs a ton, and even though I have a Vita, Re:Birth 1 is still $40 and I have no more space on my memory card. I absolutely love that we are starting to get some JRPGs on Steam that were formerly console exclusive.\n\nThe gameplay is turn based with a field, think Final Fantasy 10 meets Tales of Vesperia. The difficulty rises quickly and as with most JRPGs there is grinding involved in order to stay on top of the difficulty, which is a plus in my book.\nThere are plenty of customizations available in this game, from attack lists, to outfits and weapons. Plenty of content to keep you entertained for 50+ hours, maybe more if you get the DLC that allows you to level to 300, not sure if there was DLC to let you get to 999 like there is in HDN:Victory.\n\nObviously as this is day 1 there are some minor issues with the game. It doesn't have 1080p as advertised, it is 900p maximum. Some of the buttons still retain their Vita icons and a few in the tutorial are mislabeled. Controller support is wonderful using an XBOne controller, however the input seems limited to 8 directions rather than true 360 analog support.\n\nAll in all it is a wonderful game that finally has made its transition to Steam. Definitely worth the $30, at $15 it is a steal.","January 29, 2015","true","8.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

I bought this the minute it was released, and am glad I did. A good, solid JRPG with a great battle system awaited, and it plays wonderfully at 60fps. An all-female cast is also a big plus for me, too.\n\n**EDIT**\nI own a GeForce GTX 660Ti graphics card, and as of a couple driver updates ago, within the last few months, a few features were added to the card. Among them, "Dynamic Super Resolution (DSR)." This enables the GPU to commandeer absolutely all graphics output, from photographs to non-DirectX games (like this one), upscale the image up to 4x of the current screen resolution, and then put it back to the screen resolution. The result? This game (yes, this game) now looks AMAZING, and with no drop in FPS (over 1300-core GPU). If anyone out there owns an NVidia card as good or better than this one, TURN THIS OPTION ON!! Trust me, you won't regret it.\n**\n\nOpen statement to Japanese gaming companies: Even though PC games may not do so well in Japan, they certainly do everywhere else! And the performance with a good, dedicated gfx card is superior to that of consoles! Please bring all of your day-one releases to PC. They -will- sell.\n\nCan't wait for the next releases, Idea Factory! Keep 'em coming!","January 30, 2015","true","36.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If your answer is anything but "yes" then stop reading. I heard a bit about Neptunia from a friend of mine, but I never gave the game much thought. After being released on steam and looking at the screenshots I knew I had to play it especially since it's a JRPG. In the end I thought this was a very fun game with a charming atmosphere, a good game to play to unwind.\n\nPros:\nThere's a fair bit of the game that has voice acting, and the acting isn't really bad (it's only really bad if you look at lipsynching in which case there really isnt any...dialogue trails away from the character's mouth movements)\nAfter getting used to them, the controls can be very intuitive.\nCons:\nButton mapping, despite being a PC port of the game it still shows all the buttons of a playstation controller. This took me some getting used to but after rebinding a few keys here and there I was good to go.\nThe in-between: Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1's level scale felt a bit strange to me. There are points in the game where you can be "underleveled" but take on enemies with great ease, and other times where you can be incredibly "overleveled" and still feel like you're making zero progress.","February 6, 2015","true","270.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nitrocide17/recommended/282900/","Nitrocide17","Nitrocide17","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nitrocide17/","48 products in account","This is my first time ever approaching a Hyperdimention Neptunia game and to be honest, I had no idea what I was in for. I thought it would be a "OMG LOOK AT THE BOOBS JIGGLE" game. And let me tell you that while some jokes revolve around boobs and fanservice, that is not the main focus. Not by a long shot. I also played with a controller exclusively so I have no opinion on keyboard controls\n\nThis is a wonderful JRPG adventure with well written, funny characters. The main character, Neptune jokes around quite a bit but knows when to be serious. It feels like an Anime that you play, in more ways than one. The combat is turn based but the attacks are flashy and pretty sweet to look at. Getting tired of basic attacks? You can unleash a powerful flurry of attacks using SP (mana/magic) or your EXE charges (built up from using any other action in battle). And as you level up, more basic attacks can be unlocked and substituted for your current attack combo.\n\nThe story is quite intricate and complex, yet it takes it's time and makes sure you understand what's going on. The tale is mostly told in text boxes accompanied by lightly animated 2D characters. And by lightly, I mean they react to what's being said when dialogue is rolling and they sway gently when nothing is being said, so they they all feel alive. And the story is filled with plot twists and at any moment, a joke could pop out of nowhere, or the characters would break the fourth wall  addressing the scene or another character's behavior.\n\nEnemies all drop something upon death that is unique to that specific enemy, and the bestiary keeps track of which enemy drops what and what zone they could be found in. These materials are used to unlock items in the shop and complete plans. Plans do everything from modifying the game mechanics as a whole, modifying the items harvested in each zone and unlocking new items in the shop.\n\nThe next few items are nitpicks because this game is a port from the PS Vita from what I understand. So i know that there may be a lack of memory left over for these details. and I'm willing to look past these\n\nEnemy variety is new and fresh and the variety is wide. Some enemies will be the same in both model and texture exactly and the only difference visually will be the names. This trend isn't all that noticeable until you look at the bestiary. Certain enemies have a specific element attached. I found no use for the elemental attacks because it never seemed that I recieved a benefit from them at all. I know there was probably a system in place to address that but I just wasn't interested enough to care, since there was no internal way to know what attacks would be effective for each enemy (like final fantasy's Libra). Or maybe I just didn't understand the enemy's design hinted at the weakness, and I'm at fault here.\n\nDungeons, stages, levels share motives and share styles.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaioshin62/recommended/282900/","kaioshin62","KaioShin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaioshin62/","543 products in account","This is a remake of a PS3 JRPG that's also available on Vita. I hear the original was a much worse game, and I really don't dare imagine how that was like. It's a cheap budget JRPG (new price was 15 bucks on launch sale) with emphasize on cheap. There are only like half a dozen dungeon layouts, while there are 50 dungeons in the game. So basically each dungeon is copy pasted 10 times with only the enemies replaced. The dungeons are super short too, you can run from the entrance to the end usually in less than 5 minutes. The storyline is also only presented visual novel style with textboxes and talking heads. Cities are implemented as simple menus. So you either watch dialogues or you pick a dungeon from a list and run through it. Really this game probably cost less to make than the PS3 licensing fees...\n\nStill, it is suprisingly fun. Combat is turn based with a bunch of systems piled on it, and there is a massive crafting component involving hunting monsters for materials and crafting plans to unlock new equipment or dungeons. And the grind is so extremely streamlined, you can breeze even through special bosses within 10 seconds by liberal use of the ultra smooth animation cancel button. There are also absolutely no loading times, everything appears and works instantly. So the grind can downright turn into a rush and feels very satisfying. Think the loot and kill vortex of Diablo, but as a JRPG.\n\nOh also the story is a parody of the console war in the current game industry. The entire cast of the game is female with permanent fan service forced in your face. The main character is a personified Dreamcast and there are also Playstation, Xbox and the Wii present. Ofc the Xbox has the biggest ♥♥♥♥ while the Wii is as flat as a washboard and gets extremely jealous if that's pointed out to her. At the start they are all mortal enemies but of course they eventually band together to fight a greater evil. It is in no way shape or form serious and constantly goofy and 4th wall breaking. I thought I would hate it but honestly, I think I prefer this absolute nonsense over yet another embarassing teenage melodrama or boring as ♥♥♥♥ Hero Alex gathers the stones of power to save the world from the evil wizard ♥♥♥♥ as you'd usually find in JRPGs.\n\nMild recommendation.","February 10, 2015","true","32.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I thought it would be a "OMG LOOK AT THE BOOBS JIGGLE" game. And let me tell you that while some jokes revolve around boobs and fanservice, that is not the main focus. Not by a long shot. I also played with a controller exclusively so I have no opinion on keyboard controls\n\nThis is a wonderful JRPG adventure with well written, funny characters. The main character, Neptune jokes around quite a bit but knows when to be serious. It feels like an Anime that you play, in more ways than one. The combat is turn based but the attacks are flashy and pretty sweet to look at. Getting tired of basic attacks? You can unleash a powerful flurry of attacks using SP (mana/magic) or your EXE charges (built up from using any other action in battle). And as you level up, more basic attacks can be unlocked and substituted for your current attack combo.\n\nThe story is quite intricate and complex, yet it takes it's time and makes sure you understand what's going on. The tale is mostly told in text boxes accompanied by lightly animated 2D characters. And by lightly, I mean they react to what's being said when dialogue is rolling and they sway gently when nothing is being said, so they they all feel alive. And the story is filled with plot twists and at any moment, a joke could pop out of nowhere, or the characters would break the fourth wall  addressing the scene or another character's behavior.\n\nEnemies all drop something upon death that is unique to that specific enemy, and the bestiary keeps track of which enemy drops what and what zone they could be found in. These materials are used to unlock items in the shop and complete plans. Plans do everything from modifying the game mechanics as a whole, modifying the items harvested in each zone and unlocking new items in the shop.\n\nThe next few items are nitpicks because this game is a port from the PS Vita from what I understand. So i know that there may be a lack of memory left over for these details. and I'm willing to look past these\n\nEnemy variety is new and fresh and the variety is wide. Some enemies will be the same in both model and texture exactly and the only difference visually will be the names. This trend isn't all that noticeable until you look at the bestiary. Certain enemies have a specific element attached. I found no use for the elemental attacks because it never seemed that I recieved a benefit from them at all. I know there was probably a system in place to address that but I just wasn't interested enough to care, since there was no internal way to know what attacks would be effective for each enemy (like final fantasy's Libra). Or maybe I just didn't understand the enemy's design hinted at the weakness, and I'm at fault here.\n\nDungeons, stages, levels share motives and share styles. You won't notice it at first but as you progress through the game, levels will repeat shape and style with very slight changes and a new set of creatures. but they are mixed up enough that a return to a familiar layout isn't that bad.\n\nThe problem with both of these nitpicks is when you return to an area to collect materials from an enemy, some of them look exactly the same.

I bought this the minute it was released, and am glad I did. A good, solid JRPG with a great battle system awaited, and it plays wonderfully at 60fps. An all-female cast is also a big plus for me, too.\n\n**EDIT**\nI own a GeForce GTX 660Ti graphics card, and as of a couple driver updates ago, within the last few months, a few features were added to the card. Among them, "Dynamic Super Resolution (DSR)." This enables the GPU to commandeer absolutely all graphics output, from photographs to non-DirectX games (like this one), upscale the image up to 4x of the current screen resolution, and then put it back to the screen resolution. The result? This game (yes, this game) now looks AMAZING, and with no drop in FPS (over 1300-core GPU). If anyone out there owns an NVidia card as good or better than this one, TURN THIS OPTION ON!! Trust me, you won't regret it.\n**\n\nOpen statement to Japanese gaming companies: Even though PC games may not do so well in Japan, they certainly do everywhere else! And the performance with a good, dedicated gfx card is superior to that of consoles! Please bring all of your day-one releases to PC. They -will- sell.\n\nCan't wait for the next releases, Idea Factory! Keep 'em coming!","January 30, 2015","true","36.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EntroSRL/recommended/282900/","EntroSRL","Entro (Purple Heart)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EntroSRL/","175 products in account","Update: After 51 hours (Excluding hours I left the game running and didn't play,) got all the Achievements for the Game. I enjoyed this game so much that it's literally the only game I actually bothered to do Achievements for. Also the first Game I actually decided to do the Trading Cards for. This is definitely a great casual Game worthy of many playthroughs.\n\nReally surprised with this title so far (14 hours into the Game at the time of this post.)\n\nThe Story is quite... Interesting. It is not your typical straightforward story. The Basic plot is that the CPUs are in the middle of a Console War. Yes, a Console War. This is where your Story starts off. If you can comprehend that and the fact that the game has a lot of 4th wall breaking context to some times insult its players and have wacky dialogue, the Story is for the most part Satirical all the way through, which is very interesting, and I actually like it.\n\nOne main piece of advice I can offer to any one interested in Re;Birth 1: I recommend one of two things.\n\n1. Watch the Anime. (The Anime is an adaptation of the Game, and takes place some time after the other games. Main reason I list this is because it's a good way to get used to the Characters, and if you can handle the wacky / cheesy dialogue in the Anime, you'll fit right in for the Game.)\n\n2. Grind. Grind. Grind, and buy Item Upgrades / make the Upgrades VIA Plans at every opportunity they become available.\n\nPeople say that this Game is pretty easy. Maybe if you played it before it came to Steam, that is understandable, but this Game is by no means easy. It is actually VERY hard / some times frustrating.\n\nThe Game runs Eight Chapters. If you are not grinding / purchasing upgrades at every opportunity, you will notice how hard this Game can be when you get halfway through the 2nd Chapter. The other problem is that the Bosses have a lot of RNG to them, where they can either do a Normal hit to you, a Powerful hit that might kill you, or an Attack that hits all of your Party Members in close range, even if they aren't even in front of the Boss. Reviving your Party Members when they get downed is also RNG, because from what i've experienced in my own Playthrough, the Boss likes to immediately attack and kill the person you revive almost 90% of the time before it switches to one of your other party members. If you're coming into this game thinking that you'll blow through it without using Healing items or Game Over'ing at all, you're in for a rude awakening.\n\nGet used to how the Dungeons look in the first two chapters of the Game, because you're going to be seeing them all the way until the End. I can't knock them on this because if you can tell already that the Game doesn't take itself seriously and that it mocks a lot of things, especially in the Gaming world, you could see this as them mocking Games that use the same Layouts constantly.\n\nSoundtrack is also pretty decent, but a lot of areas unfortunately use the same background music way too often. Can't knock this either for similar reasons that I listed for Dungeons.\n\nIf you can get past all this, this is definitely a very fun game, albeit very challenging as well. Would definitely recommend to any one that likes JRPGs, and I look forward to the rest of the Series coming to Steam.","February 6, 2015","true","92.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Most of the fun comes from the cute dialogues and references to anything game related anyway. The charakters break the fouth wall quite often and the overall atmosphere is very light-hearted. The game just wants to be fun and make you smile and succeeds.\n\nThere are tons of items to find, buy and craft. Add a good variety of abilities, spells, combos, some kind synergies between characters (if they like each other, you get bonuses) and you get great possibilities to customize your party. If you like experimenting, the game might be for you. Getting all the Plans, trying things out can be pretty addictive.\n\nThe combat is turn-based on a 2D-Battlefield. Positioning is key, since all attacks have an area of effect. Standing at a wrong place can seriously ruin your day. Attack animations are also pretty good, so cambat is challenging and fun to watch. I strongly recommend a gamepad for the best experience. Playing with keyboard and mouse is possible but doesn't feel great.\n\nI won't comment much on the graphics. Look at Screenshots and videos and decide for yourself. It's a bit outdated but not ugly. Works for me.\n\nHowever, this game is not without flaws.\nThe combat can get repetetive after a while, since the game tends to be quite grindy. You often have to get a few levels because of a difficulty spike and the MMO'ish quests (Kill X of these, bring me Y of that) increase this.\nThe fact that dungeons and enemies are frequently recolored and reused does't make it better either.\nOh, and you have to save often. There is no autosave and when you're dead, it's game over.\n\n\nTo sum it all up: 7/10, fun game with some flaws.

The Dialoge has me laughing constantly and the RPG battle system is very fun. I play using a PS4 controller, which the game supports Direct Input, meaning you dont need to use an Xinput wrapper to use any controller on it, and while this is the case it also supports Xinput, meaning you can use virtually any controller that is compatible with PC on this game. Compa is the greatest character in this game, like seriously, I cannot get over how hard I would bang her. Shes perfect in every way, the sound of her sweet voice, her cute face, and her gazeful pink/orange eyes. Given any chance I would take her out on a date, anywhere she wanted, deplete my bank account for her at the most luxurious of resturants sip on wine and listen to her talk about her life, then when we are all done, take her to my home, ♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥ out of her until her, and then lay and sleep all night long.\n\n\n-cons\n\nFrom a technilogical standpoint, this game runs terribly. Considering the fact that this is a port of a PSVita game and            requires a pretty beefy PC to run is sad. (4gb of ram, Seriously?

One of them for getting me into this franchise and the other one for gifting me this game when it was on sale. I'm not gonna make any mentions, but they know who they are!\nNow, Hyperdimension Neptunia... I remember seeing this game back as a PS3 exclusive, a few years ago. But I didn't feel like playing it and I couldn't buy it cuz I didn't have a PS3 at the time and the one thing to get my attention where the main characters on the cover. So this was my first shot at it.\nFor starters, the story. And I'll try to talk about it here without spoiling too much, here. The game takes place in Gamindustri, formed by 4 lands (Planeptune, Lastation, Leanbox and Lowee) and each have a goddess who rules over them (Purple Heart, Black Heart, Green Heart and White Heart). Now the story starts with all 4 goddesses battling each other in a land called Celestia, which is above Gamindustri. All 4 with the exact same objective, which is to win and rule over all 4 lands. After battling for a while, Black, Green and White heart consider getting rid of one of them to make the battle easier and join forces to get rid of Purple Heart. They successfully do it, Purple Heart falls off of Celestia, landing on Planeptune and losing her memory. After falling, a girl aspiring to be a nurse called Compa finds her and becomes friends with her, promising to help her getting her memory back.\nI find the gameplay good. It's easy to move around when free roaming and I found the controls for combat easy to get comfortable with. Besides, the combat's pretty varied, as each character has a lot of different attacks and special moves. Though playing this game can be a little difficult, depending on your situation. The game does support keyboard, but I highly recommend a controller.\nFor a game that originally came out in 2011 for the PS3 and was ported to Steam and PSVita in 2014, I don't see much of a difference in graphics. Which doesn't mean it's bad, actually. If the game still lags for you, it's most likely because the game's loading too any enemies and any small details, in the dungeons.\nThe game's pretty fun and if you pay attention, you can notice a lot of jokes. And also something which is pretty well made in this game, which is 4th wall breaking. A lot of it!\nBut with all these pros, obviously the game also comes with it's share of cons. And I've experienced some of them. Even though this game is great, you may kinda get a little tired of some of the dungeons you'll see throughout the game, as Idea Factory recycled a lot of dungeon layouts and a lot of enemies, simply renaming them and making them stronger.  Two other examples I can give are that the game suffers from a glitch that can pretty much screw up your whole process if you don't save frequently. Sometimes in combat, the enemies will not move at all, during their turns. They'll just stare at your party without attacking at all. Idk the solution for this and a lot of people complain about the same issue in the Steam forums and so far, no solution to this problem. So if it happens, force close the game through the task manager. The last problem I can mention is that sometimes, the game randomly crashes in between intros. Idk if anyone else has had this issue, but it has happened to me a couple of times. But very rarely. So here's a piece of advice for you who buy the game: save frequently.\nThis is something I'm gonna start doing, with my reviews. My final verdict for Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth 1 is a 7/10.\nThis is a great game. And it had potential to reach a higher score! Maybe even an 8/10, imo. But with the few issues it has and with so many recycled content in the game, it kinda drops the score I personally give the game. But still. It's a pretty fun experience and worth the money! I still strongly recommend this game to any JRPG fans and anyone who's looking for a new game to play.","March 27","true","149.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Having spawned a small religion, the game has what some would consider an intense fanbase, and you too shall soon be unable to remove Neptune's adorable face from your memory.\n\nThe game follows an amnesiac, Neptune, on her journey to rediscover both herself and her purpose.  Along her journey, she encounters numerous individuals who inevitably join the party to create an adventuring force to be reckoned with.  The characters, in truth, carry this game.  The attention to detail and humour which accompanies each of them is something which makes Re;Birth1 a stand-out amongst many other JRPGS.  As you progress in the story, you are able to visibly see the personalities and relationships of the characters develop, and this in itself is a rewarding element to the game.\n\nThe animations and graphics of the game don't quite match Black Desert's, but this is to be expected from a cult JRPG.  The art-style is cute, and the accompanying sound effects to almost every movement you make in-game will have your eyes widening with joy before too much time has passed.  The cutscenes which take up a large portion of the game, around sixty percent, are beautifully scripted and there are very few errors in the English translation should you play with this option toggled.  The voiced dialogue is flawless on all counts in Japanese, and I would recommend having these voices enabled even if you wish to read along in English.\n\nWith regards to gameplay, this game is a JRPG.  By that, I mean that you can expect some grinding, and a lot of repetition.  Particularly in Act II, which I personally find to be the toughest Act for new-starters, you'll find that grinding is almost a necessity for progression.  The game rewards grinding, with a tonne of late-game and potentially infinite replay-ability by way of the Colosseum.  The difficulty is hard by default, but you are given the option to make it either easier or harder as you progress in the game.  It should be noted that the grinding possesses certain psychological benefits.\n\nThe story (no spoilers here) is compelling, and you will feel an urge to stay in your seat until you've completed it.  The scripts as aforementioned are very well written, and combine the perfect use of traditional anime-style humour and Japanese cliché storylines.  That being said, there are some curveballs thrown in which you won't see coming- so strap in!\n\nAll in all, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a fantastic entry-level JRPG for beginners and some light-hearted fun for those more advanced.  The grinding is, in my personal opinion, enjoyable due to the humour having long-lasting qualities and I don't see myself getting bored anytime soon.  If you struggle with the idea of grinding levels in order to beat a boss, this may not be the best game for you, but I still whole-heartedly urge you to jump into the world of Neptune and her friends!","December 25, 2015","true","103.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In fact, they made use of cliches and tropes to such a degree that it was funny, entertaining, and enjoyable.  You don't have to go beyond this first paragraph if you don't feel like it, since the remaining paragraphs are merely my extensions on why I like the game and think that you should get it too.\n\nEven though it had the standard "save the world from the villain" plot, the true ending puts a nice twist to the story, and indeed, the story itself is poking fun at the genre that it is in (not unlike a certain other story involving a female demon lord, a hero, his past companions, and the various people that are involved in wars).\n\nThere is an abundance of female characters and some nonsensical jiggling, but since I like girls and I laugh at nonsensical jiggling. . . wwwwww\n\nI can't get enough of Ueda Kana's voice, and the way that the voice actors voiced the cast of characters made the story even more entertaining than it already was.\n\nIf you're worried about grinding pointlessly, don't.  You can pretty much clear the game by doing only the main battles and a few sidequests to find some materials for gears.  The New Game+ feature will also help you in your subsequent playthroughs, assuming you want to get all of your money's worth of the game and find any content that you may have missed in the first playthrough.  That said, New Game+ may be considered "grinding", but then again, there's just no pleasing some people.\n\nIf you read this review all the way here, thank you.  Seriously, I didn't think that anyone would read it all the way here, so give yourself a pat in the back, and buy and play the game!","December 14, 2015","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The voiced dialogue is flawless on all counts in Japanese, and I would recommend having these voices enabled even if you wish to read along in English.\n\nWith regards to gameplay, this game is a JRPG.  By that, I mean that you can expect some grinding, and a lot of repetition.  Particularly in Act II, which I personally find to be the toughest Act for new-starters, you'll find that grinding is almost a necessity for progression.  The game rewards grinding, with a tonne of late-game and potentially infinite replay-ability by way of the Colosseum.  The difficulty is hard by default, but you are given the option to make it either easier or harder as you progress in the game.  It should be noted that the grinding possesses certain psychological benefits.\n\nThe story (no spoilers here) is compelling, and you will feel an urge to stay in your seat until you've completed it.  The scripts as aforementioned are very well written, and combine the perfect use of traditional anime-style humour and Japanese cliché storylines.  That being said, there are some curveballs thrown in which you won't see coming- so strap in!\n\nAll in all, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a fantastic entry-level JRPG for beginners and some light-hearted fun for those more advanced.  The grinding is, in my personal opinion, enjoyable due to the humour having long-lasting qualities and I don't see myself getting bored anytime soon.  If you struggle with the idea of grinding levels in order to beat a boss, this may not be the best game for you, but I still whole-heartedly urge you to jump into the world of Neptune and her friends!","December 25, 2015","true","103.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HyperDimension_Bliss/recommended/282900/","HyperDimension_Bliss","HyperDimensionBliss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HyperDimension_Bliss/","15 products in account","HyperDimension Neptunia is a series that you will either love or hate. If you are not willing to look past the fanservice and suggestive aspects of it, you will not have a very good time. However, if you are willing to look past those, you will find a series full of well-written and developed characters and a large amount of meta-humour that is hard to not get a laugh out of.\n\nTo start things off, Neptunia a JRPG. In the world of Gamindustri, there are four nations: Lastation, Lowee, Leanbox and Planeptune. Each nation is ruled over by a goddess CPU (Console Patron Unit). CPU Black Heart rules Lastation, CPU White Heart rules Lowee, CPU Green Heart rules Leanbox and CPU Purple Heart rules Planeptune. The CPUs reside in Celestia, where they are locked in battle to determine who will obtain the title of True Goddess. After hundreds of years of fighting, a strange voice suggests for Black Heart, White Heart and Green Heart to group together and defeat Purple Heart. They agree and send her careening off the edge of Celestia towards Gamindustri, during which she reverts into Neptune, her human form. After being found and tended to by an aspiring nurse named Compa, it is learned that Neptune has amnesia, and so she, Compa and a member of the Guild named IF set out across Gamindustri to restore Neptune's memories. The story is very lighthearted and rarely takes itself seriously. The characters are all well-developed and likeable, and their conversations often involve the breaking of the fourth wall to hilarious effect.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is relatively solid. It uses a turn-based system where you move you characters around the battlefield before using their abilities or using combos. Combos are composed of Rush, Power and Break attacks. Rush attacks are more effective at building your EXE Gauge, which allows the use of EXE Drives. EXE Drives are very powerful attacks that can be performed alone or with other characters, depending on which character is using an EXE Drive. Power attacks deal the most raw damage out of the three, and Break attacks are better at decreasing an enemy's Guard Points. When their Guard Points reach zero, that enemy will take around double damage for a short time.\n\nIn addition to the three characters on the battlefield, you can pair them with another three who will provide passive bonuses such as more EXP or increased defences. When two characters are paired together, they have a Lily Rank that shows how much those characters like each other. As the Lily Rank increase, more bonuses become unlocked between those characters. Some characters can even perform EXE Drives together if their Lily Rank is high enough.\n\nIn conclusion, HyperDimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is an excellent game if you are able to forgive/look beyond the sexualized aspects of it. The characters are likeable and believable, the humour is great and hard to not laugh at, and the gameplay is fun and surprisingly deep. I recommend that anyone who just wants to have a good time purchases this game.","January 14","true","121.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well this might be just the game for you!\n\nI have played this game for about a week now, so I guess it's time to let you know my thoughts on it. This honestly is much more fun that it first appears to be. At first, you may question the gameplay and how the overworld functions - I did a first for a little bit - but once you dig into the gameplay and story, that doesn't seem to be a big problem at all.\n\nFor those that don't play that many RPG's, or that have only been familiar with RPG's such as the infamous Final Fantasy franchise, this may seem like a dissapointment, but I can assure you, you will not be dissapointed! I myself, hadn't played a JRPG before, only FFVII, FFVIII and a little of FFXIII, so the battle system and overworld were a little alien to me, but it's not that complicated - it's very easy to get used to after practice. If you are any big fan of anime and as a plus, visual novels too, this pretty much combines both with an RPG. I also like to mention that the character often 'break the forth wall' by poking jokes at some particular RPG mechanics. E.g. A fight narrator (Neptune attacks.....It had no effect....).\n\nOnly thing I'll have to say as a negative is that this game does require some grinding in places in order to have a fair fight in places that advance the story. Though after a while, I found some charm in this as there are some monster that you can count as "bosses" that can help you level pretty good, while at the same time providing a challenge as well as giving you experience in fighting tougher opponents.\n\nOverall, I said it before and I'll say it again; if you love anime, visual novels, kawaii and characters often 'breaking the forth wall', then this game is for you. I highly recommend it!","December 5, 2015","true","58.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In fact, they made use of cliches and tropes to such a degree that it was funny, entertaining, and enjoyable.  You don't have to go beyond this first paragraph if you don't feel like it, since the remaining paragraphs are merely my extensions on why I like the game and think that you should get it too.\n\nEven though it had the standard "save the world from the villain" plot, the true ending puts a nice twist to the story, and indeed, the story itself is poking fun at the genre that it is in (not unlike a certain other story involving a female demon lord, a hero, his past companions, and the various people that are involved in wars).\n\nThere is an abundance of female characters and some nonsensical jiggling, but since I like girls and I laugh at nonsensical jiggling. . . wwwwww\n\nI can't get enough of Ueda Kana's voice, and the way that the voice actors voiced the cast of characters made the story even more entertaining than it already was.\n\nIf you're worried about grinding pointlessly, don't.  You can pretty much clear the game by doing only the main battles and a few sidequests to find some materials for gears.  The New Game+ feature will also help you in your subsequent playthroughs, assuming you want to get all of your money's worth of the game and find any content that you may have missed in the first playthrough.  That said, New Game+ may be considered "grinding", but then again, there's just no pleasing some people.\n\nIf you read this review all the way here, thank you.

It has that mmo dungeon crawler feel, attacthed to the goofy comedy anime vibe we all know and love. granted ive only played two hours, but so far its been really fun.\n\nOne thing i'd like to note is that this game really needs a controller. It is playable on K&M, however i'm finding it to be much less smooth than it would be if i had a controller. Its relatively easy to look past though. The english voice acting is also not consistently used throughout the whole game leading to odd gaps but whatever.\n\nFor disclosure sake, i'd like to point out the game was $6 on a steam sale when i purchased it, which may make my review more forgiving than others\n\n\nAll in all, if you have a controller, and want to have some kawaii fun with some fan service thrown in, get it. If you like final fantasy, or fire emblem, you will probbaly enjoy this for the change of pace.","March 9","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

THIS GAME IS FULL OF OBJECTIONABLE CONTENT INCLUDING THE SEXUALIZATION OF LITTLE GIRLS, ALSO KNOWN AS 'LOLITAS' OR 'LOLIS', ORIGINATING FROM THE NOVEL OF THE SAME NAME.\n\nLolita is a novel by Vladimir Nabokov, written in English and published in 1955 in Paris, in 1958 in New York, and in 1959 in London. It was later translated by its Russian-native author into Russian. The novel is notable for its controversial subject: the protagonist and unreliable narrator, a 37-to-38-year-old literature professor called Humbert Humbert, is obsessed with the 12-year-old Dolores Haze, with whom he becomes sexually involved after he becomes her stepfather. "Lolita" is his private nickname for Dolores.","February 4, 2015","true","475.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","0"

Most of the fun comes from the cute dialogues and references to anything game related anyway. The charakters break the fouth wall quite often and the overall atmosphere is very light-hearted. The game just wants to be fun and make you smile and succeeds.\n\nThere are tons of items to find, buy and craft. Add a good variety of abilities, spells, combos, some kind synergies between characters (if they like each other, you get bonuses) and you get great possibilities to customize your party. If you like experimenting, the game might be for you. Getting all the Plans, trying things out can be pretty addictive.\n\nThe combat is turn-based on a 2D-Battlefield. Positioning is key, since all attacks have an area of effect. Standing at a wrong place can seriously ruin your day. Attack animations are also pretty good, so cambat is challenging and fun to watch. I strongly recommend a gamepad for the best experience. Playing with keyboard and mouse is possible but doesn't feel great.\n\nI won't comment much on the graphics. Look at Screenshots and videos and decide for yourself. It's a bit outdated but not ugly. Works for me.\n\nHowever, this game is not without flaws.\nThe combat can get repetetive after a while, since the game tends to be quite grindy. You often have to get a few levels because of a difficulty spike and the MMO'ish quests (Kill X of these, bring me Y of that) increase this.\nThe fact that dungeons and enemies are frequently recolored and reused does't make it better either.\nOh, and you have to save often. There is no autosave and when you're dead, it's game over.\n\n\nTo sum it all up: 7/10, fun game with some flaws.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EntroSRL/recommended/282900/","EntroSRL","Entro (Purple Heart)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EntroSRL/","175 products in account","Update: After 51 hours (Excluding hours I left the game running and didn't play,) got all the Achievements for the Game. I enjoyed this game so much that it's literally the only game I actually bothered to do Achievements for. Also the first Game I actually decided to do the Trading Cards for. This is definitely a great casual Game worthy of many playthroughs.\n\nReally surprised with this title so far (14 hours into the Game at the time of this post.)\n\nThe Story is quite... Interesting. It is not your typical straightforward story. The Basic plot is that the CPUs are in the middle of a Console War. Yes, a Console War. This is where your Story starts off. If you can comprehend that and the fact that the game has a lot of 4th wall breaking context to some times insult its players and have wacky dialogue, the Story is for the most part Satirical all the way through, which is very interesting, and I actually like it.\n\nOne main piece of advice I can offer to any one interested in Re;Birth 1: I recommend one of two things.\n\n1. Watch the Anime. (The Anime is an adaptation of the Game, and takes place some time after the other games. Main reason I list this is because it's a good way to get used to the Characters, and if you can handle the wacky / cheesy dialogue in the Anime, you'll fit right in for the Game.)\n\n2. Grind. Grind. Grind, and buy Item Upgrades / make the Upgrades VIA Plans at every opportunity they become available.\n\nPeople say that this Game is pretty easy. Maybe if you played it before it came to Steam, that is understandable, but this Game is by no means easy. It is actually VERY hard / some times frustrating.\n\nThe Game runs Eight Chapters. If you are not grinding / purchasing upgrades at every opportunity, you will notice how hard this Game can be when you get halfway through the 2nd Chapter. The other problem is that the Bosses have a lot of RNG to them, where they can either do a Normal hit to you, a Powerful hit that might kill you, or an Attack that hits all of your Party Members in close range, even if they aren't even in front of the Boss. Reviving your Party Members when they get downed is also RNG, because from what i've experienced in my own Playthrough, the Boss likes to immediately attack and kill the person you revive almost 90% of the time before it switches to one of your other party members. If you're coming into this game thinking that you'll blow through it without using Healing items or Game Over'ing at all, you're in for a rude awakening.\n\nGet used to how the Dungeons look in the first two chapters of the Game, because you're going to be seeing them all the way until the End. I can't knock them on this because if you can tell already that the Game doesn't take itself seriously and that it mocks a lot of things, especially in the Gaming world, you could see this as them mocking Games that use the same Layouts constantly.\n\nSoundtrack is also pretty decent, but a lot of areas unfortunately use the same background music way too often. Can't knock this either for similar reasons that I listed for Dungeons.\n\nIf you can get past all this, this is definitely a very fun game, albeit very challenging as well. Would definitely recommend to any one that likes JRPGs, and I look forward to the rest of the Series coming to Steam.","February 6, 2015","true","92.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The thing that killed it for me, hence only 15 hours or whatever played rather than the 70+ the top reviews have, was the massive grind to beat the second boss. Like, i had to grind for a very, very long time to beat that ♥♥♥♥ing boss. It was awful, boring and killed it for me.\n\nThe combat in this game was pretty awful at first, but after tinkering around and figuring it out, it became a thing of beauty. After a little testing on your own, you'll be able to figure out which moves to use when and how to hit multiple enemies at once. It begins to feel like a little bit of strategy is needed to actually fight, which is nice.\n\nThe sheer amount of content in this game is amazing also. There's so many things to craft and so many characters to level up (and dress up in some cases) that the 80 or so hours of playtime i see most people with is not surprising in the least. However, it can feel a little overwhelming if you're a perfectionist who actually wants to get close to a perfect runthrough.\n\nAnother thing that should be mentioned is the tutorials aren't that great. They don't really explain enough, I feel, and you kind of have to figure it out on your own. That was also another "killer" for me because I spent probably an hour or two just messing around looking through all the different menus to figure out anything mildly helpful. I still honestly don't understand the point of some things or where to find certain items or how to check if an item is good before i spend hours grinding for monsters to drop the one thing i need...\n\nAnyway, most of my problems with the game could probably be easily avoided if you're up for googling and looking for guides before you get in depth. Also, being prepared for the huge grind needed to beat the second boss is a nice heads up.","April 4","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Anyways i dont remember why but this game somehow got brought at some point and well i ignored it for a while then ran out of stuff to do so i was forced.\n\nNow at first i thought it was like the anime trying to be overcutesy but seriously this is gold.\n\nThis game is in all seriousess a love letter to the art that is gaming.\n\npros:\n-The game is long, main campaign takes around 25-30 hours id say, if you want the true ending then that adds a few more hours on and you will want to see it.\n-combat system is highly addictive and satisfying, its simple turn based mixed with hack and slash, a perfect mix of both worlds id say, struggle to think of a way they could improve it apart from adding more attacks or skills at high levels.\n-The storyline is some of the most hilarious stuff that you could ever come across\n-Animations and effects are extremely well done\n-Very good port, no drops, no crashes. its capped at 1080p but modding tools are at hand to change that minor flaw\n-Voice acting is some of the best, they really go with their various personalities, id go as far to say that its some of the best work ever done. Its in english or japanese, pick your poison.\n-Each charecters has their own skill set with 90% unique abilties, mostly the low level stuff is given to multiple charecters but they all have various weapon types so how those attacks come out will vary.\n-In depth lore based around consoles(mostly the older generation). Its a good send off to those consoles that have passed.\n\nCons\n-People that havent played it will judge you(this bothers some people)\n- dungeons cant complex pretty linear\n- graphics dont blow your face off\n- Once finishing the game you will 100% of the time wonder what you are going to do with the rest off your life.(unless you have the sequel)\n\n\nAll in all though, i cant recommend this enough, wheather you like anime or old games or funny stuff or lolis or consoles or lore maybe even general jrpgs this game is one of a kind. It gets overlooked a lot due to the fact that the way it presents itself isnt really the best style to go with in all honesty but when you look past it then its certainly in the top tier of games on the market.\n\nside note: use a controller(keyboard is fine but there is hassle)","July 30, 2015","true","40.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I honestly expected a short poorly developed rpg that was funny, but instead I got a well developed long rpg that is also really funny, and clever with references. There are many pros and a few cons to this game so lets get to those.\n\nPros\n\n-Amazing dialogue and humor was laughing through many parts of the game.\n-Battle initiation system is good with advantages and disadvantages.\n-Battles require you to actually try to win unlike many games that come out nowadays.\n-Superb crafting system with dungeons and items alike. It felt like I was creating the challenge in every area and trying to overcome what I just created and I thought that was fantastic.\n-Great voice acting\n-Many characters to choose from to spice up the game a bit\n-DLC is cheap and worth buying if you plan to play the game through to the end.\n-More then one ending is also a nice addon.\n-The clothes change your appearence (most games fail to do this.)\n\nThere are also a few cons to this game.\n\nCons\n\n-Camera can get very annoying at times.\n-Keyboard controls are annoying.\n-Very repetitive dungeon design.\n-Too much grinding at the early levels which may turn some people off who don't like this playstyle\n\nOverall for turn based RPG lovers this game is a 8.8/10 and recommended for people who like anime style humor games. For people who arent huge fans of anime turn based games it may also be worth it to try when it's on sale.","November 8, 2015","true","58.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

Re;birth1 made me interest in Hyperdimension Neptunia franchises overall and i became a great fan of the franchise because of it. No regrets. Game is really fun with interesting story and the time to time grinding really does not affect the experience of the game. If there was a game i would like to show to people i hang out with, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 would be that game. There really is no way to explain why it is so great, you just have to try it yourself.\n\n9/10","August 3, 2015","true","129.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

One of many quality JRPGs that have finally come to Steam. Here's hoping we get many more.","May 14, 2015","true","6.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it is. The gameplay is good (although, it is a lot easier to play if you have a controller - in fact, it's probably best played with a controller), the characters are funny and the graphics are very fitting for the type of game this is. Although the game is fun, you really need to grind a lot in order to beat the boss fights and stronger enemies which is a downside, but the game offers an item that you can craft to make the enemies weaker, which is good for casual games (like me). I love the combo system, as you can be pretty OP if you know what you're doing, as well as the partner system, which lets you perform special moves if your character's affection (or whatever you want to call it, maybe even the "friendship level") is high enough.\n\nThe game is also quite funny. I wasn't expecting the story to be too amazing, and well, it is pretty good, plus the fact that it's very funny makes it all a whole lot better. All the characters have different personalities and they aren't always just your generic personalities you see in your average slice of life anime.\n\nThe game is very bright and colourful. I was very surprised to see that the game's graphics are as good as they are, even though this is a PSVita port (from what I heard). It's not on the level of a triple-A title, but it's not something from the early 90s. I'd say that the graphics are pretty good overall.\n\nThere aren't many issues that I have experienced with the game. The only issue that I ever had was that my controller sometimes did not work in-game, which is fixed easily by simply restarting the game or PC.\n\ntl;dr 10/10 would nep again.","May 9","true","30.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","6"

There are many references to real things and video games such as Dr Pepper, Vocaloid, Touhou Project, Mario or even Metal Gear Solid. The game also allows you to customize the outfit of each of your characters: you have a large range of outfits and hats for each character (except one or two, maybe). Some of these outfits are inspired from anime, such as Steins;Gate or Senran Kagura.\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 offers a wide range of characters (which are unlocked as you progress) which all have different skills and gear - entirely customizable.\nThis game is fairly long - the DLC's (which are quite inexpensive) can extend the game's length. Though if you aren't willing to buy the DLC's, you can still enjoy the game by going for the achievements (I did!), crafting every item possible or completing every Colosseum challenge and Quests.","February 23, 2015","true","40.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeurnoire/recommended/282900/","Coeurnoire","Black Heart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeurnoire/","494 products in account","Put Star Ocean, Final Fantasy and Phantasy Star Portable together with crazy cute flavouring and you probably have Hyperdimension Neptunia Re:Birth1.\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re:Birth1 is an all-girl casted (spare a few NPCs) turn based RPG that doesn't take itself too seriously, with easy to learn but hard to master combat system. Felistella has taken the best of Hyperdimension Neptunia, Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2 and Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory, ripped apart the first of the three and rebuilt it, bringing us the definitive Hyperdimension Neptunia experience.\n\nThe story is presented using 3D animations in the visual novel style, has decent pacing and the humour has quite a few laughs (but some groans, too). You'll move the story along primarily through dungeons and events activated in one of the game's four cities. Dungeons are explored in 3D third person, with treasure to find, resources to harvest and of course, lots of monsters to fight. While exploring a dungeon, monsters are encounted by making contact with them. You can get a pre-emptive attack on these monsters by performing a Symbol Attack, in which you swing your weapon at their hit box in the dungeon to initiate a battle. Should you fail to do so, monsters have a chance to launch a Surprise Attack. Otherwise who gets the first move is determined by the characters' agility stat vs the monsters'. Once defeated, monsters respawn after about a minute for you to fight again if you so desire, though they are easy to avoid should you not as they have relatively short leashes.\n\nOne thing to note about the combat is that it has some really steep difficulty spikes. All monsters are not created equal, and while the last fight may have gone smooth as butter, the next one may be tough as nails. Certain monsters can become infected with a virus that will recover all damage they have sustained, and provide healthy boost to their stats. A single viral monster can potentially wipe out your party without either careful planning, or a quick escape! The toughest monsters in each dungeon, fortunately will not actively chase you if you don't want to fight them. Seemingly sure of their superiority and unconcerned with your insignificance, 'Risky Monsters' will ignore your existence unless you actively engage them.\n\nOutside of the combat system, the game has fully fleshed out shops with new weapons and armour regularly added. But besides that, the player has the ability to add items to the store through the Remake system. The Remake system is this game's version of crafting, which, as you'd expect allows you to craft items of all varieties including, but not limited to consumables, weapons, armour and costumes. But you can also use the Remake system to, with the right materials, alter the game's difficulty (easier or harder), manipulate which items drop in which dungeons, or even create new dungeons and quests altogether, should you have obtained the required Plan(s) to do so. Some of the harder side dungeons, which are difficult well beyond that of the story dungeons as well as the DLC Colusseum, can add quite a bit of longevity to a playthrough, and into New Game+.\n\nAt its end, as far as JRPG PC ports go, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 sets the standard. After a little buggy release, the game runs smoothly on PC hardware new and old, supporting a wide variety of resolutions up to 1080p (but not 1200p for my monitor, the dastards!). However, it has a fixed graphics quality setting that looks okay but is about par for the course with what a PS3 or VITA would be capable of. My solitary complaint about the port is that the game does not seem to run in true fullscreen. My screen still goes into sleep mode while the game is running if I have walked away for a few minutes. This might seem like an upside to some, but for me it's a minor annoyance.\n\n8.5/10","June 6, 2015","true","40.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I got a lot of good signs from my friends about it before one of them finally decided to buy it.\nBut why is this game as popular as it is? I mean... I guess the writing is good. It's certainly a good parody, but the gameplay is seriously lacking.\nThe combat system is nice but there's just... so much grinding. From start to finish you need to do it. And it's not even slightly enjoyable. In games like Chrono Trigger, Dark Souls, or Ys sometimes I just grind for a while and not even realize how strong I get. But games like this one remind you of how tedious it is. Right when you hit a wall where the reccomended level is at least 12 levels above you.\nThe music and areas are generic, the quests are awful,  the UI is confusing... at least not as much as FF8.\nAlso this game suffers from eggman syndrome\n"NO FAIR! YOU HIT ME! YOU HIT ME! NO FAIR! JUMP! JUMP! NO FAIR! YOU HIT ME!"\n\nALSO LET ME JUST RANT FOR A BIT ABOUT THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RNG ELEMENTS IN BATTLE THAT HAVE WIPED MY PARTY SEVERAL TIMES\nWHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING SOME ENEMIES THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO GO "VIRAL" AT COMPLETE RANDOM.\nTHIS MAKES THEM RIDICULOUSLY STRONG AS WELL AS REFILLING THEIR HEALTH.\nTHERE'S NO WAY TO SEE THIS COMING OR DEFEND AGAINST IT.\nIF IT HAPPENS YOU BASICALLY HAVE A PARTY WIPE. I HATE IT.\n\nReally, if the game is so popular solely because of the community... How is it even popular to begin with?\nHow can I enjoy the story if you lock it behind a bunch of grind walls?\nI guess for now i'll just try to trudge through the game, but I'll by no means enjoy it.\nThere are much better RPGs out there for you to try. With much better gameplay, too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/282900/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","Hyperdimension Neptunia; reBirth1 is a traditional Japanese role playing game combined with a visual novel. The game caters to a niche audience and makes no effort to accommodate newcomers or uninitiated. The storyline borders on the acceptable limits of both the narrative meta and the digital millennium copyright act. The gameplay is demandingly taxing on the player’s patience. Furthermore, the presentation is borderline insanity and will ultimately make or break the experience. Hyperdimension Neptunia reBirth1 is a game that only pleases a very narrow audience through a collection of either off-putting or appealing elements.\n\nThe game’s storyline demands an extreme measure of patience from the player and a great deal of tolerance for overused references and clichés. Hyperdimension Neptunia reBirth1 is set in Gameindustria; an analogous universe that represents the four sided console war of the seventh generation. Each nation or faction is governed by a goddess, or avatar, that represents the faction’s home console. The player takes control of Neptune, an amnesiac avatar who represents Sega, who in turn has to travel the world and gather allies and fight enemies in the respective lands referencing Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo.\nEach nation is headed by a respective goddess with each their own distinct appearance and personality. The ensemble cast is rounded out by characters representing popular franchises and companies such as Tekken and Monster Hunter. The plot has Neptune search the lands for her purpose in life and reason behind the constant attacks on everyone’s nations by a mysterious adversary. The majority of the plot is told through scrolling text accompanied with expressive portraits. The sheer extent of time that is spent reading is jarring. A large portion of the narrative is dedicated to characters’ development, usually manifesting in a three-way discussion on the merits of substantial bosoms or the palatability of dairy products. The discussions are rife with references to videogame history, internet memes and porn chichés which all add up to a staggering number of times that the player will end up rolling their eyes and sighing in mild annoyance. The overall experience is not helped by the characters instance on breaking the fourth wall and actually berating themselves for talking too much, only to resume the cacophony of clichéd locution.\nIn all, the plot wafer thin in depth, richly spread with stale tropes and references.\n\nGameplay revolves around a battle system and exploration with some novel ideals, but ultimately grows stale and monotonous. When not trapped in an incessant lecture on the benefits of fruits from the nightshade family the game plays like a traditional Japanese role playing game. The player explores dungeons with different enemies and treasures to fulfil quests and craft new items. The crafting system allows the player not only to make new weapons and armour, but also reduce the difficulty to increase the amount of power generated when using attacks or the amount of experience points awarded after a fight.\nA general battle will be turn based, with each character being a given a slot in a sequential order governed by the character’s statistics. The player must the position the character adjacent to the enemy and select from the available attacks. Attacks come in three varieties and are either geared toward the generation of EXE power, dealing raw damage or the deterioration of the enemy’s defence gauge. When a certain amount of EXE power is earned additional attacks may be used or the special abilities may be unleashed to generally annihilate the enemy in a grandiose and gratuitous manner befitting of a mainstream Japanese cartoon. While the system is fully customisable and offers some level of depth, it quickly degenerates into an automated sequence where EXE building will be followed by guard breaking and ultimately unleashing the aforementioned special attacks to quickly end the fight. However, while there is a system in place with elemental attacks and a physical versus magic attack split, it hardly ever has any effect on the battle’s procedure; eliminating any all need for proper tactics.\nFurthermore, the game’s difficulty tends to spike to unreasonable levels and demands a degree of mandatory grinding for experience before allowing the player to pass to the next chapter of the story. Naturally, grinding comes into play when using the craft system as it demands items only dropped by certain enemies. These enemies only drop the items by chance, so repetition sets in fast when the same enemy is slain over and over in an attempt to acquire a particular item.\nHyperdimension Neptunia reBirth1 stagnates fast under its almost archaically traditional combat system and barely acceptable random drop mechanics while exploring monotonous and linear dungeons.\n\nThe overall presentation is where game finds its initial appeal, however, upon further inspection will be the most prominent factor for playing or dropping the game. While the game is bright and colourful, both in setting and characters, the game is terribly guilty of reusing its assets to a criminal extent. It is not uncommon to find the exact same enemy in the final stage as one you found in the introduction stage. Only the name will make any difference.\nThe dungeons themselves fall victim to the recycling of assets as well. The game contains exactly one warehouse map, and it is reused five times, each time filled with the same or palette swapped enemies.\nThe main characters themselves in the meantime suffer from stale animations. Characters seem to float over the ground rather than walking on it. Jumping might as well have been teleportation because it violates roughly eight of the twelve rules of animation. When attacking, there is either a blinding flurry with no weight to it, or a brutal swing that looked cool, but did not do any significant damage.\nDuring the story scenes the characters interact through portraits with various expressions. Particular focus is placed on character’s chest area. Considering the lack of assets in the aforementioned region on some of the characters in addition to the rather revealing attire, it might not be the best game to have installed on a hard drive if the player’s country of residence has a legal grey area in regards to the depiction of underage looking characters.\nThe visuals are accompanied by music and voice acting that breach any and all limits that can be endured by a living soul. The music is catchy and appropriately a blend of techno, rock and chiptune. However, the cuts are extremely short, so the same few notes play ad infinitum until insanity ensues. The voice acting is beyond comprehension. Most characters have voices that are so high pitched they can shatter glass. The fact that most of the delivery consists of screaming and yelling only aggravates the situation. Considering that all the of game’s text is voiced will quickly lead to the realisation that in addition to a JRPG, this game also contains an audio book where the entire novel is screamed at you. Luckily the game features an English voice track that is considerable more subdued and less obnoxious in addition to not dubbing half the dialog in lieu of some much needed silence.\n\nIn all, Hyperdimension Neptunia reBirth1 is a very special game with a number of features that appeal to a very small audience. However, for everyone else, this game suffers from stale gameplay, agonising voice acting, grating music, substandard animation and modelling, a bizarre story and dubious character development. Yet, if all of the aforementioned complaints are exactly the elements you are looking for in a game, then I would recommend it. Anyone else will want to take note of it, and rather look for a more conventional game.","June 5, 2015","false","34.0"," 203 of 397 people (51%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","51","203","397","26","20"

If you get them both at the same time for some reason it causes the game to crash the next time you try to save.\ndont lose 3 hours of game time like i did.\n\nalso when i updated my pc I lost all of my 6 hours of progress. So effectively I have to start over. I have not found a fix for this yet unfortunately.

Each character and some monsters are references to games, consoles and or companies. You can fight against pipes from SMB, ghosts from Pacman, pixelvaders, and floating screens containing a scene from some visual novel. Yes.\nThe first companions you meet are Compile Heart and Idea Facory. I mean companies. I mean Compa. And IF.\n\nRPGs often leave questions, such as ,,WHY?!?!? WUT IS DIS RPG LODJIC", but it's not hard to find answers in this game. For example, the first weapon the main character gets is a wooden sword she found in a dumpster. Why did she take it with her? Maybe for...LARPing? (Live Action Role Playing). She's a gamer, btw. And when she enters the forest there's a bunch of dogoos (a mix of dog and slime I guess). And they sound like disgusting pedophiles.\n\ncute girl + wooden sword + slimes which sound like pedophiles = FIGHT\n\nWhen a scene gets really intense, then Neptune usually ruins it by being childish and loud and making some stupid heroic entry, and the other characters tell her that she's ruining the experience for the player. The player and the game are being referred to quite often by the characters, actually. They encourage write♥♥♥♥ to write fanfictions about it, more or less directly.\n\nWhat about the Waifus? Well, in this game there's pretty much every type of girl. There are loud, childish ones, there are calm, nice but naughty ones, there are calm ones which can however get REALLY angry, there are sleepy, slow, really kind ones which can transform into half-naked, fast, sadistic women, there are cute ones, shy ones, flat breasts, big udders, s'is goddit all. It's got it all.\n\n\n\nThe actual gameplay\nIt's a round based RPG, but very different to most.\n\nWhat's typical:\nRound based\nattack, skills, guard, items, escape options\nget exp, money and items by killing enemies\nget money and items by finishing quests\nbuy equipment and items from the store\nsome sort of Tech bar (the Exe Drive Gauge)\nsome sort of ,,Your team was surprised!" system (Symbol attacks)\n\nWhat's special:\nA three-dimensional factor: You can walk around during your round to, for example, get closer to enemies or to run away, get as many enemies as possible with an attack which penetrates everything, close a gap between your teammates and select yourself with a heal-environment skill to heal all teammates around you (and yourself)\n\nCombos: Once you attack, you can do 3 additional attacks. There's Rush combos, Power combos and Break combos. Power combos deal the most damage to the health bar, Break combos deal the most damage to the guard bar (once the guard bar's depleted all attacks do more damage to that enemy until it regenerates), and Rush Combos fill up your Exe Drive Gauge much quicker than other attacks (You don't need that as long as you didn't unlock that gauge (by making progress in the story)). You get stronger combos as you level up, you need to choose which combos you want to use in battle yourself. My advice: Just choose strong Rush and Power combos, and leave Break Combos entirely.\n\nExe Drive Gauge: It's a bar which fills up if you deal damage. If you charged it in one battle, you keep the charge in all other battles in the dungeon until you leave it. You can use it in two different ways:\n1. It unlocks 4th combo attacks in battles. Using them does NOT deplete the EDG.\n2. It unlocks the ultimate attacks of your characters in battles. Using the ultimates DOES deplete the EDG.\nDepending on how far you progressed in the story, you can have 0-4 charges. Some 4th combos require 1 charge to work, some 2, some 3. Same goes with ultimates.\n\nTransformations: Goddess characters, or CPUs can transform into a form called HDD (Hard Drive Divinity). Transformations take 20% of your SkillPoints, but the character becomes stronger, the appearance and personality changes (also names and descriptions of some skills) and skills don't take as much SP as they did before. You need to unlock HDD  before you can use it, by progressing in the story. (DLC characters and unlockable characters (check guides to see them) start off with unlocked HDD).\n\nPlans: You can customize many things. With plans, you can enable items popping up in the store, you can make enemies harder or weaker, you can change items and enemies in dungeons to get special loot, you can unlock new dungeons. To get the swimwear I mentioned you gotta unlock many many dungeons, and sometimes you can miss a plan because you progressed too far. So you gotta load an older save (There's 50 slots) or play through the game and start over with your op characters. With plans you can also unlock special characters, the sisters. If you've watched the anime of HDN, you know what I'm talking about. Cause they came first in the second HDN game, and this is a remake PC port of the first one.\n\nSymbol attacks: If you run into an enemy, whether the enemy gets the first blow or you do depends on the stats of your characters. If an enemy runs into you, they'll get the first blow. If you press the attack button and hit an enemy before it hits you, you get the first blow (Symbol attack).\n\nThere's only 1 fully animated scene, and that is shortly after you start playing. Dialogues are like in a visual novel, with 1-3 characters standing infront of you as a spectator. The characters are animated (breathing, mouth movements, random blinking, head movement) which makes it seem sort of 3D, although they're 2D. Except for the mouth animations, I find them all really well done. I wish they'd move their arms or something, though. Of course there's a text box containing English subtitles, whether you chose Japanese or English voice-acting.\nI can't say how good the characters sound in English, I didn't play it in English yet. Well, except the one point where I forgot to change the language and I heard Compa saying ,,I'll do my best", sounding way too american already, and immediately changed it to Japanese. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nGetting into the game might feel a bit strange, especially if you're playing with a keyboard, then it'll feel VERY strange. But after 2 dungeons I didn't really have problems memorizing the controls anymore, except for a few misclicks here and there, where I'd skip a round by accident.\n\nThe music is pretty awesome. It's got epic music, comedy anime music, retro music. Yeah... don't know what else to say about it.\n\nBoss fights can be really long, but I like the challenge. You can skip any attack animation by pressing some button, but I forgot what it's called on the gamepad. I'm playing with keyboard.\n\n\n\nGraphics:\nTerrain: Low resolution\nEnemies: Depends on the style of the enemy. Some enemies look anime-like, some enemies look realistic. If an enemy is a blue block, then it's a blue block. Probably looks good. But a dragon looks realistic. Reminds me of deathclaws from F:NV. Edgy model, low resolution textures.\nCharacters: Very nice.\nAnimations: Depending on the animation, either awesome, okay or awful. But hey, the original game's some years old.\n\n\n\nPC port\nSome players can't start this game. That's because they're missing the MSVCP110.dll, or they have a faulty one. Download Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4, install x64 and x86. Done.\nKeyboard binds don't show up on the screen.\nSome texture/model placement errors (For example, Nepgear's MK2 HDD C processor part: hair texture's upside-down)\n\n\n\nDLCs:\nEither they're free or they cost 1€. Go buy them. Goh ween.\n\n\n\nThis is an awesome, funny, cute game. Although I don't like round-based RPGs, I love this. It's probably the 3D factor.","April 18, 2015","true","103.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snotnarok/recommended/282900/","snotnarok","Snotnarok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snotnarok/","277 products in account","Welcome to over the top anime wacky nonsense. The game is a massive parody with wacky jokes, parody-pervy stuff and refrences to other things. I don't really like the whole young girl to woman pervy stuff but I'd like to think they did it again as a parody and knew full well what they were doing.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and has a fairly deep battle mechanic from building combos, weapon arc differences, transformations, and seperate equipment slots for both character and transformed character...along with some crafting it sounds deep but it's honestly eased in a way that you can get your mind around it.\n\nThere's been some mention of technical issues, I haven't seen any of this honestly, I'll leave my specs below so you can go off that. A fix I heard is you run the game in compatibility mode and that sorts the problem if you are having them. Check the community hub where they discuss it. While I know they made an improvement in framerate from 30~ on the Vita to 60 on PC, the lack of 1080+ resolution is confusing. Maybe it breaks something that they haven't sorted out yet? But it's not a huge deal. It looks fine so far, I hope they add more options but it's not subtracting\n\nIntel i7 4770k\n8gb ram\ngtx 970\nWindows8.1\n\nVisually the game is all over the place, character models look great, the maps look PS2 era in both texture and model quality, early PS2 mind you. Cutscenes have animated avatars via emofuri which adds some nice flow/movement ...boob jiggle to cutscenes. They look great and it's odd how much depth it adds to what's going on. They're not fully animated, so don't expect characters to twirl and slash weapons in dialoge cutscenes but it's a nice feature.\n\nEverything is a wink and a joke, enemy characters can just be silly or be cat-PS4's called Purr4. So if you're looking for a complex story that isn't 4th wall breaking self parody that mostly revolves around friendship and cute girls or girls with giant ♥♥♥♥? This isn't the game for you. But if you're okay with that or just feel like trying something new? ...Or got the game for a friend whom declined it like myself...It's worth a shot, good comedy rpg honestly...just turn the game to japanese, then lower the voice volume, Neptune can be quite ...lively.\n\nEdit*******\nThey've since updated the game fixing numerous bugs and letting the game run at 1080p. Yay for the people porting this game making it even better.\nThat said I'd love it if they'd fix some of the text that runs out of the text boxes. |:\n\nDLC note:\nThe DLC that you buy you can turn off in game, as you can get characters from it that aren't acknowledged but help you greatly in game. How much do they help? Well if you choose to use them, you'll find in some story battles they don't let you transform- this rule does not effect the DLC characters and you can bypass this, helping the battle be easier. That said you can also choose to not change them as well.","February 2, 2015","true","34.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe the kawaii AF animoo grils. Maybe the fact that it had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ plot. Maybe the tons of hentai doujinshis I would have a more enjoyable time reading after knowing the situation a bit more. But lets be honest here, anime bewbs. The only reason I bought it, and probably the only reason you bought it.\nBeing a weeb seems to have its payoffs though. This game is actually genuinely enjoyable. A cute little story with a simple yet creative battle system, neatly wrapped up in a nice cell-shaded art style. And also anime bewbs.\nThe downside though, is probably the whole badly ported thing. The controls are clumsy, and I would've had an easier time translating the bible into Japanese with my left nut than figuring out how to run the damn thing without it crashing after the logos.\nSo, is it worh buying? If you are an embarassment to your parents, hate yourself and feel you can't go any lower in the pit of No GF and self-loathing you currently inhabit, then go for it. If you want to play the game not for the anime bewbs, then wait for a sale.\n8/10 its aight -IGN","April 28, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RenaTheCookie/recommended/282900/","RenaTheCookie","Batrider's bat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RenaTheCookie/","40 products in account","Definitelly an amazing game. Took me hours to complete it, but I loved every bit of it. It's half a rpg and half a visual novel. It kinda lacks in viarity in creature and section designs, but definitelly doesn't lack in character hat and dress types. And boobs. Cannot forget the boobs.\nThe game is funny and has funny characters all around. And it even makes fun of the average tropes and cliches of JRPGs, which I find very amusing. There's sexual innuendos as well, but they are rather lighthearted ones. Which I didn't mind later on into the game. The story is kinda lacking in my opinion, though. There could be so much more.\nGameplay is fun. It's turn based where you can move around in a area, but it has very little strategy. You just try and smash the enemy as much and as quickly as you can until it drops dead. To add more, there are various sections which can be used to power level really fast. So the story quests should go rather easy if you find out the mosnters that give pleanty of exp and are rather easy to kill with HDD'd ladies (spoiler: yeah, the universe revolves all around technology, specifically computer and computer games. So there's a lot of 4th wall breaking). If you bought all of the dlc, getting to level 999 is quite a trip. Even then though, you can just power level in a few hours of hardcore grinding.\nHonestly, the game is mostly all story, character design and hats, hats and more hats for ladies and their HDD's. Gameplay is fun if you like turn based, brainless smashing and big numbers, lots of grinding, and badges/collectables. I'm not complaining, as I kinda like that. But you should think twice if you dislike any of these things I mentioned, because the game's quite expensive. I'd suggest buying it at a discount unless you are a hardcore fan of the series or you imagine yourself loving the game/series.","April 7, 2015","true","85.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphical improvements for Battle and Dungeon mode. Hell to the yes. 60 FPS Nep Nep yo. SIXTY. FPS. NEPPU. NEPPU. CAN YOU FEEL IT? CAN YOU FEEL THE AWESOME?! Neptune can, albeit maybe too much. Also Noire is my waifu.\n\nOH, and the fact you now get to enjoy the awesome soundtrack of Neptunia on a system that probably has (I say probably, as I power my system with a USB DAC and a mixer) a much more powerful audio amplification system is just Neppu-tastic.

Each character and some monsters are references to games, consoles and or companies. You can fight against pipes from SMB, ghosts from Pacman, pixelvaders, and floating screens containing a scene from some visual novel. Yes.\nThe first companions you meet are Compile Heart and Idea Facory. I mean companies. I mean Compa. And IF.\n\nRPGs often leave questions, such as ,,WHY?!?!? WUT IS DIS RPG LODJIC", but it's not hard to find answers in this game. For example, the first weapon the main character gets is a wooden sword she found in a dumpster. Why did she take it with her? Maybe for...LARPing? (Live Action Role Playing). She's a gamer, btw. And when she enters the forest there's a bunch of dogoos (a mix of dog and slime I guess). And they sound like disgusting pedophiles.\n\ncute girl + wooden sword + slimes which sound like pedophiles = FIGHT\n\nWhen a scene gets really intense, then Neptune usually ruins it by being childish and loud and making some stupid heroic entry, and the other characters tell her that she's ruining the experience for the player. The player and the game are being referred to quite often by the characters, actually. They encourage write♥♥♥♥ to write fanfictions about it, more or less directly.\n\nWhat about the Waifus? Well, in this game there's pretty much every type of girl. There are loud, childish ones, there are calm, nice but naughty ones, there are calm ones which can however get REALLY angry, there are sleepy, slow, really kind ones which can transform into half-naked, fast, sadistic women, there are cute ones, shy ones, flat breasts, big udders, s'is goddit all. It's got it all.\n\n\n\nThe actual gameplay\nIt's a round based RPG, but very different to most.\n\nWhat's typical:\nRound based\nattack, skills, guard, items, escape options\nget exp, money and items by killing enemies\nget money and items by finishing quests\nbuy equipment and items from the store\nsome sort of Tech bar (the Exe Drive Gauge)\nsome sort of ,,Your team was surprised!" system (Symbol attacks)\n\nWhat's special:\nA three-dimensional factor: You can walk around during your round to, for example, get closer to enemies or to run away, get as many enemies as possible with an attack which penetrates everything, close a gap between your teammates and select yourself with a heal-environment skill to heal all teammates around you (and yourself)\n\nCombos: Once you attack, you can do 3 additional attacks. There's Rush combos, Power combos and Break combos. Power combos deal the most damage to the health bar, Break combos deal the most damage to the guard bar (once the guard bar's depleted all attacks do more damage to that enemy until it regenerates), and Rush Combos fill up your Exe Drive Gauge much quicker than other attacks (You don't need that as long as you didn't unlock that gauge (by making progress in the story)). You get stronger combos as you level up, you need to choose which combos you want to use in battle yourself. My advice: Just choose strong Rush and Power combos, and leave Break Combos entirely.\n\nExe Drive Gauge: It's a bar which fills up if you deal damage. If you charged it in one battle, you keep the charge in all other battles in the dungeon until you leave it. You can use it in two different ways:\n1. It unlocks 4th combo attacks in battles. Using them does NOT deplete the EDG.\n2. It unlocks the ultimate attacks of your characters in battles. Using the ultimates DOES deplete the EDG.\nDepending on how far you progressed in the story, you can have 0-4 charges. Some 4th combos require 1 charge to work, some 2, some 3. Same goes with ultimates.\n\nTransformations: Goddess characters, or CPUs can transform into a form called HDD (Hard Drive Divinity). Transformations take 20% of your SkillPoints, but the character becomes stronger, the appearance and personality changes (also names and descriptions of some skills) and skills don't take as much SP as they did before. You need to unlock HDD  before you can use it, by progressing in the story. (DLC characters and unlockable characters (check guides to see them) start off with unlocked HDD).\n\nPlans: You can customize many things. With plans, you can enable items popping up in the store, you can make enemies harder or weaker, you can change items and enemies in dungeons to get special loot, you can unlock new dungeons. To get the swimwear I mentioned you gotta unlock many many dungeons, and sometimes you can miss a plan because you progressed too far. So you gotta load an older save (There's 50 slots) or play through the game and start over with your op characters. With plans you can also unlock special characters, the sisters. If you've watched the anime of HDN, you know what I'm talking about. Cause they came first in the second HDN game, and this is a remake PC port of the first one.\n\nSymbol attacks: If you run into an enemy, whether the enemy gets the first blow or you do depends on the stats of your characters. If an enemy runs into you, they'll get the first blow. If you press the attack button and hit an enemy before it hits you, you get the first blow (Symbol attack).\n\nThere's only 1 fully animated scene, and that is shortly after you start playing. Dialogues are like in a visual novel, with 1-3 characters standing infront of you as a spectator. The characters are animated (breathing, mouth movements, random blinking, head movement) which makes it seem sort of 3D, although they're 2D. Except for the mouth animations, I find them all really well done. I wish they'd move their arms or something, though. Of course there's a text box containing English subtitles, whether you chose Japanese or English voice-acting.\nI can't say how good the characters sound in English, I didn't play it in English yet. Well, except the one point where I forgot to change the language and I heard Compa saying ,,I'll do my best", sounding way too american already, and immediately changed it to Japanese. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nGetting into the game might feel a bit strange, especially if you're playing with a keyboard, then it'll feel VERY strange. But after 2 dungeons I didn't really have problems memorizing the controls anymore, except for a few misclicks here and there, where I'd skip a round by accident.\n\nThe music is pretty awesome. It's got epic music, comedy anime music, retro music. Yeah... don't know what else to say about it.\n\nBoss fights can be really long, but I like the challenge. You can skip any attack animation by pressing some button, but I forgot what it's called on the gamepad. I'm playing with keyboard.\n\n\n\nGraphics:\nTerrain: Low resolution\nEnemies: Depends on the style of the enemy. Some enemies look anime-like, some enemies look realistic. If an enemy is a blue block, then it's a blue block. Probably looks good. But a dragon looks realistic. Reminds me of deathclaws from F:NV. Edgy model, low resolution textures.\nCharacters: Very nice.\nAnimations: Depending on the animation, either awesome, okay or awful. But hey, the original game's some years old.\n\n\n\nPC port\nSome players can't start this game. That's because they're missing the MSVCP110.dll, or they have a faulty one. Download Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4, install x64 and x86. Done.\nKeyboard binds don't show up on the screen.\nSome texture/model placement errors (For example, Nepgear's MK2 HDD C processor part: hair texture's upside-down)\n\n\n\nDLCs:\nEither they're free or they cost 1€. Go buy them. Goh ween.\n\n\n\nThis is an awesome, funny, cute game. Although I don't like round-based RPGs, I love this. It's probably the 3D factor.","April 18, 2015","true","103.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snotnarok/recommended/282900/","snotnarok","Snotnarok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snotnarok/","277 products in account","Welcome to over the top anime wacky nonsense. The game is a massive parody with wacky jokes, parody-pervy stuff and refrences to other things. I don't really like the whole young girl to woman pervy stuff but I'd like to think they did it again as a parody and knew full well what they were doing.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and has a fairly deep battle mechanic from building combos, weapon arc differences, transformations, and seperate equipment slots for both character and transformed character...along with some crafting it sounds deep but it's honestly eased in a way that you can get your mind around it.\n\nThere's been some mention of technical issues, I haven't seen any of this honestly, I'll leave my specs below so you can go off that. A fix I heard is you run the game in compatibility mode and that sorts the problem if you are having them. Check the community hub where they discuss it. While I know they made an improvement in framerate from 30~ on the Vita to 60 on PC, the lack of 1080+ resolution is confusing. Maybe it breaks something that they haven't sorted out yet? But it's not a huge deal. It looks fine so far, I hope they add more options but it's not subtracting\n\nIntel i7 4770k\n8gb ram\ngtx 970\nWindows8.1\n\nVisually the game is all over the place, character models look great, the maps look PS2 era in both texture and model quality, early PS2 mind you. Cutscenes have animated avatars via emofuri which adds some nice flow/movement ...boob jiggle to cutscenes. They look great and it's odd how much depth it adds to what's going on. They're not fully animated, so don't expect characters to twirl and slash weapons in dialoge cutscenes but it's a nice feature.\n\nEverything is a wink and a joke, enemy characters can just be silly or be cat-PS4's called Purr4. So if you're looking for a complex story that isn't 4th wall breaking self parody that mostly revolves around friendship and cute girls or girls with giant ♥♥♥♥? This isn't the game for you. But if you're okay with that or just feel like trying something new? ...Or got the game for a friend whom declined it like myself...It's worth a shot, good comedy rpg honestly...just turn the game to japanese, then lower the voice volume, Neptune can be quite ...lively.\n\nEdit*******\nThey've since updated the game fixing numerous bugs and letting the game run at 1080p. Yay for the people porting this game making it even better.\nThat said I'd love it if they'd fix some of the text that runs out of the text boxes. |:\n\nDLC note:\nThe DLC that you buy you can turn off in game, as you can get characters from it that aren't acknowledged but help you greatly in game. How much do they help? Well if you choose to use them, you'll find in some story battles they don't let you transform- this rule does not effect the DLC characters and you can bypass this, helping the battle be easier. That said you can also choose to not change them as well.","February 2, 2015","true","34.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Completely new to the Hyperdimension Neptunia games, it is quite enjoyable. However, it is a port. Without a controller, the controls definately take getting used to, and rebinding helps a great deal. I personally switched right bumper to E, and changed the Y button to J. That solved most of my issues, control-wise.\nThe game content itself is enjoyable, adorable, and contains moe breast fanservice. The characters are adorable. Although, I will say I went directly to the DLC from the very beginning, because I got the game nearly immediately. Had a few issues with glitches early on, but glitches were quickly taken care of. And as far as that goes, as a first look, it's been enjoyed.","February 6, 2015","true","30.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In addition to the wildly fluctuating fps, the battle system didn't really click with me, and I wasn't interested in the story enough to continue.\n\nI have to say though, this remake of the first game that apparently takes from Victory's battle system has just the tweaks it needed to be really enjoyable. Plus, being able to play the game in 60fps is beautiful, and the port in general while rocky at the start, is great compared to the track record of others.\n\nBeautiful artstyle, self-aware jokes, flashy attacks, fanservice, and enough grinding to satisfy that Disgaea itch, is a recipe for a relaxing experience.","February 4, 2015","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Athmier/recommended/282900/","Athmier","Athmier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Athmier/","107 products in account","Let's answer the question  "Should you buy it?" right now:\n\nAre you an anime fan? Yes? Read on. No? Stay the hell away from this game.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause this game is very much an anime but in a game. It has all the tropes, plot, and "plot ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)" that you'd find in an anime. (And like anime I can't stand english dub so I switched to japanese before I even pressed play)\n\nNow when you look at the screenshots, you might think, "what the heck? Is this some sort of joke? Why is porn on Steam?" Don't worry. It's not as bad as you might expect.  While it can make some nice eyecandy, most of the game revolves around looking at the back of these characters, not the front. You'll be more focused on the gameplay. Although there is a lot of fanservice I found myself ignoring most of it unconciously simply because the gameplay was just good.\n\nRegarding the plot, it's nothing special. It's a generic "only you can save the world" with a spin on being a parody on game consoles. The thing that stands out is the actual dialogue. It's told in a visual novel format that to me is ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious. This and the gameplay is where most of your entertainment will be found.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I haven't played many jrpgs so I can't say how good it is objectively, but I must say I found it very fun. I won't go too in depth, but essentially you have to position your characters to kill enemies with three different types of attacks. Your attacks can get upgraded different ways, either with elemental augments or with the most damage or hits.  It gets repetitive, but I found it entertaining the whole way through.\n\nThe music is like the gameplay; it's repetitive, even more so. But it's nice. I like the tunes and never found them annoying. I only wish they provided the soundtrack through the game files, or at least as a separate purchase. Basically, if you like it, you'll like it no matter how many times they play it. If you don't, you probably should play something else and mute the game music once you're finally sick of it.\n\nI have two major cons  though: manually saving only (aka no autosaving) and grinding. If you die, you get kicked back to the last time you made a manual save. This can ruin your playthrough so make sure you save very often. I did this on accident TWICE losing a good amount of progress and grinding. And grinding is necessary. When you reach the next story boss, they'll always be extremely tough to beat. This makes you required to constantly farm on enemies around your level so you don't get demolished in battle. Fortunately there are grinding guides, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating.\n\nTo summarize, I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of anime in general. You don't have to be a dumb neckbeard weeaboo to enjoy this, but if you're just a casual fan that can chuckle at the occasional boob joke and find the artsyle acceptable then you'll probably enjoy this.\nThere's a ton of content in this game that's worth a playthrough if you're willing. The gameplay, dialogue, and music all come together to make a really fun game, but only if you can bare with the tropes that are very much present in this game and anime.\n\n7 or 8/10 objectively, but speaking with how much I enjoyed it I'd give it a 9/10\n\nTL;DR came for ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), stayed for actually good gameplay and funny dialogue","August 5, 2015","true","40.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As it turns out, Neptunia is exactly that, except for the game is actually WAY MORE fun than any other JRPG here on Steam. Warning: the game is self-aware and makes joke after joke about gaming industry, nerds and themselves. Fourth wall will be broken many times, and trust me, it's a good thing.\nGraphics are nice and colorful, though, I would like a little more detail in them and much more polygons, since the game looks like something just barely better than PS2/XBOX were capable of. Music is kinda just there, nothing really amazing, but worth listen to and doesn't get annoying.\nGameplay is not for everyone and by that I mean it's only for people who like hundreds of menus in their game instead of combat system, leveling-up, beating bosses and managing parties.\nAlso, if you like anime, you're in for a treat.\nBe sure to buy every DLC for this game, since they're cheap and add new content.\n\nNep/Nep, would Nep again.","March 26","true","43.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The animebullsh*t here is just the right way over the top and all kinds of reperences to either games, gaming culture or japanese weirdness are droppes frequently.  Do not judge this game by its cover. The writing is excellent and the English translation is well localised. (I played with Japanese audio and English text so I was able to compare.)\n\nTrue to its theme the game includes a myriad of clothing choices for the heroines - some fairly fanservise-y type :P However, even the most perverted clothing doesn't really have any better stats than the others, so the player is free to choose what clothing pleases their eye the most. I myself felt a bit disturbed by some of the swimwear stuff tbh x'D\n\nIf you are like me an obsess about getting all the achievements and unlocking all the stuff, the game will turn a bit grindy after a second playthrough (new game plus). It took me around 100h to unlock everything, but only 30h or so to complete the storyline once. (And I am a slow player who even grinds before advancing the story after any boss^^)","July 11, 2015","true","100.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is nothing special with the combat systems or any other systems in the game, which makes it's combat pretty generic. I would reccomend picking this game up if you are interested in a good RPG with very good writing.\nAlso before you buy this game you must ask yourself if a nep-nep could nep neps, how much nep could a nep-nep nep?","June 26, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Azune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/k_azune/","28 products in account","So, It's about time I review this game.\nHonestly, when I saw this on sale, I thought to myself that the game will be something like Final Fantasy with lots of menus, tedious gameplay, walking through dungeons fighting on turn-based system with some anime all over it. As it turns out, Neptunia is exactly that, except for the game is actually WAY MORE fun than any other JRPG here on Steam. Warning: the game is self-aware and makes joke after joke about gaming industry, nerds and themselves. Fourth wall will be broken many times, and trust me, it's a good thing.\nGraphics are nice and colorful, though, I would like a little more detail in them and much more polygons, since the game looks like something just barely better than PS2/XBOX were capable of. Music is kinda just there, nothing really amazing, but worth listen to and doesn't get annoying.\nGameplay is not for everyone and by that I mean it's only for people who like hundreds of menus in their game instead of combat system, leveling-up, beating bosses and managing parties.\nAlso, if you like anime, you're in for a treat.\nBe sure to buy every DLC for this game, since they're cheap and add new content.\n\nNep/Nep, would Nep again.","March 26","true","43.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've beat this game to completion on the Vita, and am currently 100%ing it on PC.\n\nPROS:\nNEP NEP IS ON PC WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\nPretty casual battle elements\nSolid, and enjoyable story\nDecent amount of replayability\n\nCONS:\nIt's a pretty iffy (heh) console port, so crashes can and will happen\nCodec packs can screw with the ingame cutscenes\nA battle early on has a pretty solid chance of crashing it\nGrinding is sometimes the only way to progress through a certain part if you weren't murdering every living thing on the map\n\nIt's a pretty casual game, the battles themselves are nothing incredibly difficult, except for a few early game fights (A fair amount of grinding is required to beat these early on). If you're having trouble, you can always activate a 'plan' (gameplay modifiers and the way that you unlock weapons/costumes/consumables) that makes the enemies easier to defeat. Somewhere around an 8.5/10 for gameplay.\n\nThe story is freakin great. The characters are pretty well written (NOIRE IS BEST), most of the dialog is spattered with references to other games and the fourth wall is nigh-inexistant. Overall an 9/10 for story and characters.\n\nReplayability is pretty solid. A single run of the game, if you listen to all the dialog, is easily about 15 hours. There's 2 ending-related achievements so if you're looking to get both endings, it's about 20-25 hours. If you're looking to get all the achievements (DAMN THAT MILLIONARE ACHIEVEMENT) you're looking at a solid 40-50 hours.

It looked good from the store page, and it definitely is enjoyable. It has a similar feel to Agarest Generations of War, at least with the battlefield set-up, however it's a lot more open ended in my opinon, which I honestly prefer. My only complaint would have to be audio skipping in the opening scene, and audio sometimes completely disappearing from the game all together requiring a restart to get it back, I'm not entirely sure what's causing this, it could possibly be my hardware set up, still it's annoying nonetheless. Overall I'd recommend it, despite the glitches in audio that I've had.\n\n*another minor complaint would be no support natively for 2560x1440 resolution, which was a bit of a let down, game still looks fine in 1080p though.","April 8, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

As it turns out, Neptunia is exactly that, except for the game is actually WAY MORE fun than any other JRPG here on Steam. Warning: the game is self-aware and makes joke after joke about gaming industry, nerds and themselves. Fourth wall will be broken many times, and trust me, it's a good thing.\nGraphics are nice and colorful, though, I would like a little more detail in them and much more polygons, since the game looks like something just barely better than PS2/XBOX were capable of. Music is kinda just there, nothing really amazing, but worth listen to and doesn't get annoying.\nGameplay is not for everyone and by that I mean it's only for people who like hundreds of menus in their game instead of combat system, leveling-up, beating bosses and managing parties.\nAlso, if you like anime, you're in for a treat.\nBe sure to buy every DLC for this game, since they're cheap and add new content.\n\nNep/Nep, would Nep again.","March 26","true","43.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You know, anime chicks with chirpy voices and jiggling ♥♥♥♥ in tiny elaborate costumes wielding huge weaponry (giant syringe FTW). Full English and Japanese voice, subtitles and decent although most is not really animated art. The animated art battles are cool, if you like seeing scantily clad chicks do the traditional jump up in the air summon weaponry and fight anime battles. It feels very JRPG consoley. Run around on a giant map, hit enemies or they hit you and a battle starts. Battles are turn based with the ability to run around and choose attacks, and the plot is incomprehesible about some game-land where there are 4 goddesses, one of which gets ganged up on and booted out down to the land where the mortals are, where she is rescued by another jiggly chirpy girl. But youre not here for the plot.\n\nIf you're an otaku fanboy looking for your waifu, or you're a weeaboo, you'll love this game. I'm not so sure on my end, cuz I'm not really into the whole scantily clad anime female fighting other scantily clad females as the ♥♥♥♥ jiggle away.\n\nBut for what it is, and for people that are into it, its good. So I'm not rating it down, with the caveat it is VERY japanese and VERY anime moe RPG. If youre into that, you could do way worse than get this game. If youre not, the chirpy voices and fanservice will annoy you quickly.","June 26, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was a bit skeptical at first when I bought it, but it was 50% off so why not?\n\nBased on the many reviews I've read about the original game, I'm glad that I bought this one. The Remake System that is included in the HDN Re;Birth 1 has done wonders for the game and allowed for drastic improvements to be made overall.\n\nI don't want to get into any spoilers, but I will say that this is one of the best JRPG I've laid my hands on.\n\nThe artwork, plot, characters, music. EVERYTHING JUST FITS PERFECTLY.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but the BGM during boss fights and EXE drives gives me tingles every time I get into a battle.  The light-hearted personality of Neptune just makes everything 9999% better.\n\nI've only just recently hit lvl 999 with Neptune alone and I'm planning on doing the rest.\nThis game is awesome. I haven't even slept yet and I don't even regret it.\n\nNep-Nep 2 sugoi","May 19, 2015","true","108.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had a blast playing this gem right here. The storyline was compelling and the characters absolutely adorable and at the same time...BADASS. So let;s go more in depth shall we..\nMy likes:\n1. The storyline and generally the whole concept of cpus, hdd drive, cds, cassettes...the whole works. Absolutely compelling, plus some instances in the game is absolutely funny.\n2. Characters as mentioned before are well put together, unique and we haave quite a lot of anime themes coming in, tsundere, yandere, the whole works....cough cough, might see likkle yuri too.\n3. Battle system was also a charm, I must admit though the default controls were shiite.....had to change them to suit my purpose.\n4. Requires at least 40 hrs to complete main storyline and sidequests will require much more...\n\nDislikes.\n1. As mention before, default pc contolllers....no just no.\n2. I know the thing seh 'risky and hard' monsters but..... have likkle chill compile heart company studio..\n3. This true ending thing, listen I got the true ending by complete chance...but seh mi never get it...why not give some hints on how to or what I did.

I dont have a gaming computer like most of these people and I still run it better than them :P (Accordign to there reviews) anyway, tips towards the game not crashing... #1: Be patient #2: Don't use too high quality stuff ("gaming" computers seem to suck at running this game) (please excuse the vulgarity) #3: Stop being a little B**** about the game crashing and just play it :P (now I understand you can't play the game if it keeps crashing but just stop being a little baby about your game crashing) #4: If you still can run the game I consider you go to Bestbuy/Nearest or trusted tech retailer, they can help to see how to increase you computers performance (not too sure about that but I've tried at my local Bestbuy and they helped alot) and last but not least #5: Play the game and have fun :3. ☼*SPOILER ALERT*☼  Compa gets *censored* and *censored*... thats my favorite part of the game","February 3, 2015","true","60.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

This battle however has been fought for several hundred years already. When a mysterious voice appears to three of the CPUs, they team up to defeat the remaining one - Purple Heart, Neptune - and knock her down to the main land...\n\nIf you have already played other main-series titles of this game, the gameplay is pretty much the same as always.\nFor those who don't know, there is a generic overworld from which you access the dungeons, shops and other instances, the dungeons themselves where you can walk around, collect items and fight monsters.\nEncounters are - rather than being random - based on "symbols" which are enemies on the dungeon map.\nFor combat you can set 3 characters to fight at the same time. During each character's turn, they may move and choose an action (attack, item, etc.). The CPUs still retain their transformed state, HDD, which increases their stats.\n\nAnd then there's even more stuff you can do, but that's nothing worth noting here (and nothing that would change your mind).\n\nThe grinding isn't as bad as many people make it out to be; a little tactic can help you out. And there's fan-service. Nothing all too significant, but it's definitely there.\n\nDo give it a shot if you have no idea what this is, if you know and like the series or you're just bored.\nDon't if hate the series or Anime in general.","May 25","true","66.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With terms like HDD/CPU, names of the cities (Leanbox/Lastation/Lowee aka XboX/PlayStation/Wii), numerous characters/dialogue a character who's entire existence is to contain references to Steins;Gate, and incessant 4th wall breaks, I was endlessly amused at the writing.\n\n\nCons\n\n- Very unimaginative dungeons. They are not randomly generated and some of the later ones are literally copy-pasted with some different mixes of enemies. There is literally zero puzzle solving and the exploration might as well not exist. It's also impossible to know the leveling of the zones/dungeons aside from just kind of "remembering" the recent ones to gauge the leveling potential.\n- The menu is a huge pain to navigate. Items aren't sorted alphabetically or aren't in many logical orders. You can't do something as simple as buy a weapon and equip it on the same screen, etc. Most of the out of dungeon UI navigation is very cumbersome.\n- Have to be sure that my controller is on when I start the game\n- The game consistently crashes when I start it up if it isn't the first thing that I open on Steam. This might have something to do with the fact that I consistently play with a controller? Anyway, I always had to quickly exit Steam if I wanted to play.\n- Large lack of information in-game. It took me a long time to even find out what the stats do! A lot of mechanics are not transparent at all, which can get quite annoying.\n- The "plan" system is pretty necessary for item advancing/crafting, but some of these parts have a large chain of item hunting that gets really tough to keep track of due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ menu. Break out that pen and paper, I guess.\n\nI'll add a neutral point that the save system is very similar to the ones from older games. You can save during the menu outside of a dungeon and at other save points prior to boss fights and such. It might take some time to get back into the habit of saving as often as possible. You can easily lose some progress if you enter an event and it involves a boss fight, which is very annoying the first few times.\n\nOverall, the game feels like it should have come out in the early 2000s. It reminds me a lot of a 2001 game called Dark Cloud. I enjoyed Dark Cloud a couple of times, but i definitely became more aware of its glaring flaws/shortcomings as I got older and played better games. Additionally, the road blocks in the game can't be overcome by many skillful execution or innovative ideas; instead, you just grind to get more levels. In that regard, it's extremely similar to Pokemon. Since I grew up enjoying both of those games, I think that's the only reason I really enjoyed this one.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'd give it a 6.3/10.","April 13","true","34.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's thanks to the remake system which provided tons of milestones : i never grinded only for XP i made plan after plan and i leveled up along the way. Also you can skip all animations which makes the whole thing much faster and less tedious.\n\n- There are a few absurb spikes in difficulty at the beginning of the game. It gets better though so dont give up.\n\n- As far as RPGs goes this is more of the sitcom kind. Dont expect a deep story it's about characters you like (hopefully) having fun and being silly. With a ton of references to games.\n\n- You can play with a keyboard just fine but you'll have to remap pretty much every single key. Also the game will still display the originals buttons so you'll have to remember what is what. Took me some getting used to and a few trips to the config section.\n\n- There is a moderate amount of fan service (panties, cleavage, jiggling boobs). You can "upgrade" to softcore hentai with mods if you're into it.\n\n- The music is okay. Nothing i wanted to listen outside the game but nothing that made me want to turn the sound off either.\n\n- This game recycle dungeons environnements and monsters models. A lot.\n\n- The achievements are all fairly easy but will take some time. The "millionaire" one is particularly grind heavy, even more so if you dont have the DLCs (to raise the level limit and get access to more powerful ennemies).","April 15","true","63.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This battle however has been fought for several hundred years already. When a mysterious voice appears to three of the CPUs, they team up to defeat the remaining one - Purple Heart, Neptune - and knock her down to the main land...\n\nIf you have already played other main-series titles of this game, the gameplay is pretty much the same as always.\nFor those who don't know, there is a generic overworld from which you access the dungeons, shops and other instances, the dungeons themselves where you can walk around, collect items and fight monsters.\nEncounters are - rather than being random - based on "symbols" which are enemies on the dungeon map.\nFor combat you can set 3 characters to fight at the same time. During each character's turn, they may move and choose an action (attack, item, etc.). The CPUs still retain their transformed state, HDD, which increases their stats.\n\nAnd then there's even more stuff you can do, but that's nothing worth noting here (and nothing that would change your mind).\n\nThe grinding isn't as bad as many people make it out to be; a little tactic can help you out. And there's fan-service. Nothing all too significant, but it's definitely there.\n\nDo give it a shot if you have no idea what this is, if you know and like the series or you're just bored.\nDon't if hate the series or Anime in general.","May 25","true","66.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having played Hyperdimension Neptunia from its very first installment up to Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory on the PS3, I can say that having this game on PC is definitely a better experience even if just for the 60 FPS improvement alone.\n\nI'd never played anything from the "Re;Birth" line and I've been pleasantly surprised by how much of an improvement this remake of the first game is. It's not a simple remaster at all, it's literally a remake.\n\nTasteful dialogue has been added to this game alongside the battle system from the later installments in the series, which makes it a genuinely fun game to go through instead of a headache-inducing experience. Speaking of headaches, if anyone here has played the first game on the PS3 then you'd know how much of a pain some of the soundtrack was to listen to. Even the soundtrack in this game has been composed completely differently and the pieces are pretty fun to listen to. High energy with catchy melodies and the mixes themselves are great.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing either the Japanese or English dub, it simply all comes down to personal preference. The only gripe I have with the English dub is that it doesn't have voice acting during quite a few scenes where the Japanese one does. If you're the type of person who doesn't care about the language or expression, and would just like to have a full audio experience with speech, then the Japanese option will give you that. Otherwise the English dub is still quite good. I myself am indecisive and keep switching between the two.\n\nThe visuals are of course much better in the PC version due to the improved framerate, and although the game doesn't have an in-built 1080p resolution option, there is a work-around posted in the forums.\n\nIf by any chance you are having issues with this game involving cutscenes being automatically skipped, you simply need to go and install CCCP or the "Combined Community Codec Pack". It'll fix a lot of issues you may have with other forms of media as well. Thankfully I've yet to come across a single bug in this game myself.\n\nIt's been said by a fair few people, but it's true that a controller is optimal for playing this game. The in-game tutorials present you with buttons for a controller setup without giving you direct guidance for a mouse and keyboard, and even when you work it all out it's pretty unpleasant in its default state. Don't let that turn you off from this game if you're interested though, because you can just reassign everything obviously. Even still, go grab that controller to make it easy.\n\nAll-in-all this is the best Hyperdimension Neptunia experience I've had yet in terms of visuals, audio and performance. If you're a fan of the anime aesthetic, light-hearted humour, cool combat and JRPGs in general, then you're going to have a blast with this game.

I had no idea what to expect when I was thrown ino this world. Good thing I didn't get time to prepare! Right from the get-go, this little lady Neptune, I had seen around the internet captured my attension, and she didn't let go!\n\nFrom what I read online after Neptune herself commented, "They really changed the story with this remake!" They really did change the entirety of the thing and it's suggested even those who played the original get into this too.\n\nLet's talk about what this game is. Hyperdimension Neptunia is a traditional JRPG that parodies every bit of gaming you can imagine. From locations, like Halo Mountain and the Hyyrule Snowfield, to the discs upgrades which allow you to 'create' games like CoD and other such that give you awesome stats, to the fact they've stolen some Tales Of Series Hi-ougi (Mystic Arts). This game is a wash with references to Gaming, even Visual Novels like Stein's Gate get a nod. For those of you raised on gaming, this is a tribute!\n\nThe Combat system is the games most polished and strongest point. It reminds me of a far better version of the old Quest 64 Battle system, On your turn you move within a certain circle on the battlefield to approach or get away from enemies and then unleash your combo attacks to ether build upyour EXE gadge for specials, break attacks which lowers the enemies guard bar for extra damage if it's depleted, and simple power attacks for damage. The characters have their own set of combos.\n\nSpeaking of the characters, they're fantasic, you have the four Console Patron Units, and Company self inserts, alongside of oneliner joke characters like Maryo and David Snake.\n\nThere are several weaknesses in this title however. First of all, level design, the 'dungeon' areas are lazilly constructed and most are carbon copies, like seriously they litterally just copied and pasted the exact same locations with different enemies. Sometimes its nice that you don't have the feeling of, OH ♥♥♥♥ BRAND NEW PLACE, but the level design is simply lazy. Of course all the enemies are recolors too, but this is a JRPG, par for the course.\n\nAnother problem is localizaton. It's bad, the dub is obsence, we're talking 4kids tier, the translations are censored and oftentimes wrong. I hope Idea Factory International does a better job for next ime becuase the character voices aren't going to improve, they're all set! At least they give you Japanese Voices.\n\nOne other thing of note is this game is extremely grindy. As people discoveraround the level 10 mark you're going to have to grind hard. Luckilly the guides on Steam are solid and will assist you in time saving, but there are people who can't stand the grind.\n\nAll in all, especially with these weaknesses, if you can feel yourself enjoying the characters and the combat system alongsie of the strong story and the references that abound. I feel like you'll love this game and won't mind the repitiveness of the level desgin.

Like most jrpgs, however, you need to do a lot of grinding. Spoiler alert: you'll want to be level 80 before you face off the final boss. There is new game+ and you get to keep all levels/items/etc that you've found/bought within the game, so there's plenty of replayability after you beat the game. Besides, there's a few characters you need to unlock through two separate playthroughs if you're going for all the achievements.\n\nAlso, boobs.

I had to grind till i was lvl 17 to stand a decent chance. now dont get me wrong i dont mind grinding, but when you have to grind nearly 10 lvls just to be a match and hafta use ALOT OF ITEMS IN THE BATTLE, its kinds ridiculous. and to put this calculation into perspective for you(once you hit lvl 12 you have to kill everything in the valley 2wice to get to lvl 13 so you can imagine this was a long process. and im not even gonna mention the dragon in the valley other then dont try to fight it till you reach lvl 25 (min). so for a score 9/10 for storyline but 6/10 for gameplay <--mabey a little too generous. and lastly for those who wanna know. DLC does not make the fighting and gameplay broken. i kinda wished it did (or atleast made it easier for me) so for a overall score of 6.5/10 for the game. not a bad way to waste time if youve got the "memory" for it..   haha","March 12","true","34.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Like, a DISSIDIA: Final Fantasy-like twist. You move characters semi-freely in a controlled area in order to adapt and survive more creatively than just the simple status effects and buffs that most games of this genre are limited to. The music has a funky fresh feel for the most part, but it will fit the mood when the mood gets moody. Hype Nep-Nep is very story-driven and also linear, but you can take things at your own pace to stay on top of your game. The Re;Birth series is a remake and it knows, oh how it knows. The fourth wall is virtually non-existent and we are all reminded that Neptune knows what the gamers want. I recommend this for those who like rpg's that are class-based, not class-ruled, and fair warning... I hope you like the grind. Because the grind is real. It is oh so real.

And I would give it a 8.5/10\n\nFor me the most important thing are the mechanics for grinding, leveling and battle system on any RPG. And as this was my first 3D turn based RPG, it was fair easy and quick to understand to truly enjoy the battles each time.\n\nThe difficulty is important too and even when this is the fastest RPG I beat in real time it requires a good grinding between bosses as those can be pretty tough; don´t expect your nowadays easy RPGs were you can beat the story mode without even grind at all.\n\nThe music is attractive and keeps you entertained while playing to fit each battle, specially the boss's theme as it should be. But I still cant help myself and feel like one specific track was directly taken from a Phantasy Star's game but I cant land my finger on wich one or be 100% sure about it.\n\nMy only disappointments were:\n-Enemy's skins: not too many enemy so the "colors" change for map and difficulty.\n-Maps: More than once, the dungeon's repeat the same maps don´t brings you high hopes when you visit a new dungeon for the first time but you already know where to expect monsters and the though enemy.\n-Lack of interaction: there isn't just enough time or events to get to know all the characters in the game as good as I would like to, I guess is to expect since this is a portable remake but it feels a little unfair.","May 28, 2015","true","124.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game does not take itself seriously whatsoever. It is packed full of references to anime and video games, and half the fun is trying to pinpoint them all. The other half of the fun is the combat. It is surprisingly compelling, considering what game we're talking about. The attacks feel satisfying and the combat has some depth, but the difficulty does spike at times. Sometimes you can even walk straight into a game over without realizing it. On the plus side, I have to say this game has some creative enemy designs. You can fight anything from a walking eggplant with a nurse cap to a two-legged horse with wings to a tetris block from hell. In the end, this game is just as genius as it is stupid.\n\nThe port is also really bad, and does not at all explain the PC controls. It is by all means playable with a keyboard, but the controls are really awkward. I recommend you play this with a controller if you can.\n\nAlso, there is fan service.

The combat system actually makes sense with the improved combo system. Items can now be used as and when without resorting to some percential system as seen in the original. The dungeon environments are reasier to navigate as is going from one nation to the next, the original had a really awkward mini dungeon which had to be traversed to travel between nations. This was really tedious.\n\nThe visuals look lush on the PC. Running at 1920x1080 makes everything just pop visually. The frame rate is outstanding. I have not run into one single bit of stutter, glitch or tearing with the visuals. Something that I would find repeatedly with the PS3 original.\n\nThe story has also had a tighten in this remake. While it is still heavily cutscene driven, it is nowhere near as bad as the original. There were sections that would be bogged down with massive exposition dumps, now they are streamlined and while still lengthy offer more enjoyment.\n","July 5, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Though for this review I am gonna try my hardest to look at it from a neutral perspective while noting things that are bias. Also I have to note that I have not played any other game in the serie, and I do not plan on playing any of the older games. But I am quite excited to play Re;Birth 2&3\n\n(This is also my first ever review)\n\nIf you do not feel like reading my whole review then here is a summary in Pros and Cons\n\nProsAddicting\nFunny Characters\nGood Animations\nGreat DLC\nA lot to do even after the storyConsShort Story\nConfusing Stats\nA lot of text\nDull if you do not like weird humour Story6/10 (Written from how I saw the story)\n\nIntro:\nThe story is set in a virtual world called Gamindustri, this dimension is ruled by 4 CPU’s that each rule over one of the big land masses. Neptune/Purple Heart of Plantune, Norie/Black Heart of Lastation, Vert/Green Heart of Leanbox, Blanc/White Heart of Lowee. These 4 rulers have been locked in an eternal war called the console war. During one of the battles, 3 of the CPU’s heard a voice that told them to gang up on Neptune and basically kicks her out of Celistan (A dimension only accessed by the CPU’s and other goddesses). This is what ended up happening and Neptune lost all her memories in the process. After falling from the skies Neptune was found by a girl called Compa that ended up taking care of here.\nMain Story:\nThe main story of the game follows Neptune and Compa and later on many more friends in their quest to restore peace to Gamindustri as an evil Goddess named Arfoire. Arfoire plans to steal the goddesses powers and become a god over Gamindustri.\nPersonal Thoughts:\nThe reason I vote the story quite low is for one reason and one reason alone. I wish there was more. The concept really went home with me and I really wish the game was long and therefore the story being longer. I thought this game was just gonna be wall of wall of wall of text over and over again. So I used the speed up option a lot. Later on I realised that the story was quite interesting and I decided to take my time reading it all and I really enjoyed it.Overall I really like the story,  I am also a person who usually plays games because they are awesome and do not care that much about the story, but as I said this story felt great to me.\n\n\nCombat7/10\n\nThe combat in this game is quite standard to JRPG’s. The onyl unique thing I would say this game as interms of combat is that after you do a normal attack you get the option to use a “Rush”,“Strong”, or Break ability. Depending on which you use you can difference effects and outcomes. If you have played other JRPG’s then you will be able to jump straight in and understand most of it quite fast. Most new JRPG players should be able to understand the system quite fast as well. The animations for the attacks are all really awesome and beautiful, and really add that extra bit of awesome feeling when you unload your strongest attacks. One big complaint I have (reason it is not a 10/10) is that you get really confused while reading the stats of your characters. There is nowhere (at least that I found) were it explains what every stat means. This can be really annoying while you are leveling as having more in certain stats for some bosses can help.\n\nDLC10/10\n\nWhen I first found out that the game had DLC I thought it would just be another DLC driven game. Oh boy was I wrong. First of all there are 5 DLC’s you would have to buy to have them all, the total cost of these 5 are less 6€. So the DLC’s are cheap, but what do they add you might ask? They only add bonus content that is no way needed for completing and getting both the endings of the games. The DLC’s add things like, more characters to play, new dungeons, more items that you get from those dungeons. And the DLC’s each raise the max level with 300 meaning if you have all 3 your max level will be 999 instead of 99 as in the original game. If you ask me THIS is how DLC should be made, being cheap and not affecting the experience of the story.\n\n\nTo me this game is almost perfect with only a few elements like the stats and the story bringing the game down a bit, but you can not have everything now can you. I rate the game as a whole 9/10.\n\nTo end this review I am gonna answer some questions. And of course all these answers will be based on my personal opinion\n\nQuestions.\nIs the game worth getting?\nYES, this game is really worth getting.\nIs the game worth the price?\nTo be fair, I think it should be a little bit cheaper then it is now. Maybe 20€ instead.\nWould I recommend this game to a JRPG/Non-JRPG player?\nJRPG: If you like JRPG’s you will most likely like this game, and if you like Anime as well (Like me) I can almost guarantee that you will LOVE this game.\nNon-JRPG: I would not recommend this game to someone that is trying to get into JRPG’s but if the person has a little experience with them I would send the game their way.","July 15, 2015","true","93.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/incendiarylemon/recommended/282900/","incendiarylemon","IncendiaryLemon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/incendiarylemon/","245 products in account","If I were to look at this game purely from an objective stand point, I'd probably go as far to say that this is not a good game. In a lot of ways it's a fairly bad game. The areas are incredibly repetitive going from Forest area to Snow area to Factory area pretty much exclusively bar the last dungeon, and not only are these dungeons very repetitive, they are also incredibly short 90% of the time and very linear 100% of the time. They are not randomly generated meaning you get one short floor and this gets tiring very fast as this can be, at times, an absolute grind fest of a game, especially early on, not so much in the late game. The music is incredibly forgettable and doesn't stand out at all and the voice acting (in English) ranges from pretty decent (Sam Reigal and Cristina Vee) to pretty awful (Almost everyone else). The story is very generic with the entire story being 'Evil Witch wants world domination' and the characters are also fairly one note receiving only small amounts development throughout.\n\nThat being said, when I look back at the time I had with this game, I had a good time. The game has it's charm, it's certainly not a bad looking game, the art style and direction is very nice with the characters design being good between all the different characters. The combat system implemented is very fun and active, going for a slight twist on Turn Based Combat, allowing characters to freely roam the arena and positions playing a role in combat. It reminded me of Ni No Kuni's combat, which I also enjoyed. There is a variety of different moves that are unlocked throughout the game that are all very well animated and are fun to watch (Even if that fun is diminished somewhat the 100th time you've used them) and there are a ton of characters to unlock on use which all play quite differently. The regular moves that you do in battle are also quite customisable, as you are allotted a certain amount of points to allocate to Guard Break, Power or Rush moves, and you can customise the moves to suite your play style. As well as combat customisability, there are also a variety of different costumes to change the appearance of all the characters if you're into that kind of thing (and if you're they type of guy to play this game, chances are you are) as well as accessories which change appearance as well. The game can also be quite funny at times, depending on your sense of humour.\n\nWould I recommend this game? That is entirely dependent on what kind of games you like. If you were put off by anything that I said in that first paragraph, this game probably isn't for you and if you're not really into self aware humour, then avoid it like the plague. While this game certainly isn't a masterpiece, I had my fun with it and I would recommend it any of the stuff in the second paragraph sounded appealing. I don't think I'd pay full price for it (I bought it at 50% off) but for the price I paid, I definitely think I got my money's worth.\n\nFinal Playtime: 34 hours 54 minutes.","February 16, 2015","true","37.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/haruharuharuka/recommended/282900/","haruharuharuka","Haruka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/haruharuharuka/","3517 products in account","In the game industry of our world we have seen countless companies come and go, bringing us amazing consoles, epic games, and so much enjoyment and innovation. From the simple joysticks and clunky cartridges of the past, to the sleek disc-based consoles of today, videogaming over the ages has told a rich and and storied saga. Now imagine if you will, a world where people live and die based on the market shares of their respective game comnpanies. A world where software pirates and modchip makers are the scourge of the seas. A world ruled by digitally deified divas who symbolize the hopes and dreams of their console nations. Welcome to the digital frontier of Gamindustri!\n\nReleased last year on the Playstation Vita, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 has now been ported onto the PC, and is offered for sale exclusively on Steam. The entire experience is here, with all the trimmings (including plenty of DLC to buy!). Sadly it's been a little clunky so far, with many issues popping up here and there, but Idea Factory has been fast to listen to fan feedback and fix everything up! It's good to see they care about their fans at this level, some companies (COUGHSQUAREENIXCOUGH) can;t seem to take a hint about what their fans think. I'm confident though that IF knows their fanbase, as they have handled everything smoothly thus far.\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 marks the fourth outing for the series, and though it may be a reboot it is also the longest, most hilariously off the wall and over the top game to grace the series yet. If Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2 was considered a reboot of the original, then perhaps that makes Hyperdimension Neptuinia Re:Birth1 a reboot of a reboot! This literal rebirth of the original game takes the original story, polishes it up a few notches, and sticks it on top of the gameplay system that made Hyperdimension Neptunia: Victory so great.\n\nTo be brutally honest, the original Hyperdimension Neptunia for PS3 was an absolute soul-breaking slog, with hours of grinding and frankly boring combat dragging the experience on. The only saving grace was its story, which made the most of things with its masterful console war allegory. Thankfully having been moved over to the gameplay stylings of Victory, Re:Birth1 is propelled high and above its clunky progenitor. With the far more exciting battle system on offer in this entry, traveling through the games myriad dungeons and leveling up no longer feels like such a chore. Unrestrained by the formerly boring gameplay, the story is now free to take center stage.\n\n\nWhen it comes right down to it, Re;Birth1 is STILL a shining example of that the series can offer. The PC library could definitely use more JRPG experiences like these, as it's mainly been a bland morass of western RPGS until now. I for one would gladly go for every Neptunia adventure again if they were to be ported to the PC. Now get on Steam and buy this awesome game, or I'll send Iris Heart after you!","July 4, 2015","true","40.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not too texty, great graphics, amazing in game jokes and challenging gameplay. You might have to grind a bit here and there but there are enough uber bosses so that you will definitely not get bored of that either. Interesting character customization system based on sympathy among the characters allows you to execute team limit break attacks which actually make quite a difference. Play smart and you won't have to play hard. Definitely worth your money.","April 11, 2015","true","35.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"
