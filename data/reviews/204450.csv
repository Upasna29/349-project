Well, some may argue it's only the third real Call of Juarez game, since the previous one, Call of Juarez: The Cartel, did have a rather different and more modern-day background. As The Cartel did not get a particularly positive reaction, many thought the series had went off-track. But they were far from the truth: with Gunslinger, Techland has for me made not only the best game in the series, but probable the best Far West-shooter ever. A bold statement, so let me explain in detail.\n\nThe concept of the game is original and well thought-off. You play as the bounty-hunter Silas Greaves, who tells his story in a Far West-saloon to a bunch of regular customers. As his story unfolds, it soon becomes clear Silas has a penchant to exagerrate some parts of it, which is why his  story is more and more questioned by his audience. This idea of "truth or false" is cleverly catched upon by the collectible items that are to be found throughout the game. These "nuggets of truth" give a fairly detailed amount of information on the history of the Far West, its main protagonists and some lesser-known historical facts.  The entire game provides prove of the love of Techland's crew for this setting: every bit of it, from the very easy to manage menu's right up to the credits, bathes in a unique Old West-style. There are countless references to the history of 19th-century America, and to the influence this period had on later arts such as literature and, ofcourse, movies.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay: it leans more towards an arcade shooter than towards a tactical or realistic game. There is a fair arsenal of weapony, each with some characteristics of their own, but most enemies go down easily and swiftly. What makes the shooting really fun, is the idea of the "combo": whenever you manage to shoot several enemies in a row, a multiplier comes into play, so that your experience-points go up that much faster. Getting one more kill in a row so becomes a goal of its own. Since experience-points are connected to a clever system of levelling-up and gaining interesting skills, getting longer kill-streaks soons becomes a true challenge. Added to these are two special effects: bullet-time, triggered by special shots like headshots or piercing shots, and the "sense of death", which allows you to dodge bullets at the last moment. Boss fights come in two types: normal ones against more powerful foes, but also as typical Old West-duels, in which a totally different method of playing is needed. These feel a bit trial-and-error at first, but after some practice, still can provide their share of the fun. And they provide great links to several Westerns, starring the great Hollywood-heroes of decades ago.\n\nGraphically, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is very good-looking. The game uses a comics-style with cel-shaded graphics, loosely comparable to the Borderlands-series. Enemy-animations are fairly standard, and enemies don't come in that much varieties. However, these are minor criticisms, since the game comes at a very acceptable price, although it has the scope and content of a true AAA-title. After finishing the main story (which took me about 8 hours), there's a New Game Plus-mode, very useful to collect the XP needed in order to unlock all of the skills, and a True West-difficulty, in which most of the HUD is disabled.\nVery entertaining is the Arcade-mode, in which ten of the games' maps can be replayed with as sole objectivity to get as much points as possible by making very long kill-streaks. Since the Steam-integration also comprises global leaderbords, tihs is great fun as I tried to get up the rankings a bit.\n\nGameplay: 26/30\nGraphics: 17/20\nSound: 8/10\nTechnical stability: 9/10\nLongelivety: 8/10 (thanks to the several difficulty-levels and the Arcade mode)\nSteam Integration: 10/10 (really perfectly done, with a great bunch of achievements that let you discover several special aspects of the game - and do try to collect all of the "nuggets of truth"!)\nPersonal appreciation: 10/10 (I just LOVE this game)\n\nOverall score: 88/100\nCall of Juarez: Gunslinger is one the best games I've yet played this year. It's a great, arcade-type shooter, with much more content hidden just below the surface. It's unique low-price makes this a must-buy!","September 22, 2014","true","29.0"," 146 of 154 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","146","154","7","7"

The levels are narrow and the mechanics are simple, but the overall experience is downright riotous. It is designed to simultaneously feel comfortingly familiar and adventurously fresh. Put simply: it is a very easy-to-digest FPS game that boasts a strong and unique identity. Both established fans of the genre and those who are generally on the fence would be wise to give this game strong consideration.\n\nCall of Juarez®: Gunslinger embraces the Wild West  of the late 19th and early 20th century for its setting and atmosphere, with a jovial emphasis on the “Wild” part. The graphic style is in the same vein as that of Borderlands, although slightly more realistic; but the overall ambiance is definitely more focused on fun than realism. And the narrative is great. It is funny and compelling, it flows at a very enjoyable pace, and it touches on “real” folktales from the Wild West era. But more than that, the style of storytelling used in the game is exceptionally well-crafted and delivered near perfectly, with excellent voice acting. It comes together to establish an outstanding presentation.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, it is admittedly quite limited compared to some modern FPS games. There isn’t much variety to your arsenal, enemies, or to the level designs. However, there are great fundamentals inherent to the game. The gameplay is fun. It really is. There is pretty much nonstop action, and the firefights are always exciting. The game features a slow-mo power aspect, or as it is frequently called, “bullet-time.” And you are rewarded for scoring high combos during the firefights by receiving more bullet-time energy and exponentially more experience points. As you gain levels from those experience points, you can unlock passive abilities that make you more deadly. It is a simple system, but it is rewarding. As for the levels, they don’t allow much exploration or alternate pathing, and are mostly narrow. But since the game is highly story-driven, it is a fitting design choice.\n\nProbably the most defining feature of the game, (and franchise), is the dueling minigame. It can be frustrating at first, but after you learn some of the intricacies it becomes easy and pretty fun. There are duels peppered throughout the campaign in the form of boss encounters, and there is also an auxiliary duel mode in a score-attack style. The dueling feature is a leading contributor of the game’s charming and unique identity.\n\nThe game runs on a checkpoint system where the checkpoints are both frequent and effective. There is also a level-select option that lets you replay certain levels at any time. As always, I would still prefer the option to save manually; but in Call of Juarez®: Gunslinger the system used is quite adequate and due to the linear nature of the levels, will never set you back more than a minute.\n\nIt all adds up to an undoubtedly enjoyable experience. It isn’t a very long or sizable game by any means, but the campaign is very fun and has decent replay value. I can easily recommend this to all fans of the genre, big and small, new and old. If it looks like something you would enjoy, it probably is.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","February 24","true","12.9"," 106 of 113 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","106","113","4","9"

Besides the campaign there are other 2 modes Arcade and Duels where you can compete with your Steam friends for the highest scores.\nNow the downside, there is no multiplayer/Co-op whatsoever and it would’ve been nice if they had added some kind of horse experience, after all what’s a western without that?

My only gripe is, that the game is too short. Most of you will beat this in around 6 hours. But considering the low price, this is absolutely fair. Especially because you'll want to replay it immediatly after finishing it. At least thats how it went for me. Call of Juarez:Gunslinger is a very linear western shooter, that doesn't have anything in common with the other CoJ games.Exept for the setting of course. It tells a very interesting and humorous story, wich makes you laugh while exploding enemys in Over-the-top blood fountains. The artstyle is comicy and creates some beautiful scenerys, while you listen to the fitting soundtrack.\nNow for the interesting part: The gunplay in this game is mindblowing. Lining up a row of headshots has never been more satisfying. The weapon arsenal is not really big, but you'll find something for your taste and stick with it.\nSo, in conclusion, if you like FPS Games at all, if you like a well told story and a good laugh, buy this game and thank me later :)\nSincerely,\nFISTING SANTA","November 25, 2013","true","14.2"," 109 of 121 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","109","121","0","1"

There are no sidequests, no puzzles, no npc:s to talk with, just headshots after another.\n\nThe two main hooks for me were the satisfying gunplay with guns that feel like they make an impact. And the revenge story told by the protagonist who acts as an unreliable narrator. Some scenes you need to play again, because the story didn't happen as it was told the first time.\n\nFor the guns, you get to choose from revolvers, rifles and shotguns. Skills for these weapons can also be upgraded by gaining experience points. Headshots, combos and double kills give more xp than normal kills.\n\nEnvironments felt a bit stale and repetitive. Which is also highlighted by the lack of civilians in the few town maps.\n\nThere's also a "bullet time" mechanic that you can use, in which the time almost completely freezes and enemies turn red for easier spotting. During that you can take your time to line up a nice headshot combo. This is limited by energy bar that refills with kills.\n\nMany boss fights felt a bit boring when those were just horde of enemies and/or one really resilient enemy on top of that. But sometimes you get to duel in a stand off which is nice change of pacing. In these you need to keep focus on the enemy with your mouse and get your draw hand in better position with the keyboard.\n\nCall of Juarez is really simple and short but still quite fun game.

I can't remember the last time I started an FPS and "couldn't put it down" as is the case with this one.\n\nEven the most experienced players will find plenty of fun and challenge here.  The role-playing/skill-up elements add to what would otherwise still be a very good FPS, and the "nuggets" of wild west history are just icing on the cake and all interesting reads.  I actually couldn't wait to read each one after I found them.  Be careful you may end up researching old west history after playing this game.\n\nThe boss fights are fought both in traitional fps style, and in old-west style "duels".  The "dueling" mechanics are well-done, a nice change of pace for "boss fights" and add a whole new fun element to the "old-west" atmosphere of this title.\n\nAll that is available just in "story" mode, but there are 2 separate "arcade/challenge" modes as well in which you compete for scores.  In "arcade" mode you get to beome a one-man murder-machine as you blast your way through really fun shortened levels from the story mode, trying to gain as many points as possible.  There is a separate XP bank in this mode for each of 3 archetypes you can choose (basically rifle, shotgun or pistol style) and skills in this mode are gained automatically as you complete the challenges, all of which can be replayed infinitely for more xp if you want.\nIn "duel" mode you are given 5 lives to survive as many duels as possible, all presented in order and taken from story mode.\n\nI'd write more, but I have to get back to the frontier right now pilgrim.

Until I started Gunslinger, I thought it was done to boost sells for the game from the series which fate was uncertain after unsuccessful Cartel. But that's not the point. In fact, now I'm in doubts which one of those two bundled games is more providing with the spirit of the 80's.\n\nRemember the scene from the "Back to the Future 2", where Marty plays the Wild Gunman in the cafe? Gunslinger is all about that sequence. Where Far Cry Blood Dragon is the modern FPS filled with neon and such landmarks and tombstones of the past as "VHS"... Gunslinger is only looking as a modern game. In fact, it is just an arcade with cowboys shooting each other for a fistful of bucks or without any reason at all. "Ma foi, je me bats parce que je me bats", said Portos... and this bravado stays in our blood, no matter how civilized we are.\n\nThere won't be cool distinctive features of the generous western shooters such as the Call of Juarez 1&2. No real-deal ballistics, no such variety of tools and gameplay sequences... You just run'n'gun, but boy, that one is pure and delightful experience! Some people blame new showdowns... certainly they wouldn't stand even 10 levels in the Wind Gunman (and I was good behind the 100th level on my NES back in time).\n\nSo - yeah - I like the game just as it goes. Fair challenge, fair experience, fair price... Nice story and solid gameplay. Good Western show on your PC, and I think it is much better than you can get from the Disneyland tour or just idle watching young Eastwood or Bogart movies.

Not only because you are playing the Story as it is being told but how the Story is told. Because you are narrating your own story, sometimes you need to rewind to make the Story accurate in case you mess up or your listeners say something "is that how it really happened?". While the Story is not necessary big I guess you can extend it by looking through all the collectibles or by increasing the difficulty. As for my play through, the things that always took me more time to do were the duels, usually in the end of each Chapter. You need to pay attention to your focus on the target as well you speed to draw your revolver. This is a very clever idea and it really gives you a tense moment showing some good old West one-on-one combat.\n\nThe visuals are really nice. Every now and then I had to stop for a bit after the killing to enjoy the scenery. It's not only the visuals that grabbed my time but the attention to the little details made playing this game a even more enjoyable experience. You can see that they put some time to make the city, the lake or the forest just like it was supposed to be back then. In my opinion they nailed in the setting. I always enjoyed the West duels and this time of the year in the History. The duels show how honor was something important back then and I grew more fond of these weapons (revolver) in games.\n\nIn the end it was a good game and the thing that stands out the most is not the Story but how it is told. I thought it was pretty clever pushing your way while hearing your own voice, aiming for head shots in slow motion and throwing some dynamite. Oh and when you make a clean kill and blow the fumes from the pipe of your revolver? Priceless.","February 17, 2014","true","5.5"," 60 of 70 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","60","70","0","0"

The actual story itself is not complicated or morally challenging, but the use of an unreliable narrator combined with how the game itself reacts to when he backtracks to redescribe certain details is both amusing and engrossing. It cannot be overstated just how enjoyable the game is for it's presentation alone.\n\nWhile the gameplay does not push boundaries it is dependable and will prove both challenging and fun. Essentially there are three gameplay types based both on guns and the skills associated with them: shotguns, pistols and rifles. Skills are attained through scoring points which you obtain by killing enemies: pulling off headshots, performing multiple kills in a row, long distance shots, on the run kills will all net you bonuses which are coupled with your combo meter. Additionally you have access to a concentration meter (aka bullet time) and also a cheat death meter allowing you to dodge a life-threatening bullet. This arcade style action is not revolutionary but is incredibly fun.\n\nThe story mode also contains duels which are a point of contention for many players. Thematically they almost seem necessary but mechanically they can be a bit of a nightmare, especially if you intend on winning your duels honourably. You have a focus and arm speed percentage which you want as high as possible before you draw but even with high numbers it can end up being a gamble as to whether you get a decent shot off first. The duels later in the game can be quite infuriating as the target moves around or simply draws with very little delay or room for error.\n\nJust a fantastic game from start to finish, with a new game plus mode to offer even more details to the mysterious story. Personal gripes lie with the last level being obnoxious as you're assaulted on all sides, the rifle build/path not being the best and losing save data related to the alternate modes. Otherwise I cannot recommend this game enough, on sale or not.","November 5, 2014","true","6.9"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","40","41","2","0"

Once Upon a Time in the West, The Man with No Name Trilogy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Tombstone, The Wild Bunch, True Grit, 3:10 to Yuma, etc. To me, when it comes to a good Western, I'm not too concerned about the tone or style. I'll enjoy 2+ hours of a Western without a single gunshot just as much one where everyone is getting put down like old yeller.\n\nHowever when it comes to videogames, I want a lot of action. For the longest time Sunset Riders was the only Western game I enjoyed. I guess I never had the patience for titles like Red Dead Redemption* and...uh...okay well there haven't been a lot of Western games period. I never realized just how barren the genre really was until now. It's really quite strange because with a little imagination, you can do anything with a Western-themed videogame.\n\nSo let's look at Gunslinger. As the story goes, Silas Greaves is a man seeking vengeance. In his search for his brother's murderers he encounters many of the legends of the West. Billy the Kid, Jesse James, Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, you get the idea. This can't be just mere coincidence...can it? The storyline is unreliably narrated, with storyline changes affecting progress of the game. Expect to run into situations where you go one way, but then Silas is all "Wait. That's not how it went." and suddenly you're going somewhere else. All told it's very effective and adds a lot to what is a traditional Western storyline.\n\nSpeaking of traditional, this game is an arcade shootemup. There are some rare moments of quiet reflection, but you never spend more than a few seconds, not shooting cowboys in the face. The game is divided into several short stages. You run through the various environs, outlaws accost you, you gun them down. Each stage usually ends in a boss-fight. Some of these fights are straight out of Sunset Riders, just in FPS fashion. You've got the guy with the big health meter, he's firing on you from an advantageous position with the assistance of other thugs, oh if only they dropped a memorable one-liner when you dropped them (Bury me with my money...). Stages can also end the old-fashioned way, with a stand-off. In these duels you have to center your sight and steady your hand on your gun. Only the fastest and most accurate draw lives to tell the tale. These are pretty neat, though in the main game there isn't much to set one duel apart from the other. As you progress the outlaws become faster on the draw and move around more to throw off your focus at least.\n\nFor the most part, Gunslinger is pretty much a shooting gallery. Surviving dozens of armed bandits is one thing, but killing them stylishly for larger XP bonuses is what it's really all about. The trickier the shot, the more points you receive. Not everyone can ricochet a bullet through a wooden post and into a man's skull in the blink of an eye, but for those that can, it's worth a bunch of points. Trickier shots also reward the player with more concentration. Yes, this is obviously a mechanic with its own gauge at the corner of the screen. Concentration is basically the "slow down..pardner" button. Aside from causing everyone to move at the speed of snail, other benefits such as increased-damage are applied. XP is used to unlock various skills. While they're tied to certain weapons (pistols, rifles, or shotguns) the bonuses are univerally applied.\n\nThe first play-through is probably going to take five hours or less. As I said, Gunslinger doesn't fuss around with the details. Multiple difficulties are available, including a bonus "True West" setting. Not only does Silas die a bit easier, he also doesn't get all those helpful UI elements. Even something as simple as a crosshair is straight-up gone. At this point it is definitely to your benefit to take advantage of the New Game + so all of your acculumated skills carry over.\n\nThere are two additional modes in Gunslinger. Arcade mode dumps all of the plot, throws in more bad-guys, and changes the skill system. Instead of three sets of skills, you get three classes each with their own set. Getting the high scores practically require that you chain the entire stage. That means knowing where every outlaw is going to appear, reloading at the right moments, and using concentration when absolutely necessary. This mode definitely lives up to its name. It's frenetic and prone to chaos at first, but players will eventually become skilled enough to clear entire levels without wasting a shot. Duel mode is shockingly all about the duels. There are 15 stages and you have a limited number of lives to work with. If you enjoy the duels in the main game, that's plenty reason to consider giving this mode a run-through.\n\nReally though, what I enjoy the most about this game is all the shooting. Actually this game graduates to the level of shootin' game. Gunslinger is at it's best when you're rushing through stages capping everyone with trick shots and looking golden. Unfortunately there isn't the Western equivalent of a "360 no-scope". Still it's one of those shooters that knows how to make a player feel good about killin'. Also I like how there are bonus points for "last-breath" kills. One thing I hate about these checkpoint-based shooters is that they feel the need to obscure the player's vision when they're about to die. Look, it's a videogame, when I'm close to death I want to be able to see everything, not be handicapped. At least Gunslinger gets it right by giving a bonus for shootin' someone while half-blind.\n\nWith good story-telling and even better action, Call of Juarez (registered trademark) Gunslinger is definitely worth a look.\n\n*It could be I'm just sour because there's never been a PC port. I really didn't spend much time with RDR on my X360 or PS3.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 3, 2014","true","6.4"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","1"

Not that I heard great things about it...\nThe two other predecessors, however, I have played and finished.\n\nThe first thing I would say, if you are a fan of the series, is to divert your expectations. The first two games both were stories that attempted to, and perhaps succeeded, into gripping you into their narrative. A heart clenching story of vengeance and/or a lust for a haunted treasure.\n\nIn comparison, Gunslinger's story seems like a mini version of it. A simple adventure about and narrated by Silas Greaves, spoken in the context of a Saloon like he was a Cowboy telling a tall tale.\n\nThe interesting thing done here is how the story impacts the game, whereas it's usually vice versa. Your audience at several points takes over the narration for a moment, telling how they heard an event in question went down.\nAnd you play it all out, in a non-forced manner, taking their narrated path through the level. Eventually Silas will cut back in and tell how it really happened, winding back time to let the player cross through the level that way.\nIt's a very impressive, if not unique way of telling a story in a game.\n\nThe story itself, due to this, often comes across as a bit light heartened. It feels like it's lacking that darkness, that grit. But let me tell you, it eventually does come around, as Silas tells the story of his life as a Bounty Hunter in his quest for Revenge, and how he got around on starting in that line of work.\n\nThe array of guns may also seem simplified. A total of seven firearms and dynamite as throwables. It seems like that's not much, but for a story of this length, it seems enough. By the time you've gotten well comfortable and skilled, you'll have levelled up plenty and gotten around to a nice build to complement your weapon of choice.\n\nTalking of Levelling, the game makes use of three skilltrees. They mainly befit the Archetypes of Gunslinger, Ranger and Trapper. Which simply means Pistols, Long Range and Shotgun/Dyanimite. Each skilltree awards you with a stat boost and pretty skin of a specific weapon halfway and at the end of the skilltree. Each tree has at least two unique skills that make you an even deadlier man, and the weaker skills tend to have some synergy going with other skills. Again, it's not very extensive, but enough for a game of this length.\n\nCombat wise, it feels pretty good. The guns have weight to them, and fatal hits feel very satisfying. You have regenerating health, but so does the enemy apparently. You can fire two bullets in their chest, but if they find cover, those bullets can be considered wasted.\n\nI played this game on Hard, which especially urged me to make good use of cover. The enemy will not relent, and is quite intelligent compared to some titles. They take cover the moment you are spotted, move to another one if their current one proves not good enough, and they seemingy try to outflank you when they have the numbers. I was kept on my toes quite a bit, and every enemy felt like they could end me very quickly if I didn't pay attention.\n\nOverall, Gunslinger feels like a smaller (not necessarily stripped-down) version of the first game and Bound in Blood. But those were also full titiles, while at the time of writing this game is sold for 15.\nSo all in all, I would say that, with rational expectations, you'd very well get your money's worth.\n\nCall of Juarez: Gunslinger seems like a pet project treated with the love and magic of a Call of Juarez story, but smaller. If a typical CoJ story you are after, you might have a good time with this 7 hour game.","October 2, 2014","true","9.1"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","0"

When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.” and in the world of Call of Juarez Gunslinger, it seems that a number of legends have been printed concerning Silas Greaves. Stumbling into a saloon in Abilene, Kansas, Greaves has a seat and the local patrons buy him drinks and as old men are wont to do, Silas begins recounting his life story in an attempt to set a few things strait that newspapers and dime novels has misrepresented.\n\nSilas' tale is, as one would expect, a tale of revenge. He is riding in hot pursuit of Roscoe “Bob” Bryant, Johnny Ringo, and Jim Reed who managed to kill his brothers and nearly kill him as well. His quest for vengeance brings him toe to toe with the likes of Billy the Kid, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the Clantons and John Wesley Hardin making Silas the Forrest Gump of the old west. His stories seem more unlikely than what the papers and dime store novels have written about him and it isn't long before the patrons of the saloon view his yarn as an apologue rather than an autobiography. It doesn't help that the old timer's memory isn't what it used to be and some details are amended in the middle of his narration. On the gameplay end, this means that your environment can change around you during the course of a missions to account for Silas' faulty memory. While these add to the game's style, they do little to affect the firefights.\n\nGunslinger is a competent albeit uncomplicated shooter. Enemies appear en masse and are quick to huddle behind cover. A few special enemy types are present such as enemies with wooden shields, armored shotgun toting maniacs as well as the odd desperado behind a Gatling gun. In order to more efficiently blow gaping holes in the opposition, Silas can enter a concentration mode that slows time and highlights enemies in red. This can of course be replenished by slaying foes. An arcade style combo counter multiplies the points gained from cutting down outlaws and delivering head shots, shooting through cover or taking out men on the run earns bonus points. These points grant Silas experience which can be used to level up one of three skill trees. Only a handful of abilities in each of the trees feel like substantial upgrades however and the special weapons you unlock from each tree are more ornate versions of the standard weapons with a few stat tweaks meaning they don't really feel like new weapons. Never the less, Gunslinger manages to satisfy when you are wielding two six shooters and sending torrents of  blood flying from the skulls of those who would come between you and your prey.\n\nAlmost every level in Gunslinger's campaign concludes with a duel or boss encounter. The boss encounters often require gaining ground on an enemy posted behind a Gatling gun or having a shoot out with a single shotgun wielding bullet sponge. Duels are a bit more involved as you target an enemy to gain greater focus and position your hands for greater speed so that when the time comes your iron clears it's holster and your lead decimates the body of your opposition before he can even consider killing you. Duels require some quick timing and a bit of finesse to ensure that your focus is as high as it can be and your handspeed is maxed but ultimately these become a bit repetitive.\n\nPart of what makes Gunslinger so satisfying despite it's simple mechanics is that it drips with style. The notorious outlaws that you cross paths with are introduced through comic book panels and a beautifully detailed Boderlands style cel shaded graphical style prevents these comic panels from looking out of place. The dialogue is pulpy and seems ripped strait from a trashy dime store novel and while it can sometimes be a bit overwrought or contrived the overall aesthetic of the game makes it seem like an intentionally kitschy touch. Voice work is solid and the music plays on common western themes, employing distorted guitars to give the music a coarse tone that prevents it from conjuring quixotic images of  the west associated with 1950's western cinema culminating in a functional though not exactly exceptional soundscape.\n\nRounding out Gunslinger's feature set is an arcade mode that recycles sections of the singleplayer game and challenges players to string together combos and set high scores that can be compared with friends and the rest of the world on a leader board. A duel mode allows you to experience the game's duels back to back with a few added opponents. Neither of these modes will hold your attention since they do little to differentiate themselves from the game's campaign. The campaign itself will take around six hours and does have two endings. A new game plus mode and collectables add further incentive to play through the game once more.\n\nGunslinger is a stylish homage to the West. Fans of western cinema will find a number of references allusions to popular films and coming across some of the real outlaws whose exploits built the mythos of the West adds some novel appeal to the experience. Gunslinger masks the corners it cuts as a budget title with a rich style making it's campaign a mostly pleasant experience with repetition and simply enemy behaviors standing out as the only major blemishes. The West is somewhat of an untapped resource for video games and it's a shame that so few games have taken advantage of this period of American history. Let's hope that this new budget price point draws a few more people toward the Call of Juarez franchise and spurs the development of more satisfying western pulp.\n\n+Super Stylish\n+Budget Price\n+Simple, Solid Gameplay\n+Integration of historical figures\n\n-Repetitive\n-Bland AI\n-Additional Modes do not satisfy\n-Many upgrades don't feel like they have an impact","January 9, 2014","true","14.3"," 37 of 50 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","37","50","0","2"

Solid gunplay and nice mechanics that make it a bit more interesting, like some sort of 'focus' mode that let's you highlight and shoot the ever loving f*ck out of baddies.\n\nThe storytelling is definitely the strongest point of this game, you go along Silas' stories and meet interesting characters (that existed in the ACTUAL wild west) along the way. It's a very linear experience though, with little to no exploration or sidemissions in the storymode, sure there are the extra challenges that you can access in the main menu but those will give you 6 hours of extra playtime at most (or like 25 hours if you're a perfectionist like me).\nI did like the inclusion of "New Game Plus" which let's you keep all your upgrades while starting a new storymode, which still made it worth replaying once or twice.\n\nThat brings me to another weakness of this game: you can play through the entire storymode in about 3 hours, so while it's a fun game to knock out in one sitting (believe me, I just did, for the 3rd time) It doesn't hold much replay value other than bragging rights for completing the game on all difficulties, which even at the highest difficulty level, isn't all that hard.\n\nWhile it's a short and linear experience you find yourself shooting and blasting through, it does look pretty, with cell-shaded graphics giving it a borderlands-ish feeling which I definitely liked, you can even make your guns look prettier by upgrading your skills and you'll end up with beautifully engraved and gold-plated machines of DEATH!\n\n\nTL;DR\n+Good graphics\n+Good upgrade system (that let's you have nice and shiny weapons in the end)\n+Great gunplay\n+Interesting storyline\n+Outstanding presentation of said storyline\n+Interesting characters\n+NO UPLAY\n\n-Quite linear\n-Not a lot of replay value\n-Really short (you can knock this game out in 3 hours or so)\n-Not difficult, even on the highest difficulty setting\n\nVerdict: Call of Juarez Gunslinger is a fun game, that is fun to play if you're looking for an easy, quick game to play, it's not gonna challenge you, test your abilities to the maximum but it's definitely a fun story-driven experience, no matter how short that is.\n\n[7/10]","October 21, 2015","true","34.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

The story is a bit on the short side but it is also a budget title and there are extra modes to play beyond the story.

So Dad walked into a bar back in 1910 and forced a bunch of people to listen to the story about that one time he killed all those guys, and then the other story where he killed those other bunch of guys, and then again, only someplace else. All in all he kills a lot of dudes.\n\nCall of Jose: Gunfighter takes place during the wild west, a time when it was okay to wear ponchos and not look like you're about to breast feed your kid. The game takes you to many locations like the United States of America, the United States of America, Mexico (I think), the United States of America, and my backyard. At each of these locations you kill a bunch of dudes with old timey guns such as a revolver, another revolver, a rifle, a shotgun, and another revolver.\n\nThis would be really bad if it didn't feel so good to shoot people in this game. Please don't tell my therapist I said that.\n\nFor an obviously budgeted game, Call of Amigo: Slapbattler has a lot going for it in the shooting guys department. Although you only have a basic assortment of weapons, each one of them has this nice crunch to them when you fire. It also helps that you get points that pop up on the screen that are saying “Hurray! You killed a guy!” like some sort of Spaghetti Western version of the Running Man.\n\nThe levels in Call of Django: Tarantino are fairly linear, and you can tell that the team was constrained by a budget by the used assets you run into, but you kind of look past that stuff just by how the story is told. Through the entire game, Dad tells the story from a first person perspective, even going as far as to voice the other characters like he is telling a story, there are other characters that talk, but unless they're people who are listening to his story they're either just enemy chatter or few and far between.\n\nThere is also a dueling feature because killing everyone someone has ever known or loved isn't enough, you have to beat him in a fair fight as well just to show him who's the boss of this gym. You use the movement keys to move your hand closer to your gun and aim at the person you're about to plug with the mouse. These two fill up a meter that will let you draw your gun faster when it comes time to draw as well as hit the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the other side with one quick bullet, like Leonardo DiCaprio in that one movie he was in. You know. The one where he dies.\n\nBut the problem with Call of Chihuahua: Taco Bell is that it's short, you can beat it in a single sitting even with potty breaks. This is alleviated a bit with some replay value such as new game plus and arcade mode where the who racking up points via murder plays a much bigger role. But that can only take you so far.\n\nShould you play: Call of Tequila: Sombrero?\n\nI like it, but that's where it kind of stops. It's not amazing, but it's not mediocre or awful either. It's a fun romp through the old west with a good narrator and back story. The shooting is good for what it is and it doesn't really get boring or grate on you. The few boss characters or heavy characters that they're are aren't complete bummers to fight either and even bullet sponges can go down with one well placed bullet. I would say get it on sale and just blast through it in one sitting.\n\nCall of Jaurez: Old guy gets 7 Dirty Harry references out of 10.\n\nWait, Dirty Harry wasn't a western.\n\n\nHere's a curator where you probably won't get shot in: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","March 1","true","6.4"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","83","20","24","14","0"

First off I loved the approach the developers took to the game.  Now if you have read my other reviews you will know I'm not a huge fan of first person shooters.  I am however a gamer!!  So the game play is secondary to this larger-than-life storytelling.  So you take on the role of Silas Greaves legendary bounty hunter.  The best way I can think to describe the game it your character Silas is telling about his legendary life in a true old west fashion.  Its a first person shooter  told by yourself in a third person storytelling style.  You are Silas Greaves walking into a saloon taking advantage of your bounty hunter status and storytelling ability for some free booze.  Are they all big fish story's or true?  At a certain point I was thinking the gameplay got in the way of the story.  That is how good it is being told.  But the game play is basic nothing expectational or revolutionary as far as a video game goes.  The duels are probably the best part.  They automatic checkpoints will save you from time to time lot of blood shed by Silas as his career as a bounty hunter so dying in the game is expected from time to time.  They fast pace of the game is key to survival in my opinion if you take a more reserved approach you will not die as much but miss out on the point of the story because the narrative is bigger then life he didn't stop to cover he went balls to the wall in wild wild west style.  But with its lackluster play style they story makes up for it in a tremendously enormous way.  Once I started playing I want to see the next chapter from beginning to end.  Also this is the fourth installment of Call of Juarez I haven't played the others but I will be looking into them because if the main antagonist in those is anything like Silas  and the way they tell story is similar they will be just as fun I would assume.  But definitely worth the price steam has on it $14.99 and if its on sale its a MUST BUY.","September 24, 2014","true","14.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The graphics are unique in that they are different from your average FPS, I'd kind of liken them to Borderlands, but even prettier in my honest opinion. The thing that shines most in this game is the replay value, with a great story mode and arcade mode you could play through the story multiple times, (thanks to a simple yet enjoyable leveling and perk system) and have a different experience every time. The gun play is amazing, fast paced, visceral, and adrenaline incuding. Once you've gotten the hang of things and you're popping heads left and right you will almost feel like a badass bounty hunter yourself.

After having played it myself, I can safely say that it is a fantastic game and one I've never played anything quite like before.\n\nYou play as Silas Greaves, playing through stories of past exploits in the wild west as they are being told by yourself in the present.  This is one of the game's greatest strengths, as the storytelling not only perfectly matches the action, but will also change the environment and even make you replay parts of the story in different ways as various people tell how they've heard the story before.  It may not sound like the best idea, but it plays excellently and I'd love to see more games done in this style.\n\nThe other big strength of the game is the gameplay itself.  It does arcade shooting action very well and also includes the ability to avoid death by dodging bullets and slow time down with concentration mode.  You gain experience for killing enemies with a combo multiplier increasing the value of each kill and can use this experience to gain new skills.  Outside of the regular gameplay there is also a rather unique dueling feature.  You will be pitted against a famous outlaw in a wild west duel where you must keep your concentration by keeping a reticule on your enemy while keeping your hand ready to draw.  It provides an excellent sense of suspense before shots are fired and tests your reaction time very well.\n\nGraphically the game looks pretty good with a pseudo-comic style lightly outlining objects in the game.  Don't expect groundbreaking graphics, however.  Sound effects are also quite good and fit the game very well.\n\nOn the technical side is the only part of the game I'm disappointed in.  Call of Juarez Gunslinger runs on the Chrome engine so like all other Chrome engine games I have played it won't run quite smoothly.  It likes to drop frames randomly though it will run quite fast.  The game does not respond well to ALT+TAB and will get a visible mouse cursor fairly often when using the Steam overlay.  FOV can be changed through a config file as with other Chrome engine games.\n\nBuy this game, you won't regret it!","October 19, 2014","true","13.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","2"

Colorful graphics, arcade like score system, level ups, story,...\n\nI was right - this game makes everything right.\n\nYou are an old guy, who can't remember exactly what happened a few years ago, but that does not prevent you to tell your story to every stranger in the bar, you are currently in and drinking whisky. So it was not hard to recognise myself with the narrator.\n\nSo you are telling your weird story and during the good old rusty voice is sounding, you are playing the game and watching how the world is changing: some new ways will be built, some cherokees will turn into bandits in no-time and so on. It's a very dynamic game.\n\nThere is not only the story mode, which will take around four hours to complete. You also are able to face off famous western outlaws like Billy the Kid, Jessy James, The Dalton Brothers and many others in the duel mode. 1 vs 1, only pistols, who will be faster?\n\nArcade mode is also very nice, but maybe not that motivating. It's kind of a score attack in already visited level passages.\n\nWhat I really like is the New game + mode. Where you are able to complete your skill trees and find the last hidden golden nuggets.

I just loved the western feel, and I also loved the second one :)\nbut... after the cartel... I was afraid they lost it, until I saw this game! and I knew they're back!\n\nStory\nThe story is about this old bounty hunter named Silas Greaves, it all begins when Silas enters a Saloon and starts telling his story...\nSilas's story is how he met\dueled\killed real outlaws from the Wild West, outlaws like Billy The Kid, Jesse James and more... all in the sake of revenge...\n\nGraphics\nI loved the graphics, it's not BF4 or Metro, it's more like Borderlands 2, they tried to make it like a cartoon, since the whole game is being told by Silas,\nThe cut scenes are like comic book pages, anyways, the game got really sweet graphics, for me, it worked!\n\nGameplay\nGunslinger is a FPS with touches of RPG, set in the Wild West, so you know what you'll get... and they deliver it!\nThe game is packed with gun fights, where you run in the old wild west towns, deserts, moving trains, mountains, mines and more,\nthe RPG part is that you have 3 trees that you can choose from, Desperado, Trapper and Ranger, The Desperado class focuses on two revolvers, Ranger uses his Lever-Action rifle and the trapper uses Shotgun and dynamites,\neach level you get a point you can spend to each class, after 6 skill points invested in each class you get a legendary weapon, which is just a better revolver\shotgun\rifle\neach chapter you face a boss which is an historical figure as i said above, for instance, in the first mission you face off Pat Garret,\nwhen you face those bosses, you enter a duel, which is pretty cool too, they've made it really nice!\nthey also have a bullet-time effect, where you gain concentration after killing your enemies just like the old Call Of Juarez games.\nOk, so I'll just summarize this, the gameplay is just great! i mean, the shootouts are great, it's full of action, and if you love the wild west like i do, this is the game for you!\n\nConclusion\nI hope they'll make more like this!\nThe game is just amazing, well made, bug-free, full of action and fun, they deliver the atmosphere of the wild west, from the narration to the scenery and to the guns and foes.\nthe game is pretty short actually, about 10 chapters, and it took me about 7 hours to finish it, but hey, it's 15$ so for that price is a steal imo,\nthere is also an arcade mode that you can play which has 10 levels, the arcade mode is another game that you need to make combos to reach high score and compete with friends.\nSo, after they made the Cartel game and failed big time, they redeemed them self with this great game imo, I can't wait for them to make more games like this!\nand if you didn't play this one yet, but it now! and play it now!\n\nSome screens:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=191646679\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=190821536\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=190821484\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=190674908\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=190674923\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/JustLynx/screenshots/?appid=204450&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall","November 5, 2013","true","9.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbaketkd/recommended/204450/","jbaketkd","Vash(88)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbaketkd/","787 products in account","Call of Juarez is an extremely linear shooter; although, it does hold  a solid amount of entertainment.  The game-play isn't anything new apart from the duels, but the story and voice acting are both top of the line.  The player gets to meet and kill many of the legendary outlaws of wild west, and the way the game-play follows the dialog of the main character can be both fresh and, unfortunately, annoying at times.\n\nThe shooting always comes down to the same thing: the player picks his or her semi automatic western influenced weapon of choice, then proceeds to blast heads off of cowboys, outlaws and different Indian tribes while following a set path until the duel at the end of the chapter is reached.  The game-play falls short after a short while due to how easy the game is.  The player is given a slow-mo ability, but the game is a push over even without it.  The fault comes from the lack of aggression in the AI.  The bad guys simply stay in the same spot or run back and forth from one of 2 cover points until the player kills them.  Only a select few enemies will actually advance on the player's position.  Granted, the duels that at the end of most chapters can be a lot of fun and a good challenge.  Each one feels a little different from the last, and getting the hang of the dueling controls can take some time to master.\n\nThe story is told by the main character as the player progresses, and the ending has a nice and unexpected twist.  Something that was not expected from Techland after giving such a bland and unexciting end to Dead Island.\n\nThe weapons all feel and sound great, and there was a lot of effort put into the detail; however, there is a lack of options given that the pistols all feel alike -- the same goes for the rifles and shotguns.  There were some nice touches, though.  For instance, when shooting a double barrel shotgun, each of the hammers have a separate animation and work independently from each other.\n\nIf you are looking for five or 6 chill hours of western shooting, this is a fun game.  If you are looking for a shooter that is going to keep you on your toes and thinking outside of the box, avoid this game at all costs.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=319632478","September 27, 2014","true","7.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/204450/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","There has never been a game that has surpassed my adoration for the original wild wild west game Red Dead Revolver. From it's unique game play style to it's duels. I have to admit though, if I were to choose one game from the present that was near it's greatness, it would be Call of Juarez : Gunslinger.\n\nNow, the story sort of took me by surprise. I was expecting the typical scenematic every now and again between shootouts. This wasn't the case. CoJ : G approaches the story by telling it from a man named Silas's perspective. I felt like a kid in elementary again being read a book as I sat quietly listening on the mat floor. The cut-scenes aren't fully animated, but are animated enough to give you a rough idea of what everyone looks like. Within the game, Silas's voice narrates the action while his friends will sometimes pipe in with a question or a comment. The game is definitely unique in it's approach to telling a story.\n\nI was extremely skeptical before I even tried out the game. I've heard a few positive reviews but haven't seen anything to make it substantially stick out. I gave it a shot and am glad. The game play will keep you immersed, but depending on how much you like what they give you, depends how long it will suck you in for. I haven't been bored yet as they do a good mix of allowing you to use all of your weapons (or explosives) at a given time. There are times where the game play will stop and the player will have to have a duel with an enemy. This brought me back to the good old days of Red Dead. Instead of simply copying former versions that have included dueling, CoJ rather has you and the opponent sort of circling one another. At this point, the player tries to focus in on the opponent (with one joystick) and adjusts their hand position over the gun with the other joystick. Carefully watching the opponent, once he draws then you can draw. Draw first and lose honor. The game play itself is done in first person and the guns move relatively to where you move, meaning if there is a wall in the way of one revolver, Silas will hold the left revolver up (for example) while the right one can engage enemies.\n\nThe guns themselves are sort of basic but slowly upgrade throughout the game. Basic guns include revolvers (you can have dual-lies), rifle, sawed-off shotgun, and the double barreled shot gun. Explosives are also available such as sticks of dynamite. Within the map, there are explosive objects which can be shot to damage opponents within the proximity. There is also a feature which slows down the game and gives the player a chance to take out as many opponents as they can before their "focus" stamina runs out. When a player's health runs low, you're given a final chance to redeem yourself and get back on your feet. This happens by focusing in on one opponent (automatically) and he fires a single bullet at you. If you dodge the bullet, you can keep the mayhem going. If you get hit, you're sleeping with the fishes. I absolutely love this portion of the game as it keeps you on your toes and engaged within the game play almost at all times. Just because that dynamite is flying in the air doesn't mean it has to explode by you. Shoot it before it gets near you! The RPG element of the game deals with improving your skill with the revolvers, rifle, or shotgun. Choose wisely as you may favor a gun more than the others.\n\nThe graphics in the game are unique to their own sense. Their good but follow a cartoon sort of look in the slightest bit. Sounds are good and when a gun shot lands, you can definitely feel and hear it. I absolutely love what they did with the HUD. The more you get shot, the blurrier your screen becomes with bullet holes on it.\n\nI like this game, but I do feel they could have done a little bit more with it. I'm certain adding a multiplayer option would fill the void and add some more depth, but I would have liked to see what more they could have done to add to the game. The FPS experience is definitely a notable one. I've talked mostly positive, but once the game's done, there isn't much else to see.\n\nRating : 7.45/10\n\nGameplay	B+	Story / Campaign	B+	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	C-	Overall 	B-\n\nWould have been a 7.5+ easily with some replay-ability. Not typically a bad asking price though - quite fair.\n\nScreenShots :\nWhat getting shot looks like\n\nJust as I'm about to die, I get a second chance at life if I do this right (check following screenshot)\n\nDodge right or left\n\nWhat a duel looks like\n\nQuick time events being snuck into the game between shootouts\n\nIn a few years, everyone will copy his style\n\nI like games that try at every point to keep the player engaged.","September 1, 2015","true","5.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

I certainly didn't expect much of a game called "Call of Juarez: Gunslinger", or at least not more than a mindelss little trash fest. Actually the only reason I bought this game was because Chris Fanklin said some things about the story telling that sounded interesting - and the game was on sale.\n\nBut now that I've finished the game over the last two days I can barely remember the last time I had that much fun with a game. The action is fast and there's enough variety to keep the interest even for someone like me, who usually doesn't like shooters. I played the game with an Xbox controller and it worked fine (even if it wasn't the most easy game for me).\n\nBut that's by far not everything. The game's beautiful and it knows that, giving players some rest from time to time to enjoy the view as the sunlight shines through the trees. Even if the game is rather short, it ends it's story in a very satisfying way.\n\nYou barely see a game that in manages to intertwine storytelling and gameplay mechanics in a way that both complement each other. Gunslinger does it with an easy that not only impressed me but could also be a textbook example for the whole ego shooter genre, that seems to be stuck in the same tropes since Half-Life was released over a decade ago.\n\nI didn't expect much from Gunslinger and got a game that impressed me with it's perfect execution of a well thought out idea. It might not be as ambitious as Bioshock Infinite, but it's certainly a better game in any regard.","October 5, 2014","true","12.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

This game mixes high-octane arcade wild-west gun action with narrative trick and focus of Bastion... AND IT WORKS!\n\nCore gameplay is really satisfing. Nice controls, awesome gun mechanics, bullet time. Everything works here pretty well. The story is most interesting part of this game however. You are basically playing through recollections of old bounty hunter that tells his story in the Sallon. Your hero regularly tends to leave some plot holes along the way or he misrepresents some historical facts and everything is translated into gameplay in pretty clever way. This idea is a meat of the game for me and I'm really impressed.\n\nSidemissions are also suprisingly awesome. Found collectibles give you some historical factoids about people, event or places of the real Wild West and those are really interesting reads, especially when you contrast them with main protagonist's story. Arcade mode is tons of fun and Dueling "At the High Noon" mechanics, while not completely clear for the player at the beginning, make for really fun boss fights with many famous outlaws of USA's 19th and 20th century history.\n\nI can easily ignore most of the nitpicks. This game isn't sharp in every aspect (regular bossfights and some of the story elements come to mind). But for the asking price, this game is great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/recommended/204450/","drpixel","DrPixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/","3729 products in account","Having never played the prior Call of Juarez games, and hearing that this new one was pretty good after the supposedly terrible Cartel, I wasn't really too fond on getting it. I'm not a huge fan of old western movies, or games like Red Dead Redemption on consoles, though I do enjoy them. I like arcade shooters though, and when a friend gave me it I just had to try it.\n\nThe game starts with the player, an aging bounty hunter of years past named Silas Greaves, entering a saloon in a stylized comic-book/hand drawn sort of cutscene. He orders a drink (or two....or three), and begins to tell his story to the other people in the saloon, who seem fascinated by his presence. He tells wild tales of his past, each one being a level in the game, and entertains the people listening in with his crazy adventures. He narrates the story while you play through his supposed (I'll get to that in a bit) adventures, and the other people listening in chime in sometimes too.\n\nNow, Silas is a big fat liar as it seems he's everywhere at once. First he's with the famous Billy the Kid, then next he's dueling with Jesse James, the famous bandit. Is any of what he says true? No, not at all, and the other people start to suspect him as the game goes on and it gets pretty funny. In fact, the whole game is pretty humorous as Silas is a drunken liar so he changes the story or ridiculously adds in things akin to "breaking the fourth wall" moments. He does some really silly things too and seems to always be present at every major event in southwestern USA folklore.\n\nAs I said earlier, levels consist of playing through Silas's supposed "past stories", each of which are pretty fun and fast-paced. Sometimes Silas will cause certain things to happen based on his blatant bluffing or his audience will call him out and he'll rewind to tell the story like it "really is". Gameplay consists of you moving from point to point, shooting enemies for points, and moving more. That's essentially all that the game is, but it doesn't waste its time and constantly delivers either funny scenes or action-packed scenes. I like that a lot, and it's probably what kept me going to beat it in one sitting. That may sound pretty crazy, but the game is only about 5 hours long so it's not too bad and the game kept me engaged.\n\nI usually have a lot of problems with shooters, but this one was very solid with collectables (that included real facts of southwestern lore, which was neat to see being of the southwest myself!) littered all over the place and points to gather from killing enemies. In addition, there was also some very light RPG mechanics that were nice to see. I only wish that there were more weapons and more ways to gain points.\n\nGraphically speaking, this is quite the good looking game and it runs very well on even slightly older machines like mine. I was surprised to see it look so good AND run so well! Textures are crisp and the animations are fairly smooth. This is essentially a AAA arcade game so you can expect it to look as good as the name backing it is popular (Ubisoft).\n\nI can't really recall the sound or music being anything superb, but the voice acting is great and certain songs were particularly pleasant on the ears (one of the credits songs comes to mind). Everything just gives off a lovely southwestern sort of feel that you very rarely see in games nowadays.\n\nCall of Juarez: Gunslinger overall just felt "good" to me. Nothing really stood out, but I enjoyed it a lot and would probably recommend it to others if they like shooters. However, I would not give it a huge recommendation or say it's one of the best 2013 games, no, it's not really deserving of that high in my opinion. The humor is decent and the action will keep you entertained, but even if it's one of the best Call of Juarez games it won't win any awards I think.\n\nI give this game a: 7/10","January 11, 2014","true","6.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/204450/","dons20","TRU±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","IntroductionCall of Juarez: Gunslinger is a first-person shooter that combines tall tales of the wild west with a unique visual style in one of the most fun arcade-styled shooters of 2013. One of the strongest points of this game, is that it does not try to take itself too seriously, allowing for some unique plot twists, fun moments and interesting gameplay overall.\n\nI have not played the previous games in the series as of the time of writing this, so I will not be comparing this game to its predecessors. Instead I will be reviewing it based on its merits.\n\nStoryYou are Silas Greaves, a traveller who stumbles upon a bar in a certain town in the old west. You meet some local folks and begin telling them a few stories of your travels. As you re-live those journeys, Silas narrates all the action, and the game may somehwat change depending on what he is currently saying. This can lead to some pretty ridiculous moments where you can hardly believe what you're seeing, only to watch as the game changes to fit the new narrative. It really helps to emphasize the whole 'tall tale' aspect and let you see it in the eyes of the audience he is telling it to (or at least how he remembers it).\n\nGameplayStory Mode\nCall of Juarez: Gunslinger takes a more casual, 'arcadey' approach to the FPS genre. There are three playstyles which you can employ in the game. If you like taking enemies out from range, grab a rifle. Or do you prefer close-range combat? Grab a shotgun. Perhaps you like rapid mid-range fire, grab the dual pistols. This type of diversity makes the combat fun, and really caters to anyone's particular playstyle. Combined with these options, is the skill tree which really empowers the weapons you choose to specialize in. You aren't locked to any particular tree, allowing you to level any skill that suits your tastes at any time. I really like this option, as it encourages multiple playthroughs without preventing you from having a particular skill locked away because you decided to try something new. If you level up a particular skill tree enough, you unlock a special golden weapon that has special benefits over the standard version. This gives something special for players to work towards and motivated me enough to want to play the game repeatedly.\n\nCombos are a highlight of the game, turning this from a simple FPS to a more arcade-themed one, where players try their best to keep those multipliers up.\n\nYou'll often have hidden "Nuggets of Truth" which give you historical facts based on the particular story you're hearing. These are really useful for finding out what is fact and what is fiction in this wild rollercoaster of a story.\n\nDuels\nThese are fun but tense modes where you face off against another fellow gunslinger. This is a one-shot, one-kill mode where timing, accuracy and reaction times are of the utmost importance, and one mistake can leave you with a dishonorable rating, or even worse; dying.\n\nVisualsCall of Juarez: Gunslinger has an art style which is not often used for FPS games. With a style similar to the Borderlands series it gives a cartoony feeling but can have some of the most beautiful looking environments ever. Mountain levels were especially appealing, as the game had some stunning environments which would almost distract you from the gunfight you were currently engaged in. This game has has all the other aspects which makes it just as gruesome as many other well known titles. Headshots result in an almost artistic splash of blood, while bodily shots may not give the same effect. Guns look and feel powerful, especially the golden versions, and firing them is an absolute pleasure.\n\nAudioFollowing the aforementioned point, the sounds in this game are so crisp and clean, and really seal the 'immersion' in the game though of course, 'immersion' isn't the real selling point of the game. From the sound of bullets whizzing by your ear, to the loud boom of a shotgun blast, the audio was clearly well designed and deserves all the praise it could get. The voice actors were top-notch as well, giving you the feeling that you were listening to a real cowboy right through the story. I'm a sucker for good audio, so I was pleasantly surprised to find so many realistic sounds in this game to really sell it. Simply amazing.\n\nNegativesWhile the levels themselves were well designed with great checkpoints, and they were pretty large overall, we weren't really encouraged to explore, as the game was still very much linear, with its only merit being larger areas to explore. Some towns had very large areas to explore, but nothing to reward that exploration. It felt like a waste of time to even explore, so I just didn't bother for the most part.\n\nThere was no multiplayer unfortunately, which I think would have been pretty good if there was possibly, co-op, versus or something. Instead, it just turned out to be a single-player game (a very good one nonetheless).\n\nThere were a couple tiny bugs here and there but they really weren't very noticable, and a quick restart from checkpoint fixed any issues I had.\n\nSummary & ConclusionCall of Juarez: Gunslinger is a marvellous game which is a breath of fresh air among most FPS titles. The art style and arcade-type gameplay really sells the 'casual' aspect while the sounds, entertaining story, and skill-tree system give the player a lot more than they would expect.\n\nIt is definitely a great game and one that everyone should be willing to give a go at least once.\n\n9/10 Worth a buy.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

This game is a regular FPS shooter but with the addition of unique gun dueling combat system. After several gun duels, my body actually developed higher reflex and coordination and I can shoot better and faster in the game dueling combat. This made me really feel like a gunslinger living in the wild west. Unfortunately there is no multiplayer. The developer should add multiplayer if they ever release a sequel to this game. Story co-op would be fun and Player vs Player gun duel would be really awesome.\n\nThe story mode is too short though and the last chapter a little bit stalling, but overall still interesting. If they can expand this wild west franchise to a bigger game world like RDR and adding multiplayer, this game will be a winner.\n\nCONCLUSION :\nRecommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.","May 19","true","15.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The art style is really detailed and suits the setting, the execution is tidy and really brings the wild west to life.  The story is quite engaging and had enough twists and turns, and a good dose of humour to keep you on board for one more level...\n\nDownsides are that this is kind of repetative, and you will find yourself shooting hundreds of dum dums not so much out of skill as out of need to progress to the next room full of dum dums standing there ready to get mowed down.  The lovely bullet time mechanic is good for racking up some sweet points, but completely undone by the bloody quick time events that seems to pop up the second you trigger the bullet time.  These quick time events are basically 50/50 going to kill you depending which way you dodge, oh and by the time thats sorted out your bullet time meter is empty, bad luck.\n\nAlso annoying is the duelling sub game.  You need to fill up your focus by hovering a ring over the person you are duelling, the longer you hold it steady the more time you get to shoot them when its go time.  Problem is the focus ring is swerving all over the road like a drunk teenage nanny dropping your kids off at the pool and so you need more luck than skill to fill up your focus.  You can draw when you like but you are going to be the bad guy if you do, so basically dont do it. Wait for them to draw on you and then its 50/50 again if you are going to die.\n\nThis for me is a game that almost was legendary, almost.  Not buggy, not poorly designed as such, just had some shortcomings and never really lived up to the hype of the reviews I read.  buy it cheap, play through once then uninstall and move on...\n\nUPDATE.  For any other r.e.t.a.r.d who thinks I'm not entitled to an opinion, and cant understand that just because I do not recommend this game, doesnt mean I didnt like it - nobody is forcing you to buy this game, nobody is forcing you to read this review. If you like the game more than i did write your own review and by all means give it a thumbs up, just dont think you get to come on my review and make ridiculous comments like youre so much better at games than someone youve never met just because they did not think this was the best game in the world.  It's not the best game in the world - cope with that, buy it or dont, not my problem.

Gunslinger is a blending of the old and the new, fact and fiction; Gunslinger tells a story about storytelling.\n\nSilas’ story is presented through the original tradition of storytelling: by word of mouth. As Silas tells his story the truth becomes blurred: he embellishes his story, challenge history, and is challenged by other patrons of the saloon and his own memory. All of these elements make a well-worn, classic story feel fresh again, and make for some interesting turns in the gameplay. At one point Silas mentions that some men attacked him and they were like Apaches, at which point Apaches surround the player as he fights for his life, but then Silas corrects the story by emphasizing that the men attacked like Apaches, but were in fact just the bandits mentioned earlier.\n\nThe gameplay synthesizes with the idea of blending old and new. The action of the game has a very distinct arcade feel. There are explosions everywhere, combo kills, frantic firefights, and cartoonish blood spurts. Coupled with this are the modern gun and health mechanics: carrying only one gun from each category of weapon, regenerating health over time, and three skill trees to invest in after level ups.\n\nThe slick art style and presentation fit perfectly with the game. Every character in the game is introduced with a small Sergio Leone inspired sequence. Add to the style is The duel mechanic that makes you feel like a cowboy: slowly inching your hand closer to your gun as your eyes focus on your target, and you have to draw second if you want to kill your opponent honorably.  Old West fans and history buffs will appreciate how crowded this game is with famous figures and “Nuggets of Truth” that detail some of the history that the game touches on.\n\nGunslinger shows just how good Westerns can be. Adding to the style, interesting storytelling, and great action is the replay value. You can try your hand at a various arcade levels, duels, and Silas Greaves may be old, but he still has a story tell and a good fight in him.","November 26, 2013","true","33.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

And one thing I can say after playing it through is it is essentially a flawless gem for me. The somewhat cell-shaded graphics still look good, the shooting is great and extremely satisfying and the setting is purely awesome. The game itself is entirely story-driven, but the story behind it is really interesting, it incorporates a lot of actual Wild West history as well as plenty of legends. There is enough humor for it to not become too serious and there is enough suspense to keep you interested in what is going on. Great music and absolutely awesome voice acting complete the experience. The collectible “nuggets of truth” are hidden quite cleverly and are not that easy to find and along with a “game plus” mode provide some replayability. On the other hand, the nuggest provide a very interesting insight into speculations about whether the Wild West legends (including people and events) are actually true or not. Other “additional” features include a series of duels (not that interesting for me) and replaying some of the game parts as “shootout” scenes, which are fairly satisfying. If you have ever had even a passing interest in Wild West, please, do yourself a favor and try the demo of this game. The game is EXACTLY like the demo and, if you like it, you will not be disappointed (a demo that actually represents a game well – how common that is nowadays?). I would strongly suggest that you buy this in a pack with Far Cry: Blood Dragon, which is another awesome shooter that I have reviewed last year. If your tastes are anything similar to mine, you will certainly not be disappointed.","July 1, 2015","true","20.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The whole game is a straight-forward action shooter with the hilarious framing of being a story told by an old man of his younger days to a few people in a saloon in 1910, in order to get himself some free drinks.\n\nThe game is great fun and has a rather whimsical "Spaghetti Western" feel to it as you blast your way through and the storytelling works itself into the game. One minute you'll be running along happy as a clam blasting desperados, then suddenly he'll mention he's trapped and running low on ammo! And lo' and behold the way forward and your retreart are cut off as debris litterally fall from the sky to block your path and suddenly your ammo counter rapidly dwindles away of its own volition!\n\nThe guns are quite satisfying to handle, though I admit I typically stuck to a preferred loadout (the Ranger is the only pistol worth using, when I shoot a man, I expect him to die, and that pistol is the only one who does that job). Overall the game was certainly worth the purchase, and it has not just story mode (with new game+ for the uprades!) but a score attack mode of sorts too.\n\nAnyways, for the cost of a few beers, you can have ol' Silas Greaves spin ya a yarn or two. Most of its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I reckon, but damned all if it ain't entertainin'.","December 2, 2013","true","5.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Very cool feature, if you ask me. Way more worthwhile than just "items" you pick up for completion.\nI also want to mention the duels. They're detailed and difficult. You have to keep your eye on your target (a focus circle you use the mouse to guide) while positioning your hand over your gun for a quicker draw speed, and you also have to watch your target's hand to make sure he makes the first move (otherwise, your kill is deemed dishonorable), and react quickly enough to blow the other guy's head off first.\n\nOh, and bonus points because Silas actually blew smoke off his revolver. Fckyeah.\n\nI saw a lot of detailed positive reviews, so I'll keep mine short since I'm sure it's all been said before. I can't believe this game isn't more popular!

This time, the series brings you back into the Old West and it's a damn good thing too.  The art style of the Old West is cell shaded, though with a nice realistic approach.  The action is as fun as it gets, and can get tough, especially on the harder levels.  The story tells the tale of an old man looking to get revenge on the one who shot and killed his brothers and tried to murder him.  On his quest for revenge he meets some of the greats from the Old West History books (i.e. Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Sundance Kid and much more).  The action is top notch and is especially well showcased in the arcade mode.  There's a slow-mo effect that helps with your aim and making the intense action sequences possible to get through.  It's well implemented and not too gimmicky.\n\nThe tale of the protagonist is not a great tale, though it is interesting, and what makes it super interesting is the fact that it is related through a very well voiced narration as you play the action.  Think, Bastion the RPG game.  Same deal.  The narration really helps keeps things interesting, in perspective, and exciting.  There's nothing like shooting someone in the head and having the narrator describe what you just did, or having someone ambush you and have the narrator talk about the ambush.  Also, because the story is being told as if it was the present, sometimes the story will get corrected and the truth will be told.  Not only does this change the story, but then the scenery will change as well without any load sequences, but on the fly.  It's a great part of this game.  Albeit, the game is short, but overall for the price, it is well worth the value of this game and you should really take the time to purchase this game to play it.  It is loads of fun.\n\nTypically you will see for 75% on any number of sites and you can redeem it on Steam.

I've always hated game stories that are told in past-tense, but this game makes a great case for it's usage. Often, revisions, depictions, and plot details are inserted mid-game, changing the environment as the player traverses through them. The plot itself only really becomes interesting in the second half, but when it does, it's quite enthralling.\n\nThe gameplay itself feels like something common on the Chrome engine - the same engine that Far Cry 3 utilizes. There's a similar RPG progression, though it's dialed back for a much smaller game. Early game, it's not much fun, but as abilities are unlocked, the game feels much more fleshed out. It certainly makes the iron-sight-and-recharging-health gameplay easier to swallow.\n\nA better-than-average game with some pretty neat tricks up it's sleeves.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/204450/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","Call of Juarez Gunslinger is a Western themed First Person Shooter from Techland and published by Ubisoft. It is the fourth game in the Call of Juarez series, however experience in the previous games is not necessary to enjoy the gameplay and storyline. This is the first Call of Juarez game I have played, and I don't feel like I was missing out on anything by skipping the first few.\n\nThe gunplay in Call of Juarez Gunslinger is fast and hectic, but very enjoyable. The controls are tight, and even when the game throws an overwhelming amount of enemies at you, between the bullet time, three gun types and dynamite, you feel like you have all the tools you need to take down the entire Wild West. That's pretty much what you are doing here, with a body count approaching the thousands by the end of the game.\n\nThe ridiculous body count fits in with the story, however, because the plot is framed around a tale an oldtimer is telling to those gathered in a bar. Apparently Silas Greaves was responsible for taking down nearly every famous outlaw in the Old West, and you get to relive the story as he tells it. Within that framework comes some neat tricks, as you will replay sections of levels with slight differences as it is misremembered, and new paths will open up before you as they spring from memory. The whole story takes on the feel of a tall tale, which seems fitting for a game about the Old West, where legends and tall tales are aplenty.\n\nIn addition to the normal gunplay, there is a duel mode as you finally come face to face with each of your foes. It does an admirable job of adding the tension that duels must have built, as you must keep focus on your enemy while making sure your hand is ready to draw. If you enjoy the duels, which I did, there is a duel mode where you can face all your enemies again, with a leaderboard to track your score against friends.\n\nThe graphics and sound exude style. The characters are all very well designed, and the environments are very enjoyable. Cutscenes all have a storybook feel. The voice acting is stupendous, and often humorous as you listen to the audience argue with the storyteller. I was expecting something good in these departments, and what was delivered is great.\n\nOverall I completely recommend Call of Juarez Gunslinger. It will take about 5 hours to complete the main story mode, but the price point fits that length. This was a budget priced title, but many aspects of it feel AAA in quality. I had heard good things about this game, but it exceeded my expectations.\n\nGrade: A","January 15, 2015","true","9.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Graphics are in this 3D drawing style which fits the game just perfectly as well as the cutscenes, which not only aren't annoying, but are short, nicely made and skipable. And the absolute GEM of ALL THE FPS is the hardest gamemode, which makes you feel like a real cowboy - no hud, no crosshair, no clues. Just you and your guns.

At its core, it's a shoot-em-up arcade game.  That being said, I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped I would.\n\nPros:\n-The graphics are beautiful, and very well done. A shout out to the graphics department in charge of the game.\n-It's got a very artistic way of portraying the story; Graphic novel style, combined with the narration of an old cowboy telling his story.\n-It's not an easy game, and at times requires trying different routes and tactics to accomplish your goal.\n-There are some great history-bits found as secrets throughout the game. I love me some real-life learning.\n\nCons:\n-Linear, shoot-em-up. There's not much depth to gameplay.\n-A few path bugs. I remember a boss getting glitch stuck inside an environment element, where I was able to hit him safely without him being able to move or shoot back. There were also a number of places where I'd find my own character stuck and unable to move.\n-Sometimes, the controls would bug out to where I couldn't aim, crouch, reload, etc.\n-It got repetitive pretty fast. Even when trying to branch from the norm, as in the case of duels, it didn't feel like there was much depth or learning curve.\n-One last thing that bugged me. In the Xbox 360 version there is the option to turn off swearing and blood, which didn't port over into the PC version. Now, I understand plenty of gamers believe the more gore, the merrier, but I appreciate the chance to share the game with kids and family. Given it's an option in the console version, I'd appreciate seeing it ported over.","May 24","true","1.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The first couple games are riddled with flaws, frustrating as hell in certain points, and have some awful pacing at  others. In addition, the story, while good, sometimes dragged in spots.\n\nCall of Juarez: Gunslinger, though, fixes every problem I had with the previous games and adds on layers of fun and innovative storytelling to create a tight and rewarding experience.\n\nThe mechanics themselves are as polished as any I've seen in any shooter, with headshots and bullet time ("Concentration") being the key words here. Racking up kills in creative and interesting ways fills your concentration bar, which allows you to slow down time and rack up further and further combos.\n\nAll this killing ties into a robust leveling system that has three different sections: Ranger, which is about rifles and long-range shooting; Trapper, whose skills are all about shotguns and dynamite; and the titular Gunslinger, which gives you the power to dual-wield pistols among other perks.\nYou can mix and match among the three paths, and by game's end should have a hefty majority; in each path there are two legendary weapons to be unlocked, which replace existing varieties and have added bonuses (in addition to being gold and looking awesome).\n\nThe levels themselves are well-designed and provide interesting ways of approaching each gunfight, from interactive environments to scattered cover to caches of ammunition and dynamite. They're beautiful, too, with bright colors lending themselves well to the game's cel-shaded art design. The only oddity as far as graphics go is that the game has a black outline around the screen, for no reason as far as I can tell other than artistic choice.\n\nEvery few stages there's a duel, which consists of you and one or two other people in a pitched battle to the death. The duel system of previous games was either janky or downright broken, depending on your luck, but here it's been vastly improved; you now have to focus your crosshair on an enemy while simultaneously moving your gun hand closer to your holster, but when your opponent goes to draw, you need only click your mouse to do the same, after which you time it right as your crosshair moves and put your unfortunate enemy in the ground.\n\nThe real draw here aside from gunplay is, like the two games before it, the story. A tale of betrayal, murder, and retribution, it's exciting from start to finish and peppered throughout with real-life historical figures, legendary outlaws and brave heroes alike. Twists and turns keep the narrative interesting, and the game's story is relayed to you by the main character, Silas Greaves. As he narrates, details change, causing elements of the levels to disappear and appear at will, and at certain points, even causes time to rewind if a detail was forgotten or left out.\nThe whole thing makes for a very compelling experience and will keep you entertained as you fight through levels full of both cowboys AND Indians.\n\nCall of Juarez: Gunslinger isn't just a game for Call of Juarez fans, shooter fans, or fans of the Wild West; it's for anyone who appreciates exciting gameplay that rewards skill, a story that keeps things fresh, and a polished and fun experience.\n\n10/10 whatevers","July 20, 2013","true","12.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/204450/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Call Of Juarez Gunslinger is an action packed first person shooter, set in the Wild West. It has big shootouts, duels, famous outlaws, you name it. Everything you would want from a game with a theme like this.\n\nThe story is told as a tale, so occasionally the story will rewind or change on the fly in order to adjust bits of the story. It's well integrated and it's a fun way to keep the story fresh. Now, this game is all about shooting so it's important that this part works well. Thankfully, it does.\n\nThe shooting aspect is tight and the reward system behind it is solid as well. Killing enemies will reward you with XP and if you kill enemies fast enough you'll build up a combo meter that will reward you with even more experience. There's also a focus key that will slow the game down so you can kill enemies more easily.\n\nThe skill trees are diverse (for a shooter, so don't expect any skills that don't belong here) and allow you to mix things up fairly well.\n\nGraphically the game looks awesome. It has a realistic look with what looks like a little bit of cel shading in it.\n\nFor a downloadable game Gunslinger is pretty long. It took me roughly 8 hours to complete the story. After that, you can start a new game with New Game Plus.\nIf you have no interest in starting over again, there's always the Duel and Arcade modes.\nDuel will have you duel (duh) against all of the enemy bosses from the story, with only 5 lives, and Arcade will put in your several levels of the game with cleverly placed enemies. The goal there is to kill enemies as fast as you can while building up your combo meter. A fun, very fun, challenge. In fact, I think I had more fun with the Arcade mode than the Story mode but that's because the Arcade mode is fast paced and allows for replayabilty, even if a level is only a few minutes long. Collecting 3 stars on all levels should take you a long time.\n\nGunslinger managed to truly impress me. But then again, I was already looking forward to playing this as there really aren't enough games around like this (I count The Club as one of them, more or less). It's now one of my favorite games of this year. I hope it does well enough to give us a possible sequel... downloadable or retail.\n\n[Rating: 93/100]","May 24, 2013","true","20.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Six9144/recommended/204450/","Six9144","Karl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Six9144/","135 products in account","Silas Greaves is probably full of ♥♥♥♥, but that’s OK. He’s a bounty hunter with a million stories to tell, and happy to share them for a whisky or five. Like the times he rode with Billy the Kid, or when he won the praise of Injun magic men, or that shootout he had with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (simultaneously). In short, tales of hanging out with just about every celebrity in the Wild West... and convenient excuses for why nobody can quite remember seeing him there.\n\nThis isn’t just a framing device for Gunslinger’s nine missions, but a big part of what helps this downloadable budget title wash away the foul taste of Call of Juarez: The Cartel. As expected, it’s a linear shooter set in a romanticised version of the Wild West (which the game itself at one point admits is complete balls). It’s also a shooter Greaves and his audience comment on throughout, the narration routinely changing the world to fit the story on the fly. At one point, for instance, you fight through a mine full of dynamite that only an idiot would go into with guns blazing. “That’s why I didn’t,” rasps Greaves, rewinding the story to tell it ‘properly’.\n\nThis doesn’t disguise the linearity, but it does make the straight path much more interesting. My only big complaint about the execution – aside from the fact that the dialogue was recorded as individual lines, and so usually fails to mesh into a smooth narrative – is that Techland didn’t use this gimmick on a full-budget game with scope for even bigger, more varied setpieces.\n\nRestricting Juarez to raw gunplay certainly doesn’t hurt it, because the shooting is excellent. While not rewriting the rules of FPS, there’s a real weight to the weapons, while the action is a mix of regular shootouts and switching to a special slow-mo Concentration mode to take out whole groups in the blink of an eye. This ability regenerates quickly, providing an interesting power balance where you can’t take much damage, but regularly get to go full ‘Angel of Death’ on whole crowds. There’s also a very clever system where, with enough charge, you get a 50/50 chance of dodging a slowed-down incoming bullet that would normally be lethal. Get it right and you stay in the fight.\n\nCombined, the two parts work beautifully. The story keeps things slightly off-balance and constantly throws up interesting moments, while the minute-by-minute gunplay makes murdering your way through that story intensely satisfying.\n\nYes, the graphics – and the cutscenes illustrated with static, hand-drawn images – are constant reminders that this is a budget game. Far from being diminished by that, however, Gunslinger impresses with just how well it spent its pennies. And, more impressively still, it makes the idea of another Call of Juarez game at some time in the future surprisingly appealing.","February 28, 2014","true","7.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/204450/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nThere are certain parts of history that seem like an endless supply of ideas for new stories and settings, and the Wild West is one of the greatest examples to prove that point. Call of Juarez Gunslinger uses that exact period in time to tell a great, believable and unexpected story using a combination of fictional stories and characters with actual events and legends from the American West. You play as Silas Greaves, one of the few fictional characters created to fill the bucket of an already enormous cast of Wild West legends, such as Billy the Kid, Jesse James or the Sundance Kid. The story unfolds as Silas Greaves tells more about his adventures to the young and old adventurers alike, listening to his stories at The Bull's Head Saloon. His narration is part of what makes this story so unique, as things will happen and events will chance according to the story he tells you and the interaction he has with the other characters taking part in the conversation at the saloon, adding things according to how they recall it happened or approving of things that Silas says, adding more context to the story. While the story is relatively small, taking around six hours to complete, the places you visit and enemies you will fight will make each moment of it feel memorable and unique, as you will one moment go head to head against one of the Dalton brothers, only to face Jesse James himself shooting a gatling gun your way the next one. In the same manner the locations will differ, offering a new and refreshing experience with each chapter, taking you from a vast canyon to a cave, only to then end up on a moving train, being a part of one of the biggest events in the American West history.\nRating: 9.5\n\nGameplay\nIn a crowd of modern military first person shooters, Gunslinger manages to stand out by using intuitive and easy to use mechanics that reward you based on how you play and give you the option to choose in which direction you want to go forward. This feature comes as a result of the skill tree, that allows you to unlock a new skill each time you level up, which can be done by collecting enough experience of course. Depending on how you play and manage your abilities you might earn you more or less experience, but the game never stops you from earning more, even after you get to the end of the game, as the New Game Plus mode will allow you to start a new game with a different difficulty level while carrying over all your unlocked skills and remaining experience points. There are two main abilities that will be unlocked from the start, with the option to improve or modify how those work and how long it takes for them to charge, and using them in an efficient way will prove to be the key later the game or in arcade mode if you're going for the highest score. Bullet time will slow down time, highlighting the enemies ahead of you and giving you a better chance at scoring headshots and combos, while bullet dodge will automatically activate when you are low on health and about to get hit by a fatal bullet, allowing you to move left or right in order to avoid it. Aside from the campaign, the arcade mode works in a similar way, allowing you to choose at the beginning of each level a specific loadout and unlock more skills to use with that loadout and improve the possible outcome as you play more and earn more experience.\nRating: 9\n\nGraphics\nCall of Juarez Gunslinger might not be the best looking game out there, but its unique art style does a great job hiding that, as the game's art style comes pretty close to what you would see on the cover of a dime novel, and with Silas' constant narration of the story, the entire game feels like you were actually experiencing the wild stories of the west seen through the eyes of Silas Greaves. The visual effects, while not stunning, manage to mix in with the scenery in a way that makes them feel natural and a part of the environment, even if some times they are out of place. The highest detail was of course put into the wild west legends themselves, making characters such as Jesse James look stunning and closely to what you would imagine him to look like if you were to stand right next to him.\nRating: 7.5\n\nAudio\nWhile it might not be as memorable and big as the soundtrack of other western themed games such as Red Dead Redemption, the tracks that are here manage to always stay in the mood with the action and when one of those rare moments of less shooting and more beauty comes along, there is always a good tune to add to the view. The voice acting is excellent and while some of the characters which are only part of Silas' story and do not actually stand with him in the saloon rarely speak, the ones that do take part in the dispute happening at the saloon over facts and how things went down are treated with a high quality voice that makes them come to life, with the honorable mention of Silas Greaves himself which is the narrator for most of the stories.\nRating: 8\n\nExtras\nThe campaign can be completed within six hours, but the fact that the story has two possible outcomes and that the New Game Plus mode which will unlock once you have completed the game for the first time allows you to start a new campaign and keep all your progress at the same time makes this experience be worth at least another replay. Aside from that you have the Duel Mode which is a recollection of all the duels throughout the story where you can improve your reaction time and compete for the highest scores, and Arcade Mode which is all about the leaderboards and the stars you can earn. There is no multiplayer mode, but with all there is to do as it is, you can easily spend around 15 hours in the game without even realizing it.\nRating: 9\n\nVerdict\nCall of Juarez Gunslinger is one of the best western experiences to date, and while it not might be as full of content as other titles on the market, it manages to tell an interesting story by using actual Wild West legends in combination with some newly created characters that have their unique personalities and role into the story. Aside from that, for the 15 bucks you pay for the game at full price, you get at least 15 hours of pure entertainment and maybe even more if you're digging the arcade mode and aim for a top position on the leaderboards.\nRating Overall: 8.6\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Call of Juarez: Gunslinger at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=292[/h1]","December 1, 2014","true","23.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/recommended/204450/","DangerousSaiga","Dangerous Saiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/","221 products in account","There are a very few Wild West or Western shooters in video game history and Call of Juarez: Gunslinger pulls it off in all places. Gunslinger is the first game I picked up for the Call of Juarez franchise as I haven't play the others. As far as I can tell from reading user reviews and critics, Gunslinger returns to its Wild West roots with excellent gameplay fluency, occasional humor, storytelling, and mechanics that stands out absolutely terrific.\n\nThe story is short, which may take you 6-9 hours, depending if you are looking for "Nugget of Truth". The storytelling narrative is actually worth paying attention to unlike most AAA titles in the market which pulls out huge price tag just to experience a mediocre story.  For the default price of $15, Gunslinger is an outstanding price if you want to experience the story (or the jack of all trade is the -75% discount for USD $3.75). In terms of gameplay, the mechanics feels really, really smooth and presents a cinematic experience as if you are watching a "widescreen" version of a video game. Each weapon you possess and handle feel power to it, with a touch of authenticity. The best gameplay mechanics would be Concentration and Duel. Concentration is basically slow motion which can highlight enemies, bullet projections, and slows dynamite throws so you can shoot it. In the other hand, Duel mechanic is the ultimate Wild West simulator where you and your AI opponent goes face-to-face in a standoff. The best tension in the game.\n\nOther game modes are presented in the game, mainly Arcade Mode and Duel Mode (which you go face-to-face against 15 antagonists from the story). These two modes are really enjoyable and worth playing if you want to rank against other Steam users to see who's the best of the best. Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is overlooked and underrated which is probably because of the mediocre franchise. However, Gunslinger stands out in sheer awe in terms of players who had experience the franchise from the first game. For many people who haven't play Call of Juarez and want to experience it, like me, Gunslinger is a must own purchase. One of the most underrated games for 2013 and the current gaming generation. I strongly recommend this game for its Western authenticity and immersion.","December 10, 2014","true","14.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morgannin09/recommended/204450/","morgannin09","Morgannin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morgannin09/","237 products in account","Abridged summary can be read at the very end of this review.\nWhat starts off as an entertaining little arcade shooter ends up filling a void I never realized was missing. As someone who doesn't often touch a modern FPS game, I may not have a whole lot of experience to describe why I think this game is worth so much more in $15 than most games earn for the $60 they demand, but I can at least describe why I love this game immensely.\n\nTo start, it's a fairly linear narrative-driven shooter, and that alone would have put me off in the light of Medal of Battle: Dutyfield games that have defined the genre in the past couple generations. But this game manages to stand between the modern conventions of shooters and the classic mechanics I remember from sneaking onto our old Compaq PC to play Doom or Duke Nukem when I was supposed to be in bed.\n\nGames these days can't get away with some kind of RPG progression system, but Gunslinger does away with the tedium of it by offering little perks that don't define how you play the game but just enhance it in non-essential ways. The exception would be the titual Gunslinger perk that allows you to dual-wield revolvers, with that being the only gain that offers a genuine mechanical difference. Otherwise, leveling up gives you slight advantages that make the game feel a bit more action-heavy and faster paced.\n\nThe levels in the game are surprisingly massive, which actually comes as a drawback to the experience, as in many cases I found myself lost until I hit a point where I was told I was leaving the story zone and had to turn around. Why these levels allow you to reach places so far from the objective is beyond me, as there is rarely anything to find outside of the scripted mission path. There are a load of secrets to find in each level, but they are placed in little nooks and crannies amidst the mission zone that it makes no sense to let you wander so far away.\n\nThe showdown mode, which stands in place of a boss fight in several levels, is what it is. You stand there, waiting and observing your enemy, baiting them to draw first yet finish last. It requires you to focus as much on your character as on your enemy, so there is a good bit of skill involved, but there is an artificial difficulty added by the immense sway of your crosshairs that is incredibly difficult to predict or compensate for. This system could use a lot of work, mechanically, but it's hard to fault them when I haven't quite seen anything like it since the original Red Dead Revolver, at the very least.\n\nThe gunplay is a load of fun. It's a fast-paced shooter where the simple objective is to out-bullet your enemies. Stealth is usually only a mechanic at the very beginning of a level - once you fire a shot, it's all out chaos. This is mitigated by a bullet-time mode that, with perks, can allow you to dodge bullets, line up headshots, and reload or swap weapons in a blink. Apart from that, the game occasionally sucks you into a QTE-mode to dodge bullets in a life-or-death scenario, or in scripted events that depend on precise reaction to button prompts to take out enemies quickly. I hate QTE's with a firm passion, but at least this game almost never relies on instant-death ones, instead requiring you to take them down the old fashioned way.\n\nBeing such an action-focused game, it's hard to believe that it has a surprisingly deep story. At first, the depth presents itself in its history-rich narrative, involving characters from classic American Western folklore, played up in a balance between recorded history and the first-hand account of an unreliable narrator. It's incredibly entertaining to watch how everything from the narrative to the enemies to the landscape itself gets reimagined as the player character recounts his tale to his imaginative audience. Your protagonist, Silas Greaves, presents his account of the downfall of just about every famous Western outlaw or folk hero as he regales his tale of revenge. How much truth you choose to derive from his boasted tale is up to you, but it all culminates in a unique opportunity to define how it all ends.\n\nTLDR version: Gunslinger is a fast-paced, action-packed shooter with a simple narrative that nevertheless drew me in deep and left me with a burning desire for more games of its caliber. I dearly hope that this franchise (which I will admit I've never played before this game) continues in such a direction, as I have not played such a compelling and satisfying single-player shooter in a very, very long time.","October 24, 2015","true","14.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Great voice acting and characters to love. They bring in many true cowboys from history and weave them into a fun and action packed fictional story. The game can be beaten in around 7 hours but the whole time it's fun.\n\nThe story is told while you play as Silas Greaves, the main character, narrates his run ins with the various cowboys looking for the men who murdered his brothers. He tells the stories to a group of patrons in a bar who doubt his accuracy of his story telling on occasion. There are laughs to be had a twist to be discovered.\n\nThere are collectibles that are cards telling you real history of the wild west. Great things to find and read if you love the wild west. You will also earn xp in the game to level up Silas to make you and even better gunfighter. After beating the game it unlocks a new game + and true west modes. This adds some good replayability to the game if you are one who likes to try and achieve the highest score you can for each level.\n\nAlso when you find one of the main cowboys you can be thrown into a duel. You control your hand over your gun to try and build speed up for a quicker draw and also a reticle over the enemy to build your focus for better accuracy. The goal is to draw faster than them and win the duel. Once you hit about 75% accuracy though you can draw first and shoot them but you could get a dishonarble kill which doesn't get you bonus xp.\n\nIt's a great game to play and not be passed up. I definitely recommend this awesome game.","February 29","true","9.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/recommended/204450/","ravenize","Ravenize > *","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/","338 products in account","I remember playing the original Call of Juarez ages ago and thinking that it was a fun, if frivalous, affair. Not much has changed with the series in close to a decade.\n\nThis installment is still fun and full of the usual first person shooter mechanics, plus a couple special abilities for things like slow motion and highlighting enemies. Duels also make an expected return, and they're a nice change of pace from the franticness of most levels. It's generally snappy and well-executed, but there is a terrible lack of variety in both the weapons and enemies, which only have 3 and 4 unique types, respectively. So despite an ok length the gameplay feels small and repetitive. And this time around they introduced an RPG-like skill tree (a must for any FPS these days), but it doesn't really change anything so you're going to be using the same techniques - iron sights, fire, cover, reload - to dispatch the same enemies over and over again.\n\nThe production value is quite high though. The graphics look mostly great at 1440, though a few sprites (particularly the playing cards) are pixelated. The environments seem like they'd be really fun to explore, and I tried, but was constantly being pushed back by an invasive invisible wall with a warning that I was "straying from the story." Yeah I was, that's exactly the point.\n\nThe voice acting is absolutely top notch. The accents and emotions are always appropriate and come through really nicely. A tip of my hat to whoever was behind the dialogue and the voice acting, because both deserve a lot of praise, and the effort that was put into them is readily apparent.\n\nIf only that same time and effort had been put into the actual plot and story. It's essentially just a whirlwind meet and greet of every celebrity from the Wild West. There's no depth despite attempts at it in the eleventh hour. Far too little too late.\n\nReally this game is the opposite of most: it's a fundamentally bad idea executed well. If there were a wider variety of enemies and guns, if you could explore more and it felt like a open world - even within the constraints of a linear, level-based progression - if the story actually drew you in and made you care about what happened, then this game could have been amazing. But its core design just wasn't strong enough to make it more than average.\n\nSo if you want a solid Western FPS that's going to divert you for a bit, but be utterly forgettable when it's over, then this is the game for you. Plus for value the extras are really nice add-ons: both the arcade and duel modes were a fun way of getting more out of the game assets. But if you want something with a story or depth or originality you'd best look elsewhere.

The game allows the player to carry their accumulated skills over to replays, so they can eventually fully master all categories.\n\nGraphics are pretty nice not the best, like the walking dead series but i love it play it really myself even in single player is really fun.

I sure was feeling lucky as I got Call of Juarez Gunslinger during the holiday sale for a really low price; and it was well worth the price.  If you’re a fan of westerns and you enjoy killing lots and lots of people then this game is entirely for you.\n\nThe story was interesting at times and overall was enjoyable, but there were parts where things just seemed dull and to obvious. The character acting was done well and gave a sense of individualism to each character. The game itself progresses decently but then at times takes a Borderlands-esk turn and quickly changes into some craziness. The basic direction behind each part of the story was kill a bunch of bad guys in some heroic way and then finish off some ringleader of each gang; like I said parts can be dull. The ending itself was decent and did leave me with closure.\n\nOverall the sound and music were good but not great as some vocals from NPCs were reused over and over. The music isn't award winning by any means and to me didn't really stand out at all. Graphically the game is good by current standards and is something that you will admire at times but not necessary be left in awe over.\n\nGun fighting and the actual FPS aspect to the game is done perfect and never left me feeling like I didn't know what I was doing from a mechanic point of view. The dueling mechanic is fun and original, but is somewhat confusing at times. Expect some redoes if you plan on being honorable about your dueling. The singple player gameplay  was enjoyable with the exceptions of some instances where I felt like I was getting shot by an unknown assailant. I also felt that the skill trees although interesting, felt like a waste after you got the reloading skill points.  Arcade mode is interesting until you 3 star it and then it’s basically just playing the same levels over again minus story and an added few extra NPCs to kill, unless of course you enjoy ladders.\n\nI really enjoyed myself from both an emersion standpoint and a mindless killing game. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good FPS single player with some extra content like arcade mode and new game plus.\n\n+ Great gunfights\n+ Funny NPC conversations\n+ Good Visuals\n- Gimmicky Duels\n- Vanilla Levels\n- Boring Arcade Mode\n\nScore: 8 out of 10\n","January 22, 2014","true","10.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The main character narrates the story through the whole game while you're playing, which is very atmospheric. The engine/graphics/artstyle are also nice to look at. The enemies and boss fights arent that much of a challenge (no tactics required). The combat itself is also simple (point, shoot, point, shoot...), but also offers variety by adding short, not too intrusive quicktime events, bullet time, etc... It's just fun taking enemies down that way :-) Playtime is about 3,5 hours for the story mode without looking for all the hidden items and trying to get achievements.","June 21, 2014","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I love the idea that you are playing a Story being told by an old man... I mean come on you gotta love that :3\nThe Guns all feel great to use, aiming may be hard but after a time its easy to handle. It also feels awesome to knock sbd out with your fists, which isnt a common thing in Shooters! (*Cough* Cod-Knife *Cough*) The only weapon that kinda disappointed me was the Shotgun. Hardly and Range and not always a 1-Shot,and thats why you end up dieing most of the time you try to shoot with it.\nThe HP Regeneration is ok,you dont have to sit in cover for hours and wait till your screen stops bleeding.

It has a strong, interesting narrative thats delivered by the protagonist, changing what’s happening in the game as he recalls it. Something we’ve seen in games before (think Bastion) and something thats done very well here.\nThe gameplay is a very “arcady” first-person-shooter, that’s well tuned with quick,responsive, controls.

There is also good duel challenges.\n-Arcade mode looks well.\n-Boss fights not that hard but they are still does good in my opinion.\nCons:\n\n-I think this is not a big problem but it's not open world, so you cant freely go everywhere in this beutiful world.

With the third game, The Cartel, Ubisoft most likely pushed Techland to develop a modern-day version of the game to appeal to a wider audience. Suffice to say, The Cartel got torn into pieces both by fans and the press because of its shortcomings in regards to visuals, story, character design, AI and, of course, because they dumped the entire Wild West theme in favor of a Drug Cartel War theme taking place in the modern-day Los Angeles.\n\nWith Gunslinger, Techland finally went back to the roots of the franchise and provided fans of the series with some more smoking Revolvers and Wild West action.\n\nThe story is fairly simple and as Wild West cliché as it can get: You end up in a saloon and tell the story of how an outlaw killed your brothers, so you became a bounty hunter seeking for revenge and came across many other famous outlaws such as Billy the Kid, Butch Cassidy, Sundance Kid or the Dalton - who all stood in the way between you and your Nemesis.\n\nWhile the story isn't exactly innovative, the storytelling itself definitely makes up for it as it is told in voice-over manner and makes up for some funny dialogues and actual game changing effects when the remaining crowd in the saloon questions details of the story. For example, 'you' tell them about how you've fought a hundred Indians all by yourself. The barkeeper thinks you're lying and couldn't have survived this, so the majority of Indians disappear from the level so that only a handful is left and then you reply something like 'Yeah, well, maybe it was a couple less...'. I can't recall I've seen a narration like this in another game, but I definitely liked it a lot.\n\nThe game is based on Techland's own Chrome Engine 5, which was also used for The Cartel and both Dead Island games, and makes use of a mix of both realistic and Cel-shaded graphics. While Gunslinger does look fairly decent on max settings, the lack of any AA option whatsoever makes for some really ugly jaggies around the edges of pretty much everything, so unless you force AA on in your graphics drivers or through a 3rd-party tool such as SweetFX, you will have to live with that.\n\nBeing a first person shooter, there aren't any surprises in regards to controls or movement. Everything feels smoth and precise and the hit feedback is also pretty satisfying, so you always know if you've hit an enemy with any of the, unfortunately, few weapons in the game - among them revolvers, a rifle, a shotgun and their sawn-off counterparts. Additionally, by killing enemies and racking up combos or by finding collectibles, you earn XP which you can spend on a variety of character upgrades.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game, though, is the linearity. While the first two games basically had on open world where you could saddle your horse and just roam around, Gunslinger has a relatively narrow level design where a horse wouldn't even make sense, so they removed the horse riding aspect entirely from the game, which is a huge shame IMO.\n\nWith around 4.5 hours for the main story on normal difficulty, the game is fairly short but if you want to spend more time with it you can replay the story in the New Game+ mode, which will preserve all your previously unlocked upgrades and provide for some additional challenge. On top of that there is an Arcade mode with 10 levels where you can fight your way to the top of the leaderboards. Lastly, there is a Duel mode where you have 5 lives and  face 15 enemies one after another until you either win or run out of lives.\n\nCall of Juarez: Gunslinger has some minor flaws, but for a budget game like this I'm extremely surprised by its quality, so if you're a fan of the original CoJ games or just want a decent Wild West experience, give Gunslinger a shot (heh) and check the game's store page for the Demo download button.","October 29, 2013","true","5.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Well, if you look at the western-themed games there are just 3 out there - we can disregard The Cartel which is set in modern day Los Angeles for the sake of this review.\n\nWhat I like about the game is that it does not take itself seriously. Silas, our protagonist, goes to a saloon and starts the telling of many tales with the involvement of all the legendary Wild West outlaws. Silas either killed, wounded these people or just rode alongside them. Every level is a different tale with a different setting and outlaw.\n\nNow, about the gameplay: slow-mo is more frequent than in previous games and duelling is easier and more exciting. You have more collectibles hidden throughout each level and these so-called "nuggets" fill the in-game database with a lot of information on the era: everything you wanted to know about every outlaw, the steamship, the gatling gun, etc.\n\nKilling people with precision and speed allows you to obtain more experience points - levelling up lets you pick a skill / upgrade which aims to take you to the land of specialisation. You'll be an expert of weapon handling so you are free to pick which weapon will be the most suitable for you. With the shotgun you can be the master of close-quarter combat, with the rifle you can further enhance your precision aiming and become the ultimate sharpshooter and with the dual-wielding of pistols you can really become a true cowboy.\n\nLevels can be played separately, after finishing the story just for the sake of obtaining more scores to compete with your friends on leaderboards. The same goes for duels - one duel after another during which you have a limited number of lives: Do you have what it takes to win all of them without reloading?\n\nTechland's Chrome Engine offers us more colourful visuals than ever. The game has vivid colours and overall you can see more attention was put into detail than in any previous CoJ game. Not only does it look good but it runs at a smooth 60 FPS.\n\nThis has been the best CoJ game to date. The story is forgettable but let's be honest we only play a western-themed game for its shootouts and Gunslinger has just claimed the throne.","March 17, 2014","true","8.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But an arcade mode and limited-lives dueling challenge provide a shot of friendly competition as diversion from the game's main draw, and at eight to ten hours long, it's satisfying enough as a single-player experience if you're willing to go along for the ride and see where it takes you.","February 16, 2014","true","13.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxBrando/recommended/204450/","MaxBrando","YagamiBrando","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxBrando/","62 products in account","Call of Juarez® Gunslinger is the 4th game of the series. Story-wise it has no connection with the other games, heck you won't even visit Juarez in this game, so I really don't know why they titled the game "Call of Juarez", it could seriously be just "Gunslinger" or something.\nThere is a new protagonist, Silas Greaves, and there are no other playable characters in the game. Silas is a bounty hunter, and he wants revenge against 3 bad guys who killed his brothers. So, he searches for them killing other legendary outlaws who are foolish enough to stand in his way. Or at least that's what his story is about. That's right, the whole game is a "story by Silas Greaves", which he retells in one of the bars. So each chapter is a flashback from his past, kinda. Such style of giving the story is a bit odd and it oddly impacts the gameplay, for example when Silas says that he was fighting apaches - you fight with apaches in the game, but then he says that they were not apaches, they were just bandits who ambushed him "apache-style" and poof! the apaches in the game magically transform into bandits and the level continues. Yeah, that's pretty funny, but actually I didn't like such things. Because the story is actually series of flashbacks, "in-game Silas", that you play during the levels never speaks for himself. We can only hear the Narrator-silas, who is telling the story. There are many cool bosses in the game, but they are kinda soulless, because Silas never communicates with them directly, we can only hear narrator-silas say something like "...and then I told him to surrender, but he didn't listen, so I had to shoot him." Well, the story is kinda poor if you ask me, yeah there will be an interesting twist in the end, but still. I just don't like this kind of narration. The protagonist is ok, but he is nowhere near Ray McCall (who was a total Badass). The bosses are cool and most of them (if not all) were real people. But in the game they are kinda soulless because most of them never speak and it makes me sad. Also, this special "dark" atmosphere of the first two CoJ games is gone here.\nNow about the gameplay - well this is where the game shines. It is an excellent FPS shooter with lots of cool arcade elements. We have our classic slow-motion ability, which highlihts enemies, also there are different QTE moments which look pretty brutal, and there is a decent power-up/level-up system. You can spend your experience to upgrade your abilities of dual pistol wielding gunslinger, close combat shot gunner or long distance rifle using Ranger. Whatever fits your playstyle, amigo. There are very few weapons in the game, unfortunately, we have 3 types of pistols, 2 types of rifles (which are almost the same), and 2 types of shotfuns. Oh and we have dynamite.The levels are quite short, but I was still satisfied with the length of the game. Aside from the main story mode there are Arcade mode (where your objective is to clear the levels fast enough and to have a solid combo-series of kills to achieve a highest grade) and Duel-mode, where you will face all the bosses in a duel, so it's kind of a boss-rush duel mode I guess.\nSoundtrack is decent and the graphics are good enough (although I miss seeing my lower body and legs when I look down. looks like Silas doesn't have 1st person model :( ).\nVERDICT: "Gunslinger" is a decent western shooter and I definitely recommend it to any FPS or Western lover. But the story is not connected to the previous games of the series and this flashbacks-narration style is not to my liking. I haven't played CoJ: The Cartel yet, but I can definitely say, that the first two CoJ games captivated me more and I had a stronger impression after completing them. If you ask me, Bound in Blood is better than gunslinger in every possible way, although if you look at Gunslinger as a game of its own and not a Call of Juarez game, than it will be much better.\nMy personal rating for this game is 7.5/10.","November 10, 2014","true","12.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This Wild West show bowled me over and here are a few of the reasons…\n\nExcellent Voice-acting, nice visuals and terrain with brilliant maps (although I noticed one was a reuse, may have been more not sure). Excellent music with a real Wild West theme. The narration does well to keep the campaign play through engaging, and doesn't take itself too seriously and this deserves a special mention as it was spot on (some of the lines made me chuckle and the story telling was brill). Nice historical bits of history that are enjoyable to read through collectables. Solid, entertaining gunplay mechanics. Nice upgrade trees all fairly unique depending on play style. Frequent checkpoints, useful for someone who dies (A LOT) and is pants at FPS. Extra features such as mini game duel (which I loved!), and arcade game.\n\nI could mention the negatives but I would just be picking this game is well worth it even more so when on sale, thumbs up from me!\n","March 9","true","14.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Everything is set in place as it needs to be, for the story is told as you share your tale in a bar drinking whiskey, filled with so many cleches to add to it all (this is a good thing by the way), the drinking, the grit, the word "revenge" being used at least 298,556 times.\n\nAside from that 'Gunslinger' is a very good shooter. Simple tacked on RPG leveling system, sure, but the gunplay is incredibly enjoyable and fast flowing, if with pistols. You see the game's difficulty is an interesting one, at it's core its not the most challenging but expect to die many times for acidentally staying in a certain place for a bit too long. The game has regenerating health so you will need to go into cover a lot, which is a shame with this considering it could have been much faster. I wouldn't really say health packs couldn't be placed in with the excuse that this is a lightly developed game, because most of the levels are teachnically linear, and I don't think health placement wouldn't of been that much of an issue. Along with that (the requirment of cover and caution) you will probably be sticking to your pistols for most of the time, since they offer the perfect balance of range and speed. Occasionally you might go to the rifle but pistols seem more convient. In this regard, I felt the shotgun was almost useless, since range is so important in this game and getting to close to a group of enemies can tear you to shreds instantly.\n\nThere are no other weapons aside from these 3 not counting the turret-styled gattling gun and the 2 or 3 different types of pistols, which is all rather a shame. A game such as this could have an explosion of weapon variety, like a sniper rifle, or maybe throwning knifes as an alternative to dynamite.\n\nI suppose you can't really ask for that much with a game that was worked on as lightly as this was, and being released with a 14.99$ price tag. Seems like an apology for 'The Cartel' and as such, it's a damn good one. The action is fun, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous, the whole western theme and style is done perfectly, and even as a very short game it is still fufilling (also contains new game+, arcade mode, and a duel mode.)\n\nThis is a fantastic little surprise that I think many people could enjoy, and although I am not a fan of this series, I would love to see it continued based on 'Gunslinger' with a full development, because 'Gunslinger' has an open ended stlye to get in some really epic stuff.\n\nLike a portable gattling gun. That's what you would expect from this game. A portable gattling gun. Let's have that.","December 1, 2013","true","4.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bakamon0/recommended/204450/","bakamon0","bakamono","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bakamon0/","578 products in account","Lately I've been asking myself if it's possible that I'm just done shooting a man. I constantly find myself bored with FPS games; generally, if I finish one it's just because I was determined to see it through to the end despite the whole thing where I'm not actually having fun. About an hour into Gunslinger, I exited the game, convinced that this was actually the case. I was done with FPSes. Time to hang up my disembodied guns.\n\nThen I loaded up this game again, mostly because I love the story conceit of this game so I wanted to see it through to the end (plus I heard it was pretty short so what the hell). Woops I was real ♥♥♥♥in' wrong. My bad. I slogged on for a bit longer, then I started getting deeper into the skill trees. Then the game finally became what it was supposed to be. I guess my impatience is showing if I feel that a game takes too long to get going after an hour, but here we are. Once you gain skills that start improving your ability to combo, the game arrives where it should have been at the beginning.\n\nIf you're feeling tl;dr, skip the next two paragraphs. They're pretty spergy. Then come back (or don't).\n\nI made the mistake of starting with the shotgun and rifle skill trees. Who would have thought that in a game called GUNSLINGER, maybe the GUNSLINGER tree was the way to go. Imagine that. So you make your way down the gunslinger tree, your combos last longer, do bonus damage, whatever. Then you reach the last skill (this will take you like an hour if you go right for it.) It refills your concentration (bullet time) meter every time your combo reaches a multiple of 6. Holy ♥♥♥♥, now this is a game. You're now chaining entire multiple wave setpieces down without your opponents getting to take a shot. Maybe there's just a part of me that loves the mental image of loads of guys exploding into blood decals the second they peek their heads out from behind a wall all at once. It's incredible.\n\nI know this is a hyperspecific way to play the game, and one size probably doesn't fit all, so I'll just go on to say that the game is probably still fun even if this doesn't tickle your fancy the way it does for me. I should probably tell you that the other skill trees are also well thought out and give you fun additional things that change the way the game plays. In the close quarters tree you gain the ability to throw back dynamite off the ground (maybe this should have been free), make your dynamite split into individual sticks in midair (with predictable results), and even skip reloading in concentration mode (this is a game changer, considering shotguns are two shot affairs). I felt like they were pretty weak until I got a couple damage boosts, but then after that all close quarters levels were handled with akimbo sawed-offs. The rifle tree is less exciting, but the rifle is already stupid overpowered so I guess that's ok. I mostly just used the pistol skills with a rifle.\n\n----\n\nNow that that's over... the story in this game is pretty great. You're an old bounty hunter sitting at a bar with some strangers,  telling tall tales about how you were friends with, had run ins with, or killed pretty much every single outlaw that pop culture has deemed worthy of keeping in the public conscience. You begin your first mission with Billy the Kid, end up chasing Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and eventually winging Jesse James. The thing that I love about this game though is the way the narrative sometimes changes midsentence. You'll play a sequence, then your narrator will inform you that that didn't actually happen, and then a totally different story will play out. I know that probably reads like lazy storytelling but it's really well done, in my opinion. Paths will open up in front of you when the story deems it necessary even though there was nothing there before. I lost my ♥♥♥♥ when I saw my first sky ladder.\n\nSo um, the bad. The duels are an excellent concept, but in practice can be super frustrating! I played with a controller and I feel like the analog sticks helped tremendously, so maybe that's something to consider. I actually tried doing a duel with mouse and keyboard before I wrote this and I can't say I recommend it. It's kind of a generic shooter until you get down the skill trees, but this probably isn't as big of a knock for most people as it is for me. The game is about 4 hours long. I'm not really a dollar per hour kind of guy but I can see this mattering for some people so I think it's worth mentioning. I think it has pretty good replay value but I'm the type of person that plays a game 2 or 3 times most of the time anyway.\n\nGo buy this game. I want more old west shooters. Thanks.\n\n(I also want to add that I think it's really funny comparing the hyper stylized comic book panels for all the main characters to the actual pictures of the dumpy looking dudes that you can find on the game's collectibles.

Similar in a way to Bastion where the main character (you) narrates the sometimes over exaggerated western story in the late 1800's early 1900's. The landscape changes as it is being told, enemies appear and sometimes (hundreds out of thin air) When one of the listeners found themselves falling asleep during a fairly dull part of the game. Overall the humour is fantastic and it's well-paced game.\n\n\nThe gun-play is arcadey, Gun choices are fairly limited. You're giving a small variety of revolvers, shotguns and bolt action rifles. There is a small skill-tree and a leveling system in the game. You'll have special abilities that can help you dodge bullets in slow motion, as well as pulling off multi-kills during that slow motion duration.\n\n\nCall of Juarez Gunslinger is a GOOD looking game. The cell-shaded art is beautiful and the scenery is gorgeous. As I was playing many times I was just floored by the incredible scene that lay in front of me.  There's a good amount of content in this game. You get the story mode (which has 2 endings) with a new game+ mode. An Arcade mode for high scores and Duels where you just face off against NPC's in an old western style duel! If you're a fan of westerns, or just fast-paced FPS then this would be worth your time.\n\n\n*I should add that Uplay is NOT required to run this game!","June 29, 2014","true","3.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

(By the way: Visit thefpl.us for horrifying things read with enthusiasm. No, I don't care about ethics in gaming journalism.)\n\nSo when I booted up Call of Juarez: Gunslinger for the first time, I noticed two things:\n\n1: Oh, hey, the protagonist is narrating his story as I am shooting the bad guys.\n2: Hold up, wait a minute. Techland made this? Dead Island Techland?\n\nYep, the same guys who made Dead Island made this. And I'm pretty surprised with how it turned out, given that Techland is known lately for making ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (like Dead Island, Dead Island: Riptide, Escape Dead Island), and the sequel that nearly killed this franchise dead: Call of Juarez The Cartel. Despite The Cartel being a pile of garbage with a cowboy hat on the top, Call of Juarez lived to fight another day, and I'm so glad it did because it resulted in Gunslinger. (It's not without its share of dumb visual design decisions, such as the quick-time bullet event happening when you've shot a cowboy to death and another dude shoots a killing shot that passes through his body and only appears through the other side when it's too ♥♥♥♥ing late to decide when to dodge. Or that entire level where you're fighting underneath a railroad bridge, where the shadows and the daylight contrast into this visually horrid mess that made my eyes cross.)\n\nAll the FPS elements here are solid, but what makes the game really stand out is that Silas Greaves (the dude you're playing as) is telling the story of his blood-soaked career as a bounty hunter. The entire game is framed through Silas's recollection and storytelling as he's sitting there, getting loaded in a bar while skeptics and dime-store novel junkies hang on his every word and call his story out at points. For a moment, one of the people listening to his story says that the Pinkertons were fighting the same train robbers as he was, and the Pinkertons arrive to help Silas. But then, he says "I've been there, I fought all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ train robbers all by myself with no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pinkertons", and like that, The Pinkertons vanish. He embellishes, and we are him, fighting through his embellishments, with every kill and room clearing adding to his story. He gets progressively drunker through the game, and with every drink, his story becomes more outlandish and less believeable, and up until the end, I kept trying to figure out whether his story was real or not. The developers kind of tip their hand at the end, which kind of ruined it for me, but it's not like that invalidated the previous five hours of game I had played through, so who cares?\n\nGunslinger is tons of fun, like being told a story by your grandfather, but IN VIDEO GAME FORM.\n\nA quick note to the publisher:\n\nI almost never played this game because of UPlay. UPlay is a pain in the ♥♥♥ - it's like waking up and finding out that the Ferrari corporation has installed a retractable wheel boot on the lovely new sports car I purchased, and I have to call them over the phone to verify that, yes, it is me, I did purchase this car. Every time I want to drive it. I just assume all Ubisoft releases have it now, and I wistfully sigh as I see another game I want to play potentially tainted by original sin. The new Rayman game, for instance. Classics I've been dying to play like Driver: San Francisco. Hell, I was even considering giving the new Far Cry a shot, but I'm not going to. Ubisoft could make the video game equivalent of Moby ♥♥♥♥, but I will not touch it if I have to go through UPlay.","March 18, 2015","true","4.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

I had a craving for something different in a shooter and this totally delivered. Not since Red Dead Redemption has a game captured the feeling of the "wild" west as well as this game. Beautifully rendered graphics and although linear in design, gave you just enough incentive with the "history nugget" unlocks, that exploring through every nook and cranny of the levels is worth it. The guns and gunplay was done brilliantly , not since the iD Doom/Rage shotgun have I had so much fun shooting! (everything from badguys to rusty coffee cans to chickens)\nThe gameplay mechanics on bullet time, bullet dodging and duels was executed perfectly. The story  ideas were well thought out and engaging, with an original story telling  idea that you play both what the legend tells, and what the actual history was. (with the legend and the reality usually being wildly different)\nA short game, but lots of replayabilty with different game play modes and leaderboards, etc.\nIf Ubi set out to atone for the horrible mess that was "C.o.J - The Cartel" then they have redeemed themselves totally, and have made what is quite possibly one of the best western games ever made.\nTotally worth the new release price of 15$ and a must have  if it ever goes on sale!","June 14, 2013","true","11.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

After dabbling a bit in other, not as atmospherical settings (ie The Cartel), this game returns to the best game in the series, Bound in Blood, and puts us in that classic western mood. The mechanics are solid, no unnecessary gimmicks or items or stuff like that, just a few proper guns. There isn't great variety in them, but one can imagine there wasn't, back in that day. The story has a neat twist, in that it is narrated, and sometimes the narrator "forgets" or "remembers" things, which in turn has an effect on the gameplay.\nThe story is short (7 hours), but has some replay value, and there's an Arcade mode which has you shooting as well as you can in set paths for highscores.\nGraphically, the game is much more polished than you would expect from a relatively unknown game like this, and sometimes I just had to stop and stare at the scenery.\nI highly recommend it for the current price, since it's one of the better single player FPS experiences I've had.","December 2, 2013","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The storytelling was entertaining because it was told through flashbacks by the main character, who always had some funny remarks about the situations he was in.\nThe graphics were absolutely gorgeous on max settings.\nThe gameplay was really fun too. It played like a typical western shooter with guns like a shotgun, rifle and revolver, but it added some cool features like boss fights and bullet time. Skills like bullet time could be improved by the simple leveling system. Also very cool were the one-to-one duels, where you have to shoot your opponent before he shoots you (obviously), which will put your reaction time to the test.\nMy only complaint about this game is that it was too short ! I completed it in less than 5 hours. After that you can also play arcade mode and duels, but those are not as entertaining as the main story. You can also start a new game+ on a harder difficulty to make full use of the skills you got through the leveling system in the first playtrough, but that's about it.\nI would recommend the game to anyone who even remotely likes shooters or westerns (or both), because of the fun gameplay, the gorgeous visuals and the entertaining storytelling.","December 29, 2013","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/haslam_/recommended/204450/","haslam_","Haslam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/haslam_/","255 products in account","Before I start off:\n\n- I ran the game on max settings without any mods\n- I've played through the story on 'Hard' mode\n- I have no experience with any of the other 'Call of Juarez' games\n\nFirst off, the settings:\n\n- Full set of resolutions, probably goes past 60Hz\n- No AA or filtering options\n- Just 'Low', 'Medium' and 'High' for texture quality, etc.\n- Subtitles option :)\n- You can change lots of audio volumes, but no '0-100%' indicator\n- Detailed 'How to Play' menu\n- Limited key bindings, an annoyance because of some odd buttons\n- Detailed mouse options, smoothing, invert, etc.\n\n---\n\nOkay, so let's start with the game. The graphics aren't bad, but definitely not 2013 material. However, this isn't really an issue, as it still looks good enough in my eyes. I haven't played any of the other games, and as far as I saw you do not need to play any of them to understand any part of the story. You play as Silas Greaves, reliving his memories as a bounty hunter. A large portion of the game has narration between Silas as an older man, and some other characters in a bar. The narration is often comical and dosen't disrupt the game, so it's likeable. The game makes clear that it's about a man reliving his thoughts, because objects appear from nowhere, taking off any serious edge from the stereotypical 'Hollywood Western' style.\n\nThroughout the entire game there's a really thick black layer around the edge of the entire screen. It's a bit cumbersome at first, but you get used to it. I have no idea why it's there. It's pointless. You can tell it was ported from the Xbox 360, because you can see the D-pad icon on the weapon wheel, but the game is still quite well optimised, as I've never had any drops in framerate throughout the entire game. Most of the controls - the important ones - work very well for KB+M, but some, for example the 'Show objective location' button is set to 'O' and cannot be rebound.\n\nThis game sets you against outlaws and more in every mission in the exact same way; they shoot and you shoot back. This is what all FPS games are like, and it puts lots of people off (those who prefer strategy or RPG games) because of it's simplicity. But as someone who is sick and tired of this same formula, I was very surprised. The gunplay is very easy to get used to, but will require some practice to master. It perfectly manages (on hard mode at least) to make you feel like the best gunslinger in the Wild West, while still giving you lots of room for failure. The UI is minimal and looks nice, and aside from the annoying border I mentioned earlier, fits in nicely. It has an arcade style scoring system, which puts up your mission score amongst your friends for some replayability.\n\nYou are doing the same thing on every single mission; killing people in the exact same way and fighting a 'boss' at the end. There are collectibles, but all of them have Wild West lore within and there's only roughly 3 per mission, so it's a nice amount that actually gives you a reason to find them, unlike in most Ubisoft games nowadays. But surprisingly, dual-wielding revolvers and taking down 5 enemies in 3 seconds never ceased being entertaining, aside from the duel minigame, which was interesting at first but it was compulsory and tedious, and happened at the end of most missions. There's 2 gamemodes aside from 'Story': 'Arcade' and 'Duels', but both are just recycled from the Story and are very boring and pointless if you've finished it. On the whole though, with a leveling system that isn't just plastic to one playthrough of the story, a new difficulty setting unlocked after one playthrough, and a New Game+ option, the game's replayability just isn't enough to warrant a second playthrough. It's a fun game, but because it relies on surprise QTEs and slow-mo showdowns that don't have the same effect on the second time through. For me, on hard mode it took merely almost 3 hours to play through what I think the game had to offer (The story, a tiny bit of arcade mode).\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game, and it was a truly refreshing FPS experience. The biggest downside is the length of the story and lack of replayability, but for £11.99, I'd say it's worth it. It's also often on a discount so if you don't have much money, you won't have to wait long before you can buy it for less.\n\nThanks for reading.","June 22, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

If you want a wildly entertaining single player FPS set in the old west, this is the game for you. You're a retired bounty hunter in a saloon where people buy you drinks to hear your stories. The further into the game you go, the more drinks you've had, so the stories get more exaggerated. When bar patrons catch you in a lie, the level quickly changes as you try to adapt your story. It's pretty hilarious. The cell shaded graphics look great. The skill trees in both Story and Arcade mode really change the way you play. I got through Story mode on easy difficulty in about 10 hours, and have since been replaying on a harder difficulty as well as spending time in Arcade mode. There are more environmental traps to watch out for on the harder difficulty settings, such as mining carts flying through tunnels which will kill you if you don't get out of the way in time.","December 15, 2013","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However I'm loving this game, despite it sharing a lot of similarities with Call of Duty, including two out of three words of the title. How's that so? Well, two reasons, mainly:\n\n1) the gameplay is made slightly more arcade-y than the CoD I remember playing by the presence of scores and combo multipliers. It's not the trick glory that was Bulletstorm but it's still pretty good to turn the experience into a neat game of skill;\n\n2) the story and the voice acting are straight up awesome and set up a wonderful mood, while being tongue-in-cheek and not taking themselves too seriously. The best bit is that the whole plot is basically a collection of tall tales told by an old bounty hunter at a saloon, so he's all but reliable. And this reflects on the gameplay as objects pop out of air as he remembers them (or makes them up?) and entire sections of the story are rewritten on the fly (but still leave you the experience and skills acquired).

It's hard to have a compelling story in a single player shooter, but Gunslinger gets it right with its interesting narration throughout, as told to a bunch of bar patrons.  As the star gets called out on overembellishment or recalls missing pieces, the game changes with it; paths open up, the weather changes, or even entire sections are replayed.  The campaign is short (took around 4 hours on hard), but it is a perfect length I think for a story like this and it doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nThe shooting is also solid and while there isn't a whole lot of weapon variety, the pieces provided do make you feel like a gun slinger.  A few iterations of bullet time round out this western; nothing cooler than making a split second reflex button press and dodging an otherwise fatal round.\n\nWorth a look if you've got a few hours to kill (the game also has speedrun/leaderboard items to add to longevity).","February 15","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has very realistic and imaginative level design. The in-game physics are very believable, as they reproduce very realistic effects. The dialogu and the accent of the narrator is highly entertaining and authentic. Whilst there could have been more period specific weapons, such as the 1887 Shotgun and the 1895 Winchester, the existing ones are pleasing to both the eye and are a joy to shoot. Gunslinger is more a visual perfection of the series, which attempts to add the graphic novel element to dramatic effect and succeeds. The reloading animation of the Winchester and the shortended Winchester are wrong and the Schofield is too quick, but the weapons otherwise work well and the powder barrel explosions are both effective and impressive to watch. Fans of the series and western afficionados will find a lot of things to like about this game.","December 28, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It may be short, but it sure is sweet. With the perfect balance of Borderlands-esque humor and art style, mixed with the sheer beauty of the west, it's one of the most enjoyable games that I have ever played. The combat is tight and frantic, with extremely satisfying gunshots and explosions.\n\nYou'll meet a ensemble of many legends of the Wild West on your journey, and you'll kill most of them. Though Silas' story may be a bit exaggerated, you will discover "nuggets of truth" along the way. These nuggets are little snippets of the true history of the West and it's outlaws.\n\nWhile a part of me wishes that it was much longer, I think the shortness of the game is actually one of it's strengths. It doesn't outstay its welcome - it doesn't lose its focus, its charm, along the way. From start to finish, Gunslinger is satisfying and fun, with great combat, hilarious dialogue, and a truly epic tale... the tale of Silas Greaves.","March 3","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story mode can be quite quick, especially if you're acquainted with other FPS games and play at the easiest difficulty, but is supplimented by collectibles you can go back and search for in each level, 3 difficulty levels, an arcade mode where you can attempt to get the highest score, a duel gauntlet, and a NG+ mode.\n\nSkills in this game actually feel rewarding and like they impact the gameplay, making the decision about which to get take some preplanning and consideration. The rifle, shotgun, and pistols all play differently and allow freedom on what playstyle you want, but the upgraded versions you get from skills feel only marginally unique and do little to differ from one another, except visually.\n\nThe visuals were appealing to me, not ultra-realistic but went in line with the storytelling and recollection elements of the game. Felt very satisfying to shoot something or for an explosion to go off, or to see bullets going by as you slowed time down and sprayed into a room. It is an old game, but that doesn't get in the way of playing it (except alt-tabbing, don't do that unless you intend on closing the game).\n\nHonestly, the only downside would be the amount of hours you could put into this before having 'done' everything. To complete the story mode twice, 3 star all the arcade levels, and collect about half of the collectibles, took me about 15-20 hours (5-10 offline). However, this game is on sale often and can be found lower than the $9.99 pricepoint. But this game was definitely worth the time and money I put into it, and deserves to get a lot more recognition than it has so far.\n\nEDIT: THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY A 2013 GAME, MY MISTAKE.","December 20, 2015","true","234.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A bounty hunter.\nThe story is told by Silas himself (in exchange for some free whiskey) as he reflects on his journey.\n\nSilas is on a quest for revenge. To right a wrong done to him. Hunting his archnemesis all throughout 'The Wild West' and meeting some notorious outlaws in the process. 'Billy: The Kid', 'Jesse James' and 'Butch Cassidy' to name a few. You'll actually get to duel them in a typical mexican standoff, but more on that later. In pursuit of your archnemesis, you''ll come across bank heists, train robberies, and what would a western be without some indians trying to scalp you.\n\nOverall it's a pretty decent story. Nothing new, we all heard it before. Some plot twists and turns, but it's well executed. The voice acting is quite solid and the narrative style of storytelling contributes to the atmosphere of the game. I also liked the occasional story rewind of how things really went down. It seems our dear Mr. Silas Greaves tends to exaggerate a bit. Let's just contribute that to all the free whiskey he's been pouring down his throat in exchange for this story.\n\n\n*** GRAPHICS ***\n\nGraphics are great. It's a cel shaded style, which really fits the setting in this case. Some features include sun shafts, water ripples, weather effects and destructible objects. You have the ocassional low resolution textures, but nothing really disturbing. I'm usually to busy shooting people in the face anyways. Overall it looks really stunning and runs quite smooth also. I tend to favor gameplay over graphics, which brings me to....\n\n\n*** GAMEPLAY ***\n\nThere are three gamemodes available: Story / Arcade / Duel\nLet's begin with the story mode:\n\n*story mode* consist out of a mission based (episodic) format.\nBasically you'll move from objective to objective eliminating all who stand in your way in a linear path. At the end of the mission you'll usually face a boss (in this case a famous outlaw like Jesse James) and have a true mexican standoff. Eliminating enemies will grant you with experience points. These can be used to unlock and upgrade some abilities. You have three tiers of skill categories which favor the matching playstyle (dual wielding / rifleman / shotgunner)\n\nMaybe the best part about the gameplay is the return of 'bullet-time' we know so well from Max Payne. Slow motion gameplay, dodging bullets, lining up headshots (or crotch shots if you're into that) and keep those combo's going.\n\nEnemies are hiding behind objects, actively taking cover.\nA.I. isn't too smart though, but hey it remains an arcade style shooter and not a tactical masterpiece.\n\nYou'll also have your basic hidden secrets (golden nuggets) which, if collected, tell a bit about the background story and also net you some extra experience points in the process.\n\nSome minor QTE's on scripted occasions are also present.\nLuckily they're quite scarce and not all that annoying.\n\nFor the die-hard cowboy a 'new game+' mode is included.\nThis keeps your hard-earned xp and existing skills intact for the next playthrough, if you so desire. The True West difficulty only unlocks after finishing the story mode once and offers an increased challenge due to the complete absence of a HUD.\n\n*Arcade mode* is basically a rehash from the story mode missions. Run through a parcours to the finish line, eliminating bad guys and scoring as much combo's and points as possible. Nothing really special here, but it guarantees some additional gametime.\n\n*Duel mode* offers a mexican standoff against 15 of the in-game outlaws. 'Billy: The Kid', Jesse James, The Daltons, Butch Cassidy etc. The principle consists out of keeping two pointers simultaneously in the correct zones. One pointer resembles your draw hand and hovers above your pistol. The longer you keep it in the correct zone the faster you will draw your weapon. The second pointer is aimed at your opponent and resembles accuracy. The longer you correctly aim at your opponent the more accurate your shot will be. Furthermore, you can kill your opponents 'honorably' (which means that you react upon them drawing first) or 'dishonorably' (which inevitably means that you draw first). Statistics about reaction time and even leaderboards are available.\n\n\n*** CONCLUSION ***\n\nGunslinger is quite a solid arcade shooter. I didn't expect this after the debacle with 'The Cartel'. Everything blends really well together (graphics, gameplay, sound and the narrative storytelling). It's an immersive experience and The Wild West never looked this good. Sure, one may claim it is too short (ca. 8-12 hours) story mode, depending on skill, rushing or finding all collectibles etc.) It's linear and not free roam and maybe has little replay value, but in the end it doesn't really hurt the game. For a $15 listing, this is quite a steal. I know some $50 titles that are a lot worse.\n\nIf you're looking for a solid arcade shooter, you actually might be pleasantly suprised.\nMy rating an easy (8/10).\nHighly recommended.","December 3, 2013","true","17.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly, Pale Rider, A Fistfull of Dollars, and even the genre bookend Unforgiven, are what this game emulates and channels perfectly.\n\nI am simply shocked that I haven't played this game until now, and even feel a little guilty for not having paid full price for this on release day.\n\nDespite the romanticism of the storytelling, I also enjoyed the Nuggets of Truth metagame (well not so much the finding secrets as the factual tidbits of history contained in each nugget) that added the historical flavour of the backdrop.\n\nEven the multi-perspective story pacing was an enjoyable play element, which was always wonderfully used to guide the player along the on-rails story, making you rarely (if ever) disappointed with the linear nature of the game, but rather makes you appreciate that this is a story being told.\n\nIf you even have a passing appreciation for the western genre, you owe it to yourself to play this game.  And if you don't, what the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with you?  Make yourself less broken by buying and playing this game.","July 24, 2013","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Simple, real fun like in oldschool Doom or Duke Nukem you just go and kill a lot. Sure enemies are dumb... but that IS THE POINT, 'cause you want to relax and kill them all :-) Sure, they hide but that's why you can kill with piercing shot or ricocheted bullet or you can use that time to reload weapon.\n\nThere is experience, levels and skills too... so you can kill more enemies, in less time, even easier.\n\nYou don't get lost in a game, don't have to solve puzzle or some riddles. But after long difficult day you don't want to stuck somewhere and think... you want just to kill them all, go ahead and kill more morons on the way...\n\nHowever I have to complain about few things in the game: for example I've encountered some friendly NPCs that I was unable to kill. So be prepared for such disappointment. I also have serious problem to enjoy duels: you have to patiently aim for few seconds and wait... just wait... and then you maybe kill one guy. Seriously. During the game you mostly kill 5-10 guys in the time period you waste on dueling. It would also be more fun to carry all weapons, you have to choose between rifle and shotgun, while you dont want to do such stupid decisions! You want to have all the firepower.\n\nOh, and I miss the rocket jump. I did try TNT jump, althougt as for now only with very little success.\n\n\n","April 13","true","34.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morganov/recommended/204450/","morganov","Plissken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morganov/","361 products in account","At first glance fiction of the old west, particularly the game fiction, could strike you as rather stale. The dog eyed tropes of showdowns on Main Street at high noon and dynamite laced fire fights through the old mines seem to perpetually resurrect themselves like the uninspiring zombies of a genre long past its relevance. However like the zombie genre, there can always be room for reinvention.\n\nThe Call of Juarez franchise noticed this a while back when its western setting began to wear thin and has been in a constant cycle of reinvention ever since - Most notable being ‘The Cartel’s admirable but failed attempt to translate the genre into a gritty modern context.\n\nIn this sense Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is initially somewhat of an enigma. Without switching up its genre trappings in any obvious way, it still somehow manages to feel like a breadth of fresh air. Moreover, we see that rather than dancing around the clichés, Gunslinger has actually dug in and entrenched itself in the pulpy fiction of the old west. It gets away with this by cleverly framing its story arc around the rather dubious recounting of past glories by shady outlaw figure Silas Greaves – That is to say the game doesn’t tell his story – it tells the story of his story! This sleight of hand rather brilliantly comes to define the whole tone of the piece freeing up the plot and gunplay to really revel in a special brand of heightened reality.\n\nMost immediately noticeable is the games beautifully measured visceral feedback. The guns are weighty, the shots are loud and the impacts produce a glorious crimson spray. This is a game that really wants you to enjoy the connection of a well aimed shot, going so far as to slow-mo the dispatched enemies bodies (300-style) as they flail gracefully into the ground.\n\nVisceral reality extends into the environment as Silas recalls traversing a diverse array of locals, made unexpectedly exotic within the confines of this North-American genre. The recounted narrative then builds on this diversity by lending a unique brand of playfulness to the level design: Details of the story can be brought into question, and in response the narrator often bends or twists the nature of the playable reality without warning. As Silas haphazardly revises the flow of his story new paths can materialise, various characters can be swapped out and entire sections of the level design can be replayed along an altered narrative. This surreal manipulation married with the superb visual design creates a crisp, graphic and slightly oversaturated world that ends up feeling genuinely unique.\n\nThe rich landscape is not for idle rambling though as the campaign bolts from the starting line and then continues to ride at break-neck pace through the remainder its ripping yarn. Even the plot, quick-fired at you through in game narration and sideshow cutscenes serves more to set the roguish tone rather than attempt to construct any kind of complex narrative progression. In this and many other ways Gunslinger proves to be a master class on the good application of brevity. Slogging and grinding are most certainly off the menu for this insulin shot of action gunplay - Most should finish satisfied but with a healthy hunger for more!\n\nAnd that’s the joy of Gunslinger - everything about its design has been streamlined to suck you into the zone of it pulpy hyper-realised action core. It’s a game that can genuinely brand itself as gun-running-fun and it has done this by releasing itself of many of the overreaching expectations other games in its category of man-shoot live or die by. Expectations perhaps generated by the traditional triple-A price point that Gunslinger has deliberately dived below.\n\nWhile the fiction of the old West has long since developed into well trodden territory, its popularity can always be traced back to the youthful pleasures of heroic conflict by way of cowboys and Indians. Simple stuff really – morally unburdened heroes in a savage unpredictable frontier free to carve a path of righteous violence through an ensemble of joyfully hateful villains.  In returning to these roots Gunslinger has excelled in giving us an unapologetic slice of gunpowder-fuelled catharsis, once again making the old west feel new. YE-HA!\n\nIf you liked that piece check out my game review site:\nTonnochi Road [tonnochi.blogspot.co.uk]\nThanks for reading.

The visuals, especially the characters and their introductions, are done very well, and this is complemented by the audio and the cut scenes. The depictions of dead enemies are also done masterfully, with both the ragdoll physics and the theatrical sprays of blood complementing the rest of the game, especially the beautiful background setting - whether it be an Wild West town, a train, a gold mine, swamps, or the mountains - the scenery can be breathtaking.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics themselves are also quite solid; and this game is very unique in how the Old West quick-draw stand-offs are depicted - tricky to master, but great fun. With several things you need to take note of; including focus and speed, and maybe even the ability to dodge, duels are a fun, if potentially frustrating addition to the game. This is complemented by the ability to slow down time and dodge bullets, in the style of Neo - it always brought a smile to my face when I dodged a bullet and heard an enemy say "Did he just dodge a bullet?!" The skills also work quite well, with 3 short skill trees, each leading to the ability to unlock two unique weapons, superior to the default weapons, while giving other bonuses such as to reload speed, etc.\n\nBut by far my favourite part of the game is the story. While it is not incredibly long, the way the story is told is unique and I found it utterly compelling. This is because the story is not happening as the game is played, the story is narrated by your own character, Silas Greaves, telling some young 'uns many years after the events occurred in a saloon while downing shots of whiskey. As such, hearing the conversation going on as you play, as well as situations in which the game rewinds as... "this isn't how the story goes, what actually happened was THIS..." Not too long, but long enough to be enjoyable.","July 16, 2014","true","17.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFlyingDill/recommended/204450/","TheFlyingDill","Dille","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFlyingDill/","667 products in account","This is one of those games that from the outside seam like nothing special, just another fps, but once you begin to play it turns out to be one of the most fun things ever.\n\nCall of Juarez Gunslinger is a short 'All killer, no filler' arcade fps game. You are Silas Greaves - one of the fastest gunslingers in the wild west. A man who has spent most of his life in bullet-time.\nThis game has a unique way of telling it's story. Game starts in a saloon where Silas ends up telling his life story to a bunch of people. As he speaks you get to play through his life's events that he is narrating. Every now and again one of his listeners will interrupt Silas and tell his own version of the same story he has heard it somewhere. And that will effect the game word. The level will shift or time will rewind and the scene will play out in an entirely different manner.\nAlso thanks to this manner of story telling there is almost no downtime. You are always in action and the story is narrated while you are lining up headshots.\n\nVisually this game is also neat. It may not be the most graphically advanced game around, but what it lacks in graphics it makes up with good art design. The colors are bright and sharp. Environments are beautifully designed and quite varied.\nWhen it comes to visuals the only three sins this game commits are:\nLack of fov slider. The default fov is not terrible, but it's definitely not 90.\nNo anti-aliasing.\nAnd there's a weird black border around the screen at all times.\nLuckily all three of these issues can be fixed by the player. Fov and that border can be modified in a .ini file. And AA can be forced through you gpu's control panel.\n\nAnd while the story mode is good and definitely worth a playthrough, where the game really shines is it's arcade mode. Arcade basically is an score attack/speedrun mode where you compete with your friends for the highest score. You get to play through more linear version of story modes levels where the objective is to kill everyone as fast as possible meanwhile maintaining a as high as possible combo.\n\nAll in all this is a short (~5h for the story mode and ~13h for a complete run) and super fun fps. If you are in a mood where you just want to shoot some people and feel super bad-♥♥♥ while doing it you can't go wrong with Call of Juarez Gunslinger.","August 23, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

The story itself isn't anything amazing, I dare say it may even be rather forgettable after a few days, but overall the fun wild west shootouts and satisfying/solid feel when hitting a target made it definately worthy of a recommendation. The game didn't manage to inspire any emotions relating to the story the protaganist is telling despite there being the availability for it (I don't want to give any spoilers so the details here will just stay this vague), but it wasn't boring or badly voice acted/written either. I think the developers put their time into the combat mechanics of the game as a priority and that side of the game was more than enough to pull the average storyline through to the end.\n\nThe gameplay was solid, well voice acted and the cutscenes were short and sweet, nothing too long that made me bored.\n\nThe variety of weapons basically boiled down to 3, a rifle, a pistol or a shotgun, and I felt like each of the weapons felt satisfying to use, though dual wield pistols felt abit clunky at times, I stuck with the single pistol if I had to use it, otherwise I used the rifle with a sawn off shotgun as a secondary weapon which worked nicely and proved to be fun.\n\nI'm a veteran of fps games having played them for many many years, and yet the game still provided a challenge that I found highly enjoyable, and there's multiple difficulty settings to spice things up if you want another playthrough.\n\nReplayability - It was good but now that I know the story it's not something I can realistic imagine playing through again. It was an enjoyable 1 time experience but there's nothing pulling me back in to try it again since it would just be more of the same, maybe just on the hardest difficulty mode.\n\nChoices - There was only 1 choice that the player was asked to make and it was in regards to whether the main bad guy gets to live or die, I chose live and it was a peaceful end to the game. Don't expect to have any impact on any part of the 'world' like in other RPG's and it's not that kind of game, it's not a persistent world and quests/missions are given directly to you without needed to be collected. It's basically an old-school storyline shooter like the old Medal of Honor series.\n\nAll in all i'd say it'd be a shame if you missed out playing through this game, but i'd recommend grabbing it while it's on sale or on offer as a bundle (I got it from bundlestars) as based on the short amount of time it took to complete and the linear enviroments that leave the player with little to no decision making required, it's not really worth more than 5 euros in my opinion, but for that price it's a great game.\n\nOverall rating - 6.5/10: It didn't wow me and the story was forgettable, but the combat was fun and the enviroments were pretty.","February 20","true","4.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

It's definitely one of the better games I've played within the genre, as not only there is some replay value thanks to its smooth and easy to grasp controls, but the whole product is presented and delivered extremely well. The campaign has taken me about 12 hours to complete, though I restarted about 1/4 into my first playthrough to select a different combat build. I'll present a list of features ranging from great to lacking so that you have more information to work with.\n\n\n+ (Great)\n. Gameplay is quite addictive, a combination of smooth mechanics and enticing visuals. It's quite satisfying to shoot the numerous bad guys eager to take your life.\n\n. Concentration: Killing enemies fills up your concentration bar, which you may deplete to enter concentration mode. This mode turns the world into black and white slow-motion and highlights enemies in red, making you feel like the fastest gun in the west!\n\n. Duels are a good addition too. During the staredown, you control different features, such as your hand position (which affects your draw speed) and your focus on the target (the higher it is, the easier it is land a well-aimed shot).\n\n. Fantastic atmosphere - This is probably one of the best things the game has to offer: You are bounty hunter Silas Greaves, who shares tales of his past with several patrons at a bar. As the player, you control Silas throughout these stories, with him simultaneously narrating important, funny, and interesting moments. You will often hear the patrons' comments as well, many times in disbelief at Silas' feats of prowess or at the fact that he keeps running into famous outlaws. Moreover, the levels may abruptly change on certain occasions depending on how the story is being told. For instance: indians suddenly appearing out of context to kill Silas, which was actually a trick in storytelling to see if one of the listeners was paying attention. That part was hilarious! ; Or having to stop a bank robbery in different ways because everyone kept telling the story wrong.\n\n. Levelling system: You may spend 1 skill point every time you level in three different skill trees, which mainly grant you bonuses with the several weapons in the game, namely revolvers (dual, if you wish), rifles, shotguns, and dinamite.\n\n. The collectibles in this game are known as Nuggets of Truth and are actually worth your effort if you are interested in Old West history. Each Nugget provides factual information and a picture about a real person/event/location, relevant to the plot at that particular point. I found them quite interesting and rewarding to uncover, which is something many collectibles do not offer these days. Besides, they also grant experience, which means more skill points!\n\n. Moving train level. That is all for this entry. ^^\n\n. Epic soundtrack. Very fitting themes that truly put you in the right mood. Want to hear for yourself? By all means, pardner! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAyVs4WapDw&list=PLRHJd0VBxwV98RiguAUMdcFgPWK1qyXTa\n\n\n+/- (Average)\n. Linear levels: The maps in this game are pretty straightforward, with the occasional different approach to different situations, which is pretty much going to your goal by taking a slightly different path. It's not completely a bad thing, however, since it provides steady ground to keep on shooting bandidos with few distractions!\n\n. Robocop AI. You can usually sneak up to the first group of the entire section and kill them off without trouble. Following that, it seems that everyone has an automatic target-lock on your position. If you're taking cover behind a barricade and try to go around a house to flank your opponents, it seems that they always know where you are and where you will come from. That's my experience, at least. In "Call of Juarez: Gunslinger"'s defence, it is not a sneaking game, and once your enemies open fire it actually becomes easier to track their position, especially by tapping the concentration bar once you hear a gunshot, which will then give you enough time to dodge the bullet(s). *wink*\n\n. No puzzles. There's never any moment where you have to solve a puzzle or riddle in order to progress, not even find a secret key. Everything's pretty straightforward, which from one side of the spectrum means that the action is nonstop, but it may also be argued that the game is a one-trick-pony. (Though a good one!)\n\n. Campaign is fairly short (about 12 hours), but the story is decently wrapped up.\n\n\n\n- (Poor)\n. No horseback riding at all. Now, I was definitely not expecting a detailed riding system in this game, but the lack of it seems like a missed opportunity. When people think about Old West, I would say a vast majority will picture a cowboy riding a horse at some point. A couple of railroad shooting sections on horseback, dodging obstacles by strafing, jumping, and crouching, would be enough to satisfy this need.\n\n. You'll be coming across the same visuals several times, such as re-used interiors and props, which can be monotonous in the long run.\n\n. Melee combat is ridiculous. Press F in close range to one punch someone to the death. Besides, there's no real feel to this action (it looks like your hand just goes through obstacles to complete the motion), but it is easily avoided most of the game, fortunately.\n\n\n---\n\nIn the end, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger definitely takes the gold medal home. I would rate it a solid 8 out of 10.\nPS: I reduced the graphics and resolution to a minimum and the acquired grittiness matched the spirit of the game quite well! It had almost that dime novel cover feel to it. ^^","December 26, 2014","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each time you leveled up, you gain a skill point in which you can use to purchase a skill from the skill tree which either specializes in duel wielding pistols, rifles or shotguns.\n\nThe gameplays are split into 2 parts, the normal FPS which is fast-paced and badass, and the Duel part which tests your reflex.\n\nI don't know what else to say, everything in this game is AWESOME! The gameplay, the story, the music, the sound effects, they are all superb, on the dot and satisfying!\n\nNo multiplayer tho, no problem. Also no open world, no problem!\n\nThe game have 3 game modes, Story, Arcade and Duel. Story is the campaign. Arcade is where you trying to rack your high score by chaining combo kills and Duel is well, duels!\n\nDon't worry, this game is far, FAR better than Call of Juarez The Cartel (let's not mention that game ever again). For it's $15 price tag, I would say that it's worth every cent of my money, heck I think that they deserve more!\n\nFor you FPS enthusiasts, you would most probably love this game!\n\n[HIGHLY RECOMMENDED]","May 27, 2013","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything from the range of weapons to sound design ensure that every bullet you fire feels different and has an impact on the enemies.\n\nFurthermore, the aesthetic fits the game well. It's stylized look douses everything in bright colors, and everything seems to pop out a little more because of it.\n\nThe story is surprsingly intresting, and is told as a sequence of memories. This means that during the middle of a gunfight the narrator may remember something new, drastically changing the playing field.\n\nConsidering that this is a very cheap game for what it is, I'd give this game a look if you were intrested in a good old fashioned shoot em up.","June 15, 2014","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd even be interested in seeing them tell other stories in other settings (modern day, 1950s, future) using this same structure.\n\nThis was a complete blast and from a developer and franchise I didn't expect it from.

It's definitely one of the better games I've played within the genre, as not only there is some replay value thanks to its smooth and easy to grasp controls, but the whole product is presented and delivered extremely well. The campaign has taken me about 12 hours to complete, though I restarted about 1/4 into my first playthrough to select a different combat build. I'll present a list of features ranging from great to lacking so that you have more information to work with.\n\n\n+ (Great)\n. Gameplay is quite addictive, a combination of smooth mechanics and enticing visuals. It's quite satisfying to shoot the numerous bad guys eager to take your life.\n\n. Concentration: Killing enemies fills up your concentration bar, which you may deplete to enter concentration mode. This mode turns the world into black and white slow-motion and highlights enemies in red, making you feel like the fastest gun in the west!\n\n. Duels are a good addition too. During the staredown, you control different features, such as your hand position (which affects your draw speed) and your focus on the target (the higher it is, the easier it is land a well-aimed shot).\n\n. Fantastic atmosphere - This is probably one of the best things the game has to offer: You are bounty hunter Silas Greaves, who shares tales of his past with several patrons at a bar. As the player, you control Silas throughout these stories, with him simultaneously narrating important, funny, and interesting moments. You will often hear the patrons' comments as well, many times in disbelief at Silas' feats of prowess or at the fact that he keeps running into famous outlaws. Moreover, the levels may abruptly change on certain occasions depending on how the story is being told. For instance: indians suddenly appearing out of context to kill Silas, which was actually a trick in storytelling to see if one of the listeners was paying attention. That part was hilarious! ; Or having to stop a bank robbery in different ways because everyone kept telling the story wrong.\n\n. Levelling system: You may spend 1 skill point every time you level in three different skill trees, which mainly grant you bonuses with the several weapons in the game, namely revolvers (dual, if you wish), rifles, shotguns, and dinamite.\n\n. The collectibles in this game are known as Nuggets of Truth and are actually worth your effort if you are interested in Old West history. Each Nugget provides factual information and a picture about a real person/event/location, relevant to the plot at that particular point. I found them quite interesting and rewarding to uncover, which is something many collectibles do not offer these days. Besides, they also grant experience, which means more skill points!\n\n. Moving train level. That is all for this entry. ^^\n\n. Epic soundtrack. Very fitting themes that truly put you in the right mood. Want to hear for yourself? By all means, pardner! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAyVs4WapDw&list=PLRHJd0VBxwV98RiguAUMdcFgPWK1qyXTa\n\n\n+/- (Average)\n. Linear levels: The maps in this game are pretty straightforward, with the occasional different approach to different situations, which is pretty much going to your goal by taking a slightly different path. It's not completely a bad thing, however, since it provides steady ground to keep on shooting bandidos with few distractions!\n\n. Robocop AI. You can usually sneak up to the first group of the entire section and kill them off without trouble. Following that, it seems that everyone has an automatic target-lock on your position. If you're taking cover behind a barricade and try to go around a house to flank your opponents, it seems that they always know where you are and where you will come from. That's my experience, at least. In "Call of Juarez: Gunslinger"'s defence, it is not a sneaking game, and once your enemies open fire it actually becomes easier to track their position, especially by tapping the concentration bar once you hear a gunshot, which will then give you enough time to dodge the bullet(s). *wink*\n\n. No puzzles. There's never any moment where you have to solve a puzzle or riddle in order to progress, not even find a secret key. Everything's pretty straightforward, which from one side of the spectrum means that the action is nonstop, but it may also be argued that the game is a one-trick-pony. (Though a good one!)\n\n. Campaign is fairly short (about 12 hours), but the story is decently wrapped up.\n\n\n\n- (Poor)\n. No horseback riding at all. Now, I was definitely not expecting a detailed riding system in this game, but the lack of it seems like a missed opportunity. When people think about Old West, I would say a vast majority will picture a cowboy riding a horse at some point. A couple of railroad shooting sections on horseback, dodging obstacles by strafing, jumping, and crouching, would be enough to satisfy this need.\n\n. You'll be coming across the same visuals several times, such as re-used interiors and props, which can be monotonous in the long run.\n\n. Melee combat is ridiculous. Press F in close range to one punch someone to the death. Besides, there's no real feel to this action (it looks like your hand just goes through obstacles to complete the motion), but it is easily avoided most of the game, fortunately.\n\n\n---\n\nIn the end, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger definitely takes the gold medal home. I would rate it a solid 8 out of 10.\nPS: I reduced the graphics and resolution to a minimum and the acquired grittiness matched the spirit of the game quite well! It had almost that dime novel cover feel to it. ^^","December 26, 2014","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's got a good dose of humour although I don't think it should have been tagged it as 'comedy'.\n- The mechanic of the story telling is fun and original.\n- The duel mechanic is simply brilliant. It's simple, yet, not easy. And you really feel like you've won the duel when you finally do.\n- The skilling system works really well and is balanced.

However, i am pleased to say that this game is such as refreshing face to the FPS genre, and the best part is that this game despite being published by Ubisoft DOESN'T REQUIRE UPLAY!\n\nYou play as a man called Silas Greaves, who tells you and a few others at the bar about his past adventures. It's all narrated throughout the course of the gameplay! I absolutely like that about this game as well. During the gameplay sometimes he changes things up a little bit which either rewind you back to a certain point in the level where he recalls that it played out differently or just half-a**ed a secret pathway or entrance somewhere nearby that really wasn't there before.\n\nEither way the gunplay is amazing! The guns feel as though they really have that "kick" to them as you blast bullets into the skulls of you're enemies. You also gain bonus/skill points for killing in unique ways (kind of like Bulletstorm, but not that hyper-extreme). Everything else such as the leveling system, the perk system and upgrade system are very rewarding and will most definitely help you and make you a force to be rekoned with!\n\nI haven't played this game for longer than 2 hours and yet it's already getting my review.

Madly I love the wild West and ability to snatch out the revolver quicker than the others, quite so and survived at that time.\nWell what western without train robbery? Missions by trains were pleasant. The main problem here — not to shoot back enemies, and to keep on narrow bridges.\nDuels:\nCowboy's duels became more difficult, but it is more interesting. By means of the keyboard we hold a hand at a holster to snatch out the weapon quicker than the enemy, and a mouse we catch the opponent "in focus" more precisely to aim.\n\nHistory:\nTo tell that Silas slightly invents — means, thoroughly to violate the truth. The grandfather fills in so that the baron Myunkhgauzen validly would remove a cocked hat. And supports its lies game process. As in Bastion, only on the contrary — there the offscreen voice commented on each our action, and here we do of what the story-teller brags. "And here they surrounded me! Person twenty, not less! Crept imperceptibly — favourite tactics of Apaches!" — Grivz broadcasts, and on the screen literally from air some tens Indians materialize and start watering us with heavy fire. "Wait a moment, the grandfather! What, to hell, Apaches? You tracked down a gang of Cowboys?" — the attentive listener while we feverishly rush about on the gorge is interested, trying to find though some shelter from the bullets whistling in air. "And I also didn't say that it were Apaches — the story-teller instantly "dodges" — I told that Cowboys flew on me just like Apaches!" — and Indians are dissolved in air, and their place is taken by bandits in red scarfs.\n\nPluses: the gold revolver the Ranger, a heap of sendings to reality, movies, books, a photo of bandits of the West, firing from a gatling.\n\nMy assessment of 8.0 points.","December 18, 2014","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has more style and execution than you'd ever expect from a $15 Techland title. It's difficult for me to imagine what type of person this game wouldn't appeal to.\n\nThe gameplay is tight and fast moving, the art is extremely stylised, the writing is intentionally silly, but also very well done. The mechanic of playing along as someone tells the tales of his life, embellishments and all, along with revisions opens the way for this game to do some really intriguing set pieces. There are kernels of ideas in this game you'd never expect from a small title.\n\nIf you like westerns, pretty much every famous outlaw and cowboy are present at some point in this game. It's the Assassin's Creed of late 1800s America in that way. Silas is somehow involved in the entirety of the wild west. I loved this game.

It takes liberties with history, of course, but it's still a great western story.    The skill system is a great way to get a little more out of the play as various kill types yield different XP amounts, rewarding head shots and range the most.  You can then specialize toward your preferred style and go from there.\n\nThere are three main modes.  The Story itself, which is pretty interesting if you can set aside reality for a bit.   A little suspension of disbelief is needed for any game, though.   The next mode is Arcade, where you play through aiming for points and trying to hit high scores.  And the final is duels, where you run a gauntlet of quick draw duels.   Each mode is fun and worth a play through.","December 1, 2013","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And if you aren't feeling enough satisfaction running and gunning them down, you can always go into gunfighter mode and have a showdown in the middle of the street, real gunfighter style.

Like a movie of Quentin Tarantino's as a game.\n\nThe game begins as the main character enters a saloon and sits down with a few people to tell them a story about his adventures, as the game itself is the story being told. The main character keeps narrating the story throughout the game, and the people sitting with him talk as well, so in a way you are following two stories at the same time. What makes it really interesting, is that the interraction between the story-teller and the listeners sometimes affect your surroundings and the events in the game, keeping it interesting and full of surprises. So story-wise, the game is excellent.\n\nThe visual style of the game is very stylish, comic-like and gritty. There's a lot of blood, just like you'd expect. The music, the sound effects and the voice acting are all excellent and complement that certain wild west feel.\n\nThe controls are smooth and responsive, and shooting enemies is satisfying. There are three weapon classes for you to select depending on your preferred playstyle. The game has some well implemented quicktime events.\n\nI completed the game on Hard difficulty setting, and I think it was sometimes hard to follow the narrative in a tight spot as you try to survive, but I don't think it should be passed as a critique. There were also a couple of moments that, in my opinion, required more trial and error than good reflexes and timing. I encountered a few minor bugs in the game, but nothing that would affect the gameplay experience. The game is a bit short, but one hell of a ride.\n\nIf you get it for about 10 euros (or dollars) or even less, it's definitely worth it.\n\nAs a bonus note: It's almost like playing a modern version of Sunset Riders.","April 6, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I beat the game in 4.5 hours.","March 19, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's very solid (nothing too innovative and crazy), and you can easily pick it up and put it down again (not as in getting bored).\nYou'll feel like a badass, but still be vulnerable enough to play strategically and actually feel a little like your life is on the line (atleast on hard). It has a minimalistic skill tree, which makes it easy to go through the game again with a different path.\nThe music is GREAT if you prefer that the pieces are interesting enough to stand for their own.\nThe art-style seems to me like a colorful sharper version of Borderlands', which makes it quite fantastic.","November 18, 2013","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play through these adventures while Suarez narrates in the background, often while having arguements with the people around him. The funny thing is that that the memory of Suarez isn't as good as it used to be, so the mistakes he makes while telling the story affect the gameplay while you are in it.\n\nFor instance, one time he was fighting a gang of criminals called "the cowboys", but when he says "Suddenly the apaches were all around me, and they started attacking me from their higher ground", one of his fans will say "Apaches? Weren't you fighting the Cowboys?", to what Suarez responds: "Did I say Apaches? Oh, I meant to say the Cowboys were attacking me like apaches!" and all of sudden the apaches around you turn into even more aggressive cowboys.\n\nThe story itself ends with a satisfying finale, and all cutscenes are handdrawn single frames to thicken out the western atmosphere.\n\nPros:\n\n-Awesome gameplay, you use western-typical weaponary to defeat hundreds of evil foes that are in your path\n\n-Concentration mode brings Max Payne-elements into an ego shooter\n\n-Cool story with funny humour\n\n-Skill System, you earn XP by killing enemies and chaining combos.\n\n-Rare connection with story and gameplay\n\n-You can collect "nuggets", which are bits of information about the real wild west\n\n-You meet tons of important characters of that time, Billy the Kid, Pat Garret, etc\n\n-Graphics create a good wild west atmosphere\n\n-Voice acting is very good, only english though\n\n-Arcade mode can entertain for a long time, has one duel-mode and a shoot em up-mode\n\n-Very good boss-battles, some of them can actually be surprisingly hard\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Could have used more weapons, there are only 8 different weapons in the game, and that's only if you count dynamite and the sawn off rifle that you'll rarely ever use.\n\n-Shotguns are pretty much useless, since they can only fire 2 shots before reloading, and most of your enemies will be at middle to far distances\n\n-Main story is finished after a max of 5 hours, (note that the game is only 15 bugs which makes up for that)\n\n-The dueling minigame sometimes is just not working like it should\n\n-You'll quickly have seen all types of enemies (Revolver-bad guy, Rife-bad guy, bigger Shotgun-Bad guy and Door-bad Guy)\n\n-The shoot em up of the arcade mode should have let you use all of your skills, or atleast given you the oppurtinity to learn all of your skills.\n\n-An endless mode should have been added since all shot em up-missions are done in under a few minutes","July 24, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its FPS which i really like, because i know a lot of western games what are Third person. There isnt a lot just "foolin'" around in the game :D You have a lot of action and shooting going on, which is important in a western game. The missions are fun and you can collect several things in them. There are 3 different gamemods also, which i have only played story mode. They have also added a cool feature where you can press "Q" and the game goes in slow mode and shows red. There is a cool leveling system. You can earn exp by killing enemys and completing missions. If you level up you can choose a new skill.\n\nI recommend this game if you like FPS/Western/Cowboy games.

Its kind of cheesy at times, and while the voice acting is good its certainly not excellent.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty fun if you enjoy a simple, straight-forward single player experience.

The levels for the most part are very vibrant and colorful. Gunplay feels great as well. It's hard to explain but the combination of the looks of the guns, the sound effects, the powers you can unlock and just overall weapon handling make this game so much fun to play though. The game also has a really fun story with pretty cool story telling techniques which I won't spoil here.\n\nOne thing that you should keep in mind is that it's pretty short. I played through it on Hard mode in about 4.5 hours. While there are some collectibles and new modes to unlock after you're done, it would have been neat if the base game offered more levels. However since the game is already pretty cheap and goes on sale rather often, it's not a huge deal.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun singleplayer shooter (of which there haven't been a lot recently if you ask me) then give this game a shot. If you're the type of guy that likes to get everything done in a game (as in getting all achievements and collectibles ect.) then there's no harm in getting it at full price.

The story is based upon the baddies of the Wild West and you're going to take everybody down in order to avenge your brother, so obviously you're going to be the biggest badass of all time.\n\nNow there aren't a ton of guns to play around with considering the time period, but this might have just contributed to the slick gunplay. The guns fire in tremendous fashion and reloading can be quick and fluid and not break the action.\n\nPut this gunplay with the satisfying arcade-style system of scoring, pair that with skills that you can unlock and a meter that allows you to slow down time, and you have an incredible experience.\n\nThere are some games where I only really like the feel of one of the guns. This game, I like the feel of all the guns.\n\nIt's called Gunslinger for a reason, folks.","December 15, 2013","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play an old bounty hunter telling his tales of his past the western frontier to the patrons in a saloon and I won't go any further as the game is filled with many twists, turns and surprises throughout. The good is that the story is very good with excellent voice acting, nice gunplay and beautiful cel shaded graphics. While some of the environments do repeat themselves  (mostly due to how the narrator is telling the story) you'll still do battle in valleys, forests, gold mines, swamps and of course a train. One of the unique points of this game is the duelling and it definitely takes some practice but you'll get better as you go which adds satisfaction to when you win. It took me about eight hours to compete but I was scouring the levels for the unlockables, which give you some real life history of some of the characters you come across. If you enjoy the old west, this is definitely the game for you. The MSRP is $14.99 which is quite fair but if you can get it for 66%-75% off well that's just a (train) robbery. 9/10 from me.","June 8, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But Gunslinger tweaks the genre just enough with a small mechanic that could have become an annoying gimmick if used irresponsibly.  Driver: San Francisco did the same thing for me with driving games (which I also usually hate) by integrating its weird mind shift mechanic into the gameplay and story.  In this case, Gunslinger rolls with an incredibly unreliable narrator, which isn't too unfamiliar on its own... but the game goes even further by changing the world to fit the narration.  In some ways, Gunslinger reminded me of Bastion (another of my favorite small games), but in Bastion the narrator reacts to the changing world, while in Gunslinger, the world reacts to the changing narration.  I guess it doesn't hurt that I'm a huge fan of spaghetti Western drama, but I found the actual shooting mechanics and skill trees quite good in their own right.","January 19, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even better, though, is how the game tells its tale as a series of remembered half-truths. Hyperbole, corrections, misdirections, and other storytelling tricks are weaved through the gameplay in a way that, while not maybe groundbreaking, certainly keeps the action from getting overly predictable or repetitive.

Where most of them "shooters" nowadays go all serious and business-like, arguing fancy tactics and whatnot, Gunslinger is like jumping off a stagecoach, off-loading lead from your trusted six-shooter while pouring down your favourite Whiskey refreshment.\n\nThe game plays as a fast-paced, action-packed shooter, with a story and presentation style that capture the exciting atmosphere and feel of the "Wild West", with all the tropes from your favourite Westerns. If you like shooters or have even a remote interest in the Wild West, I challenge you to try the demo and not be hooked. You get a taste of the full game, the rest is pretty faithful to that demo.\n\nThe gunplay is really great, and the gameplay mechanics with "concentration" (kind of a bullet time) and "sense of death" (last chance to dodge that bullet that was about to kill you) are really satisfying and fun. Plus, it features different tropey locales and situations, like prision escape, bank heists, mines, indian caves, train robberies, ghost towns, etc etc. The graphics engine is really good, providing nice detail and beautiful sceneries, and is as fast as the action itself, with ultra high fps even in the highest quality settings.\n\nHell, boy, I ain't had this much fun shooting since Lord knows when.

Gunslinger offers three modes; story mode and arcade mode and duel mode. Duel mode is mostly forgettable with a minigame style showdown.\n\nIt is the arcade mode and story mode that is the standout of the game. For me, Arcade mode alone makes this game worth it. The game is semi-fast paced point-based first person shooter. In arcade mode, shooting enemies yields points. Shooting enemies in the head, yields more points. Shooting enemies in succession yields multipliers, which yields even more points. Points galore! Yes, the arcade mode is about getting the highest score possible and this really makes the game competitive especially for those perfectionists and competitive gamers.\n\nThe story mode is an added benefit. The story itself is surprisingly good, offering a unique storytelling style. Without spoiling it, it will definitely keep you entertained and even a few chuckles along the way.\n\nIf I had a minor complaint, it would be that the arcade mode stages are all based on the stages from the Story mode. It would've been nice to have a larger variety of stages not already seen from the story mode. But this is a minor complaint, and doesn't detract from the fact that this game is such a solid shooter.\n\nThe game's gimmick is also a bullet time style power that slows everyone down. Nothing innovative in this aspect, but the gunplay makes this game highly satisfying to play. For the low price point, you will certainly get your money's worth for it.","February 10, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gunslinger not only offers great visuals, voice acting, music and an interesting story, it does it all while being priced at $15.00USD. The game is fairly simple and straightforward but, adds enough in to make it interesting such as a slow-mo mode, three separate skill trees and a great duel system. While the story is rather short, lasting only about 4-5 hours, it has enough extras and content here to make the story alone worth the asking price and, at the end of the day the only reason not too is if you’re really not into first-person shooters or you’re that sick of them.\n\n-Double Thumbs Up from Royial\n\nVideo Reviews at youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork","March 29, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It uses a frame story of a few men (and a lady) in a saloon, telling a story of one of the men's life in highlights.\n\nIf you're a big fan of the FPS genre and even like scores in games this should be on your to-buy list.

The voice acting and narrative techniques used are pretty good for a video game, the gameplay is fairly simple and easy to get into, and the art and sound direction are quite strong. It actually features a really interesting use of the unreliable narrator, which I haven't seen before to this extent in video games. The gameplay itself is twitch-based, but there are a lot of character abilities you can use to supplement your skills if you find you're having a hard time dealing with the enemies (generally by slowing down time, or providing a kind of auto-target).\n\nAs for what my complaints would be... I don't really have any. It's exactly what I expected it to be: a fun, good-looking shooter with a short, simple, well-told story. I didn't encounter any bugs, crashes, bad level design, or anything of the sort. While it does depict a world of macho mostly-white men, there's no blatant racism or sexism of the kind you'd find in other games if the genre (including, apparently, the other Call of Juarez games), and the narrator has moments of simple empathy with people from other cultures or other walks of life in a way that feels humanizing.\n\nGunslinger is an enjoyable, fun way to whittle away a few hours (it really doesn't take long to finish the game, which is great for people with lives). It's not amazing by any means, but not every game has to be. As a bonus, it's one of the few Ubisoft games I've purchased that doesn't force Uplay on you.","September 14, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanic of playing along as someone tells the tales of his life, embellishments and all, along with revisions opens the way for this game to do some really intriguing set pieces. There are kernels of ideas in this game you'd never expect from a small title.\n\nIf you like westerns, pretty much every famous outlaw and cowboy are present at some point in this game.

The skill system is a great way to get a little more out of the play as various kill types yield different XP amounts, rewarding head shots and range the most.  You can then specialize toward your preferred style and go from there.\n\nThere are three main modes.  The Story itself, which is pretty interesting if you can set aside reality for a bit.   A little suspension of disbelief is needed for any game, though.   The next mode is Arcade, where you play through aiming for points and trying to hit high scores.

Hell, there's even a whole separate endurance mode catered to it. It's an excellent concentration exercise.\n\nEqually as creative is how the great narration can alter the game in a quick pinch, even during mid-combat.\n\nCharacter B: "You sayin' they were Indians?"\n\nNarrator: "No. I said they attacked me Indian /style/."\n\nAnd, with that, models are switched and your back in the game. I'll tell ya. The Old West vibe was so thick here I found myself chewing on my mouse cord like a piece of straw.\n\nAs the game draws to a close, it does tend to rely on those "breach n' clear" events (The Not So Great Train Robbery was easily the least exciting mission) and an overall scripted nature (which is normally used in moderation, thus making it enjoyable and not played out for this particular game), and the "throw dynamite from cover until he's dead" boss fights are rather dull, but it's an overall incredibly solid shooter with an infectious (albeit predictable) story and narration.","January 3, 2014","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/helloramon/recommended/204450/","helloramon","LVLUP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/helloramon/","38 products in account","This game is a very well executed western-FPS!\n\nThe story is well put together, putting you in history with the West' most notorious cowboys and gunfighters, as you play Silas Greaves. The graphics are exceptional, more than enough to give you the feel of how it would be to be a bounty hunter in the west.\n\nFor the price (even at full, although I paid 50% off during a sale), there is very much to do in the game. 3 difficulties (unlocking the other 2 after you've finished easy mode) for story mode, artifacts or "nuggets" hidden throughout each location, arcade mode for those looking to just shoot em' up and rack up points in comparison with others, a well thoughtout dueling system which will have you on the edge of anticipation and anxiety, as well as a dueling leaderboard to compare with friends and others in the community.\n\nHaving finished the easy mode, true west mode has been an amazing experience. A minimal HUD mode which really takes out the "game" feel and puts you in a more barbaric fight-or-flight mode. It's pretty hard and I've been enjoying the progression in this difficulty the mode.\n\nAs far as weapons, there are three basic choices. More are unlocked as you progress through the game. Although few, each gun does feel different from one another, and your choice of weapon will effect your efficiency in progressing through the levels.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a single-player story, western-based FPS. I really enjoyed the story, it helps you relive the tales of one Silas Greaves, and the game hardly ever feels like a grind. I've been waiting for a game like this for a long time, I'll probably be waiting a long time before such a game is made again.\n\nOnly thing that it could improve on is adding a multiplayer dueling system, or perhaps a gang vs. gang, sherriffs vs. cowboys mode. Ohter than that, it's great!\n\n9.1/10","January 6, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has more style and execution than you'd ever expect from a $15 Techland title. It's difficult for me to imagine what type of person this game wouldn't appeal to.\n\nThe gameplay is tight and fast moving, the art is extremely stylised, the writing is intentionally silly, but also very well done. The mechanic of playing along as someone tells the tales of his life, embellishments and all, along with revisions opens the way for this game to do some really intriguing set pieces. There are kernels of ideas in this game you'd never expect from a small title.\n\nIf you like westerns, pretty much every famous outlaw and cowboy are present at some point in this game. It's the Assassin's Creed of late 1800s America in that way. Silas is somehow involved in the entirety of the wild west. I loved this game.

It takes liberties with history, of course, but it's still a great western story.    The skill system is a great way to get a little more out of the play as various kill types yield different XP amounts, rewarding head shots and range the most.  You can then specialize toward your preferred style and go from there.\n\nThere are three main modes.  The Story itself, which is pretty interesting if you can set aside reality for a bit.   A little suspension of disbelief is needed for any game, though.   The next mode is Arcade, where you play through aiming for points and trying to hit high scores.  And the final is duels, where you run a gauntlet of quick draw duels.   Each mode is fun and worth a play through.","December 1, 2013","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is well narrated and our hero will meet most of the Wild West famous bandits like Jesse James or the Daltons. Graphics are pretty good and recreate a charming atmosphere. The sounds are excellent and gives you the feeling to have powerful guns in your hands. On the bad side, no multiplayer, the level design is quite linear (not open world) and repetitive, the enemies can act stupidly sometimes and the game is quite short, about 6-8 hours to complete it. However once you have complete the game, it will unlock several game modes, like the Authentic difficulty where you don't have any UI or ammo count on the screen :)\nIf you are looking for a good Wild West shooter, you won't regret buying this game during Sales or Daily offer.","November 30, 2013","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is completely linear but don't let that put you off as it's been crafted perfectly in terms of set-pieces, level design and just the look. Talking of the look, this is a beautiful game. (even with the kinda cell-shaded look around everything) It's highly stylized, colourful, and authentic. The game pulls you into this rich world and doesn't let go, it oozes style and personality.\n\nThe weapons look, sound and most importantly; FEEL fantastic in this game. The gunplay is satisfying as hell. The recoil in each weapon is strong and the kick gives you the visual feedback you need to place your shots on target correctly. As you get more skilled with your weapon of choice you'll get used to the recoil and later on through levelling up you can obtain a higher-performance version of your weapon.\n\nThere is a small variety of guns in the game but don't see that as a negative point. Each gun has a unique purpose and aren't watered down unlike other games where there are about 30 guns and they all roughly feel the same. As the game progresses you'll probably find a few favourite weapons that fit your play style and stick with them though you can mix and match as you please.\n\nSame goes for the skills. You can unlock abilities/skills through levelling up. (which is fast and fun in this game, not a chore) You can put a point into the skill you believe fits your playstyle best in one of the three trees, but you can also put points into the others to make your original skills more effective! Ranging from accuracy to faster combo-chaining.\n\nThis game is arcade-like in terms of being able to earn combos, you're rewarded for trick shots (Headshots, Piercing shots, Long-Range shots etc) and as well as being fun as hell they will bag you a lot of points which will move you higher up the leaderboard if you're into that kinda thing, if not, simply ignore it! Points also go towards filling up your Focus gauge, which allows you to go into slow-mo when in emergencies and will highlight enemies in red. Use it wisely as it runs out fast, though you can turn it on and off anytime you wish.\n\nThe story in this game actually surprised me with its quality. There are a twists and turns along the way, you'll meet some of the most notorious people in the West along the way as allies and enemies. Gunslinger also has a BRILLIANT sense of humour! From the characters relations with each other, to the occasional 4th wall breaking.\n\nThis game it utterly fantastic and although you may complete it within anywhere from I'd say... 7-10 hours. The game has a lot of replay value. Going back to finish off the skills/abilities I missed, messing around with new playstyles, completing the harder difficulties, a completely seperate arcade score-attack mode with its own seperate leaderboards, the dueling challenge and last but not least the collectibles!\n\nWhich are ACTUALLY good in this game, to which I was immensely surprised. Usually a collectible is some useless piece of junk you pick up for the sake of it being hidden. But in Gunslinger the collectibles are a Poker card. Each one has a little slice of history from the West with photos and theories behind some of the more mysterious ones which made me genuinely give a damn about collecting them! Not too hard to find and rewarding for finding them!\n\n\n\n\nThis game is a STEAL for £12!! ($20-25ish?? lol) I would of happily bought if for more! Don't miss out on this! This game has been overlooked by a lot of players but definetely deserves a chance! Get the demo first if you don't feel confident enough, I guarantee you'll fall in love with this game. I recommend this game to everyone!\n\nP.S. - The dueling is badass.

Where most of them "shooters" nowadays go all serious and business-like, arguing fancy tactics and whatnot, Gunslinger is like jumping off a stagecoach, off-loading lead from your trusted six-shooter while pouring down your favourite Whiskey refreshment.\n\nThe game plays as a fast-paced, action-packed shooter, with a story and presentation style that capture the exciting atmosphere and feel of the "Wild West", with all the tropes from your favourite Westerns. If you like shooters or have even a remote interest in the Wild West, I challenge you to try the demo and not be hooked. You get a taste of the full game, the rest is pretty faithful to that demo.\n\nThe gunplay is really great, and the gameplay mechanics with "concentration" (kind of a bullet time) and "sense of death" (last chance to dodge that bullet that was about to kill you) are really satisfying and fun. Plus, it features different tropey locales and situations, like prision escape, bank heists, mines, indian caves, train robberies, ghost towns, etc etc. The graphics engine is really good, providing nice detail and beautiful sceneries, and is as fast as the action itself, with ultra high fps even in the highest quality settings.\n\nHell, boy, I ain't had this much fun shooting since Lord knows when. TRY IT!","March 22, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dockzor/recommended/204450/","dockzor","Dock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dockzor/","441 products in account","What Call of Juarez Gunslinger inspires in me is the competitiveness of the old school arcade shooters. Gunslinger offers three modes; story mode and arcade mode and duel mode. Duel mode is mostly forgettable with a minigame style showdown.\n\nIt is the arcade mode and story mode that is the standout of the game. For me, Arcade mode alone makes this game worth it. The game is semi-fast paced point-based first person shooter. In arcade mode, shooting enemies yields points. Shooting enemies in the head, yields more points. Shooting enemies in succession yields multipliers, which yields even more points. Points galore! Yes, the arcade mode is about getting the highest score possible and this really makes the game competitive especially for those perfectionists and competitive gamers.\n\nThe story mode is an added benefit. The story itself is surprisingly good, offering a unique storytelling style. Without spoiling it, it will definitely keep you entertained and even a few chuckles along the way.\n\nIf I had a minor complaint, it would be that the arcade mode stages are all based on the stages from the Story mode. It would've been nice to have a larger variety of stages not already seen from the story mode. But this is a minor complaint, and doesn't detract from the fact that this game is such a solid shooter.\n\nThe game's gimmick is also a bullet time style power that slows everyone down. Nothing innovative in this aspect, but the gunplay makes this game highly satisfying to play. For the low price point, you will certainly get your money's worth for it.","February 10, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The shooting is very very satisfying - zero complaints there. I really dig the "last minute dodge" mechanic as well, and the stand offs are a neat way to cap off levels. There are so really cool levels here, like the train, and it's all quite gorgeous.\n\nMy only complaint was the last level in the graveyard, which was tedious and ♥♥♥♥.

Like a movie of Quentin Tarantino's as a game.\n\nThe game begins as the main character enters a saloon and sits down with a few people to tell them a story about his adventures, as the game itself is the story being told. The main character keeps narrating the story throughout the game, and the people sitting with him talk as well, so in a way you are following two stories at the same time. What makes it really interesting, is that the interraction between the story-teller and the listeners sometimes affect your surroundings and the events in the game, keeping it interesting and full of surprises. So story-wise, the game is excellent.\n\nThe visual style of the game is very stylish, comic-like and gritty. There's a lot of blood, just like you'd expect. The music, the sound effects and the voice acting are all excellent and complement that certain wild west feel.\n\nThe controls are smooth and responsive, and shooting enemies is satisfying. There are three weapon classes for you to select depending on your preferred playstyle. The game has some well implemented quicktime events.\n\nI completed the game on Hard difficulty setting, and I think it was sometimes hard to follow the narrative in a tight spot as you try to survive, but I don't think it should be passed as a critique. There were also a couple of moments that, in my opinion, required more trial and error than good reflexes and timing. I encountered a few minor bugs in the game, but nothing that would affect the gameplay experience. The game is a bit short, but one hell of a ride.\n\nIf you get it for about 10 euros (or dollars) or even less, it's definitely worth it.\n\nAs a bonus note: It's almost like playing a modern version of Sunset Riders.","April 6, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Starting from the story which is interesting all the way to the art style and the gameplay.\nThe gameplay consists of a lot of shoot outs with a touch of slowing the time down and achieving as many kills as possible for the duration of the slow down in order to achieve high scores. Then at the end of each chapter you'll encounter boss fights. Many of those bosss fights consist of a duel, in which you need to draw your weapon in a blink on an eye and time your moves as well as precisly aligne your mouse. It is a very interesting concept.\nThe game has lots of replay value and include three modes. The Arcade, the Story and the duel modes. Even if the main story is short the adiitonal mmodes are fun to play and try to compete for the highest score in the leaderboards.\nIt is a great arcade game.\n\nGood:\n- Great visual presentation\n- Great variety of modes to play\n- Story and rank up system\n- Big replay value\nBad:\n- The main story line is too short\n- The constant forced pauses between shoot outs in the main story mode can be annoying\n\n85/100\n","March 23, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very linear (what game is NOT these days) but the story is fun, and there are some neat quirks to it. Mainly the narrator/story teller says 'I did it this way...' and you follow that path, only to die and not be able to change that. So then the Story Teller says  something like 'thenI realized how badthat path would be and did it THIS way instead...' So you back up and go the different, but correct way. Kinda a neat change, and lets you play a little more and get a few random kills. And the duels are fun too...\n\nIf you like westerns, this is a good random game to play for the cheap summer sale price.","June 28, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Where most of them "shooters" nowadays go all serious and business-like, arguing fancy tactics and whatnot, Gunslinger is like jumping off a stagecoach, off-loading lead from your trusted six-shooter while pouring down your favourite Whiskey refreshment.\n\nThe game plays as a fast-paced, action-packed shooter, with a story and presentation style that capture the exciting atmosphere and feel of the "Wild West", with all the tropes from your favourite Westerns. If you like shooters or have even a remote interest in the Wild West, I challenge you to try the demo and not be hooked. You get a taste of the full game, the rest is pretty faithful to that demo.\n\nThe gunplay is really great, and the gameplay mechanics with "concentration" (kind of a bullet time) and "sense of death" (last chance to dodge that bullet that was about to kill you) are really satisfying and fun. Plus, it features different tropey locales and situations, like prision escape, bank heists, mines, indian caves, train robberies, ghost towns, etc etc. The graphics engine is really good, providing nice detail and beautiful sceneries, and is as fast as the action itself, with ultra high fps even in the highest quality settings.\n\nHell, boy, I ain't had this much fun shooting since Lord knows when.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dockzor/recommended/204450/","dockzor","Dock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dockzor/","441 products in account","What Call of Juarez Gunslinger inspires in me is the competitiveness of the old school arcade shooters. Gunslinger offers three modes; story mode and arcade mode and duel mode. Duel mode is mostly forgettable with a minigame style showdown.\n\nIt is the arcade mode and story mode that is the standout of the game. For me, Arcade mode alone makes this game worth it. The game is semi-fast paced point-based first person shooter. In arcade mode, shooting enemies yields points. Shooting enemies in the head, yields more points. Shooting enemies in succession yields multipliers, which yields even more points. Points galore! Yes, the arcade mode is about getting the highest score possible and this really makes the game competitive especially for those perfectionists and competitive gamers.\n\nThe story mode is an added benefit. The story itself is surprisingly good, offering a unique storytelling style. Without spoiling it, it will definitely keep you entertained and even a few chuckles along the way.\n\nIf I had a minor complaint, it would be that the arcade mode stages are all based on the stages from the Story mode. It would've been nice to have a larger variety of stages not already seen from the story mode. But this is a minor complaint, and doesn't detract from the fact that this game is such a solid shooter.\n\nThe game's gimmick is also a bullet time style power that slows everyone down. Nothing innovative in this aspect, but the gunplay makes this game highly satisfying to play. For the low price point, you will certainly get your money's worth for it.","February 10, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game isn't a rail shooter, but it has that arcade shooter feel, in a way. You're free to move around the scene of mayhem as you wish, while all kinds of bandits are shooting at you. Other than that, it's rather linear, but the story is accompanied with your character relating about what's happening in past tense, telling some folk about his deeds.\n\nThe visuals and music is great and give you just the right feeling. In ways the game reminds me of what I liked about the Borderlands games, but without the experience grind and useless loot, which I hated. It also features some slow-motion scenes and duels, which I honestly don't like that much, but I also see how they wanted the game to be more than mindless dummy killing. You can upgrade your character in three different styles of play, freely picking what you like, but in certain sequences to unlock new ones. There are also some "secrets" around each stage that gives you some true western facts for those that like such things (I like looking for them, but I don't care much for reading in-game).\n\nI haven't played this a lot yet, so please excuse me if the review isn't very in-depth. My impression so far though, is that this is a really good game if you like shooting. I believe I got this game as part of a bundle once and didn't really expect anything.

Not graphically fantastic, but great artstyle. Guns all feel nice, as well as the environments. Enemies are varied, as well as bosses. Duelling is difficult, but often far between luckily, and each level feels different. 8/10, very very fun way to kill 10 hours, and good replayability.\n\nCall of Juarez: Gunslinger (or Gunslinger from now on) is effectively a rail shooter, so gameplay wise it's not particularly innovative. In short, follow the path, shoot the dudes, rinse and repeat. The western theme makes for some great style, especially in Gunslinger's comic book-esq Artstyle and some interesting levels, such as those in a Goldmine, a Swamp, and a whole-town shootout to name a few. There's a few different guns from which to choose from, you get a primary weapon, Double-Barreled Shotgun or Rifle, and a secondary which you can single or dual wield from the short-ranged Quickshooter or Sawn-Off Shotgun, or the mid-ranged Six-Shooter or the long-ranged Ranger, in addition to some Dynamite on later levels. There's a skillpoint system, and generally you'll level up once a level or so, and there's a variety of upgrades for Short Range, Mid Range and Long Ranged combat with some Weapon Upgrades when you've invested enough points. Towards the end, you may feel a bit overpowered, especially with a new game + option, but Gunslinger's difficulty isn't particularly high to begin with, except for the totally evil duelling, where you need about 3 eyes just to be able to do it decently, and feels a bit token just because it's a Wild West themed game. In addition to your guns and dynamite, Gunslinger also gives you two extra toys: Sense of Death, and Concentration. Concentration is bullet time, but is very useful when things get a bit hectic. Sense of Death has a 30 second recharge that allows you to dodge a lethal bullet if you lean out of it's way. Useful certainly, but you'll probably die a lot from misjudgement.\n\nWhile Gunslinger isn't particularly innovative or exciting in Gameplay, it makes up for it, strangely enough, in story. Gunslinger follows an old man who wonders into a Saloon of a sleepy town one day, claiming to be the legendary Bounty Hunter, Boba Fe-I MEAN Silas Greaves. The alleged Mr. Greaves then tells some stories from his Bounty Hunting days to the few folks in the saloon, which are the levels we play in game. Where Gunslinger really makes this effective is some excellent narration, seriously the voice acting is beautiful, take my word on it. But Gunslinger has another ace up it's sleeve. The narration follows you outside the cutscenes to the levels, and on several occasions, time will rewind, the level reorganise and plot details change, it's some excellent storytelling.\n\nBut as usual, Gunslinger is not perfect. It's not particularly difficult, and the extra ammo upgrades are kind of useless as you get showered in ammo. A lot of enemies are very difficult to see, and misjudgement from sense of death will be a pain in the ♥♥♥♥. The duelling system is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the final 'plot twist' is a bit predictable.\n\nWhile not the greatest game ever, Gunslinger is probably the most fun I've ever had with a game. Not only is it an excellent narritive experience, but it's just fun in a kind of mental/badass way. How many games can you name where you can become a magical shotgun wizard, where you dual-wield Sawn-Off Shotguns, with no reloads and increased damage in bullet time mode, and clear out an entire bank of thugs in the middle of a whole-town shootout? None other, than Call of Juarez: Gunslinger.\n\n8/10 - Not particularly innovative, some dodgy textures here and there, and a poor duelling system. But some simple and rewarding gameplay combined with beautiful setting and level design.","December 30, 2014","true","28.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

There isn't any state of the arts graphics or an outstanding story telling. Story is simple as a western should be, with a nice twist, the AI is not that complex. However, the fact that AI is simple, makes the game more fun fast and well suited for an afternoon of relaxing shooting. The collectables are not that important for the history or XP, but they give a good doses of culture. XP is another nice feature as it compels you to do head shots and all that nice stuff. There are some issues in the aiming, special with Zoom, but they don't affect the experience that much. I recommend that game for any western lover or for anyone who use to love the shooters in those game rooms. For those who expect a more complex story, better graphics, and more complex AI this is not the game.

The way the story is told is the narrator is Silas Greaves and he takes you through the story. The story is told in real time so anything Silas will say will happen, whether or not it makes sense. This way of telling the story is unique and it works.\n\nThe gameplay is tight and flows well. The game features a combo system that rewards quick kills and precision aiming. As you earn xp you level up and you unlock perks. If you unlock enough perks in that category you get a legendary weapon. The game also features arcade mode which is certain sections of story in which your objective is to score as much points as possible. The last mode is Duels, where you go through 15 duels and you try to score as much points as possible.\n\nThere are some gripes I have with this game is that to change the FOV you have to go into Video.scr to change it. Not many people are aware of this. The AI isnt the best, they just spawn and shoot you. I have experienced a couple crashes with the game.\n\nIf you are a fan of first person shooters get this, if you like Wild West shooters definitely get this.\n\n\nTo change the FOV\n\n1) Go to C:\Users\YOURNAMEHERE\AppData\Local\tech­land\cojgunslinger\out\Settings\n2) Open Video.scr with notepad\n3) Add the following 2 lines to the bottom of the list\n\nForcedHorzFov(INSERT FOV NUMBER HERE BETWEEN 80-110)\nDisableScreenBorder()","September 14, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This must have been said at least 100 times by now, but i felt like adding my own words into the pot (so to speak). The game follows the adventures (or misadventures) of Silas Greaves. The whole game essentially is Silas in a bar recalling his adventures of years gone by. Of course, the whole game inst just a cutscene, you actually get to play in Silas' stories as he tells them. Many famous outlaws of the Wild West, such as Jesse James and Billy the Kid. The game really shines gameplay-wise. There's no complicated game mechanics, nor a deep levelling system. Gunplay is really well done and the basic levelling system compliments it nicely. The game took me around 7 (ish) hours to complete and is well worth the asking price (even better when it's on sale!)\n\nPerformance\nThis game originally came out a few years ago, so i can't say much about day one. I managed to attain a locked 60fps 95% of the time in 1440p (with a GTX 960).\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 9/10 | Highly Recommend","March 28","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has the best first person shooting mechanics imo, CoD doesn't hold a candel for this s**t. The game is perfectly balanced, and with true skill you can make some of the most intense moments that youll ever expirience.\nThe focus mechanic is the most useful thing in the game and will be a core mechanic in the arcade mode where you'll have to strategically use it in every situation possible to get the best score. The game has some of the most slick gameplay I've ever had the pleasure of palying.\nYou shouldn't come into the game expecting to much of the story though, even though it's pretty cool to hae the characters talking in the background while you fight your way through the level, the story isn't deep nor it has a satisfying end, the real part where the game shines is in the arcade mode, where you will really have to master the game to get all three gold stars in each level. Also the atmosphere in the game is something to behold, even with the (kind of) cartoonish artstyle the game manged to always made me feel like its the wild west, and thats partly becuase of the great voice acting and awsome locations that the game takes part in, and the artstyle makes the game even mor atmospheric imo...\nTl;dr version:\nYour a cowboy, and you shoot people.

If you have the slightest interest in action games, shooters, artistic visuals, or Ye Olde West (educational facts about the Wild West are collectibles), this game is perfect for you. There are two singleplayer modes: Campaign, where you hear a drunken old man tell his life story and then shoot someone right in the bar in full view of like ten people, and Arcade, where you re-enact all of your favorite Matrix/ Equilibrium/ Die Hard/ Expendables/ Terminator/ Robocop scenes in the desert with revolvers and double-barrel shotguns as you dodge bullets, enter bullet-time, hammer fire revolvers, shoot explosive barrels, destroy cover, dual-weild pistols, and THROW DYNAMITE THAT TURNS INTO THREE DYNAMITES WHICH YOU CAN THEN SHOOT MID-AIR. Also, Duels mode, if you couldn't get enough of a minigame about watching your own and other people's hands.

The main storyline of the game is narrated by Silas as an old man in a run down salon. As an interesting mechanic the game can change based on the narration, some of these changes are amusing. Often you will play a mission as one of your audience explains the well known story only to then have to replay the same mission as Greaves say "Well that's an interesting story but what happened was....."\n\nGameplay wise it is a very linear game and is a sequence of shooting galleries. Reach an area and a number of enemies will spawn and rush you. You have 3 main weapons and upgrade trees, pistols (inc dual wielding), rifle and shotgun. Kills also earn concentration which can initiate a 'bullet time' slowdown allowing you to target and fire at multiple enemies. The boss fights are a mix between bulletsponges and duels, The duels are by far the best of these. I find the difficulty of the duels to be just right, often I would require a couple of attempts to complete but sometimes succeeded in the first attempt.\n\nOutside of the storyline there is also a couple of leaderboard style game modes. Arcade which is a level you need to clear with the highest score possible. Score is a combination of points for chaining kills and things like headshots and time to complete. There is also a pure dual mode where you need to complete 15 duels with 5 lives. The main game is still the main draw card but they additional modes are fun.","March 19, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Someone who loved Wild West American history put their heart and soul into this game. On the surface it's your typical shoot'em'up. Shoot, shoot, shoot, reload, and shoot some more--my favorite. Of course, it sports a Wild West Americana theme through the story telling of Silas Greaves.\n\nThe people in the story are actually real people. There's history and speculation behind these people back when we weren't so great at logging our past. This allows the story teller to stretch the truth as we see our plot unfold. Secret collectables known as "nuggets of truth" reveal factual history on these characters and more, so it's also educational and full of intrigue.\n\nThe combat is solid. I wasn't a big fan of the quickdraw segments. I had to repeat these a lot because you have to keep track of three things at once while trying to pop the bad guy. Normal combat is visceral and action packed! Bad guys have great aim, though they don't flank around too much. They use cover and reload appropriately. Your "health" meter is very well represented by paper tears on your screen that heal over time. Weapons feel powerful and kinetic. There's very little variety, unfortunately. Three revolvers, two shotguns, and two rifles. There's a level-up mechanic in the form of skills. Unfortunately shotguns are way too limited and the gunslinger tree focuses too much on spray-and-pray, so if you want to play this game on the hardest difficulty you are going to default to "Ranger" and focus on longrange combat and precision.\n\nThe game has a points system for gaining experience in the same way that Bulletstorm does. The "cheat death" mechanic is a lot like Max Payne. You get to see who's about to gank you and you can turn the tables and get yourself back in the fight.\n\nThe game isn't realistic by any means, but that's what makes it such a fun shooter. If you like FPS games and Western themes then you need to give this game a try.","September 13, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've only played the second game in the series before this but as I heard the third game Call of Juarez cartel wasn't a great game. This game on the otherhand takes the series back to it's old west roots although it ditches the characters of the first two games for a totally new bend.\n\nThis game focuses on an old washed up gunslinger spinning tales for booze in a Kansas bar who according to his own tales has shot down more men than... shoot, I don't think anyone has as high a body count as Silus Greaves claims. The story is mostly a tale of revenge as he hunts for a man who robbed and killed both his brothers and left him for dead with a rope necktie and a coin in his mouth "so they can't say I left you with nothing"\n\nDo NOT be fooled by this games lower price tag, even 15 dollars at launch this game more than earns itself amongst it's older brothers. While the game features an RPG style leveling system and a rather arcadey point system but does away with money and merchants as one found in the previous games it's still got the great high octane gun fighting and it's story is just as if not longer.\n\nOverall if you really liked this series older games, enjoyed the demo, or even just like find it on sale for less than four dollars I whole heartedly recomend this game.\n\nA word to the wise that this game when played on a 4:3 monitor has a very obstructive letter box. It cannot be deactivated in game but the devs have a way of tweaking the files to remove it.  A little more hassle than most games would ask but by no means a deal breaker.","September 10, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Set in the Old West, you take on the role as Silas Greaves as you take on legendary outlaws as you try to make things right in the world. The way the story is told is the narrator is Silas Greaves and he takes you through the story. The story is told in real time so anything Silas will say will happen, whether or not it makes sense. This way of telling the story is unique and it works.\n\nThe gameplay is tight and flows well. The game features a combo system that rewards quick kills and precision aiming. As you earn xp you level up and you unlock perks. If you unlock enough perks in that category you get a legendary weapon. The game also features arcade mode which is certain sections of story in which your objective is to score as much points as possible. The last mode is Duels, where you go through 15 duels and you try to score as much points as possible.\n\nThere are some gripes I have with this game is that to change the FOV you have to go into Video.scr to change it. Not many people are aware of this. The AI isnt the best, they just spawn and shoot you. I have experienced a couple crashes with the game.\n\nIf you are a fan of first person shooters get this, if you like Wild West shooters definitely get this.\n\n\nTo change the FOV\n\n1) Go to C:\Users\YOURNAMEHERE\AppData\Local\tech­land\cojgunslinger\out\Settings\n2) Open Video.scr with notepad\n3) Add the following 2 lines to the bottom of the list\n\nForcedHorzFov(INSERT FOV NUMBER HERE BETWEEN 80-110)\nDisableScreenBorder()","September 14, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is rendered even more fun by a great enemy variety and a pletora of combat techniques. There is even a dedicated arcade mode with the purpose of achieving the highest score possible out of waves after waves of enemies.\nGunslinger's plot is told in a "story within a story" fashion, with Silas telling his tales to a bunch of costumers in a saloon. The game actually takes advantage of this by using unexpected turns of events justifyed by how Silas is actually reporting the story, with paths often appearing out of thin air because Silas just remembered about them or the time being rewinded to tell the tale in a different light. Such events are always amusing.\nAll in all, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is a cheap and charming title. There is no harm in trying it.

With the addition of combat-based quicktime events, the gameplay feels smooth and genuine. In addition to fun gunplay, Techland provides a great progression system for the combat. Players can choose to advance in skill from one of three perk trees. Each perk gained  not only enhances the player's combat ability, but also provides a feeling of accomplishment. Along with the refined nature of progression, the firefights in this game have an "old-school" type feeling that fans of Doom or Quake will notice. The game encourages running while firing as there is no cover system and a large amount of enemies. The game features the standard health and armor bar, but also features a regenerating health system. Despite it's modern twist on an old genre, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger succeeds in providing a genuinely challenging FPS experience.\n\nGraphicsFor it's time of release, the game exhibits great visuals and performance. While the game is heavily stylized, it still looks great and can run perfectly on most modern machines. I was able to run the game at 4K with sweetfx installed while maintaining a solid 60 FPS. That says a lot about the game's optimized state as I am using a GTX 970, a modest video card at best in terms of 4K gameplay. However, the graphical settings menu leaves a few options out. For example, I had to dive into my configuration files in order to alter the field of view and letterboxing effect in the game. This is a very simple thing to include in a menu, and I am dissappointed at Techland's laziness.\n\nStoryThe game focuses on the story told and narrated by the protagonist at first, as all gameplay is inside the 'story'. It is fun to play out the different scenarios told by the main characters, and comic relief is applied to an otherwise tense game when story details are changed. As you progress through the game, a complex story unfolds outside of the game you're experiencing. I won't spoil anything, but this game provides an amazing story with a rollercoaster of a plot. For those who enjoy the linear, story-focused gameplay of Half-Life or Portal 2, this game is for you.\n\nSound and MusicI would like to start by mentioning how great the soundtrack is. The OST for this game is not only well produced, but it really helps present every scene and scenario that the player experiences. This OST is one that I would listen to in my free time, and could easily be sold as merchandise by itself. The sound is very good as well, includng great effects and voice acting. This aspect of the title does nothing but draw you into the atmosphere and world that the game creates.\n\nFinal VerdictI recommend Call of Juarez: Gunslinger to any fans of linear story-driven games, as well as old school FPS lovers.","January 6","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gun handling and sounds are spot on so even at the end the shooting up bad guys doesnt feel dull at all while every  level still manages to feel different..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeterMatias/recommended/204450/","PeterMatias","Peeta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeterMatias/","144 products in account","Call of Juarez Gunslinger is an FPS based on the Wild West, a title that was released as a digital download only, and priced as an indie game at launch, (15$ is an absolute steal) but with AAA production values.\nAfter the underwhelming critical response to Call of Juarez The Cartel, developer Techland and publisher Ubisoft went back to the drawing board and revived a franchise many thought would never be relevant again, and for all intents and purposes, they managed to pull it off, Call of Juarez Gunslinger is a great Call of Juarez title, and an amazing shooter in it's own right.\n\nThe game has 3 main play modes, Story, Arcade and Duel. Story mode is the main one in the game, you play as Silas Greaves a bounty Hunter who has just arrived to a bar in Abilene, Texas and starts telling his life story to a few people at the local saloon, for a few free drinks. He tells about how he met Billy The Kid, Johnny Ringo, Sundance Kid, Butch Cassidy and other famous Wild West legends. The game's story and narration is told in a very different way than any other game, as you play the levels Silas himself is telling the story as he remembers it, and it creates a unique gaming experience in the sense that as you play a level, you hear him and the people around him, telling what happened and asking how the events took place. It is simple and it makes for a few twists to the story in the levels in real time, when Silas tells something that sounds almost impossible, it usually is, and he then tells the story "how it actually happened" making you play some levels in completely different ways. It is an interesting mechanic, and quite unique in how it presents the story to the player.\n\nArcade mode is all about getting through levels as fast as you can and rack up the most amount of points possible, it is incredibly fun to play and the combo system(which also exists in the story) for taking down enemies works amazingly well and is very rewarding.\n\nDuel is a mode that allows you to play, or replay the Duels from the main story. It is what makes this game feel like it actually takes place in the Wild West, and it's also what made Call of Juarez unique to begin with. It is basically a 1 on 1 (sometimes 1 on 2) standout like you see in most Westerns worthy of that name, where the camera is focusing on your enemy from a behind your gun perspective and you need to focus and adjust the weapon draw speed to succeed. You will need fast reflexes to win these duels, and they are incredibly gratifying, and fun to play.\n\nThe visuals and audio in the game are quite amazing, even more so considering this is not a full budget AAA game. The game's engine is Techland's proprietary Chrome Engine 5, an engine used in Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide for example, and it uses a cel-shaded effect that makes the game look quite unique. It is similar in it's looks to the style Borderlands uses, although different enough to stand out on it's own. It is violent and bloody, and everything on screen looks great and plays fast. The music is one of the best parts of the game, it sets the mood quite well, and they are essencial to the experience in the way it works together with the visuals, the presentation and the overall feel of the game. Call of Juarez is in more ways than one, a true homage to the Wild West, to Spaghetti Westerns and to a time where the law and crime were seen in a completely different way than what it is today, and it delivers in spades.\n\nThe mechanics in the game are simple and work brilliantly. The shooting is a lot of fun and incredibly precise, making shooting the enemies fun and not frustrating. Concentration is an important part of the game's mechanics, allowing you to make time go slower and be even more precise, activated simply by the press of a button and it depletes and recharges over time, adding some strategy in how to best use it, and the last chance mode will give you the opportunity to dodge a bullet that will kill you, if you press the right direction, and it's context sensitive, meaning you will not always be able to use it. All these contribute to some dramatic and frantic gameplay moments, adding even more value to this title.\n\nDo not let the low price tag fool you. Call of Juarez is an incredible game and has a lot of content for it's price. The story isn't that long, but it is fun and has just the right lenght. Arcade and Duel modes add even more content to the mix, and are unique and incredibly fun.\n\nThe Good\n\n-Good story, great presentation and narration;\n-Cutscenes presented in a comic/handrawn style gives the game a unique personality and visual style;\n-Really great shooting mechanics;\n-Tense Duels;\n-Excellent visuals and audio;\n-Real Wild West Lawmen and outlaws in the story;\n-Highly replayable story mode;\n-It's price;\n\nThe Bad\n\n-Story mode may feel a little short to some;\n-Levels are linear, for the most part which can be considered a downside for some players;\n\n9/10","June 11, 2014","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can tell Techland put a lot of love into this project, because it shows every step of the way.\n\nThe gameplay setting takes place in the past, while the narration takes place in the present as he tells his epic stories to some teenagers at a bar. This let the developers have some fun with the story-telling mechanics, with frequent rewinds and misinformation, making for longer gameplay. You can collect artifacts to read the true historical facts if you wish.\n\nThe gameplay is, for the most part, like most first person shooters. But CoJG comes with a fresh twist on gunplay. While old mechanics like the concentration gauge make a warm return, you can now come face to face with an outlaw for a quick-draw duel. Very groovy mechanic, and it definitely makes the whole western theme feel extra solid. You can carry two single handle weapons such as pistols or sawn-offs, as well as a double handed weapon like a rife or shotgun. This installment in the franchise plays a little differently from it's predecessors in the sense that it has an arcade feel to it. Every shot has skill points attached to it, which gains experience points to upgrade your character the way you play. The skill tree is divided into three classes: Gunslinger, Ranger, & Trapper - giving you the power over how to evolve your character.\n\nNormal, Hard, and True West difficulty settings.

And they have new and interesting ways of building the level, and a definate story that puts a 3rd person view on the western shooter. Like Brothers In Arms: Earned In Blood did with the war game genrà. But in a subtle and truly haunting way.\n\nThe jumping being off as hell I definetally reccomend this game to people who love FEELING like they can kill thousands single handedly.\n\nThe art is celshaded, and despite the horrible border around your view, the look of the game is something we haven't seen before. The Borderlands celshaded look added to a western and thrown in some of the most colourful blood I have ever seen\n\nDispatching of enemies is easy and fun but also the regeneration ability doesn't make it feel like you're cheating. The duels are somehow easy and difficult at the same time and they switch up how the duel works every other duel and really forces you to pay attention.\n\nIf I haven't sold the game to you already, probably the fact that it's for anyone who has hands. As like I said, dispatching of enemies is easy and fun but also challenging. So people who don't really think that much about the story will enjoy it to, unlike those who can't play Life Is Strange without a single explosion happening atleast every 6 seconds will sell it to you.\n","July 31, 2015","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here's what it has to offer:\n\n-A surprisingly fun and well told story, specially considering how arcade shooters usually have really crap stories. "Gunslinger" not only plays with narrative conventions to create a funny and enticing tale, it also teaches you stuff about the Old West through collectibles.\n\n-Great visual presentation and sound design. The comic-booky feel of the graphics means that this game will stand the test of time much better than other games with realistic graphics, and overall the whole aesthetic is consistent and interesting. The music is great, and I don't think I've ever played a first person shooter in which the bullets sounded as good as they do in "Gunslinger".\n\n-Incredible gunplay, wiith a variety of skills and guns so you can play how you want to. You will feel like you're playing the leading man in a Sergio Leone film, down to the revolver duels. No other arcade shooter has gameplay as solid as this.\n\n-A lot of replayability. The story is short (about five hours long), but there are some differences between playthroughs, not to mention new game+ and collectibles. Arcade Mode and Duel Challenges make this a great pick-up and play title when you want to shoot some stuff but don't want to go play a lenghty story-based FPS or deal with multiplayer.\n\n-There is no need to have played any other Call of Juarez games (I haven't, and honestly this could have been called anything else and it wouldn't make a lick of difference), and the game is really cheap, so there's very little reason not to try it.\n\n-It runs well.\n\n-HOLY ♥♥♥♥ NO UPLAY\n\nIf you like first person shooters and/or spaghetti westerns, this is a must buy.","December 31, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very colorful cell-shaded western game. Very arcade-y feel to it. Bullet time has been done before, but it fits in well with this game. I actually got a couple good chuckles out of parts of it. Seemed a lot more light-hearted than the previous Call of Juarezes. Multiple game modes, New Game+, an RPG-like leveling system. Story is told through a bounty hunter that has walked into a bar and is telling a series of stories about his life. Interesting plot twist at the end, with a choice. New Game+ points out bits of the story that may have been overlooked before. Nuggets of Truth are collectibles scattered throughout levels that give bonus experience and reveal information about certain topics such as people and objects in the real old west. Voice acting was top notch, I recognized the guy who voiced the grandpa from the old Ben 10 cartoon series as one of the main characters.\n\nOverall probably an 8/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKing4562/recommended/204450/","TheKing4562","Ammy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKing4562/","229 products in account","Its not often a rare gem like this comes to my attension. Thanks to a good friend who unfortunatly doesn't want to experince every bit of this game like I do due to his perefence in difficulty.\nCall of Juarez is a Western FPS, Single player and come with Campain (Story mode), Arcade and Quickdraw Duels\n\nArcade: In this mode you try to go for the highest score while choosing a certain class of weapon. (Gunslinger) Double Quickshooters. Ranger (1 Revolver and a Rifle) and Trapper (Shotgun, Revolver). Your goal is to be a combo master-god and to (or at least attempt) to keep a combo going for as long as possible (perferably start to end of the level for the bigest score multiplyier) All the while trying your best to survive the onlast of of enimies your running into to keep you combo up (Unless in a situation where they are comming to you).\nEach class in this mode also have a set of skills that you unlock over time ascoiated with them that will help you imensivly as time goes on. The only problem with the system is the trapper class due the sole reason "I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP A COMBO WITH A 2 SHOT SLOW REALOADING SHOTGUN" but all that aside with shotgun being my most look down upon weapon in the game.\nThe other 2 clases are built really well in comparison. Gunslinger is really good at high populated areas where you need to take them out as fast at possible without dieing. and the Ranger is good for when the range of the enimies is to great to take on with a revolver without risking losing your combo taking time to go in closer. Oh noteworthy tip to note, Rifle headshots are worth twice in points compare to revolver/quickshooter headshots.\n\nDuels: This mode was desing to forcus the boss battles in the game is a western like fashion. In other words, its a quickdraw tourniment where the slowest lose. It takes awhile to master since you need to do 3 main things. Line up your target with a very (on purpose) wibbly wobby crosshair that gets smaller more your forcus in. Make sure your hand speed is at the highest by having a balencing minigame est with your hand slowly moving towards your gun to quicken your pull out speed. and lastly if you want to play morally and get achivements like the cools cats do. YOU NEED TO BE THE 2ND ONE TO PULL OUT OF HIS HOLSTER. Unlike the arcade mode, the duels are done all in one sitting giving you 6~ lives to get trough all ## bosses (I'm leaving the number a mystery on purpose). If you go for the honrable kills on all the bosses in the game, out drawing them on every turn and also surving the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they throw at you (you get to find out as it comes). For me at least, it was one of the most statisfying feeling I had in video games in a long time, To survive and beat all the bosses while all the being honorabled killed. PS: The Duels can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ at 1st but you'll get used to it eventauly\n\nStory/Campain\nThis part of the game is the ture meat of it, the game is a mix of both Arcade and Duels but in a more casual fashion (where you don't need to grind out and just have fun). The vidoe game events is being narated by a old bounty hunter in a pub telling the floaks inside about his life-story. Due to this the game is very linear but you do get moments where (Wait, it din't happen like that) where you go trough the events in a differnt way giving you a slight amount of amusment of how much things chould have been all changed around/paused, filler). Other than the levels being linear/1 track (Unless something changes in the story). The levels are great, they are all in a cell shaded style that can resemble Borderlands greatly but with its own color pallet.\n\nGunplay: 1 serious thing to note, the crosshair and actauly place where the bullet is going to hit is a little lower than other game I play, to compinsate I just got used to aimming up a higher a bit than what I'm used to.\n\nRevolvers: Longer realoads (Realoding each bullet instead of a clip) but has a longer range than Quickshooters, good but might get annoying in situations where you don't have time to shove bullets into you gun\nQuickshooters: Shorter clip reaload but with less range t Trade-offs, Trade-offs. Ya-da Ya-da Ya-da\n\nRifles: Greatest acuracy weapon in the game but has the slowest reload time, Great for getting the guy on the hill 200ft away. Not so good when your in a saloon with 10~ guys.\n\nShotguns: Maybe its because I don't know how to use it. But it pretty much one shots people where-ever you hit them and has moderate reaload. Now if your a guy like me who is poping people's head off left and right, this doesn't have much use for something like this.\n\nLast notes about the game. Story mode you can carry 2 Holster weapons of the same type (You can 1 or 2 armed to fire at the same time) and 1 Special weapon which can be a Rifle/Shotgun. Your bullets are limited but the games make sure you shound't run out unless your missing or using 1 weapon at little 2 much. And on a Final note you need to play this game twice in story mode to get a true feel for it all.\nYou see there is a difficulty unlock upon playing the game called "True-west" mode. Where you basically don't have any hud elements except for the letter box around your screen. This means you cannot check you special ablities or see your crosshairs. Now you can check how many bullets you have via weapon switch wheel but other than that, that is the only break you get.\nIn Duel bosses in story mode, you don't get to see your focus % or your quickdraw % but you do get your crosshairs and you do get to see how close your hand is your Revolver so you can find the sweet spot visualy.\n\nI need to learn to type a proper review that itsn't just full with "ands" and incompletly sentences or thoughts. But I said what I think neede to be said, I hope you all pick up this game eventauly in your life and I guess Happy Kwanzaa?","December 21, 2014","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If he talks about something coming from "out of nowhere," it might actually fall from the skies. It's all rather clever. There's good mechanics at play here too, with an XP and level up system with different skill trees, a combo and focus meter system, a different take on "down but not out," and one on one duels, there's quite a lot here in this 4 hour game. There's also a combo focused arcade mode and a new game +, so I will definitely check both of those out.

I mean, it's like a brilliant commentary on video games in general and how they tend to exaggerate reality in the spirit of keeping things exciting. And it is exciting and tons of fun! The shooting is very very satisfying - zero complaints there. I really dig the "last minute dodge" mechanic as well, and the stand offs are a neat way to cap off levels. There are so really cool levels here, like the train, and it's all quite gorgeous.\n\nMy only complaint was the last level in the graveyard, which was tedious and ♥♥♥♥.

The story itself is isn't award winning material but the way this game presents it certainly elevates it. As for the gameplay it's quite a simplistic but satisfying FPS. The gameplay may get a little repetitive for some but the story and upgrade system is sure to keep things interesting and although there isn't much of a variety of weapons in the game they all get the job done with satisfying impact. Plus you can dual wield Sawn-Off shotguns so...ya know, there's that. The only part of the game I didn't enjoy was the duelling. Now it may be because I sucked at them (and I am a sore loser) but I found that they were... well I just couldn't get the hang of it and found them difficult, especially as they take so damn long and I get incredibly impatient and antsy when I lose- Christ I shouted at my cat for distracting me! But I digress. The soundtrack is also very good, it retains an old west feel while still sounding modern and sets the perfect tone for this game. Now I haven't played any other title in the franchise so I can't judge it as part of a series but as a standalone game I recommend it strongly, especially if you're a fan of the era.","April 2, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Here's what it has to offer:\n\n-A surprisingly fun and well told story, specially considering how arcade shooters usually have really crap stories. "Gunslinger" not only plays with narrative conventions to create a funny and enticing tale, it also teaches you stuff about the Old West through collectibles.\n\n-Great visual presentation and sound design. The comic-booky feel of the graphics means that this game will stand the test of time much better than other games with realistic graphics, and overall the whole aesthetic is consistent and interesting. The music is great, and I don't think I've ever played a first person shooter in which the bullets sounded as good as they do in "Gunslinger".\n\n-Incredible gunplay, wiith a variety of skills and guns so you can play how you want to. You will feel like you're playing the leading man in a Sergio Leone film, down to the revolver duels. No other arcade shooter has gameplay as solid as this.\n\n-A lot of replayability. The story is short (about five hours long), but there are some differences between playthroughs, not to mention new game+ and collectibles. Arcade Mode and Duel Challenges make this a great pick-up and play title when you want to shoot some stuff but don't want to go play a lenghty story-based FPS or deal with multiplayer.\n\n-There is no need to have played any other Call of Juarez games (I haven't, and honestly this could have been called anything else and it wouldn't make a lick of difference), and the game is really cheap, so there's very little reason not to try it.\n\n-It runs well.\n\n-HOLY ♥♥♥♥ NO UPLAY\n\nIf you like first person shooters and/or spaghetti westerns, this is a must buy.","December 31, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thanks to a good friend who unfortunatly doesn't want to experince every bit of this game like I do due to his perefence in difficulty.\nCall of Juarez is a Western FPS, Single player and come with Campain (Story mode), Arcade and Quickdraw Duels\n\nArcade: In this mode you try to go for the highest score while choosing a certain class of weapon. (Gunslinger) Double Quickshooters. Ranger (1 Revolver and a Rifle) and Trapper (Shotgun, Revolver). Your goal is to be a combo master-god and to (or at least attempt) to keep a combo going for as long as possible (perferably start to end of the level for the bigest score multiplyier) All the while trying your best to survive the onlast of of enimies your running into to keep you combo up (Unless in a situation where they are comming to you).\nEach class in this mode also have a set of skills that you unlock over time ascoiated with them that will help you imensivly as time goes on. The only problem with the system is the trapper class due the sole reason "I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP A COMBO WITH A 2 SHOT SLOW REALOADING SHOTGUN" but all that aside with shotgun being my most look down upon weapon in the game.\nThe other 2 clases are built really well in comparison. Gunslinger is really good at high populated areas where you need to take them out as fast at possible without dieing. and the Ranger is good for when the range of the enimies is to great to take on with a revolver without risking losing your combo taking time to go in closer. Oh noteworthy tip to note, Rifle headshots are worth twice in points compare to revolver/quickshooter headshots.\n\nDuels: This mode was desing to forcus the boss battles in the game is a western like fashion. In other words, its a quickdraw tourniment where the slowest lose. It takes awhile to master since you need to do 3 main things. Line up your target with a very (on purpose) wibbly wobby crosshair that gets smaller more your forcus in. Make sure your hand speed is at the highest by having a balencing minigame est with your hand slowly moving towards your gun to quicken your pull out speed. and lastly if you want to play morally and get achivements like the cools cats do. YOU NEED TO BE THE 2ND ONE TO PULL OUT OF HIS HOLSTER. Unlike the arcade mode, the duels are done all in one sitting giving you 6~ lives to get trough all ## bosses (I'm leaving the number a mystery on purpose). If you go for the honrable kills on all the bosses in the game, out drawing them on every turn and also surving the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they throw at you (you get to find out as it comes). For me at least, it was one of the most statisfying feeling I had in video games in a long time, To survive and beat all the bosses while all the being honorabled killed. PS: The Duels can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ at 1st but you'll get used to it eventauly\n\nStory/Campain\nThis part of the game is the ture meat of it, the game is a mix of both Arcade and Duels but in a more casual fashion (where you don't need to grind out and just have fun). The vidoe game events is being narated by a old bounty hunter in a pub telling the floaks inside about his life-story. Due to this the game is very linear but you do get moments where (Wait, it din't happen like that) where you go trough the events in a differnt way giving you a slight amount of amusment of how much things chould have been all changed around/paused, filler). Other than the levels being linear/1 track (Unless something changes in the story). The levels are great, they are all in a cell shaded style that can resemble Borderlands greatly but with its own color pallet.\n\nGunplay: 1 serious thing to note, the crosshair and actauly place where the bullet is going to hit is a little lower than other game I play, to compinsate I just got used to aimming up a higher a bit than what I'm used to.\n\nRevolvers: Longer realoads (Realoding each bullet instead of a clip) but has a longer range than Quickshooters, good but might get annoying in situations where you don't have time to shove bullets into you gun\nQuickshooters: Shorter clip reaload but with less range t Trade-offs, Trade-offs. Ya-da Ya-da Ya-da\n\nRifles: Greatest acuracy weapon in the game but has the slowest reload time, Great for getting the guy on the hill 200ft away. Not so good when your in a saloon with 10~ guys.\n\nShotguns: Maybe its because I don't know how to use it. But it pretty much one shots people where-ever you hit them and has moderate reaload. Now if your a guy like me who is poping people's head off left and right, this doesn't have much use for something like this.\n\nLast notes about the game. Story mode you can carry 2 Holster weapons of the same type (You can 1 or 2 armed to fire at the same time) and 1 Special weapon which can be a Rifle/Shotgun. Your bullets are limited but the games make sure you shound't run out unless your missing or using 1 weapon at little 2 much. And on a Final note you need to play this game twice in story mode to get a true feel for it all.\nYou see there is a difficulty unlock upon playing the game called "True-west" mode. Where you basically don't have any hud elements except for the letter box around your screen. This means you cannot check you special ablities or see your crosshairs. Now you can check how many bullets you have via weapon switch wheel but other than that, that is the only break you get.\nIn Duel bosses in story mode, you don't get to see your focus % or your quickdraw % but you do get your crosshairs and you do get to see how close your hand is your Revolver so you can find the sweet spot visualy.\n\nI need to learn to type a proper review that itsn't just full with "ands" and incompletly sentences or thoughts. But I said what I think neede to be said, I hope you all pick up this game eventauly in your life and I guess Happy Kwanzaa?","December 21, 2014","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the addition of combat-based quicktime events, the gameplay feels smooth and genuine. In addition to fun gunplay, Techland provides a great progression system for the combat. Players can choose to advance in skill from one of three perk trees. Each perk gained  not only enhances the player's combat ability, but also provides a feeling of accomplishment. Along with the refined nature of progression, the firefights in this game have an "old-school" type feeling that fans of Doom or Quake will notice. The game encourages running while firing as there is no cover system and a large amount of enemies. The game features the standard health and armor bar, but also features a regenerating health system. Despite it's modern twist on an old genre, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger succeeds in providing a genuinely challenging FPS experience.\n\nGraphicsFor it's time of release, the game exhibits great visuals and performance. While the game is heavily stylized, it still looks great and can run perfectly on most modern machines. I was able to run the game at 4K with sweetfx installed while maintaining a solid 60 FPS. That says a lot about the game's optimized state as I am using a GTX 970, a modest video card at best in terms of 4K gameplay. However, the graphical settings menu leaves a few options out. For example, I had to dive into my configuration files in order to alter the field of view and letterboxing effect in the game. This is a very simple thing to include in a menu, and I am dissappointed at Techland's laziness.\n\nStoryThe game focuses on the story told and narrated by the protagonist at first, as all gameplay is inside the 'story'. It is fun to play out the different scenarios told by the main characters, and comic relief is applied to an otherwise tense game when story details are changed. As you progress through the game, a complex story unfolds outside of the game you're experiencing. I won't spoil anything, but this game provides an amazing story with a rollercoaster of a plot. For those who enjoy the linear, story-focused gameplay of Half-Life or Portal 2, this game is for you.\n\nSound and MusicI would like to start by mentioning how great the soundtrack is. The OST for this game is not only well produced, but it really helps present every scene and scenario that the player experiences. This OST is one that I would listen to in my free time, and could easily be sold as merchandise by itself. The sound is very good as well, includng great effects and voice acting. This aspect of the title does nothing but draw you into the atmosphere and world that the game creates.\n\nFinal VerdictI recommend Call of Juarez: Gunslinger to any fans of linear story-driven games, as well as old school FPS lovers.","January 6","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Call of Jaurez Gunslinger has you take up the Bounty Hunting life of Silas Greaves who is equally skilled at Gunslinger and telling a good story in the local Saloon while downing a shot of Whisky.\n\nRight away what i liked was the unique story telling approach that this game took with Silas telling his listeners what was happening and you then doing what he was saying and there were times when he would say he did something or fought someone and then the next he explains it differently and it takes you back to do it the next way he explains it. To me this was very different from how most games tell a story of there campaign and i found it very refreshing and interesting and just in general alot of fun.\n\nIn terms of actual gameplay its very straightfoward and uses the typical control style of most fps games so it was easy to jump into and start gunning down your foes. There were some really awesome features like dodging bullets and have a quickeye mode allowing you to shoot multiple targets quickly to some there features might seem abit gimicky but i can assure you that it does add some very fun elements to the game and you have to make use of them correctly to get your way through the tough spots.\n\nAnother nice feature is the upgrade system instead of just starting of the game and blazing your way through like alot of shooters you are offered to upgrade your character in certain areas like duel wielding pistols or taking a route down the rifle upgrade tree or shotgun this system allows you to develop your character to specilize in a specific are or you can disperse upgrades evenly its entirely up to you so you can go through each playthrough using a different setup for your character. There is also a unique system the game has when you have a classic western gunslinger duel and although the control system isnt perfect and at first is abit hard to get use to the duels are alot of fun in duel mode once you learn how to do them.\n\nTo bring up some negatives i was rather disapointed in the limited selection of weapons there are only about 3 pistols a rifle and a shotgun and although you can get upgraded versions of there weapons that have different visuals and amounts power and accuracy they are in essence the same weapons and as a result there isnt alot of variety there. Also even though the story is good to my mind its abit to short i was able to finish it on the standard difficulty in about 5 and a hald hours which is a little to short to my tastes but you could play on higher difficulties to make it more challenging and you could go around gathering all the collectables to increase that game length.\n\nIn terms of graphics and visuals its very beautiful with lots of great locations that help drive the story and immerse you in the gameplay ranging from old towns to forests and canyons to fighting in saloons and on trains so its very diverse which is fantastic. Another great feature i like was the addition of historical figures like Billy the Kid Butch Cassidy Sundance Kid and Jesse James and Silas's take on what he says really happens with these characters and his encounters and battles with them.\n\nThe Plot does possess a really nice twist to it which was nice when you got to the end and were able to enjoy it to sum up i do recommend this game as it is alot of fun and it does feel like a really great shooter even if it is abit short but i still think its worth it i give it a solid 6.5/10","January 12","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
