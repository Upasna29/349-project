The weapon choice desk doesn't spawn directly infront of me, but somewhat to the right.\n2. With the amount of enemies from different directions, i'd say dual-wielding weapons would be a very welcome addition.\n3. I like how the Minigun feels like an arm, maybe expand/change the gun models to have some sort of arm going in to increase the feel of immersion\n4. Enemies don't dodge in the slightest, it'd be an added difficulty aspect if atleast the bigger enemies tried to somewhat dodge your fire.\n5.Energy/electric weapon is too OP for clearing out the groups of small enemies, while the flamethrower is perfect for this, if a little too strong/fast in clearing them out.\n6. Flamethrower is too powerful against big enemies.\n7. I think you focussed a little too much on the difficulty stemming from the amount of enemies, i feel like they die like flies even the big ones) and there's no real accomplishement in killing them . Less enemies at once but with a lot more health per enemy would be my preference.\n8. I like that you already have very different types of enemies and ways of spawning them in (Hangar doors,the slime nests,dragon-alien flying in) and that they have varying looks.\n9.infinite ammo makes things too easy, maybe make ammo packs spawn around the map that we ned to shoot to gain more ammo/fuel/energy, doing this with health packs might also be useful.\n\nAll in all, i'd say it shows a lot of promise, and definitely not bad for a free-to-play game!","May 27","true","0.1"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","27","33","3","2"

Once it's opened, it only says Levels + Endless, but when I click it or press any key, nothing happens. All I see are some projectiles flying and a soldier getting green-colored and empty again over and over. Please tell me how I can play, because it looks like a great game! :D","May 30","true","0.2"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","3"
