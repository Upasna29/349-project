I've definitely enjoyed my time with this!\n-There are a total of 6 chapters, with a boss encounter for each. Early stages can be pretty easy, but it can get difficult later on, especially on higher difficulty. It can take you a few attempts during later boss encounters before you figure out their attack pattern and take them down!\n\n-The visuals are fantastic for a SHMUP – everything is crisp and fluid. I really love the excellent art aesthetics and the look for the mechas.\n\n-Also, there are full Japanese voice overs for all of the characters (it's actually pretty good!) Subtitles are available, but you won't be reading much of it during intense fights.\n\n-3 attacks are available to you (4 if you count the EX special which has 3 variants) and each attack has a secondary function. Scatter shots can lock on enemies around you, focus shots lock on enemies in a targeted direction and blade attacks can be used to dash across the screen. Destroying enemy shots with the blade will charge the EX meter faster.\n\n-You’ll become real familiar with your arsenal – you won’t just spam one attack, especially if you’re a score chaser. You'll use blade attacks to rack up points, switch between shots depending on your position, cancel enemy projectiles with your blade, line up foes and dash across the screen with the blade dash to destroy enemies or avoid danger, and find the perfect moment to unleash your EX special to annihilate your foes.\n\n-You can take some punishment before you die. Your "health" is your shields which recharges over time to a certain degree.\n\n-The camera perspective will change during combat keeping each encounter fresh. It switches between side-scrolling, top-down, and 3D perspectives.\n\n-Astebreed definitely has replayability. Hard mode is extremely challenging. You also have the option to turn on scoring to test your skills and compete against other players’ scores on the online leaderboards.\n\n-There are unlockables! Hard mode, art, model viewer, and the ability to start with a different mecha becomes available after beating the game.","May 30, 2014","true","14.4"," 135 of 144 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","135","144","2","2"

What if your waifu was a giant robot with the soul of a young girl?\n\nThe answer, provided by Astebreed, is one of epic OVA proportions. But don't let yourself be fooled, there is kawaii to be found inside this world. But you must fight for it. You must fight to create a more kawaii world for everyone. Should you fail to do so, there will be no kawaii left. No more oppai. No more moe. Even otome novels will be a thing of the past. This is not a world worth living in. Ready your button fingers and slice those bullets to carve a path to a world of kawaii for everyone, a world where maybe even Sakura Angels could one day be a reality.\n\nThis game is a test of your dedication. Will you fight for this utopia to become real? Or will you run and doom everyone to a world of darkness and despair? Even your waifu?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/283680/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","One of the best things about indie games is that it’s actually possible to be surprised by them. As great as more mainstream games might be they’ve almost inevitability been preceded by a year or more’s worth of trailers, previews, interviews, and betas. But Astebreed has been out for over a year at this point and I've never had any idea it existed until a few days ago. Now that I do I can see it’s one of the best shoot ’em-ups of last year.\n\nAstebreed isn’t a first person shooter though, and it certainly doesn’t have any cover mechanics. It is instead an old school 2D shooter, very much in the style of genre master Treasure and classics such as Radiant Silvergun and Ikaruga. I’ve never heard of Edelweiss before but they seem to be a Japanese indie developer with only a small string of other arcade style action games to their name (after this I'm certainly going to check out earlier game Ether Vapor).\n\nBut while their appreciation for Treasure’s more traditional 2D work is obvious in every second of gameplay it’s actually Nintendo-published franchise Sin And Punishment that this game most closely resembles. The similarities come in that although in gameplay terms Astebreed is always a 2D shooter the perspective constantly changes, so that sometime it’s a traditional side-on game, sometimes a vertical scroller, and other times essentially an on-the-rails third person shooter.\n\nThe story behind the action is, of course, pure nonsense (and detailed in subtitles you never have time to read) but the cinematic stylings are hugely impressively and amongst the most technically advanced I’ve seen in the genre. The viewpoint doesn’t just switch at random, but is used to punctuate the action with the reveal of a boss or to allow for a brief respite after a punishing set piece.\n\nCreating a top quality 2D shooter is rarely about big new ideas but instead is more like designing a good roller coaster, with the appearance and design of each wave of new enemies requiring skilled choreography that often goes unappreciated – until you play a game that gets it wrong.\nAlthough it’s a truism that the Japanese do not use PCs to play video games that’s only generally true in terms of mainstream Western titles. The PC has always been home to a thriving market of visual novels and other low budget titles intended solely for a Japanese audience, and there’s also an active indie scene – know in Japan as dōjin soft.\n\nEven so the graphics here are still well above the level you’d expect, with rock solid 60 frames per second action and higher than 1080p resolution. But of course it’s the gameplay that is most vital and here Astebreed also excels. You’re piloting a Gundam-ish flying robot, which has three main forms of attack: a short range sword, a focused stream of bullets, and a wider spread shot attack.\n\nBoth shooting styles can use a lock-on mechanic, with the spread shot allowing you to target enemies in a circle around you, while the focused shots can only be used for objects directly in front of you. There are some additional complications, with different attacks being used to cancel different kinds of enemy bullets and a variable use special ‘EX Attack’, but the basics are relatively simple and much more accommodating for a novice player than something like Radiant Silvergun.\n\nIn fact the game goes out of its way to try to welcome those new to the genre, with an in-depth tutorial, reasonably fair checkpoints, and three different difficulty modes. The opening prologue is also purposefully easy, which not only helps not to scare of potential players but is also extremely useful for experimenting with the game’s various systems.\n\nAs genre fans would expect there’s a complex scoring system for when you’ve got the hang of the action, although delving into that side of the game is entirely optional. The score multiplier is based around your robot’s shields, and as long as they’re still up your combos will continue to rack up whenever you make a kill using either of the two normal shot attacks. When you use a sword you bank the points but the multiplayer drops.\n\nAnd again the game goes above and beyond by including a full suit of online leaderboards and achievements. There are even graphs to show the ebb and flow of your multiplier over the course of each level. Compared to other shooters, and other Japanese-dominated genres like fighting games, it’s a remarkably complete package that doesn’t use its niche status as an excuse not to include basic functions.\n\nIn strictest terms Astebreed doesn’t do anything new in the genre, but within that context this is one of the best examples of its breed in years. It’s especially good for newcomers and although it certainly gets very hard towards the end the game’s not spiteful about its difficultly level, and it does its best to help you succeed. I wouldn’t even really call it a bullet hell game, for although the screen certainly does get bus it doesn’t require rote learning or supernatural arcade skills to progress.\n\nRegardless of genre Astebreed is simply an excellent video game, with well balanced gameplay, great graphics and art design, and an interesting and varied challenge despite the short running time. That all this should be the work of an unknown indie developer just makes it all the more impressive, and all the more worthy of your time and money.","November 20, 2015","true","7.0"," 61 of 68 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","61","68","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaerock/recommended/283680/","xaerock","xaerock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaerock/","160 products in account","Astebreed is a sort of shoot'em'up / 3D mecha game hybrid. There's a fairly complicated melee system which makes the game very different from normal shooters. In addition to a generic shot and melee you have the ability to lock-on to enemies in an area.\n\nThe view of the gameplay shifts throughout the game; scrolling directions change and sometimes you only shoot enemies in the background. This is the best implementation of this I've seen so far, I felt it didn't disturb my gameplay at all unlike say in  Eschatos or Ether Vapor.\n\nA single playthrough while skipping all cutscenes takes about 30 minutes, which is average for a shmup. There is also chapter select to play each of the 6 chapters.\n\nPros:\n+ Extremely impressive presentation for an indie game. Graphics, music and sound effects are all top notch\n+ Shooting and melee combat systems are merged nicely. There is a lot of depth to how the systems can be used.\n+ Approachable to beginners of the genre due to varied difficulty options, lifebar and a comprehensive tutorial\n+ Simple intuitive scoring system; shoot things with your shot or lock-on to increase a multiplier, then get a lot of points by killing enemies using melee attacks with a high multiplier\n+ Well produced (but generic) anime storyline to follow throughout the game. I'm assuming the japanese voice actors are pretty good as well.\n+ Lots of extras and achievements to unlock\n\nCons:\n- It can be very difficult to see bullets and your hitbox when there's a lot of stuff going on\n- Some unskippable cutscenes even with story dialogue turned off in options\n- No 'super difficult' mode for hardcore fans of the genre. There's also not that much actual bullet dodging on hard mode because about half of all bullet patterns can be cancelled with melee strikes.\n- Lack of cohesion in enemy behavior: the same enemy type might shoot completely different attack patterns in different waves. Some attacks aren't telegraphed well (very fast red lasers without warning, etc)","May 31, 2014","true","9.8"," 50 of 59 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","50","59","0","0"

However the action is by far a crowning achievement, as a sidescroller, Astebreed goes to great lengths to create changing dimensions during play. You may be charging headlong into enemy fire to find that the enemy is now behind you, or drop down on a foe & fly circles around them during combat.\n\nDuring combat you have Spread Shot/Spread lock-on, Focus Shot/Focus lock-on, Blade Flurry/Blade Dash, EX Nova/ EX Blade Storm/ EX Wild. The shot & blade techniques are a simple difference between holding down the required button, however the EX attacks vary depending on how many targets your locked on -if any- & lastly if you've locked every weapon you have on a single target you go EX Wild.\n\nThe game has difficulty settings, chapter select, & leaderboards as part of the replay experience. It also has a gallery of all sorts of unlockable images to award your exceptional efforts.\n\n10/10 I would save my kawaii sisters again. :D","November 19, 2014","true","9.5"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","0"

At some moments, you may feel like you understood and mastered the game mechanics. But it is at such moments that the game throws you off and forces you to rethink how you control your mecha and play the game. The achievements prove worthwhile to see if you are really up to challenge of mastering the game.\n\nThe game's visuals are crisp and do help (rather than stray) with my enjoyment of the game. The graphic effects do add to the whole epicness of the battle. The sound effects are thankfully not grating (some games have awful SFX that makes SHMUPS sound like pea-shooters).\n\nGet this game!

You have a wide range of attacks from the get go, including wide and narrow ranged fire and you sword. There is also a dash attack, which is very convinient for changing your positioning and evading. Special attacks is where things get especially interesting. Once the attack is charged it's up to you which special you want to execute. The basic difference is that one is more offensive — dealing a lot of damage to the enemies, and the other is more deffensive — giving you brief invincibility and a chance to evade heavy fire.\n\nYou might find that the first few stages are very easy. Don't drop your guard though, try to use the opportunity to learn the mechanics and get yourself comfortable with executing different maneuvers. I can't stress enough how important evading gets later in the game, when suddenly you notice you start getting the Continue Y/N screen a bit too often.\n\nPresentation-wise, the music is good. So far, nothing I would listen to on repeat, but good enough. Visuals are spectacular though. You will want to get destracted from the action by the scenery, because it's that good.\n\nI haven't finished the game yet, but I definitely will. I'm not sure how much replayability the game offers: there are different difficulty settings and you can always try to go for a better score. Regardless, I think I will play through the game at least several times simply because how good the game feels and looks.\n\nDefinitely recommend this game to any fan of the genre and anyone who is willing to give it a try.","May 30, 2014","true","1.4"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","34","42","0","1"

My only concern is that the game was way too easy on normal mode; I pulled my 1CC All Clear in about an hour (my third attempt I believe).  This could be noted as a positive for many people since shoot 'em ups were intentionally prohibative (see DDP, Battle Garegga, Rayforce, etc) and I'm sure the game would suit me better on the now unlocked hard mode but considering I have only 1 real (excludes iOS ports, Gigantic Army, etc) single credit all clear in my years of shmupping (Kingdom Grandprix) I don't think I'd brag about this one nor add it to the list.  On to hard mode!\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add how pleased I was with the wealth of options available in the game.  You use a lock on mechanic like Souky but they even let you customize the controls to react similarly to Rudy where the straight lock zone is reversed making dodging while shooting feel more sensible.\n\nHopefully final edit: I was curious going in whether there would be a stereoscopic 3d mode like there was in EVR, unless I'm completely blind there is not.","May 31, 2014","true","2.0"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/headcrabrape/recommended/283680/","headcrabrape","Diebuster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/headcrabrape/","77 products in account","First: ignore the "TOO EASY" reviews. They are jokes. None of them took note of score, 1CCed Hard mode or even COMPLETED it.\n\nOne of the best, most underrated indie games out there, made doubly impressive by the development company's obscurity & status as part-time devs. Despite classic arcade-like design principles, it's not a "nostalgia game"; it can hardly be described as "X meets Y". Maybe Sin & Punishment's cinematic on-rails presentation + a shmup's bullet dodging + Alien Soldier's sheer variety of stuff to do... but that wouldn't really do it justice.\n\nBefore going more in-depth: Astebreed is NOT a bullet-hell/bullet-curtain game. It simply has bullet-hell ELEMENTS. You'll be dodging stuff and the last two bosses can get pretty manic, but you'll be destroying enemy shots in mid-air with your sword (or projectiles) just as much, if not more. It's less of a bullet hell or even a shmup as much as... an anime mecha game. If you find games like Dodonpachi to not be your thing, give this a try anyway; if you're into bullet-hells then chances are you're into arcadey games in general, so also go ahead and play this; just don't expect bullet-hell.\n\nI will outline the attacks here, but make sure you go through the entire tutorial to get a better feel for just how they work in the middle of battle:\n\nYou control a robot while locking-on, shooting, sword-slashing and comboing your way through various perspective-shifting stages. You have two normal shots (activated by tapping their respective buttons) & two lock-ons (holding down their respective button). The lock-ons are a forward & spread shot respectively, either targeting around you in a circle or in a straight line. Your slash is more than it seems at first glance; sure, you can quickly tap the attack button to do a fast combo, but this can often leave you open; sometimes, AVOIDING the longer combo attack by timing your presses just right is the better way to go. You can also hold on to the sword button along with whatever direction you want to dash towards, sword-first. Lastly you have a variety of context-sensitive special attacks; if you press the special attack button while locked on to nothing, you will damage whatever is near you (the range of this effect increases once you unlock the second mech) and creates a short aura of invincibility around you, which adds a nice element of strategy. While locked on to a large group of enemies, your mecha will automatically home in on them and slash them up at a crazy speed; meanwhile, while only locked on to a single enemy, you will pull off a very anime-esque move on it taking out a significant chunk of its health. The scoring system is easy to understand and hard to master and involves plenty of practice of all the aforementioned skills (once again, refer to the tutorial on scoring). Many will feel that the game will completely destroy your fingers, but if you find yourself mindlessly mashing the normal shots chances are you're not playing it right; the lock-on is very useful throughout most of the game and balances out the button-mashing quite well. The on-rails camera-shifting (from side-scrolling to vertical shooter to behind-the-back third-person) is truly impressive; it helps add to the game's variety while also making for interestingly-composed cinematography.\n\nMy gameplay gripes are balance issues, occasional lack of proper (yet not game-breaking) attack telegraphing and the lack of a DEFAULT option to set the movement keys to WASD. The latter, however, is easily fixed by googling "Astebreed WASD" and getting the Astebreed tweaker from the Steam forums (however note that sometimes it might create a strange delay for the directional keys; if this happens, just restore the defaults and set your own controls again). The former might just be a result if my (crappy) play style, but it feels like an area in stage 3 along with the last boss are both a bit too much of a difficulty spike. Even then it's nothing as big as, say, the contrast in difficulty between Ikaruga's first and second stages. Beyond that we have the occasional bizarre crash when using the "restart game" feature, but this can't actually destroy one of your runs, so I can look past it (also my computer is an ancient piece of garbage that was old even when I got it in 2008 and I can't even properly play this on max settings)\n\nMy own technical issues aside, the presentation's great. The art direction gives everything a cohesive space-y feeling while still being varied and making good contrasting use of color, the robots look so cool they even won over an old-school Japanese cartoon robot purist like me (I'll always prefer stuff like Go Nagai's Mazinger Z, Osamu Tezuka's Pluto and Mitsuteru Yokoyama's Black Ox to the more detailed "real robot" types that this game took influence from), the music is fitting, the animations and sound effects work... everything just comes together to make you feel like a mecha-piloting badass.\n\nYou probably noticed by now that I've not mentioned anything to do with the story or human characters so far; depending on a variety of factors, those can be a bit of a mixed bag. If you're extremely bothered by otaku-centric modern anime (which I am not), you will absolutely not be able to stand them; but that's not an issue, because you can skip every cutscene and completely mute all the anime talking. I don't, though, because I AM an anime fan and I enjoy the way the game makes you feel like you're playing a dramatic, well-directed, bizarre Japanese cartoon. The in-game dialogue can also be an issue if you can't speak Japanese, because most of it is delivered through gameplay and it's VERY hard to pay attention to both the subtitles AND the crazy robot action simultaneously. If you really want to know the full story and character interaction, I recommend watching a Youtube longplay instead (which might also help with certain difficult parts in Hard mode). Lastly we have the character art, which I place more focus on than most people. Putting it simply, the game clearly has various artists with very different levels of skill. Some of the visual novel-like cutscenes and human character artwork look super-stylish, expressive and cool by visual novel standards (actually, they look more like a high-profile TV mecha anime show; the art on the upper-right of this very page is an example) while others are just about what you'd expect from a visual novel. If you're not an art elitist like me though and find a lot of commonly-praised VNs to look pretty, those occasional downgrades will not bother you & the particularly good parts will surprise you even more.\n\nThis is also a short game, but if you're into arcade games this should not be an issue; arcade design is not about artificially creating "pacing" by stopping the action to force you to solve physics "puzzles" or pushing a block over a switch, which can be an issue with otherwise-great games. There is no exploration and no grinding; the game's world is not your oyster. Good arcade design is about pure non-stop gameplay bliss, a barrage of creative enemy formations and set-pieces that will stay with you for years. It is not about offering the player the illusion that they are forging their own path, but about creating a pre-set obstacle course and then giving you a very wide variety of ways of making your way through it and grading them based on their inventiveness. Replayability comes in the form of beating all the modes with all the mechs, 1CCing hard more and improving your global score.\n\nGiven this is an obscure game, the art unlockables are actually a nice thing to have because you can't just find all of them online. Some of them, like the 2D mecha concept artwork and the aforementioned stylish human character pictures, are definitely a visual treat. You also get to view every model and effect, because why not.\n\nThis is not just just a mere "old school nostalgia" game; it is simply a good game.","March 16","true","47.7"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","1"

It has great presentation and visual effects but has flaws typical for Japanese bullet hells - short length, harder difficulty (though there's easy difficulty) and silly story.\n\nI'd recommend this game but only to people who know what to expect from this subgenre of shoot 'em ups, with all upsides and downsides, others, if not attracted by the visuals, should rather try other shoot 'em ups (check Steredenn).\n\nPros:- Great presentation. Oh, it looks gorgeous! The game will shift camera angles pretty often so you can see all the hard work developers made there - environment, enemies and all effects look simply great.\n- Rapid combat that doesn't leave you much time to get rest. Anyway, most levels are three minutes of mob killing and three minutes of bossfight, the rest goes for cutscenes.\n- Controller support. Played on Xbox 360 controller without any problems.\n- Steam achievements that aren't gained just for beating levels - There are actually challenges in them that require to play in specific style.\n\nCons:- Short length. If you want to play it only once (on normal or easy difficulty), don't expect more than 2 hours of playtime.\n- There's only Japanese dubbing and most dialogues happen in battles where you won't get opportunity to read the English subtitles. Anyway, you don't lose much since it's mostly space brother-sisters drama packed into mecha action.","January 24","true","5.5"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","1"

There is also a gallery that demonstrates the various abilities and how to execute them with video and interactive tutorial segments. Finally the difficulty levels are well scaled, providing challenge and fun to all skill levels.\n\nOnce you learn the mechanics and beat the game it doesn't stop there. Astebreed features deep and rewarding scoring mechanics on top of all the other great features, so if you enjoy score chasing and leaderboards there is a lot of meat here.\n\nFinally the presentation is about as flawless as you could ask for in this type of game. The anime stylings perfectly capture the feel of 80s and 90s mecha and space opera anime, much like Ether Vapor before it. The music, audio and visuals in game are top notch. This game is a tour de force for shmup fans and a triumph for Edelweiss' particular design concepts.","June 23, 2014","true","4.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/283680/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Astebreed is a shoot em up with an odd twist. It is constantly changing perspective from isometric, horizontal and even third person points of view. It's a neat gimmick that helps make the action look over the top and adds a bit of personality to the game. Another thing that separates it from other shoot em ups is the addition of a sword that lets you destroy most projectiles and to attack enemies for big damage. Most enemies also shoot red projectiles which can not be destroyed, so it is unwise to stay in melee range and not have time to dodge. If you are particularly talented though, holding down the melee button lets you teleport a short distance which can be used to close in on enemies and dodge red beams. I found it a bit wonky and teleporting to be unpredictable but that may have been due to my own skill.\n\nYou start off as the President leading a small group of Xbreeds to fend off the enemy. Things quickly go wrong and both you and your squad are killed. It is a good prologue that teaches you the basics of the game and is an important piece of the story. From then on you play as a young goofy looking pilot.  Story is surprisingly interesting though pretty corny at times. All dialogue is spoken in Japanese and only the subtitles are in English. Which can be a problem as the characters are prone to talk during the heat of battle and it is very hard to both read and fight at the same time. Levels are also nicely interconnected and it feels like one big adventure instead of a few levels thrown together due to how well the transition from end of level story section to start of the next level mix.\n\nThere are 6 levels overall not counting the prologue and should last you a bit under an hour. After you beat the game you will unlock the hard difficulty and a lot of extra goodies like concept art, view-able character models and back-story for the world and the characters.  The back-story would have been far more useful before you played the game. You are thrown in and are expected to know everything from the get go. Not sure if Astebreed is an anime or something but the story is hard to understand the first time through and is further worsened due to the fast paced nature of the game forcing the story to move at an equal pace. That leaves it no time to flesh out the characters and very little time to explain who the enemies are and the events that caused all this. You also have the option to turn off a dialogue which is very appreciated after a few playthroughs.\n\nGameplay is fun and you have quite a few tools at your disposal. You can use a spread shot or a narrow shot like a regular shoot em up to take out enemies. Holding down the scatter shot button lets you lock on to all enemies around your giant mech and holding down the narrow shot button lets you lock on to any area of the map and is useful against boss fights as it locks on much faster. That is also the only way to shoot behind you which some bosses and enemies annoyingly like to do. Your mech can also use a sword for heavy damage against enemies or to block most projectiles. Using your sword greatly lowers your speed while in use but by holding down the melee button you can teleport away. Which is not usually a wise thing to do as you do not know where you will end up and are likely to get hit anyways.\n\nUnlike most bullet hell games Astebreed does not usually have a pattern to the projectiles and you are expected to block them with your sword. Sounds good until they throw in red beams making it nearly impossible to avoid damage at times. If you do get hit it is not the end of the world. You have a rechargeable shield which can take a lot of damage and it starts recharging itself slowly after a certain time without damage. If you are playing on the hard difficulty, your shield will not fully recover and the more hits you take, the lower your ability to fix your shield becomes. There are no lives and if you die you will simply be thrown back to the nearest checkpoint. There is also an “Ex attack” which allows you to damage every enemy around you and to become invulnerable for a while. Fully locking on to and enemy with your missiles and press that button unleashes an ultimate attack. Ex attacks can be recharged faster by blocking projectiles with your blade.\n\nGraphics in Astebreed is not impressive technically, but the artstyle is amazing and makes this game very cool to look at. It is full of color and the environments are varied. You go from the Ocean, to space and inside a giant station to name a few. You would expect everything to be black and gray in those last two areas but Astebreed just has a certain style that you can't help but love. Some cutscenes are hand drawn and anime style. These are nice to look at though they do break the flow of the game. I can't say if the voice acting is any good since I don't speak Japanese but the quality of whatever they used to record the voices sounds pretty low budget and scratchy at times. Music on the other hand is decent and fits into the game perfectly.\n\nOverall this is a pretty good game with a decent amount of content to look at in the extras menu. After beating it you can start off with the mech that you unlock late game, which is a nice addition. It does have a few problems like the targeting when the boss goes far behind you, which can be very hard to aim it precisely where you want it before it's on the move again. Another problem is the teleport feature that needs to be refined a bit, as well as allowing it to be mapped to a different key, instead of having to hold down the melee for a few seconds which makes it very hard to use when you need it most. Other than those problems this is a very well made and fun game. The big focus on story is an oddity for these types of games and helps carve out it's own identity. Astebreed is highly recommended to those looking for a twist on the genre or are simply looking for a good shoot em up.","June 18, 2015","true","3.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","1"

This game like all shorter games have replay value. The replay values can range depending if a person wants to challenge a harder difficulty or not. The gameplay is seemingly simple and it brings a lot of fun. The art is pretty amazing especially the scenes that are not during a fight. As this has controller support, I greatly enjoyed playing this game on a controller. Though it was short, I felt that it had a complete story. The sound and the voice actors were pretty good. A game that is different from most steam games would make this a fresh experience for new players.

Edelweiss doesn't disappoint again.  Easily one of my favorite shmups although fans of more hardcore 'bullet hells' might find it a bit easy/forgiving.  Haven't tried on the hardest difficulty yet so maybe that changes this.  Really fun combat system and the changing perspectives (similar to Ethor Vapor) are done very well to make the beautiful and cinematic stages even more so.  Only gripe people may have is the brevity of the game, though it's understandable as a doujin game that follows in the style of classic arcade shmups.

More than just your usually shooter. A masterpiece put into the design of the gameplay. Using the works of scenery, the functions of the blade are a definite plus considering the mecha unit. On this game, you will like many other shooters face many bosses. However there is indeed a plot line. A 9.7/10. 10/10 if there was more to the story and building it up, sure we cannot connect pieces together but this work was amazing. However my money is not wasted on this game. It provides excellent fun. If you take the time to enjoy a game for graphics, gameplay, and some story. This one has promise, can be one of the next best arcade games. However I must say that the models shown within the gallery, the storyline, the development all seemed to have a correlative ease. Although at stages there are parts we want to read, they also can distract. However this game really gives us the Bullet hell feel with a little slash and dash along the way. If you are thinking of purchasing this, I do recommend it. I was addicted on my first run that I simply had to do it again just to be sure.","August 17, 2014","true","1.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

And the reasons for that are:\n\n1. Appealing to all kinds of players. You only have one life per continue, yeah, but you actually have a life bar with life regen. You can destroy purple and yellow bullets and also missiles. And even so, the game proves to be a challenge. Regarding the perspective switches, they are smooth here, you never feel like the game changing your perspective is something out of the blue.\n\n2. It has an understandable story. One may not be able to read all the dialogue throughout the game because of the intense firing, slashing and dodging, but if the dialogue between chapters and during parts that you can actually take a breath don't make it clear, the lore section that is unlocked once you beat the game certainly will.\n\n3. The soundtrack is very well made and it matches the theme of the game.\n\n4. The voice acting is great. I am a complete sucker for Japanese voice acting, and after knowing who voices who in Astebreed I must say I was very surprised. I didn't know a single name among the voice actors, and they pull off some performances that might be as good as the most popular Japanese VAs out there. Special mention goes to Hiro Sakurase, who voices the twin sisters Fiona Nono and Estina Nono.\n\n5. It simply looks dazzling. The animations, the stage backgrounds, all the mecha, the character designs... And the best part, you are treated to a gallery full of all those mecha models and character artwork / concept art once you beat the game!\n\nIf I have to list the drawbacks of this game, it'd be one crash problem and two nitpicks that I don't mind, but some people might.\n\n1. This game is much better experienced if you have a controller to play it.\n2. It's less than an hour long for you to beat the game.\n\nThe crash problem mentioned above is with the 5.1ch surround sound channel. The game might crash during certain parts if you are playing with that on, and there's a specific point in the Prologue where your game may crash because of that. The solution to that is skipping the prologue and switching it to 2.0 Stereo sound. You can then replay the prologue for the achievement and enjoy the rest of the game.\n\nThis game went on sale at the time I wrote this. Even so, I don't regret buying it full price. If you enjoy the genre and can overlook the drawbacks, you should give Astebreed a try, And you certainly won't regret it.","November 27, 2015","true","101.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

I was already totally hyped about this one, since I love shmups and played other edelweiss productions already, I knew this will not turn out badly.\n\nSo first what makes it different than other shmups, you have a f*** big sword. It was the first shmups I played where you fight close combat.\nAt the beginning I was a little disoriented because most danmakus/bullet hell you have to evade the bullets, so every new game mechanic which involve you to "absorb" bullets makes the gameplay really interesting.\nIn addition I dislike the limited continue system in other shmups, these were acceptable in the arcade era but not nowadayws so I prefer the checkpoint system, where you can instant starts over.\nAnd even the story feels great, ok nothing more then the standard cliche anime but who cares, I like the ending, I like the characters (awesome seiyuu) and since it is mostly a highscore/gameplay-driven game it is a nice extra.\n\nWhat is left to say, actually I only finished this in easy mode (yet) because I struggle on my first try at normal which is great, because at first I did not understand the score/health system and in my opinion shmups have to be difficult. If I could finish a shmups on first try in normal something is definetly wrong. So for people who say it is short and do not have enough content, this is not a game made for them, you have to set you own goal and play it over and over until you beat the next stage, get higher score, no damage etc.\nPlay this game one or two hour, get better with every run until finally beat the stage and this will be the most satisfying game moment ever, at least for me.","August 8, 2014","true","3.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

First off, it's borderline bullet hell. Yes, the whole screen is going to be covered in flashing red, blue and purple lights the entire game. Yes, you're going to have really stupid boss fights with multiple forms. Yes, when you die on the last form, you have to start back at form 1 and work all the way back to the final form only to die yet again. If you're not immediately put off by these design choices, you should keep an eye on Astebreed.\n\nTruth be told, Astebreed isn't very hard by bullet hell standards. I'm God-awful at these games and I made it to the second to last boss on Normal without dying a single time. The story is one of the best ways Astebreed sinks its hooks into you.

Most shmps I've played in the past just leave you focused in one orientation: vertical, horizontal and occasionally straight ahead. This game just decides to make use of all of them, swapping from view style to view style on the fly.\n\nStory wise, it's just your standard mecha anime stuffs for the most part. Not bad but not really ground breaking either so it won't hinder you wanting to play the game.\n\nThe mech you pilot makes uses of a collection of energy bits that you can lock on to multiple targets or to just bombard the hell out of just one. Along with that you have the standard lasers that have straight fire and spray mode unless you've focused all off said bits onto a target; they return after a few seconds or after the target's destruction. Last but not least you can't have a giant robot without a sword to slice up stuff.\n\nLast thing is the matter of super attacks that shmups tend to have. The more destruction to cause, the quicker the gauge refills for the attacks which vary between an energy field and a lock on based homing slash attack, carving through multiple targets ^_^\n\nOverall an entertaining lil' game for mecha fans and thoses looking for not so bullet hell-ish shmups.","June 27, 2014","true","15.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That being said, this is quite frankly one of the best games of the genre I've ever played. The difficulty scaling is perfect, slowly advancing from "this is pretty easy" to "Oh my god how am I not dead yet?". The story was interesting too. You only get very small chunks but it's enough to work on in my opinion without bogging the game down.\n\nGameplay is what you'd expect from this sort of thing. There are like, infinity enemies that you shoot on the way to the boss. Camera angles change dynamically to make things interesting (but in a logical, controlled manner so it's not like you're going to get killed while you can't see or anything) and the visuals are very pretty.\n\nThis game seems like it's accessible to newbies to the bullet hell shooters but it's also challenging enough for veterans. For example, you have regenerating health and bombs. It means that you're not going to get a game over because you accidentally got shot 5 times in one stage but it certainly doesn't mean the game is easy. HP recovers slowly so it's less about "don't get hit, ever" and more about "you are currently in the middle of a rain of bullets and you are probably going to die if you don't do something about it"\n\nThere are several options for not dying, such as activating EX attacks (Similar to bombs from other games). You can even destroy certain projectiles, clearing part of the screen.\n\nEven if you don't like bullet hells I'd recommend this game, it's something even someone terrible at the genre as me enjoyed.","June 29, 2014","true","6.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The sword dash escapes, ex attacks, and destroyable bullets makes the game much more organic in it's action flow compared to traditional SHUMPs like Raiden or Touhou. It's by far my best purchase this steam sale.\n\nVisuals are absolutly beautiful and the soundtrack is catchy.

Many games these days don’t offer the incentives to replay that Astebreed does and I wonder if gamers will recognise the depth on show here.

That said, Astebreed won't forgive you if you let your guard down, especially within the last half of the game (and without remorse on Hard).\n\nOne of the most notable things about this game is how many enemies there are-- not so much in number of styles, but in sheer quantities. The number of cannon fodder enemies that appear starts out already high, and steadily rises as you progress. It might seem like a swarm of (at least early on) docile, non-colliding foes could be a breeze to handle, but when you need to aim or lock-on enough at the extremely hostile foes hiding amidst the clouds of mooks-- or especially if you choose to aim for a High Score and can't seem to keep up with their endless numbers-- you will find them just as much of a risk as the targets firing all their rockets from behind it all.\n\nI will be frank, this game is not for everyone. It's usual price combined with the duration of the storymode may rub some the wrong way. It best with a controller, and the story can be hard to follow--not for lack of cohesive plot, but for it's all Japanese audio leaving the translated text as the only means to follow along (and it's none too easy to read with 100 other things to focus on). Additionally, though I'm none too sure if it wasn't just a lag-based fluke, in one or two rare moments some of the dialogue text had issues with it's timing, transitioning too soon or slowly, or skipping a line entirely (though it is forgivable in that you can piece together whats missed via intuiton).\n\nThat said, for those who do enjoy quick and frantic gameplay with a fair number of options in combating unending enemy hordes, who like beautifully rendered CG environments and some fairly enjoyable and fitting background musics, or just love SHMUPS in general, then this would be a must-have for the collection.","June 6, 2014","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can of course destroy all of them, with just four simple tools.\n\nAstebreed has 5 weapons to the players disposal, each can be used in various ways to destroy the attacking Filunes.\n\nFirst off is the Scatter shot, which fires bullets in a wide arc infront of the player designed to blanket the screen in a flurry of bullets, effective against largest filunes and tight clusters of fast moving enemies\n\nThe second type of bullet is the focus shot, it fires a hail of bullets in a tight straight line directly in front of you, you lose a bit of maneuverability doing this, but the bullets as a whole pack a whole lot more punch. Great for doing some tight focused damage or obliterating a line of enemies travelling in one direction.\n\nThe third attack is the Blade Attack, to put it simply you attack with the equipped blade, this cuts through most enemies with ease and also cuts bullets clean in half, find yourself in a tight situation with a hail of bullets incoming, simply cut your way right through them and keep on going. The blade attack also has an innate dash attack which can cut your way through large amounts of enemies in a straight line, but leaves you vulnerable at the end.\n\nThe lucis system of your mech can also lockon to enemies in a straight line or 'neutral lockon' by holding the scatter shot or focus shot keys. This allows a hail of 'lucis particles' (not even sure what they're called) to chase enemies (even off screen!) and destroy them for you. You can also use the blade attack instead to do a deadly multi blade dash attack that will attack all locked on enemies on screen.\n\nIts important to note that even though you can cut through enemy bullet patterns, this game is by no means easy, its still just as difficult as this genre is famous for.\n\nThe final attack and probably one of the most important is the Ex Attack, which charges relatively quickly and is your 'get out of jail free card' it activates the lucis shield system and makes you completely immune to all attacks for 3-4 seconds.  Great for smashing through seemingly undodgeable patterns.\n\nEnemies will generally fire four types of bullets, Energy balls which can be destroyed by your own mechs scatter or focus shot, yellow bullets which can only be cut, and the dreaded red beam bullets, which can't be cut or shot (these must be avoided at all costs!) Red beam bullets have poor tracking and homing. Movement is key. They're a few other types of shots, but most others are unique to certain types of enemies.\n\nAstebreed features a tutorial and 3 levels of difficulty with varying enemy patterns in each one, so you'll be able to have fun with each difficulty you attempt, knowing you'll get a different game each time!\n\nThe game is relatively short and can be beaten in a single sitting (50minutes to 1hr) but features extremely high replayability in the form of difficult achievements and online leaderboards to aim for.\n\nOverall this game I highly recommend for those wanting to play a shmup that is both unique, different and challenging.\n\nMy only complaint is the story is rather lacklustre (its not really explained very well) and features many bad anime sci-fi tropes. The backgrounds can get REALLY distracting. Theres a scene in chapter 3 where you have to destroy an entire enemy fleet. They're bullets, missiles from the ships, lasers, enemies flying everywhere, Its sometimes way too much to focus on.\n\nI give it a 8/10. Beautiful HD graphics and mechanics show this genre is not running out of ideas and will continue to live on.","June 19, 2014","true","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Astebreed has some actual depth to its gameplay, with many different ways to approach a situation, be it to sit back and use your guns, use the lock on bit system, or go in close with the giant sword, you get more than enough variety to use these attacks.\n\nThe game also takes a nod from probably some of the best shmups, most noticeably Ikaruga and Radiant Silvergun.  Using the blade attack, you can destroy certain types of enemy fire, and absorb them to release your EX attack, which also changes based off of your playstyle.\n\nThe story is pretty forgettable, its your standard robot anime plot, with crazy AIs and all.  Unless you're really into it, it probably won't be very important (you can get an achievement for skipping cutscenes, so if you hate it that much, there's a bonus to it I guess?).  tl;dr humanity fights overwhelming odds and bets it all on a super mega robot that has a rogue alien AI and stuff.

It's a great addition to the genre, with very little negative to say about it.\n\nThe gameplay is fast paced, action packed, and chaotic. The game on normal isn't very difficult, the challenge comes from trying to get the highest score possible. Astebreed is a game that's made from the gameplay, and is one of my favorites in the genre.\n\nThe story was a bit hard for me to enjoy, because I found myself hardly able to read the subtitles. That being said, if you're playing this for the story, you're doing it wrong.

There's plenty of replay value, but if you're the type of person to play the game once and be done with it, I wouldn't pay full price for it. You may only get about 2 hours of entertainment. Also to note, the game runs well, but it randomly crashed near the end, and I had to restart from the beginning.\n\nIt's a great game, well worthy of it's current metacritic score.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkfatalknight/recommended/283680/","darkfatalknight","Gilliam Bojangles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkfatalknight/","139 products in account","Astebreed is a good mecha shoot'em up game that has a reasonable amount of content and one of the first I have played. The gameplay is pretty fun and it's easy to learn the basics even without the guidance of optional tutorials. In combat, you have plenty of options like simply shooting bullets, lock on enemies to shoot them with bullets, cut your way through with a powerful blade, and heck using a quick short insurmountable blade dash. Although the story isn't so amazing, the fact that most of the dialogue is spoken during the game can become an annoyance since you have to focus on destroying your enemies but sometimes you may feel the need to read the English subtitles (dialogue is in Japanese only) and that may be a bother (not so much for me personally). The dialogue is not terrible though, the voice actors did a good job voicing each character. Another thing that must be noted is that once you start the game, you have to finish it completely because you cannot load from where you left off. However, there is a Chapter Select option that allows you to play chapters you have at least completed but if you care about certain achievements then you would have to stick to playing the game in one go. You can play the game on Easy, Normal, or Hard but be warned that Hard mode is really challenging (I tried and failed miserably). One last letdown is that the game is rather short, I was able to beat the game in about an hour and I really wished there was more to play.\n\nDespite the negatives, Astebreed is still a good game to try out. Aside from the great gameplay, the art done in this game is great. Speaking of art, this game offers extras that allow you to see in-game art, concept art, 3-D mecha art, and more. The characters in the game are tolerable and you can also know more about them in the extras along with pretty much anything. To me, the price seems a little reasonable considering what the game offers so if you're a fan of shoot'em ups, mecha, and anime then I would definitely recommend picking this game up. Before I wrap up this review, I also highly recommend using a controller to play the game.\n\nThat concludes my review on Astebreed, looking forward to hopefully seeing more of this game in the future.\n\n","January 8, 2015","true","24.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The most gorgeous art you'll see in the genre, A dynamic camera that deploys three distinct vantage points in a constant state of ebb and flow. Throughout the campaign, the perspective shifts seamlessly between horizontal, vertical, and over-the-shoulder angles that go a long way to craft a resplendent visual showcase. The voicework, while well acted, is delivered solely in Japanese, although your eyes will frequently be too preoccupied with bullets to bother reading text. The game checkpoints between and during levels, ensuring that players can tackle tricky sections until they figure it out. Your mech is equipped with several cannons that can dispense justice in a myriad of ways. The standard attacks include a concentrated stream of bullets and a spread shot, each of which can be charged up to deliver a homing attack that will help Eleminate enemies for a limited time, and give you some   manuvering room.  Dujinsoft studio Edelweiss accomplishes just about everything it sets out out to do with Astebreed. It's inventive, beautiful, and absorbing. The music is catchy and perfectly fitting. I have no major complaints, really. It's an endearing experience from start to finish, one that I look forward to enjoying again and again...","May 31, 2014","true","11.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

Astabreed however feels strange.\n\nThere are things I like and things I dont like. First comes the main menu and settings where you choose from 8 different resolutions but there are no 1680x1050, so I played 1600x900 windowed mode.\n\nSword fighting is fun and looks awesome, it's so much better than on Radiant Silvergun. However at many times I got a feeling I'm not in control of the game and just button smashing. There are so much fast enemies in the background (where you cant shoot, but can lock-on) and on same level you are and can shoot, that you dont understand what is happening. In Ikaruga you saw the enemy and could move to position to shoot, but not in this game. Try to lock-on something, use sword for incoming bullets and button smash. I didnt like sudden changes on 2D to 3D. It wasnt cool and its hard to see distance, not that it matters since you just lock-on things in 3D. I think 2D is the best for shmups.\n\nGraphics are great and it feels good to play modern looking shmup. Story telling is funny and I have no idea what is the story, because it happens on radio conversations when I play. There really is no time to watch bottom of my screen where english subtitles are for japanese speaking. I literally lolled out loud when at some point cut scene showed anime clip and I had no idea what was happening. I dont think this is bad thing, it's just very funny to put story going same time when you are playing extremely fast game.\n\nAlmost forgot the chapter select in main menu, so you dont have to start right at the beginning everytime.\n\nFinal verdict: I cant deal with the fact I'm not in charge of the game, like I am on Ikaruga and Radiant Silvergun. This is not crap, but not excellent either. This review probably gets many down votes because of this, but I cannot recommend this game, 2/5. If you like button smashing and exploding enemies this is 4/5 for you.\n\nTL;DR:\n+Graphics\n+Sword\n+Chapter select\n+Funny story telling\n\n-I'm not on control of the game (button smashing)\n-Too fast enemies and I'm too slow\n-Too much happening at the same time\n-3D gameplay","October 5, 2014","false","3.0"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","20","38","0","0"

I went into the game expecting this to be a bullet hell but instead found a traditional shoot-em-up with health points.\n\nYou'd think with the large amount of bullets, the law of bullet hells apply (you can evade bullets), but the truth is, you have an attack that destroy bullets. However, it has tons of recovery and you lose mobility to evade other bullets. Good thing this isn't a bullet hell game.\n\nThe controls for teleporting is a little bit sluggish. Sometimes, I activate it accidentally but I've never done it on purpose. I can see many attack patterns where it would have been very useful. I wish they put the teleport into its own button.\n\nGameplay wise, its solid. The graphics is beautiful. The controls are not perfect. The story is average at best.\n\nAs for difficulty, I've finished the game in 2 hours. Its not that hard EXCEPT for the last boss. The last boss is divided into three parts and its difficulty reaches SNK-hard difficulty even in Normal. I'm sure there's a pattern that can be exploited but because of the sheer amount of particle effects, lack of feedback if you got hit or graze an attack, and large amount of recovery from blade attacks, its hard to get into position where you won't get hit.\n\nAt the easiest difficulty (with cutscene skipping), I finished the game in roughly 33mins.\n\nSummary: Don't expect this game to be bullet hell. Its a shoot-em-up that pretends to be one. Its a short game, but the production value is well worth the money.","August 15, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Nice gameplay mechanics, easily responsive, and stunning graphics. The level design (how stages are projected) is just amazing, really, really amazing! The background and weather smoothly change as well as the camera and so on, in short: versatile. Music is also great. The story, characters and dialogues are a big plus too, especially the pretty entertaining dialogues. Totally recommended; also, no bugs, no weird stuff, you can play on controller, customizing the keys in game.\n\nPortuguês: Ótimo jogo, parece uma mistura de hack n slash com shooter, com uma boa dose de estratégia, já que o jogo não se resume em apertar somente um botão: é necessário saber que tipo de ataque é melhor para cada situação; garanto que, para um shooter, esse jogo oferece uma boa variedade de ataques. Ótima mecânica de jogo, com uma resposta rápida aos comandos, e gráficos muito bonitos. O level design (como as fases são projetadas) é muito bom também! O fundo das fases e as condições climáticas mudam de maneira fluída, assm como a câmera e mais, resumindo: versátil. A trilha sonora é boa.

The developers clearly put in a ton of effort to create a well-polished game accessible to as wide an audience as possible.\n\nThe first thing to note is that this game is far more forgiving than your typical bullet hell shmup, which is great for people like me who tend to be terrible at that genre.  While many shmups involve a tiny hitbox and a ton of finesse in movement alone, Astebreed gives you a shield which recharges after not being hit for a few seconds.  This might be a turn-off to hardcore fans of the genre, but I would argue that Astebreed still manages to keep things interesting in its own ways, while also being more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nAstebreed features dynamic gameplay switching between top-down, horizontal, and behind-your-mech perspectives throughout the game.  In terms of attacks, you have two types of normal shots (spread and focused), which each have a unique charge/lock-on mechanism, and you have a sword with close-range and dash attacks.\n\nThe game is equipped with an introduction section and a set of tutorials to get you fully up-to-speed on the various mechanics, including how scoring works.\n\nIn terms of playthrough length, you're looking at around an hour (and that's if you don't skip cutscenes), but that's not terribly unusual for the genre.  In terms of replayability, the game has multiple difficulty settings and mechs, and naturally there are leaderboards for each stage and total score.","June 1, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

In normal difficulty you can go up to level 5 boss just by using the sword  and without dying (there are 6 levels total). i rate it 05/10 and this comes from someone who is playing shmup's from the 80's till today.\n\nPROS:\n-nice music\n-cool mechs\n-nice graphics (models look descent)\n-change of paste (views) keep things interesting (but 90% of the time you will fight either vertical or horizontal)\n-no bugs or crashes. everything runs smooth.\n\nCONS:\n-button mashing\n-difficulty (only the last boss deserves your time). HARD is ok but still no much skill is required. only the last 2 bosses require some practise.\n-confusing gameplay (bullets and enemies will come at you very fast and you cant react. you can only use your melee attack). even if they hit you, you still have enough health (health is regenerating at normal difficulty) to beat the level.\n- story is hard to follow during gameplay\n-you can beat some bosses just by melee attacking them and ignore their attacks (level 5 boss, level 4 boss)\n-expesive at 15 euro (current steam price)\n-repeating environments(the backgrounds will repeat themselves or cover their limitations with tricks (level 2 breaks the monotony by letting you fight in space for only 30 seconds. prologue has the same background as level 5 etc..)\n\nSCORE: 05/10\n\nBUY ONLY AT DISCOUNT JUST TO TRY IT.

The first couple of levels lack anything too dangerous, which is great because it gives a player time to test/get accustomed to the controls, and if you got kids they can usually get through the first 2 or 3 stages and have alot of fun before the harder stuff smashes them.\n\nPros:\n- Full of colors and lights, very appealing graphically.\n- Plays like a classic but alternates between views, which helps to keep things interesting.\n\nCons:\n- Menu interface can be a bit unclear (Possible it was translated?) when first using and is a little clunky.\n- Controller support is only partial. Having to click through menus with arrow keys and enter, then pick your controller back up is a pain.\n- Unless you've gotten used to the controls and perhaps even if you have, the game difficulty curves sharply after the first couple of levels. Mostly this is not a bad thing, but on a first playthrough when you go from being able to spam butttons or play around, to getting stuck in middle of multiple laser beams, that you have to flicker/boost through not to get hit/die,  can seem a bit nuts.","October 15, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is technically very basic and the story is told mostly through the dialogue (so if you only speak English you will probably be mashing buttons while you read the text), there is no customization, minimal variability in terms of actions and simple projectile mechanics (can be blocked, and can't be blocked). This however isn't a complaint as it makes the game more accessible and although definitely on the easier side, for even novice gamers the experience is not diminished. The game offers first and formost impressive visuals, both models, backgrounds and cutscenes for its genre. The combat takes place in a variety of styles (top down-, behind-, third person views), that all mesh together nicely unlike some games where it seems forced. These mechanics add to the immersion along with the winding environments and dramatic pauses done by the camera and mech making everything one cohesive experience.\n\nThe story is moderately good although relatively vague, it leaves much to the imagination and seems rushed, mostly in terms of execution. Its not often one desires more padding, but they could have easily through in some generic missions to stretch out the experience. That is really the only gripe with the game, that it is too short, and within 2 and a half hours you will be done and wanting more. Its a solid ride and is on par with playing through a cinematic experience/movie, but it needed more content. Overall a full recommend for fans of the genre and the uninitiated alike.","January 24, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Noxcaleum/recommended/283680/","Noxcaleum","Salth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Noxcaleum/","97 products in account","If I was to recommend any game to a fan of Bullet Hell games, or SHMUP' in general; my first choice would most definetly be Astebreed.\n\nThere's something about this game that instantly clicks; and it does so many things right that there are very few flaws if any at all; and below I'm going to tell you everything there is to love about this game.\n\n1. The camera; initially it might feel a bit jarring seeing it pan and zoom at various intervals but the good thing about this is that it does so in a flawless and seamless manner that it never really becomes an issue; there's the standard top/down view, a side-scrolling view and a rather well done third person view which alternate between set sections to really give a bigger impact instead of sticking with just one camera view. It's this concept that makes Astebreed unique and gives it that kick to make it stand out.\n\n2. The graphics; Graphic wise, most Bullet Hell games tend to stick with the 2D format, pixels on a moving, otherwise repeated background yet that isn't the case here. The graphics are some of the best I've seen from an indie game; they're smooth, clean and incredibly crisp and despite all the madness that goes on screen, it doesn't deter you away at all; you can always see where your ship is, and most importantly the backgrounds are eye-dazzling; each one changing from the next although it implements heavy sci-fi elements AKA flying robots of various sizes there's always a new design for each enemy you come across be it big or small although certain enemies are more visually appealing than the rest each of them has something unique to them.\n\n3. The Story: This is, something of a hit and miss but what this game does is actually make a damn good attempt at actually telling a story amidst the carnage. Essentially, you are a Rookie pilot sent on a mission to finally end a Galatic war between mankind, and the Filune; a race of alien creatures that; for reasons unknown is hellbent on wiping humans from extinction. I won't go into too much detail, but it's surprising how good the story is even if it's a little cliche. The characters interact with each-other constantly, giving advice or being a general nuisance and the voice acting to go with it is some of the best I've heard; despite the fact that it's in Japanese only. The only flaw to go with this though, is that you can't really pay attention to what the characters are saying, unless you know Japanese; if not you most likely won't have time to pay attention to the subtitles at the bottom left corner amidst all the shooting and dodging you'll be doing, this is just a very minor flaw though.\n\n4. The Music; ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic, is a good term for this. Granted, Bullet Hell games have always had catchy music; whilst not the most memorable Astebreed has a soundtrack that suits perfectly with each stage and boss encounter. There's always a set tone whether it's a more upbeat tone for the initial stage or something more desperate for the stage bosses; the most enjoyable one for me is the entirety of the stage 5 theme, which I personally believe would've suited the final boss better but that's just me.\n\nAs of writing this review; I've put plenty of time into this game; despite what the hours say. If I ever want to keep myself occupied and entertained without really getting bored I'll boot up this game and waste a few hours blowing things up like a complete lunatic; and there's nothing wrong with that. This is the sort of game designed to keep you hooked for hours on end, whether you play it casually, or if you're like me prefer to beat all the high scores in the game and top the Leaderboards for bragging rights.\n\nIf you've ever got the time, and the money to spare; give this game a try; you most certainly won't regret it.","March 18, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I suppose the need to be efficient, deadly and flawless just doesn't sit well with western gamers. Astebreed does it's best to rectify that with a few key changes to the shmup format that make it a lot more accesible.\n\nDon't take accessibility as meaning the game is easy. If you cannot learn to adapt, the last boss will destroy you (FINALLY! A game where the last boss is the hardest thing in the game). Instead of just throwing endless enemies at you and expecting you to figure it out, the game features a rather in-depth tutorial mode.\n\nAstebreed also has regenerating health. While that may seem pointless, it works wonders for getting out of tough situations. There are also specific enemy shots that one can only dodge with good, old fashion reflexes. Astebreed gives the player some different projectiles and a sword; this sword can dodge any attack that is yellow.\n\nWhen you encounter a red shot, you have to dodge. There is more than one way to accomplish said dodge, but you still need to get out of the way. You cannot simply spam your way through this game (I tried in a few spots, so I know!). For as much as can happen at one moment on screen, the game still feels entirely in your control.\n\nThere is also a pretty interesting story, even if it's a bit short. The game can be finished within a few hours, but the cool anime style and constant dialogue make the journey worth it. Once the campaign is over, you get harder difficulties, different ships and the ability to check out a gallery full of artwork and 3D models.\n\nFor the casual gamer, just skip this. Astebreed could be a jumping off point into Shmups for you, but it doesn't possess a huge amount of content. For anyone else interested, buy the game. It's well worth the price.\n\n8/10","January 1, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So it's a schizofrenic mix of a top-down/sideways/tunnel shooter.\n\nThe story and theme is what I reckon can be described as manga, which I'm entirely unfamiliar with. To me it just came of as hysterical japanese kids yelling constantly, so I turned off all the in-game dialogue and skipped as many animated cutscenes as possible.\n\nThe gameplay itself is really solid (I used a 360 controller) - you have two projectile fires modes: Spread and focused. Additionally, you have a close range/melee kind of sword attack, and the ability to gradually lock some sort of homing nanomites onto your enemies. The longer you hold the lock-on button, the more nanomites (theres a limit though) will eventually fly towards the targeted hostiles and slowly damage them over time. The lock-on mechanism also comes in two modes - either a far reaching tight cone, or a short ranged sphere.\n\nThe action is VERY hectic - there can be an overwhelming amount of enemies shooting an even larger amount of projectiles against you. Hats off to the rendering engine though - the framerate never once dipped below 60fps on my nVidia 780 despite an obscene amount of transparent objects were plastered all over the screen.\n\nImo, there's simply too much going on. I would've prefered half as muh stuff to avoid, but having it do double damage. It's often absolutely impossible to avoid getting hit. I'm more into the good ole 1942 kinda shooter where 1 bullet killed you. You end up being a little too indifferent to your enemies attacks when you can pretty much endure to wade on through a rain of bullets. Unfortuneately theres a friggin' monsoon of them, so you can still die.\n\nThe graphics are very good - very colourful and polished, but the "cutscenes" made with the game engine are so poorly directed they often made me wonder wtf I just saw.\n\nI'm sad to admit that beating the end-game boss on normal difficulty proved too hard for me, and the motivation to keep at it too low. But the third try on easy was a success :)\n\n70%","April 10, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's so cliche, even if you didn't read any of the conversation, you can still make out what's happening.\n\nThe story itself has it's redeeming moment, but only a few. Very few. No backstory or anything, so you might as well forget about the characters.\n\nIf you're in for the mecha danmaku gameplay, buy this one.\n\nThe gameplay is really interesting. It's basically the best part of the game, and it's clear that the developer puts a lot more time in developing the gameplay. And the result is pretty satisfying. The need to alternate between attack and behaviour towards bullet is really fun and challenging to play with. So far i'm liking the gameplay, and would replay it again for some more.\n\nThe graphics is top notch.\n\nNot much to comment on, but the mecha detail, the animation is fluid and smooth, and the enemies movement are beautiful to look at. The background is sometimes forgetable, but the background is also done beautifully.\n\nThe sound isn't bad either.\n\nSoundtrack and voice acting is pretty well done. The BGM doesn't get boring, even after retrying the stage several time, and the variety between the stage's BGM is there, so it's a plus. The voice acting doesn't do much justice, but with the several lines there is, it's pretty good. You can feel the emotion in each lines, save for the few.\n\nNow you might be wondering why i didn't recommend this game.\n\nSimple.\n\nThe story, which is almost practically guessable and non-existent\n\nand\n\nThe difficulty spike.\n\nI'm no stranger to this type of game, but this is almost unforgiveable. You're practically cruising from stage 1-5, and when the stage 5 boss final form came out, you can be guaranteed to retry at least a few times. It would be better if each stage bosses poses much more difficulty than that, so when the boss came out, you can at least expect it.\n\nAnd don't get me started on stage 6. Unlike several danmaku game, this game doesn't have the grazing system. Well it's technically there, but only a small bit. Therefore your hitbox is pretty big, making the boss i mentioned pretty hard.\n\nThis might be me complaining because i can't beat it, but if you look at the youtube video, you can see the spikes.\n\nAll in all, i wouldn't recommend this to anyone new to this genre, or who's into the story, but if you're into mecha and shooters, shoot ahead.","August 24, 2015","false","1.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Yes the game is only 15 dollars, but it's literally only got 6 or 7 missions that take a few minutes each. only reason it took me so long was because one or two bosses are really annoying and the ability of the sword to destroy incoming projectiles is... inconsistant sometimes.\n\nAnother really annoying thing is the story is fast and feels rushed, there is almost no downtime whatsoever, there's almost nothing between missions, you just start the next one and "BOOM SOMETHING IMPORTANT" finish mission MORE IMPORTANT STUFF and then MORE IMPORTANT STUFF DURING BOSS, the story is told via small chat boxes in the bottom left corner, which is both good because it doesn't get in the way of gameplay, but that also makes it really annoying, as i was honestly interested in the story, and i ended just spamming an invincibility move going back and forth accross the screen while reading the tiny chat boxes and ended up finishing half of the levels that way without even paying attention. Especially with how much i tried to understand what was going on, the fact that they just kept throwing plot at you constantly with almost no break, in the middle of trying to dodge bullets in an incredibly short game made it feel even shorter than it already is.\n\nA huge gripe of mine is the 'hyper' move as well, it's really cool to have a screen clearing attack, or to be able to target melee everything you've locked onto, yet about 1/3d the time, the move doesn't work for me. I even went through the tutorial 5 times and still can't figure out what's up. I would love the 'screen clearing bullet shield' swipe to be it's own button while the lock on attack was independant, because very often in some of the bosses, you pratically have to use the lock on, but want to use the shield just to survive. It doesn't help that the blade's ability to deflect projectiles is occationally very sketchy, i can do the same thing against a boss 3 times and twice take no damage and the third die in under 10 seconds.\n\nThough i have a lot of little gripes with this game, it is still very well put together and if you want just a fairly cheap, very good looking game, i'd recommend picking it up, but i don't think it's worth it's short length to the average player. I recommend anyone who really wants a challenge to play the game once on easy mode and just read the story, then immediately switch to hard mode and go from there. Just consider easy mode a slightly longer tutorial with some interesting, if not cliche'd story. and hard mode the actual game","April 18","false","3.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

The result is a cluster♥♥♥♥ of projectiles and enemies coming from different angles and depths in which you aren't sure what is going to hit you, what is away from you, what you can hit and what is out of your reach.\n\nInterestingly enough, it's simultaneously too hard (for the reasons I described) and too easy, because despite feeling like I lacked any control of the situation on the screen, the ship's shields are so ludicrously forgiving that you can power through the game's horribly confusing design as long as you keep spamming your homing attacks, sword slashes and EX attacks.\n\nIt's not a completely terrible game but there are so many better games out there that I find it difficult to sit through this game and ignore its glaring flaws.

Effects and bullets are flashy enough without detracting from the gameplay.  Which is good since so many SHMUPs these days tend to forget this distinction.  The weapons all look nice, but in gameplay don't tend to be very interesting.  Bullets of two spreads, lockon of two varieties, and finally a sword.  Scoring in the game is building up multipliers while not getting hit with the bullet weapons then 'cashing out' the multiplier using the sword on high value targets or a cluster of enemies.\n\nBAD\n\nIt's easy.  RIDICULOUSLY EASY.  I didn't die a single time up until the final boss.  I can't say I'm a fan of the health bar nor its regenerating nature.  If bullets were more of a threat perhaps but your mech is able to tank bullets on top of being a very small target.  There's no interesting bullet patterns that make you think of how you want to avoid them, it's either slashing yellow bullets with your sword and spamming your EX-attack which acts like a bomb (Which also grants you a shield against bullets for a few seconds), or moving back and forth slightly to avoid the predictable bullets.  With all this in mind there isn't much to improve on in multiple playthroughs.  The game is also pretty short even for a SHMUP.  A higher difficulty option is unlockable, but doesn't seem to change much aside from preventing full regeneration after a hit and slightly tougher enemies.\n\nFinally... the Story.  Not only is it terribly cliche, but I feel that it actually detracts from the gameplay.  SHMUPs are not a good medium for telling a story and here's why.  The adrenline is pumping after you beat a boss then you get interupted by a long cutscene.  It's not good design to do this in this genre because you're meant to beat the game in one action filled sitting.  It's not as action filled if half of the time is spent in dialog and cutscenes.  If they were shorter or skippable (Which also detracts from replayability) it would be less of an issue.  This all wouldn't be quite so much of a problem if the story was actually any good.  Power of friendship, magic mechs with the ability to fight the previously invincible enemy forces, corruption and betrayal.  It's a laundry list of anime cliches.","August 12, 2014","false","3.4"," 31 of 65 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","31","65","0","6"

But seriously.  This game made pretty much no sense plot and gameplay wise.  That last boss was really annoying on normal difficulty at least.  Why didn't they utilize the second stick of the Xbox controller so you could aim your area of homing attacks instead of having to fly into their line of fire to get a lock on them.  Why can't you turn around in that last fight when the final boss gets behind you?  You do that in another fight in the game, why not then?  Also, the game took me an hour and a half to beat on normal and I stopped half way through because I realized I was playing on easy mode and it was too easy and I also died a lot.

Instead of the slow, intense patterns of well telegraphed bullets the genre is famous for, Astebreed simply spams the screen with huge numbers of bullets and enemies. The patterns change so quickly and the enemies and bullets move so fast they're mostly impossible to avoid. To compensate, the game give you a huge shield which regenerates quickly, meaning that despite taking damage pretty much non stop, the game is actually very easy until the final boss.\n\nIt looks nice enough, if very generic, but the music is utterly forgettable and the dialogue is incessant and literally never shuts up. The characters babble on about nonsense for the entire game, and of course, it's all in Japanese.\n\nIkaruga is a bullet hell masterpiece, a game with such precise, intelligent, and logical design as to be something which despite being brutaly difficult can be mastered with practice. Astebreed by comparison, is just a mess of random, incoherrant design from people who just don't understand what makes a good shooter.","August 22, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

You will hear Japanese throughout battles but you are focused on the battle, so rarely do you get to read any of the subtitles.  So if you want to know the storyline, you won't unless you understand Japanese.\n\n- Targetting system is silly.  You can't turn off direction-based targetting so you end up trying to lock on to either the direction you are moving or the opposite of the direction you are moving.  The only way to target an enemy directly is not to move at all and hope the 'auto-lock' figures out the best target to lock on to.\n\n- Attacking with multiple attacks will sometimes lock your attack in a single direction.  Not sure if this is intended, but it is annoying as ♥♥♥♥.\n\n- "Special Attack" has multiple attack types but the tutorial is useless in explaining how you use them.  You want to do the mega-ultra-single-target attack?  Nope, aoe shield attack.  You want to do the aoe sheild attack?  Nope, random target attack.  Sweet!  I guess this is part of the very simple control scheme.   Instead of allowing you to assign each special attack to a different button, you have to do so combo, ie. button 1 + button 3, and if you fail it defaults to the aoe shield attack.\n\n- Control setup is too simple.  It would be amazing if you could auto-fire and use the hat/thumb sticks to fire in a different direction you are moving, but instead you get a silly one-direction / direction-based targetting system that is counter-intuitive.\n\n\nPros...\n\n- Decent graphics\n\n- Voice acting if you like to hear Japanese\n\n\n\nConclusion: the game feels like it was made by some college game grad looking to make a game, but lacks the experience of game design to make the game fun to play.  The storyline might be impressive if it didn't require reading the subtitles or some other non-action cutscene... oh yeah, the cut scenes are awful.","June 28, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

These guys fill up the screen being useless and you totally blow them the f*ck up with a hundred more bullets per second (BPS) than they can ever hope to shoot.  Like, by the hundreds of thousands of bullets multiplied by dudes (holy f*ck there are a lot of useless f*cking dudes).  Seriously, it's totally worth it because you can fire like, a gazillion more BPS than these stupid f*ckers and totally feel empowered because they are useless.\n\nEvery chapter is like, totally 10 minutes long (but only if you suck, I finished most of them in like 5 minutes).  And there are like 6 chapters (Holy F*ck, running the gauntlet am I rite? Half an hour, WTF MAN?!).  On top of this, there are totally like, SIX, F*CKING CHAPTERS (like, whoa.  A game that lasts that long? WTF?!!!)\n\nThen, with the guys in the main game -get this- they f*cking make it TEN TIEMS HARDER LOL\n\nyou hit the last boss, and it breaks the entire f*cking game and you spend all of your time in which you could get a refund just trying to beat this f*cker, and then you do, and it's entirely, utterly, totally, completely worth it.  Trust me on that worth it part, bro.  totally. worth.  wasting that much time and money, even if it's not on sale.\n\nI mean, this last bost just has 1000 times the HP of a normal boss, and is the ONLY boss with this much HP.   And the only reason he manages to beat you is because he has that much HP and you've shot him 14,000 times (literally bro- no, really, he has at least QUADRUPLE the HP of any other enemy because he's totally the last guy) and your turbo machne gun does so little damage it is literally worthless and you have to figure out a way to damage that last boss in a way that kills him in under a half an hour if you are constantly chip-damaging him that entire time and you don't get hit (because you lose half your HP if you DO ever get hit from any bullet, and there are like a few hundred drowning the screen. So, it's totally challenging.  In a totally, completely, HONEST way, bro).\n\nSo, so worth it.\n\nBro.\n\nbrofist\n\n(In case you cannot tell- don't buy this game.\ndon't buy this game. it is ♥♥♥♥ing pathetic.

It is worthless in terms of difficulty, until you hit the final boss.  It is then so impossible, so completely impassible unless you start doing unnatural or unethical stuff (read: cheating) that you will never actually beat it without so much practice you will not be considered human.  Really, I mean this; the last boss has at least 4 times the amount of hp any other boss in the game, and you are killled by two to three hits by this last boss.  Normal bosses in the game take far, far, far more to kill or even scratch to you.  This last boss can suddenly kill you in four hits and fills the screen with bullets that can potentially end you.\n\nThis is the definition of a "quarter trap," if you understand what that means.\n\nAll the money you put into the game- it will be lost.  You do well, and easily so, right up until you hit this last boss; then when you hit the last boss, it becomes an impossible trek, like the goblins and orcs in Lord of The Rings suddenly got Einstein intellect and simultaneously acquired unconditional halfling "F*ck you" radar that allows them to track you and subsequently stuff their sexual organs between your unwilling buttcheeks for several hours, thus destroying the entire narrative and storyline because you're spending at least a half an hour just trying to kill ONE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GUY that is utterly irrelevant to the storyline.  Only you, YOU, are on the opposite and bad end of the "f*ck you" spectrum.\n\nReally, don't get this unless you REALLY enjoy mecha, unless you REALLY enjoy a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bullets on your screen, and certainly DO NOT get this unless you want your game to end in roughly 3-4 hours- and THEN be excused by "just replay it."\n\nHell, I ignored every ounce of dialogue until I got drunk enough to watch the dialogue instead of trying to survive.\n\nRead that again:\nI had to be completely ♥♥♥♥ing hammered to even consider what the f*ck was going on in this game.\n\nOther than than that, it is actually a decent bullet hell style game.\nNo, really, it IS a decent bullet hell.

If you are not swinging your sword on this shooter, you are not making much of a dent with the swarms of enemies. This leaves you swinging your sword 9/10ths of the time, which gets boring. If graphics makes a game, this one made it but they don't. That's just one part of the formula and the rest is falling apart. The boss battle do fall into attacking patterns, not effective ones but the rest of the game just keep slashing. I'm just can't get into this game and it's just not interesting enough.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","260 products in account","Played for an hour and got to the final level, died twice, normal difficulty. Could've finished it if I played for 15 more minutes but already made up my mind on it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that as long as you mash your blade attack you are invincible to everything minus some red beams and these red cloudy energy sphere thingies that appear in the last level. Seeing as how your invincibility is also an attack, you just get up close to every boss and watch them die as you shoot beams and slice them to death. Invincibility with no cool-down would normally be an issue if the game didn't HAVE to be like that. It's a bullet-hell game, and without such a mechanic you'd die automatically, or the game would have some actual difficulty that would put off the majority of gamers.\n\nThis game outright fails to provide the challenge that the majority of SHMUPs do. Games in this category aren't about attacking; typically you just don't take your finger off the damn attack button. It's about dodging attacks and learning boss attack patterns so you can dodge accordingly. I get that it doesn't appeal to most people due to the difficulty, and changing expected mechanics in a genre is great if it leads to something good. But this game does a 180 and gives you a machine with regenerating health that can TANK damage and has from the very beginning what might as well be permanent invincibility. Why a game that ALMOST can be said to play itself gets 90's from reviewers can only be surmised as the 'indie dev' syndrome. It's a good game because an indie dev made it and man ♥♥♥♥ those big corporations!\n\nThe game also has issues with plot. Or rather, the difficulty in keeping up with it. You see, the game has Japanese voices, which is great. I love it when I get dual audio, except that this game only has Japanese VA's. Which I'm totally fine with as long as there are subtitles, and there are. The problem is that when ♥♥♥♥ is lighting your screen on fire you don't have the luxury of looking at the subtitles on your bottom left. So you have to make a decision: look at the subtitles and conversations or play the game. English voices would've resolved this, but seeing as how this is a small studio they probably couldn't afford it or, if they did get English VAs, I'd be complaining about how bad they are. It's a tough situation for the developer, but a negative is still a negative no matter the reason, and I'm merely pointing it out.\n\nI just muted the voices and gave up on the plot when I found myself constantly switching from focusing on the bottom left and then the action on-screen. That wasn't gonna work out. Some text logs would've gone a long way with helping me actually know what the ♥♥♥♥ was going on and why there were two girls who felt like they were nearing nothing at all\n\nnothing at all\n\nnothing at ALL.\n\nI'm just gonna look at the image and guess what the plot was about. Hmm...let me see....Luke 'Mr. Bitc*es' Skywalker is busy trying to bed the two girls in Gimp suits but must first impress them by riding the new Honda Mech...with DISASTREOUS results! Honestly you'd think a large company like Honda could make something better than this.\n\nedit-the last boss was semi-difficult and it was so ♥♥♥♥ing sad because if only the rest of the damn game was like that.","November 27, 2014","false","3.2"," 8 of 29 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","8","29","0","0"

The differnt enemies and differnt combination of these enemies cause you to manuver and rethink your attack patterns in case you lose too much health when you reach a boss, or just get creamed by the baddies. I'd say it is easy to get the hang of the controls, but it also gets difficult at times, like when your trying to avoid hundreds of missles and lasers from a giant robot.... xD.

Seriously.\nCons:\n-Story can be hard to follow at times\n-Pretty much need to play the prolauge\n-You can easily lose yourself on the screen\nThis game is definitely worth a buy for anyone who loves bullet hells, I personally loved it, so theres no excuse for you not to.

I have never been into bullet hell games, but this one really stands out from the others that i have played. tl;dr at bottom.\n\nLet's start with the art. All of the artwork for this game is phenominal. From the in-game graphics, backround, and atmosphere. To the anime styled story telling cutscenes. Every single thing in this game is just very soothing to look at it. I didn't find one ugly thing in this game. Not one. Artwork/Graphics 10/10\n\nNext is gameplay. The game is actually.... Fun. It's an absolutely chaotic mess, but it's fun. There where a few times i had to defeat on boss on Easy instead of Normal. (im just a casul at bullethells). The lock on system was very fun to use, and not to mention the sword. I don't know if it's been done before but the swordplay was actually very fun, and alot more useful than i thought. (i remember first thinking, "what the hell is a sword going to do in a bullet hell game"). Very fun game. Also very chaotic. If the lock on system didn't slow things down i would have no idea where my character is half the time haha. Im going to give this part a 10/10 simply because it's the only bullet hell i have actually had fun playing; and possibly even addicted too. This one be a little biased but... oh well.\n\nStory. The story was... alright? honestly i wasn't able to pay attention to it because alot of it was told in the middle of the game and since i can't fully understand japanese, it would require me to read the subtitles at the bottom and that's not something i can do during a bullet hell game lol. But you gather the just of it through the cutscenes. It was Alright. 7/10 cus i didn't really follow it...\n\nAs for complaints, my only really complaint is how short the game was. There's only 6 levels.... and there isn't a whole lot of replayability either (unless you're willing to torture yourself on trying to complete a higher difficulty).\n\ntl;dr: The game is good. Buy it, play it, be happy you got to experience it. Final score 9/10","December 27, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Now.\n\nAstebreed is a Schmup (Shoot 'em up) with an anime styled theme, based on, obviously, a futuristic type warfare.\n\nThere's a prologue and a main story. They are both, together, only lasting enough for around an hour of play (if you don't die a bunch of times, which, honestly, shouldn't be too difficult to avoid on Easy, though I havn't tried any other difficulty - That's how long the game is). The story itself plays through as you play the game - which can get a little difficult to follow if you're terrible at multi-tasking, though I liked the idea of the story following what's actually happening in the game itself. The voices are in japanese (with English subtitles). In the main story you play as a character named Roy, who, with his sister, is out to save the sister's twin, and save the Earth from evil.\n\nI honestly don't know much about Scmups at all. I never really played them (nor liked them), and initially brought this because it looked good with the anime styled graphics and I've heard good things about it. I can honestly say; This was the fastest hour I have spent on a game in god knows how long - and this is meant in a good way, as I was really entertained both with the gameplay and the story all the way through.\n\nThe gameplay in itself felt smooth, and it worked really well with a gamepad too. I really don't know what to say about the gameplay - As I said, I don't usually play these types of games. I had no problems with it, and I quite liked the variability in the attack forms.\n\nI liked it :)","July 22, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hard mode is where the game actually shines though, and playing for high scores is a matter of skill and timing. There's a pretty deep, interesting system for combat that doesn't get really touched on unless you're going for scores. My main complaint is the game doesn't really do well with it's difficulty transition, going from "You can beat these without trying to much" for most of the game (although you'll probably score poorly if you dont know what you're doing) to a sudden gutpunch if you aren't prepared near the end.\n\nSome controls could be better (dash-melee takes some getting used to without accidentally pulling out a combo you didnt intend to do), but are more than adequate for the most part. Some camera angles make using some shot types really annoying, but your sword will be doing alot of the legwork anyway. Another quibble is that until you get used to the game, there's alot of visual noise that, while pretty, makes it easy to lose track of what is going on.\n\nWhile it's a nice the game has alot of side and backstory to it, some of the parts that allow dialogue to make sense require you to beat the game so you can read up on the side details. This part is unimportart for play really, nor is the plot particularly amazing or profound, and this complaint only matters for the first playthrough, but it's something that bothers me slightly.\n\nEither way, it's a good, fun thing for anyone who enjoys shooters.","August 21, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, good visual consistency between attacks and their effects. You always have a very clear idea on how to deal with any type of projectile coming your way.\n- Special notice in my book: an actual tutorial which explains every single game mechanic there is, complete with demonstration. It's really different mechanically from "classic" bhells, so props for recognizing that.\n\nCons:\n- Obviously console-oriented controls. Like, "back" in the menus when you launch it up, is on Shift.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Graceland/recommended/283680/","Graceland","Graceland™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Graceland/","314 products in account","I'd start out by saying; If you like Schmups, or anime-related games with a pretty nice story - then buy it. Now.\n\nAstebreed is a Schmup (Shoot 'em up) with an anime styled theme, based on, obviously, a futuristic type warfare.\n\nThere's a prologue and a main story. They are both, together, only lasting enough for around an hour of play (if you don't die a bunch of times, which, honestly, shouldn't be too difficult to avoid on Easy, though I havn't tried any other difficulty - That's how long the game is). The story itself plays through as you play the game - which can get a little difficult to follow if you're terrible at multi-tasking, though I liked the idea of the story following what's actually happening in the game itself. The voices are in japanese (with English subtitles). In the main story you play as a character named Roy, who, with his sister, is out to save the sister's twin, and save the Earth from evil.\n\nI honestly don't know much about Scmups at all. I never really played them (nor liked them), and initially brought this because it looked good with the anime styled graphics and I've heard good things about it. I can honestly say; This was the fastest hour I have spent on a game in god knows how long - and this is meant in a good way, as I was really entertained both with the gameplay and the story all the way through.\n\nThe gameplay in itself felt smooth, and it worked really well with a gamepad too. I really don't know what to say about the gameplay - As I said, I don't usually play these types of games. I had no problems with it, and I quite liked the variability in the attack forms.\n\nI liked it :)","July 22, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mechwarrior(GC) is an example of a good mech game fun and challenging in its own right. Astebreed throws it's hat into the ring and is ambitous if anything. The developers of Astebreed favor the eastern style of mech combat much like Gundam and Eureka 7 type where you move fast in the air obliterating everything in your sight. You will feel like a king on a keyboard killing millions every mission you play.  Story takes a backseat to the action clearly, there are datalogs for the plot if you're that curious but it doesn't help nor hurt you gaming experince. The overall spoiler free summary is "Climb into the pilot's seat of an otherworldly war machine and take down a genocidal alien race bent on eradicating humanity to preserve their own civilization." Thats it. Another thing I should mention is that all dialog is in Japanese but can be skipped at anytime. For those you cringe at a language unfamiliar to your own spoken native tongue you can play with the audio options to mute it. I for one had no issues.\n\nIn conclusion, stunning to look at, slick and fluid to play as well as being a satisfying -- but never insurmountable -- challenge, Astebreed is a top-quality game that everyone with even a passing interest in mech games should have in their collection","July 23, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game provides a large number of attack options between wide & focused fire, lock-on variations of both, sword attacks, and ex attacks. It can be initially daunting but once you get a handle on each option's strengths, Astebreed becomes absolutely sublime to play.\n\nThe only negative thing about the game is the story. Like most shoot 'em ups it's not particularly memorable. There is a handful of dialogue during levels via subtitles in the corner; but with how much is happening on screen it is troublesome to read while playing.\n\nThat aside, Astebreed can put up a moderate challenge.

Also, good visual consistency between attacks and their effects. You always have a very clear idea on how to deal with any type of projectile coming your way.\n- Special notice in my book: an actual tutorial which explains every single game mechanic there is, complete with demonstration. It's really different mechanically from "classic" bhells, so props for recognizing that.\n\nCons:\n- Obviously console-oriented controls. Like, "back" in the menus when you launch it up, is on Shift.

Does this get hard, hell yes it does, but its challening and when you complete you will feel great, or maybe I just suck :P. sword and lasers what more you could ask for as a robot thing destroing other robot things lol. The differnt enemies and differnt combination of these enemies cause you to manuver and rethink your attack patterns in case you lose too much health when you reach a boss, or just get creamed by the baddies. I'd say it is easy to get the hang of the controls, but it also gets difficult at times, like when your trying to avoid hundreds of missles and lasers from a giant robot.... xD.

It can be initially daunting but once you get a handle on each option's strengths, Astebreed becomes absolutely sublime to play.\n\nThe only negative thing about the game is the story. Like most shoot 'em ups it's not particularly memorable. There is a handful of dialogue during levels via subtitles in the corner; but with how much is happening on screen it is troublesome to read while playing.\n\nThat aside, Astebreed can put up a moderate challenge. It's not quite bullet hell, but there are times were it will feel close to it. Highly recommended for shoot 'em up fans.","July 5, 2014","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very smooth gamefeel; fantastic visual; a few really neat ideas; small, but fun story; awesome character design. It's got a lot going for it.\n\nIt makes for a great introduction to the bullet hell genre. Playing on normal is pretty easy for most of the game. So it eases you into things. Once you unlock the next higher difficulty, it gets pretty tough. But, either way, the visuals are beautiful the whole way through. Which definitely helps to keep you engaged.\n\nThe extras are also very fleshed out. The way the story is presented in game, you might feel like it's a bit sparse. But if you like floods of information (think Mass Effect codex), then the extras are pretty fun.\n\nAt $14.99, I'm not sure if it's quite worth it. With a hard mode playthrough I suppose it might be (I haven't finished that yet, as I have way too many other games I'm playing right now). But if you can pick it up on sale then it's definitely a good deal.","February 28, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a hardcore Japanese mecha fan, you'd love this.\n-Great graphics\n-Multiple abilities to make use of, so you can play the game your way.\n-Bosses are challenging and has their own sequence of attacks.\n\n-Cons-\n-Barely enough room to fit all those effects, sometimes even to the point that you literally see nothing but bullet fire and explosions on your sceen.\n\n-Story is too short.\nI honestly would like to know more about the characters and the universe of Astebreed.\nOne thing this game lacks is the story-telling, i'm really interested in it as it has a rather intriguing plot that could possibly be made into an Anime.\n\n-Voice acting for Daniel needs to be redone, parts that should be him shouting loudly sounds like someone just put their mouth too close to the microphone and saying their script with an over exaggerated slang to it. (LOL)\n\nOther than that, get this game if you love Danmaku (Bullet hell) games like Touhou Project.\nYou won't be disappointed with the amount of destruction it offers!\n\n\n\n","April 23, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said I had a lot of fun with Astebreed.  I got a real sense of being in control of a one man army as I locked my homing lasers onto dozens of enemies and watch them explode, while using my machine's hilariously oversized sword to swat their shots out of the sky.\n\nThe game is a bit on the short side as I beat it on easy (because I'm a pansy who doesn't play shootemups) in about an hour and a half.  That said there are harder difficulties to play through as well as different mecha to play through the game as, so I don't feel cheated with the length.\n\nMy main complaint with the game is the way the story is presented. It is mainly told through dialogue in the missions and this dialogue is entirely in Japanese.  While it is translated in text at the bottom corner of the screen, it is difficult to both read the text and keep an eye on the action of the game.  It almost makes me wish the game was dubbed, but from a production standpoint that wouldn't have been worth the extra cost.\n\nThe story itself is fairly cookie cutter for real robot anime, with some stuff about loved ones on the other side of the war and the morality of people being used as weapons.  Nothing to write home about at all, but decent enough to provide a backdrop for an entertaining game.\n\nOverall if Astebreed looks at all interesting to you or of you like either giant robots blowing stuff up or shoot em ups that aren't controller-breaking difficult, I'd recommend you give it a try.","January 14, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems like they had some big story and cut over 80% of it out in random places to squeeze it all in. The "bullet hell" aspect of it doesn't even feel like a bullet hell since you're basically immortal anyways and the free firing guns are almost completely pointless. Enemies are more often than not "out of depth" so that you can only hit them with lock on attacks- and since using those all the time reduces your actual firing capability, any that ARE in range of you are better dealt with using your sword. Also- there were only 1-2 real "boss" feeling bosses. The game was also very short. The voice lines/acting were NOT good like most commenters say. True- they weren't as bad as.... english dubbed anime for example.... but it was not "good". There was also some strange lag/delay in both the voicing and the subtitles. It might have been that I was running the game at full graphics and my PC somehow managed to not handle it well...\n\nI don't regret getting this game and playing it, but at the same time I just see it as a huge let down. It could have been pretty great if they hadn't packed everything together and had focused less on the flashy attacks and more on actually adding some semblance of skill to the gameplay other than "mash melee and constantly lock on to as much as possible".\n\nAll in all- 5/10.\n\nOH, and almost forgot. The system requirements says in additional notes "controller recommended". Recommended is a lie. Idk about anyone else- but I could NOT get this game to go past the title screen until I had a controller set up to run on my PC.","February 9","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My closest experience to a game like this is Raystorm (I loved that game from back in the Playstation 1 days).\n\nTl;DR Great game! Super short, lacks replayability for most, but oh so satisfying to play.\n\nThis game is fun, like really fun! Also an adrenaline packed madhouse. But terribly short spoilering how short it is  only 6 chapters, I wish it were longer or something. There is a story to it though! You will most likely not pick up on it though since you'll be too busy dealing with the ABSOLUTE FAST PACED CHAOS happening on screen and trying to not die, rather than read the english subtitles on the bottom left of the screen, as there are no english voices unfortunately. Though even the story happens so fast you'll be on an emotional roller coaster like a high speed soap opera(or maybe that is just me.)\n\nMost of the story seems to be contained in the "gallery" you unlock after completing the game (teeny tiny spoiler of how short that is at the bottom of the review). I have reason to believe there may be several different story developments! Unfortunately I can't say it without giving away a spoiler so i put it at the bottom of the review in a spoiler (if you don't know how to see them, just hover the mouse over the black boxes). If you are fine with the spoiler then do have a look see! or come back to the review when you finish the game (within 3 hours give or take)\n\nTo any of you achievment hunters out there, Especially if your the compulsery type, DO NOT get this game ... you will absolutely never get all the achievments, unless your insanely good at bullet hell games and capable of beating the entire game on every difficulty without ever getting hit (including boss fights). Which is unfathomably difficult,\n\nI think you can prevent Fio from getting hacked and her mind getting taken over by Esto if you avoid all of those Lucis stealing attacks, which are the red explosions in chapter 5, good luck! plase comment for confirmation if its true, conclusion to her mind getting hacked in the spoiler below this\n\nShe was hacked and her mind taken over or brainwashed by Esto, but after a touching family moment, she recovers back to herself, more touching family moments and Esto is redeemed","February 29","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, the game can turn into a decent test of skill with some pretty fast-paced action, and going for high score multipliers with your combos can be a good test of strategy.

It runs consistently smooth, and the changes of viewpoint throughout each level keeps things fresh and exciting.\n\nControls are tight and responsive. The game provides a large number of attack options between wide & focused fire, lock-on variations of both, sword attacks, and ex attacks. It can be initially daunting but once you get a handle on each option's strengths, Astebreed becomes absolutely sublime to play.\n\nThe only negative thing about the game is the story. Like most shoot 'em ups it's not particularly memorable. There is a handful of dialogue during levels via subtitles in the corner; but with how much is happening on screen it is troublesome to read while playing.\n\nThat aside, Astebreed can put up a moderate challenge. It's not quite bullet hell, but there are times were it will feel close to it. Highly recommended for shoot 'em up fans.","July 5, 2014","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a bullet spread, a concentrated fire, and a close-range sword attack. By holding the buttons, you can use lock-on shots and dash slashes. Enemies will use various shot types, and by watching their attacks you can either dodge the incoming blasts, or use your sword to cut down the wave of bullets.\n\nAs for the story, I never payed much attention to it. What drew me to the game was  the way the camera will shift in perspective, creating a sense of 3D, while piloting a mech with several ways of fighting off enemies.

I love it because it serves three purposes.\n\nFirst, it's a great shmup. You have three weapons, including a sword and "bits" that lock on enemy targets, surround them and shoot them. All your weapons can be used with a destructive EX attack, which replaces the bombs you usually see on other shmups. You also have a rechargeable shield. There are no power-ups to pick up, but that's a good thing here.\n\nSecond, this game is perfect for fans of mecha anime. You control a mech yourself and will occasionally fight other mechs. All the characters in the game are voiced in Japanese. If you don't know the language, you'll need to read the subtitles while you play. The dialog is pretty anime-like.\n\nThird, this game is really bullet hell for beginners. You have a prologue mission that teaches you the basics and then you also have several tutorials that will teach you every single aspect of the special mech you'll be controlling and even how scoring works. I think the normal difficulty level is pretty easy, it only gets harder on the final stages. So, after you complete normal, you'll unlock the hard difficulty level and that's where you'll face a real challenge. Seriously, if you never played a bullet hell before, this should be your first.","August 26, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Astebreed is a bullet-hell style shooter that is driven by a deep and powerful backstory about loss, pain, love, and redemption.  Through the use of unique camera angles and beautiful art and animations, this game delivers a unique experience to the often rigid genre. Like I said, the game is  short (I can blow through the easy mode of this game in about 30-45 minutes. Normal mode took me a couple hours. Haven't tried hard yet), but the story makes it a great experience. There are definitely some feelsy moments here. My only complaint is that the story unfolds as the game is taking place. Since the voices are all in Japanese, it's kind of hard to read the subtitles, shoot enemies, and dodge bullets at the same time. ~Trying not to spoil anything, so yeah...~ This game also isn't just a mindless button mashing game. In order to use certain special moves, certain circumstances must be met, as well as each boss has it's own sort of unique style to being beaten. I definitely recommend this game.

My closest experience to a game like this is Raystorm (I loved that game from back in the Playstation 1 days).\n\nTl;DR Great game! Super short, lacks replayability for most, but oh so satisfying to play.\n\nThis game is fun, like really fun! Also an adrenaline packed madhouse. But terribly short spoilering how short it is  only 6 chapters, I wish it were longer or something. There is a story to it though! You will most likely not pick up on it though since you'll be too busy dealing with the ABSOLUTE FAST PACED CHAOS happening on screen and trying to not die, rather than read the english subtitles on the bottom left of the screen, as there are no english voices unfortunately. Though even the story happens so fast you'll be on an emotional roller coaster like a high speed soap opera(or maybe that is just me.)\n\nMost of the story seems to be contained in the "gallery" you unlock after completing the game (teeny tiny spoiler of how short that is at the bottom of the review). I have reason to believe there may be several different story developments! Unfortunately I can't say it without giving away a spoiler so i put it at the bottom of the review in a spoiler (if you don't know how to see them, just hover the mouse over the black boxes). If you are fine with the spoiler then do have a look see! or come back to the review when you finish the game (within 3 hours give or take)\n\nTo any of you achievment hunters out there, Especially if your the compulsery type, DO NOT get this game ... you will absolutely never get all the achievments, unless your insanely good at bullet hell games and capable of beating the entire game on every difficulty without ever getting hit (including boss fights). Which is unfathomably difficult,\n\nI think you can prevent Fio from getting hacked and her mind getting taken over by Esto if you avoid all of those Lucis stealing attacks, which are the red explosions in chapter 5, good luck! plase comment for confirmation if its true, conclusion to her mind getting hacked in the spoiler below this\n\nShe was hacked and her mind taken over or brainwashed by Esto, but after a touching family moment, she recovers back to herself, more touching family moments and Esto is redeemed","February 29","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First off, it's beautiful, or at least I think so.  Being a huge Mecha fan, this was the biggest drawing point for me, and it did not disappoint.  Secondly, the gameplay.  It's fast paced, and can get pretty intense at times.  In chapter three I felt a significant difficulty boost, and by chapter four there were even points I was overwhelmed.  Not to mention, there's a story!  Going into a lot of these games, I don't expect much story, seeing as most of these games get lost in translation hell, and the story doesn't really vibe.  Is this the best story on the planet>  No, not quite, but it does a good job of making you feel like what you're doing has purpose, and that's all anyone could really ask for.  I've only really played this game for 43 minutes, however, and it's addicting, and I'm definately going back to it once I post this review.","May 14","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Astebreed, on the other hand, looks and feels like a game that I wouldn't mind paying $14.99 for, but with the caveat that, like many shmups, the story takes less than two hours to play through and is designed for multiple playthroughs and highscore chasing.\n\nAstebreed plays like Platinum Games made an old school shmup. It's simple enough that someone new could make it through the campaign on a low difficulty and feel like a bad-♥♥♥, but the mechanics are deep enough that you really need to master them for the hard difficulty or if you want to play for high scores. Once you get thngs down you'll be zipping around the screen, shooting enemies down, using lock-on attacks, deflecting enemy fire with your melee before charging in for the kill, and unleashing one of several different super attacks. As this happens the pespective will occasionally shift between top-down, side-scolling, and behind-the-shoulder. The latter works the worst, but the devs obviously knew that because that perspective is used more for wow-factor moments and comprises the least challenging moments of the game. Overall it's hectic and fun and a condensed experience without any filler. Some games might be 8+ hours long with  1.5 hours of truly exciting gameplay, Astebreed just simply ditches all the extra fluff, but regardless the length will be a sticking point for people who just want more for their money.\n\nThere's a surprisingly deep story here from a shmup and it's absolutely absolutely bat-♥♥♥♥ insane, although I'm aware that it may just be par for the course if you're into anime. Whether you're interested in it or not, you'll likely miss most of it because the voice acting is all Japanese and the english text is shoved into the bottom corner where you're going to miss it because a good 50% of the exposition happens during firefights. Even when I was able to see the text a lot of the story is an odd mix of pretentious and inane. I have a feeling that may have been exactly the intent, but it's just not for me, and fortunately it's not necessary to enjoy the game and also completely ignorable.\n\nIf you can find it on sale (it's been as low as $4) it's definitely worth a play.","May 23","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
