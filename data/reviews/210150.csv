The game is a piece of cake. I won my first race by tuning the handling and acceleration with a 3 star team in addition to buying all the top notch supplies.\n\nThe game can be a challenge if you handicap yourself, but otherwise, not really. It only gets easier and easier as you get sponsors, and as long as you win races, you can replace your parts very easily. Some parts get worn out to 50% after one race, but they cost less than 25-50k while winning a race gets you 1m. If you have two drivers, that can go up to 1.9m, and there are lots of free agents at the start to hire mad cheap. My salaries were 50k even though it said a 20k salary would guarantee a contract signing. It's very easy to hire personnel as well. You just have to make sure you're balanced.\n\nFor $2, it's worth it. For $20? Nuh uh.","January 4","false","4.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The biggest weaknesses are a UI that takes a bit to figure out even with the "tutorial" turned on which is nothing more than a description of each screen that you visit for the first time. Another glaring weakness is the simulation itself. The car mechanics, parts and driver abilities do not contribute to meanigful changes in the races. I stumbled upon a car setup that has allowed me to win every race with both my drivers taking the podium. I essentially am left with managing the wear and tear of parts.\n\nOn the surface, this game had me excited. I am sad to say it was a disappointment.
