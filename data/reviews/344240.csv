Combat is fast paced and rewards daring maneuvers.\nExtremely unique ships with crazy weapons such as drills, catapults and boat rams makes each time you fight a new ship a new experience. Higher end ships are NOT just stronger copies of the smaller ships.\nWarhammer universe inherently gives the game a lot of potential lore to work off of.\nEasy to understand trade system takes the pain out trading while still allowing more advanced players the option to profit greatly if they are smart about which city needs what resource.\nCONS:Only Orcs and Humans are currently in the game as well as the map being limited to the first few cities resulting in only a few hours of content being currently available.\nSailing is long and boring, even with a 2x time speed up it takes a bit too long to get anywhere especially when you have to run back and forth during quests.\nThere is severe graphical hitching when loading in new ships or cities. Framerate also is very inconsistent even on my GTX 970.\nQuests need balancing, as many of the longer quests give you extremely low amounts of gold in relation to how much work you do.\nSUMMARY:As someone who hated Naval Action for having long drawn out boring battles Man O’ War really hits the spot for me by providing fast paced, fun ship vs ship combat. Ship combat and control is simplified with you only needing to worry about the range of your shots and the direction of the wind, giving the game a more casual (but still deep) gameplay feel. The biggest problem with the game is that there is only a tiny bit of content available; you are restricted to only exploring around 1/10th of the map and interacting with only 4 factions which you will quickly run out of things to do with. While I don’t think this game is currently worth the price tag, I do think it is a game that will eventually grow into one of the best naval combat games available as it progresses through early access.

This game looks waaaay better now that everything isn't bathed in shadows. Great progress so far.\nTL:DR\nI'm not going to lie. I've kinda fanboyed out for this game. The sheer potential and the broad focus the game has taken makes it this weird Pirates!/Black Flag/Warhammer hybrid. And yes it's actually as awesome as that sounds. However, being  an early access product, the game is clearly rough around a few edges (most notably lighting and shading) and the animations could use a bit more work.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS0rPwLy2Ug\n\nHow does it play?\n\nThink AC's Black Flag combat system (with more depth) , a quest system, special crew members, boats of downright crazy designs that you can use (one boat is basically just a giant cannon in the front which takes up half the boat in size), and a boatload (ha) of other features like Monster attacks. Did you say monster attacks? Yup. Within the first 15 minutes of playing the game you fight Orkz, and a giant ♥♥♥♥ing shark (megalodon) with more spectacular factions and monsters on the way (griffons/wyverns are planned next). You will sail around the coasts and seas of the Old World from the Warhammer fantasy universe while playing through an entire story. The core mechanics are solid and this seems like an amazing start but there is definitely some work to go before this is a full fledged product.\n\nWhat is planned in the future?\n-A (seriously) ridiculous amount of content.\n-Fully customizable character (think MnB: Warband type customization)\n-Full story Mode\n-More monsters\n-20 or so factions (seems to include all races from WFB)\n\nWhat is wrong now?\n-Because of lighting and shading, it's kind of hard to see anything in the game at night. It doesn't help that there is an  unsual amount of fog in the northern areas that you're in. This makes night battles an absolutely painful challenge.\n-Animations are a bit wonky in areas and movement can feel jerky or floaty (depends on if you're walking around on the ship or just sailing the ship). Because of this, it's hard to hit targets in boarding actions or in monster attacks. For example, when you fight a Megalodon, you're supposed to shoot it in the eye... I'm not saying it's impossible, but I am saying that after about 6 megalodon attacks, I've only shot one in the eye with my hand cannon once.\n\nWhat can be improved?\n-I'd definitely start with the previously mentioned lighting and shading. Visibility is a major part of the game and not being able to see through fog and the deck of your ship being coated in pure black despite nearby lighting sources makes it hard to truly enjoy the beautifully crafted ships or to be able to combat effectively against enemy ships.\n-Animations that seem fluid or have a realistic weight to them could really push this game up to where it needs to be.\n-Couple of graphical errors like blackboxes appearing out of nowhere, standard Early Access stuff.\n-Boarding actions could be a bit more forgiving, it's a bit difficult to shoot the right enemies when the ship is bucking and crewmen clip through each other... I'm about 60/40 on shooting my teammates and enemies. I'd also like to see a bit better boarding combat system be implemented if at all possible. Maybe some melee fighting from the main character or something.\n-Would love to see the voice acting fully implemented. What's currently in the game is not too shabby but there are moments when voices cut out or it seems lines just haven't been fully voiced yet. Can't wait to see that finished.\n\nIn summation\nThis game is well on it's way to being a damn good title. It's already got a very solid foundation and in it's current format, it's a lot of fun to play with enough surprises and challenge to keep you playing for a few dozen hours. Definitely recommend it to Warhammer FB fans or people who are looking for a Fantasy take on the Black Flag/Pirates! formula.","April 15","true","7.9"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","45","51","8","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/344240/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2003 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nMan O’ War: Corsair is an open world naval combat game that takes place in the Old World of the Warhammer universe. Apparently it is inspired by a tabletop game from Games Workshop and I had no idea. Therefore, I’ll retain myself from comparing the two.\n\nOverview:\nBefore starting the game, you get to name your captain and choose what kind of background he comes from. You also get to name your ship and choose your own flag. Right after you’re done customizing your ship and your captain, you’ll be thrown into the high seas and right into the middle of the action. From the start you’ll be accompanied with a very competent and welcoming tutorial that will teach you pretty much everything you need to know. Still, I think it is worth mentioning that the tutorial itself is incorporated with story missions, thus creating some kind of cohesion between the teaching of game mechanics and the storytelling of the game itself.\n\nAs with most open world naval games, there are plenty of things you can do in ports, you can take on missions in the tavern or learn if there is a shortage of a type of resource in another port so you can sell it there and profit more. You can also buy and sell cargo, which you can also acquire during encounters. The encounters not only reward you with resources such as gold, but they also increase or decrease your fame with the several factions. Gold can be used to purchases new ships or upgrade your current one, as well as hire more crew and crew members like a sharpshooter which you can directly control.\n\nCombat:\nIf you’ve played Black Flag you’ll feel right at home in terms of ship combat. Just turn your camera in the direction where you want to shoot and adjust the range at which you want to fire, then just sit back and watch as a glorious barrage of cannonballs is unleashed upon the enemies. Still, there is a lot more to the combat, you have to keep an eye on the way the wind is blowing and watch out for HUGE sea creatures that won’t stop until they can get a hold of your ship. There are also various different ships which use different types of weaponry placements like your standard Man O’ War and a ship with a big mortar cannon in the middle.\n\nIf that isn’t enough to convince you, then I should also tell you that you can switch between playable characters on the fly. This plays a huge role during boarding action. If you fancy a more close quarters experience this is the way to go. Still, melee combat is not available in the game which is a big bummer. On the other hand, after having a look at the forums, the developers seem to be taking into account player suggestions so, hopefully, melee will come in the future.\n\nVisuals & Sound:\nIf there is one thing I really love about Man O’ War: Corsair is the voice acting and the music, they are just spot on! Both one and the other convey and provide that feeling and atmosphere that is reminiscent of a Warhammer game.\n\nAs for the visuals, the characters, the ships and the ports also have that Warhammer feel to them but I do admit that the world is not really that much detailed. Some textures are somewhat bland, especially rocks, land and structures of the ports. I wouldn’t really mind this but the only thing that bothers me at the moment is that the game runs kind of bad. Even with every graphics option turned down to the minimum in the menu, I rarely get over 40fps with an i5 4460 and a 970. Still, from what I gather, the developers are waiting until everything is in place so they can start working on the optimization, which I really hope they do.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nMy only complaints about the game at the moment, as I’ve mentioned, are the lack optimization and that faint feeling that the world feels somewhat empty at times.\n\nThe naval combat is great and tons of fun and the same goes for the boarding combat. The wind and the variety of different ships provide for some really interesting and challenging engagements but the wind is somewhat of a bummer when you want to go to somewhere that is a bit far off because there is no fast travel, only the option to make time go faster.\n\nIn terms of content, the world does sometimes feel somewhat empty but with the latest update this became a lot less evident, so it seems the developers are taking player feedback at heart. This update added over 32 ports which include a whole new region that expanded the world, a new fleet, port attacks and more types of ports. Overall, all I can say is that, most of the main game mechanics are already in place and the core gameplay is a lot of fun.\n\nIf you fancy something to tickle your pirate or Warhammer needs, this might just be the game for you. The combat is great and addictive and the entire game has this great atmosphere to it. Considering the price, I’d suggest holding off if you’re not sure this offers enough content for you, but do keep an eye out for it for it shows tremendous amounts of potential.","May 11","true","13.7"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","3"

The controls can be tricky to get at first and the content is still clearly being implemented, but even at these early stages the game is entertaining.

Thus far, highly recommended.\n\nEdit - This is an early access game - unless you're ok with being a part of the development (i.e., if you're ok with not having a finished product right off), you may want to wait a bit before purchase.","April 15","true","14.5"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","27","32","3","1"

Set in the Warhammer fantasy universe. Kill greenskins. Slaughter Chaos champions, slap mouthy Britonians!\n\nEA but fairly playable. You have about 1/10th of the map, but the game mechanics are quite good, and mostly in place. Based on the roadmap I can say this game is the pirate game we have all been waiting for. Upgrade your ship! Hunt for lost treasure! The devs are even considering adding melee based on suggestions. (Although ship boarding with a revolving handcannon is quite fun. :D )\n\nSeriously if you have an inkling for adventure on the high seas, you might as well grab this now or on release.\n\n...there are considerable performance issues.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/344240/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA gothic and mysterious work of art, Man O’ War: Corsair is a naval action adventure game that focuses on the epic lore of the Warhammer World. Hauntingly lovely coastlines serve as the backdrop for picturesque battles with barbaric and mysterious races of men and beasts. At times grotesque and gory from the bloodshed, and others eerie and silent; the ship’s deck is the scene of all the action in the game. The sea literally rolls with fog. Fans of Warhammer’s Old-World adventures will find it home.\nEvil Twin Artworks has created a trail of missions across the Great Western Ocean. Your map shows your progress and helps keep up with open missions, which are logged at the top of your screen. The game is built around a minimalistic concept of sea battles and Warhammer lore. And, it does a good job of staying within that focus. It is definitely a niche product for long-time fans of the tabletop games and collectors.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nThe sea battle’s mechanics were straightforward and simple to learn. But, boarding was by far the most fun part of the battles. There seemed to be more action there. The ship itself was easy to pilot, and was able to be turned around almost on a dime. There was a fluidity of movement on the waters that was ascetically pleasing. There was night and day progression, and changing weather. The weather didn’t seem to have an effect on the physics of the ship. But, it added to the ambience. The game definitely has atmosphere.\n\nGraphics and art:\nI was most pleased with the art of the game, and collecting the backgrounds. They are artistically done and suitable for profile use. I have never played the Warhammer games myself; neither the tabletop games, nor the video game series. But, it’s hard to miss the popularity of the lore.\nThe graphics did not run well for me. The game was sluggish and laggy, occasionally freezing. While playing I experienced low framerates. And, many visual glitches and errors presented. It’s clear the game is not quite ready to come out of early access very soon. For example, characters would merge, like when the first mate took the wheel and the captain never moved. Her hat was visible protruding through the front and back of his chest. They were combined on the wheel.\n\nContent:\nThe content will surely be more fleshed out in the final release, but for now, it seems a little overpriced if you are looking at only what the game offers at the moment. The devblogs suggest that much more is in the works. I would love to see what is in the works for the ‘custom battle’ option that is still locked in the menu.\nThe AI performed randomly, walking back and forth around the ship. You could hear the characters repeating stock phrases when in various menu screens, repeating the same phrases about manning the ship. The sound effects were great. But, the music was limited. And, for now, the game is limited to single player, which just doesn’t seem to fit with the Warhammer concepts.\nThere were some personalization options. I was able to choose a female captain, which was quite unique I thought. But, the dev plan offers the potential for playing other races. That would be great. I battled a shark. I find myself more into the mythological creatures of the sea than into mythological beasts, like orcs and skaven. Leviathan, the Megalodon, and sea monsters are enough to make the game enjoyable. Rather than a pirate game, this is more a story about adventure and the bravery of exploration of uncharted waters. “Here there be monsters.” The game does that well. I think the sound of the clanging bell in the opening screen lends so much to creating the feel of the medieval world; so gloomy and atmospheric.\n\nIf you crave adventure, longing to leave the “… legends of your deeds on the waves and steel in the hearts of your enemies,” and you enjoy the world of Warhammer, then I suggest you take a look at Man O’ War: Corsair.  It promises hours of fun for battle fans of all ages.","May 1","true","14.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","4"

Do not expect a full game!\n\nMan O' War: Corsair is a high seas adventure set in the warhammer universe absed of the man o war tabletop.  A very unique setting wich hasn't been used before. This game isn't a replica of the tabletop at all instead they made a real time adventure game out of it. They are making many of the tabletop ships in nice detail in this game. At first you will think how this will ever work with how weird some ship models look. But it actually works suprisingly good. It looks realistic and you can totally immerse yourself in this game.\n\nAs of now, you can only select 1 captain male/female(wich is nice) but many more options will be added through early acces such as starting off as a Bretonnian, Empire or even a Chaos captain. There are different ships you can buy but you will be spending most of your time on the corsair ship. However you can upgrade this ship that is somewhat cheaper than buying a new ship. You can also hire a sharpshooter for your ship that you can control yourself wich is really cool. And for the ones who like it, you can walk around your ship inspecting your crew whenever you want and your 1st mate will take over the helm.\n\nThis game also offers a now still small trading system and will be expanded the more ports will come through development. You can make some sirieus money if you make it safely to a port with the gargo. You can also offcourse steal gargo from mechant ships however you will have few save havens left afterwards.\n\nThe quests in this game can be devided into 2: 1 being the kind of bigger and more scripted quests wich can quite suprise you sometimes. They are also pretty fun to do. 2 are more optional and less rewarding such as ship races and assassinations and can be found in almost every other port.\n\nAgain if you buy this game now expect to recieve just a bit of what to come, for the road map go here:\nhttp://manowarcorsair.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EA_infographic.jpg\n\nThis game has HUGE potential probarly the most potentional then any other early acces game out now. But the question is: Do you want to support the developers and help them developing the game?\n\nThe developers are very kind and have love for their game and listen to everyones suggestions. You will see them replying often to threads in the forums. They want this game to be community based so when you buy the game, you can suggest things yourself and you might see it come in the game!\n\nI recommend this game to people that are warhammer fans and who are just interested in naval games and early acces.\n\nPlease do not buy if you expect it to run perfect or be completed the next week. You might have some frame drops but I haven't expierenced a single crash in my playthrough\n\n\nThis is just a buy suggestion, I have no control over your money but if you decide to buy the game I would very much welcome you to the community :). I hope the review was clear enough for you to help your decision.","April 15","true","19.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","0"

The core concepts of Ship navel combat (good), the trading and sailing (good) and the various customization on ships and things you can do (good) are currently clearly not finished.\n\nBut whats more some of the races, ships and especially Ai (Hi Sailing into the a cliff and destroying myself escort!) need a ton of work.\n\nAnother functionality that needs a ton of work is the boarding / third person combat that currently is VERY early development and plays like a brick strapped to another brick flying and airplane by throwing them at the cockpit.\n\nBut is it bad? No. All the functionality merely needs tuning, finishing and expanding, there isn't really anything i've found - from ship combat to trading to questing - that is fundamentally messed up.\n\n\nSo, as always, i dont recommend buying a early access title unless you are like the game AS IS. and even though the potential of the game is 100% here... it just isn't here yet, so hold of on buying the title until they are closer to completion unless you are really invested in this specific title.","April 15","true","1.2"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","1"

The objective of the game is to build up a ship and a crew so that you can sail the seas in the search of treasures, pirate other ships and build alliances with factions.\n\nThe main gameplay has you sale your ship using the wind to determine your speed and mobility. Combat is done through the use of cannons by simply adjusting your range indicator to match where you want your shot to go. In addition to long rage combat, you can also bord enemy ships and engage combat between the cruises. The crews will fight until one ships surrenders. While you can't take over someone else's ship, you can take whatever cargo they are carrying. If at any time you are killed or your ship is destroyed, it's game over and you must either restart or load the last save to continue.\n\nMan O' War: Corsair does a really good job at balancing realism with fantasy in a way that makes the combat feel realistic but not at the expense of fun.\nOne of the biggest problems I've had getting into naval combat games in the past is that a lot of them were to focused on creating a realistic ship experience instead of a fun one. Man O’ War: Corsair accomplishes this by making every ship have a unique set of weaponry instead of just having more advanced ships be simply bigger ships of the smaller ships, more advanced ships will be outfitted with crazy weapons such as catapults, drills, rams and absurdly huge four cannons; increasing the depth of gameplay immensely.\n\nThe gameplay is more simplistic than any other naval combat games, having to adapt and deal with an unprecedented variety of ships keeps the gameplay from getting stale. A tactic that worked on a standard human Corsair ship may completely backfire on an orc ship. For instance, the first time I've encountered an orc ship, it was much smaller than mine but it was outfitted with a drill and a paddle propulsion system. Naturally I would try to gain distance on the ship but the power propulsion hit faster than I was moving and it ended up doing massive damage just by ramming into me.\n\nThe main progression in the game is done through collecting gold by doing quests, trading goods between towns and plundering goods from other ships. After you get enough gold, you'll be able to buy a new ship. And the starting ship is actually one of the most well-rounded ships in the game. You can use this opportunity to buy specialized ships that will allow you to do certain quests more effectively. You may not be able to take out bigger orcs ships using your starter ship and that's where a slower ship with a large cannon in the front may become useful.\nWarning: Don't try to hunt the Black Leviathan fish, you will regret it!\n\nPros- Support for Trading Cards and Steam Cloud.\n- The chance to be a pirate and fight orcs at the same time!\n- Giant sharks and other monsters of the sea waiting to attack you at any moment.\n- Nice tutorial to help you understand the naval genre experience. If you’ve never played a naval game before, it can prove to be a great opportunity to learn.\n- Unique concept that will keep you playing for hundreds of hours after the game gets out of early access.\n- A lot of fun moments, like when you try to hunt an Black Leviathan and you lure other pirate ships with you near him, then Black Leviathan eats them all, you must try it, it's a fun experience.\n- A variety of ships and ways in which you can play.\n- More simplistic gameplay than any other naval combat games for those who don't like the realistic genre.\n\nCons- No support for Achievements.\n- The rewards quest system is incredibly unbalanced. There are some quests that can take you a very significant amound of time that often reward you with much lower gold than simple quests.\n- Low framerates. It still needs a bit of general optimization to get the framerate more consistent.\n- The graphics, while suitable, need quite a bit of work.\n- No fast travel option between the ports.\n\nConclusionMan O’ War: Corsair it's a delight for those who have spent in the past over a dozens of hours in Assassin's Creed: Pirates on their phones/tablets or Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag on the PC. I'm one of those persons who separated from social life only to play Pirates on his tablet all day long. And this game is no different, even though it's in early access at this time, it has a lot of potential to be an addictive game.\nIf you're a fan of the Warhammer universe or any naval games, I recommend you to try it. The high price is reasonable for all the content that the developers promised and if that bothers you, wait till it gets out of the early access and watch a few youtube videos to check if the game changed. If you like it, buy it.\nI'm giving it an 4 out of 5.\n\nThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified and Evil Twin Artworks for providing the key for review purposes.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/344240/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEvil Twin Artworks have returned with their long awaited second title in Man O’ War: Corsair. Given how good their debut title, Victory At Sea has proven to be with an ardent fan base who still play the game as avidly as they did when it was first released it is unsurprising that they were determined to remain with a naval themed game. However, instead of having a focus on World War II they have instead paid for a license to launch a game themed on the Warhammer 40k universe and based upon the original now out-of-print table top war game by Games Workshop. At its peak its popularity was among the very highest of all of the table top games with who played it clamoring for a return of the title ever since the franchise made its debut in the video gaming medium.\n\nIt was only a matter of time until a developer decided to take the sailing features from Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag and add features from other games that inspired them. In the case of this game I can clearly see the inspiration from the classic Sid Meier’s Pirates! as well as old school adventure and RPG games with the way in which the ports are established. To be perfectly honest, however, what I am seeing a lack of at the moment, beyond the humans and the orcs races, is the Warhammer universe. However, it is early access and there is clearly a lot of work that is needing to be done before the devs can claim that their game is feature complete. It is also very apparent that the developers have placed a heavy focus on getting the game play right before they refocus on the secondary components of the game. Therefore I can say with great confidence that the game play itself is going to be of a very high standard as it is already mostly fluid and enjoyable. Things such as races and\n\nSomething that I am fond of is the way in which the game introduces itself to beginners. If you’ve never played a naval game before it can prove to be a very daunting experience. That the developers have introduced a very good tutorial without being too hands on thus allowing for the players to make mistakes and to learn from them is very good. This increases the game’s accessibility to the entire Warhammer 40k fan base who may never have considered playing an at sea game before. It proves to be intelligent game design.\n\nFrom a technical perspective the graphics, while suitable, need quite a bit of work if they’re going to reach their potential. I like what they devs have done in using the graphics to build a dark and foreboding atmosphere within the game but the combat graphics could do with being made a little sharper. The sound is more than adequate.\n\nA number of early purchasers have already spent tens of hours in the game already. So although some players have reported that there isn’t a sufficient amount of playable content within the game, and there is a lot more to be added, there is clearly more than enough to keep those who find themselves addicted entertained.  Therefore even at the relatively steep asking price the value proposition has already been met for many. I hope that when the game leaves early access that Evil Twin Artworks provide as much support for this game as what they have with Victory at Sea. If they do so then purchasers can look forward to a game that is not only popular at release but one that has sustainability built into it as well.\n\nMan O’ War: Corsair has the potential to be one of the more addictive games to emerge from Steam’s Early Access Program.","May 2","true","12.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/recommended/344240/","Psygineer","Psygineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/","1509 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroduction\nMan O' War: Corsair is a 3D Naval Combat game set in the Warhammer Universe. For the most part, you choose the kind of Captain you want to be. You are not forced into joining certain factions or doing preset story missions that are the same every time you play. Visually stunning with fantastic ambient sounds, this game has the huge potential to be one of the best Indie Ages of Piracy style games to hit Steam in quite some time.\n\nGameplay Impressions\nAgainst all odds and with a stroke of luck, you manage to get your small sailing ship to dock for much needed repairs and to take on new crew. From here on out, you live by your own terms. This is a feature I really appreciate in these kinds of games. Each time you replay the game, you can choose to play it differently. Do you want to be an honest merchant trying to earn your keep via buying and selling of trade goods? Sure, you can do that but just watch out for Pirates! Perhaps you dislike the notion of having to spend your hard-earned gold on trade goods that you will earn you only a meager profit. Have you noticed how low in the water some of those Merchant ships are sailing….ripe for the plunder. Maybe you are sick and tired of seeing those Pirates prey on the Merchants and want to clear the seas of as many of those scurvy varmints as you can. You can pretty much be any kind of Captain you want to be… and more! Well those are the standard Age of Piracy tropes out of the way; it’s time to show how this game sets itself apart from the other Age of Piracy naval combat games!\n\nOrcs, wizards and mythological beasts. That’s right, not only do you have to fear pirates (or pirate hunters you scallywag), you have to fear the bloodthirsty Orcs and the devilish beasts which want nothing more than to send your ship to the briny deep. Orc ships look considerably different from those of humans. You will shiver in dread when you see the ships themselves have huge, barbaric and menacing looking claws ready to grab and drag your ship into their firing maw. If you are lucky enough not to encounter Pirates or Orcs as you make your travels between the ports, you might very well find yourself being attacked by a massive shark or sea serpent! In fact, the first time you encounter the shark is during the tutorial, and it is very fearsome. Despite being just a game, it actually instills a bit of trepidation in you as you fight it. It is highly detailed with deadly looking teeth. The last thing to mention in this section is the Wizards, just added recently; they can be a member of your crew or the enemy. Unlike your normal crew armed with mere firearms and melee weapons, wizards can cast spells to aid their colleagues in battle. I have not had much experience with the wizards yet, but they definitely will add a fun new element to the game.\n\nSailing the high seas is the best part of this game which is a good thing, because the ports are just clickable buttons and text. When sailing, everything, from the ships to the sea and the monsters it hides, look beautiful and highly detailed. The diurnal cycle, changing weather, and ambient fog all make for a realistic and pleasurable sailing experience. The ambient music changes to a much more dynamic track when you are in danger or combat. It really helps pull you into the experience. All in all, despite being a very Early Access title, it almost feels like it is a complete game as it is despite the fact the Developer is currently actively supporting it and adding new content.\n\nA telltale sign that it is Early Access though is the fact that right now there is very little in the way of character customization options. You can choose the name and gender of your Captain and that is about it. There are only two character models in the game currently. You can also name your ship and select the sails it will fly. Lastly there are currently three difficulty settings which affect how much gold you start with and how much of your damage is repaired for free upon docking at a friendly port.\n\nPorts, despite not being entirely that interesting to dock at, can be quite appealing in their own way. There are towers stationed near each of the ports. If you have been hunting too many of their ships, or they just don’t like you for not having green skin, you will come under fire if you attempt to dock. You can then battle it out with the fortifications if you choose to, or you can turn tail and try to sail away before any of their ships engage you.\n\nDespite just being buttons, the ports still feel lively. While at ports you can repair and upgrade your ship, take on new crew and buy them new weapons, trade supplies, listen to gossip, buy clues to the location of hidden treasure or take on mostly randomly generated missions. There are several kinds of missions that can be available. There are the special missions related to just that particular port (such as a zombie outbreak!), and then there are the common ones. The common ones can entail racing another ship to another port, bounty hunting, escorting another ship, or moving cargo around. The common missions can get a bit repetitive, but they are really just there to get you to move between ports and get you a little gold in the process. You are far better off just living free and going where you want when you want and selling what booty you plunder on the way. Chasing treasure maps can be quite fun too. You get a map which is basically just a picture of a landmark and a name. You find the place in the world and search for the treasure, it might be there, it might not be. You might find a completely unrelated wreck to salvage in the process too.\n\nOne thing that is lacking from this game that keeps me from saying it is the best Age of Piracy game ever is the fact that despite being able to board enemy ships, all you can do is loot their cargo if you win. You can’t capture their ship and take it as your own. This is quite disappointing. I’d love to be able to make up a fleet of ships that I have captured, or in the very least, just be able to take control of their ship, abandoning my old one. Currently the only way to get a better ship in this game is to earn enough gold to purchase it. This can take quite some time depending on your luck.\n\nOne other observation to make before closing is the controls of the game and the AI. When sailing the ship, the controls are very simple and fluid. I have no complaints at all about the controls or the responsiveness of the ship. The ability to switch between and control the special crew members of your ship also works quite well, in fact that is a feature I rather like. The only real complaint I have is the AI itself and I am just being nitpicky here due to the fact the game is so early in the development cycle that this kind of issue is easily forgiven. The AI in the game is quite buggy still. Often during boarding missions, enemy crew or my crew get stuck together or to objects and just run in place rather than entering combat properly. A good example of this took place when I was battling an Orc ship that heavily out gunned and out crewed me due to all the battle damage I had already sustained. I knew I was about to sink so I quickly initiated boarding action in the hopes that I might get extremely lucky. It started and the orcs swarmed over. They slaughtered my crew for the most part… but I didn’t die. There were no orcs left on my deck… puzzled I switched to my sharpshooter in the crow’s nest and quickly spotted the problem. Three orcs were stuck together, another two were glued together with one of my crew floating just above them. The rest were just kind of running in place. I used the sharp shooter to pick of the orcs, killing my floating crewman in the process and won the battle. I gained reputation and got a discount when I repaired my near death ship. Thanks to that bug, I lived to tell the tale!","May 14","true","12.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

Captain. . .  Starboard! We have a ship coming towards us. Do you recognize the emblem on the Sail? No Captain! How many sailors on the deck? At least thirty, Captain. . . But…  But what sailor? They are all looking green Captain. Green! Give me the spyglass before you tell me frogs are sailing a vessel right at us! ARRG, they are green alright, it’s an Orc ship! Everyone to their battle post, this is going to be a fierce battle!\n\nMan O’War: Corsair is an exploring / adventure/ action combat naval game which takes place on the coastline of the Warhammer world. At the start of the game, you will have to give a name to your Captain and slightly customize your new ship. Then you will be lead into a couple of missions which will teach you the combat phase and what to do when you reach a port. Actually, quite a good tutorial. Then it will be all up to you!\n\nYou will be able to visit up to 50 ports in the world. There, you will be able to visit locations. At the tavern, you might find some very interesting information - about treasures, what type of stocks other ports are running low of, and more. At the Market, you can buy and sell stocks for a profit. At the dock, you can purchase weapons for your Captain and your sharpshooter, refit or repair your ship, purchase a new ship and recruit crew members. Don’t forget to check the noticeboard; this is where you select your mission!\n\nAt sea, well you might have a nice, peaceful journey from one port to another, or you might engage in fierce battles with pirates. You will have close encounters with mighty and frightening sea creatures, too. You can see on your map where those confrontations are most likely to happen. Naval battles are really fun and I find the mechanism really easy to use. Shooting cannonballs to your foe is simple - all you have to do is move the camera to the left or right of your ship, and by holding the right button on your mouse a red curve arrow will appear. Then move your mouse forwards or backwards to choose the distance, “FIRE” and hopefully you will hit your target. Oh, by the way, they will fire back at you, too! It can become hectic when you are facing more than a couple of ships at once. Try to get as close as you can to a ship if you want to board it. If you decide to do so, your Captain will draw his weapon and you will start to fight on the ship. You will be able to swap characters between the captain and the sharpshooter but make sure to protect the Captain (yourself) very well if you are playing the sharpshooter. If he dies, it is game over!  Eliminate the crew of the opposite ship and you will win the battle. It’s really fun to play! Oh, I nearly forgot; it is most likely that you will acquire the ship’s cargo upon your triumph.\n\nIn terms of graphics, they are good. However, I would like to see more detail on the coastline and ports. It is a bit bland. The control works fine and I personally have not encountered any crashes so far.\n\nMan O’ War: Corsair is a very impressive early access game and it shows massive potential. I can’t wait to see more!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good graphics overall\n-	Good battle mechanism\n-	Fight Pirates, Orcs and Sea Monsters\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No Achievements (early access)\n-	No fast travel option\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

I'd oft ponder, sailing away from another shattered, smoking ruin in the oceans of said game. It wasn't until I'd come across Man O' War: Corsair that the question was answered: both of them are welcome additions to the naval combat genre. Although I enjoy AC4: Black Flag more for its refinement (this review is based on Early Access build 0.1.2) and my dislike of the so-called 'Assassin' side of the game makes me appreciate the Jackdaw segments far greater, Man O' War: Corsair matches AC in its execution of being on the high seas; all it needs right now is more of it.\n\nOriginally a tabletop game by Games Workshop, Man O' War has been turned into a turn-based tactics title into a real time naval simulator. Still based in the Old World (none of your Age of Sigmar tripe) with familiar factions, Corsair allows you to travel Manaan's realm without the worry of timelines or story, thrusting you into an open world brimming with adventure and possibilities. Or in most cases, have you sail gently in the open world. Upon starting the game one can create their Captain, currently only Empire and Independant captains are available. Naming them, assigning their gender and a name to their ship is all that can really be done in terms of character creation, but the game will allow for customisation later on... if you're willing to get your boots wet.\n\nThere isn't much of a goal to Man O' War: Corsair - you can choose to be the Saint of Sartosa, ruining your reputation with friendly ports by indiscriminately attacking any nearby ships, or you can build up strong friendships to get better prices when trading with the Empire, and have them at your side when fighting the Orc and Pirate blight. There are quests you can do in the port towns along the coastlines, such as races, escorts, courier service and assassinations of captains and their vessels, each intending to fill your pockets with coin on a job well done. However the freebooter in you might just wanna have fun, entering the seas aimlessly or heading to mega-map blips indicating gargantuan sea monster locations (currently there's only 2 sea monsters: gigantic narwhals and sharks) or to take out some ships and plunder their booty.\n\nWhen dealing with ships the combat is divine, even better than my favourite pirate game (the one mentioned so frequently above), as it allows you to damage individual parts of the ship. Want to immobilise an enemy? Burn the sails! Are their bombardments too much? Take out the mortars! Are the enemy getting too close? Destroy the ram.... or drill, in the case of the Orcs! Damaging individual parts makes the game feel more strategic, even if in this build of the game it's not immediately noticeable. Not to mention the cosmetic damage including torn/burning sails, fires bursting out, ships being chipped away at and blown to smithereens makes it all the more engaging! However the boarding could be better; the captain can't aim to save their life, with poor mouse and movement controls making player characters feel like they've got two peglegs and two hooks for hands. Considering how poor their aim is, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they had two eyepatches on. This is a stark contrast to the ship weapons though, with sensitive and precise controls that respond immediately, allowing for fair and fun combat.\n\nUnfortunately the game doesn't look or run too well. It's not terrible which is a pleasant surprise given how the game takes place almost entirely on water. The textures are incredibly poor, as are some of the particle effects, making me often repeat myself saying "this is too early for early access". And that phrase applies to the content too - although many have gotten 40+ hours into the game, I struggled to get much more than four before being fatigued. If you're going into this game, you have to have the mindset of a goal or a desire, be it to plunder or to parade your mighty ship across the ocean.\n\nThe way I recommend early access games is thus: if the development of the game were to cease right now, due to any reasons (tragegy in the developers' lives, taking the money but not updating, etc.), could I recommend this game? Currently, it's a hard yes. It's a great game for naval enthusiasts and those who love piracy in video games, and because it's a niche genre it's a safe purchase. On the other hand, the Warhammer license alone will not be enough if you're not into sailing games. If you've never played one but want to experiment with the genre, this is a good one to try.... but also try others like Sid Meier's Pirates! and AC4: Black Flag.\n\n\nNeed to see some gameplay?

Sid Miers pirates, AC Black flag and on the economic side a bit of mount and blade style trading but from port to port rather than castles.\n\nIt's very playable in it's current iteration and the battles are quite enjoyable. There are a few bugs here and there but I have not experienced a single crash or anything hugely game breaking. The economy needs a little tweaking and maybe some higher rewards to incentivise long distance regional trading but what's there at the moment works reasonably well.\n\nYou can approach the game in different ways and build your relationships with different factions by attacking their enemies or completing delivery, assasination or escort missions for them. Working for the empires makes you unpopular with pirates and there is much more cash in piracy than trading and running missions for empires. It does bring a lot of extra heat though so make sure your ship is fully upgraded before converting to piracy. (it's easy to gain faction standing with the pirates by sacking a couple of empire ports)\n\nThe weather systems are fairly well done but there seems to be a lot more stormy weather than calm and sometimes that can feel a little oppressive. I'm sure some weather options could be added to compensate for this later so it's a minor really. A battle against an empire fleet in the dead of night with booms of thunder and lightning crackling across the sky certainly add to the atmosphere, although the rolling mist can get in the way of targeting enemy ships.\n\nThere are creatures to hunt down too and I've had a couple of jump out my skin moments when surprised by them (looking out for them and not realising they are bearing down to chomp on my ship).\n\nThere is a good variety of ships to have to deal with as the game stands and I've found that slightly different tactics work best when dealing with an individual ship type. There is not really a one size fits all.\n\nOne thing that the game really needs to implement as soon as possible is different shot types (Chain, grape). It will make immobilising ships a useful tactic when being pursused by an empire fleet. You can still take the sails out as the game stands but alternative shot types that do that job more efficiently would be an excellent addition.\n\nAll in all a very enjoyable sea romp with enough there to keep you busy as you wait for the game to be updated. On that note the devs seems quite receptive and have implemented changes based on user feedback. They seem to be quite busy with patching and getting the foundations right before moving on to implement wider ideas. I see that as a positive in development terms.\n\nAs it stands in early access I would have no hesitation in recommending the game to others.","May 22","true","32.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The sailing became a key point in the gameplay and soon I found my copy of the game drifting back to Gamestop for a trade-in. Flash forward to April 16, 2016 and another opportunity to set sail on an open sea. The setting enticed me enough to give a crack at another sailing simulator, but would the third time be the charm? (Naval Action was the second try.)\n\nWarhammer has always provided a unique and varied atmosphere from fantasy to science fiction, tabletop to first person shooter. While Evil Twin Artworks could have taken the easy route and made this a carbon copy of the tabletop, they decided to go in a different direction. They still maintained the Warhammer aesthetic and it shows in the design of the ports and ships to the style of speech used by the NPCs. Enemy types are lacking at the moment, but the stable Orc armada and enormous sea monsters stand out in a good way, breathing life into the open seas. It is enough to make even the most skeptic of Warhammer fans giddy with delight.\n\nThe strongest aspect of the game is certainly found in the combat, which is thoroughly explained in the tutorial provided at the start of the game. It is a simple system of line of fire and distance similar to Assassin's Creed 4. Turning and firing seems simple enough on the outside, but throwing in the wind direction and multiple enemy units quickly makes things challenging enough to keep each fight enjoyable. Boarding enemy ships is also an option and can give you a chance at more cargo (as well as the chance to go musket to musket) than if you would blowing them up with cannon fire.\n\nCargo bought in town or won from random encounters plays into the trading system that offers another way to make coin. Simply purchases or win different units of traceable items and sell for a higher price at another city. It is simple, but very rewarding. Slightly less rewarding is the quest system, which is the standard fair for any action game. It does allow another option for combat though, which is always a plus. Random encounters also reward gold as well as notoriety.\n\nAll of this coin can be used to purchase new ships with very different designs or upgrades that can go head to toe with the other ship variation. Each ship has a different load out for cannon type and direction for a new style of play to keep things interesting. This ranges from a single giant cannon on the front of a ship to a warship armed to the teeth with cannons pointed in each direction. They are very creative investments.\n\nWhile the game has some strong points, it is ultimately weighed down by some major issues. Content is extremely limited; offered by just a few ports and the quests provided by them can be finished within a couple of hours. The quests boil down to either get to point A to B, eliminate a target, gather this item or the rare story quest. Traveling takes awhile (even with the x2 speed) when forced to fight against the wind which can be annoying when listening to the same dialog spouts over and over again. The game is also prone to frame rate stutters and is very noticeable during combat. Graphically, there is an issue with lighting during hours of darkness and random black boxes appear from time to time. Clipping is an issue with crew members and they can be seen getting stuck to the stairs, cannons and even in enemy boarding units.\n\nCombat issues range from minor to game breaking. There are times crew will not board the enemy ship and it is up to you to locate the random enemy unit glitches into a wall to finish the fight. There are times you will sink a ship only to be boarded at the last second, bringing up the transfer page for the enemy vessel. The worst bug by far though has to be when you are boarded and stuck in the attack sequence even when all of the enemy crew have been defeated, forcing the player to reload a previous save file. This has happened mainly when boarded by the enemy, but it happens almost every time and makes it imperative to sink the Enemy before they can get close.\n\nIf it were not for the optimization issues, graphical problems and the last bug I mentioned, I would have probably recommended the game at the current stage of development. Evil Twin Artworks has done a fantastic job adapting the Man O'War tabletop game into a real time arcade game, but it falls short on a mechanical level. I will continue to monitor their progress as the months go by and hopefully closer to launch I can change this down to a up. Until then, it is best to keep this vessel in the shipyard while it continues to improve.\n\nPros\n\n- Warhammer centric environment\n- Simple and addictive combat\n- Robust trading system\n- Varies ship designs and upgrade options\n\nCons\n\n- Frame rate stuttering\n- Limited content\n- Game breaking glitches\n- Graphical infidelity","April 18","false","10.0"," 30 of 58 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","30","58","2","6"

Not to damn with faint praise, but it's...well, it's an early-access Warhammer pirate simulator. If you go into it with that in mind, you'll not be terribly disappointed.

Say it to yourself every so often and then imagine what it will be like when the devs clean it up, polish it, and then add some more of the stuff you love.\n\nIf you aren't the patient sort, maybe look for the full-release.
