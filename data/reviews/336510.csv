Until they shut it down because no one was playing it anymore.  I noticed it was offered through steam and I wanted to come back for 2 main reasons.\nFirst, to see if anything had been changed, improved in all that time and the most important one was so when I wrote this review it would be as accurate as possible.  Yes, I did forget about this game and most of the content in 2 years so I wanted to be accurate.\n\nFirst of all let me give you my recommendation, NO, please do not download or play this game.\n\nFor those of you with no patience it is sid meyers sim city meets micro transactions.\n\nThe game is a browser game port that requires flash to play.  It is hardwired so that it prefers google chrome flash over adobe flash.  Up to a few days ago if you had a semi modern pc or laptop you could not even get into the game because it did not recognisze a 64 bit flash version as a valid one.  Yes, it was a straight port over from browser to steam.\n\nOkay I will step up on my soap box, I personally do not think browser games or phone games belong on steam period.\nNow I will step off of my soap box and tell you why this game, this Anno Online is bad.\n\nBefore I do that I want to give 2 points away to those few people who give this a positive review.  It is not pay to win, there  is no PVP at all, barely any combat I will go into that in detail in a bit.  Let us call it what it is, pay to play.  There is someone in the forum who claimed to be able to unlock everything for free but he did spend over 400 days doing it.  I can not confirm or deny it but it does sound about right.  Let me give you a warning here.  If you ever miss one day logging in your loyalty program will drop back to day 1, even if you did spend 2 years playing it.\nMy second point I will give those few people with a positive review is if you are going to write a review, good or bad please use more then 1 word so it is helpful.  Okay got those out of the way.\n\nThe game is pretty staright forward.\nYour little ship shows up on a new island, you build your first house and your first woodcutter.  Total population 1, yeah.\nThen you will spend the next 8 to 10 hours depending on how familiar you are with sid meyers sim city games to grow your population from 1 pioneer to 1500 vassals. You will make houses, farms, markets and wells, maybe a church here or there.  Then you scratch your head and go, hmmm, now what.\n\nNow you hit the first pay wall.  Your little settlers are asking you to give them linen shirts which takes hemp which your main island does not have.  So now you have 2 choices.  One you can go to the market place and buy a little island with hemp or build an explorer ship and hope to find one.  This process can take anywhere from 1 day if you are really really really lucky to a week to a month depending on what you find.  This is assuming you managed to avoid all those pop ups for micro transactions getting here.  So for arguments sake, you really "don't" have to buy your first island it just helps.\n\nThen you have your little island.  You think, lets rename it hemp island or something.  Nope, you can not rename any of your islands or ships.  You repeat the sid meyer city building, a few houses, a few woodcutters and some hemp farms.  Now you make your settlers on your main island happy right??  Ah, not really.  What you find is that the little trade ship you can build, or buy can haul back about 5 shirts.  It will take you at least another little hemp island and another trade ship to make any kind of progession in game at all.\n\nOkay so you are still playing, you have your little hemp island and your main island with its 1500 vassals.  By now your pop up help menu has annyoed enough to no end that you will start trying combat.\n\nCombat involves 3 ship types, the brig, the caravel and the galley.  Each one is good against one type, poor against one type and even against ships of the same hull.  You will line up your little ships, hit attack and they move forward like in a chess match and shoot cannons. Period, plain and simple.  Of course you have gem items like chain shot or smoke screens or repair kits to make it a bit more interesting.  For arguments sake, yes you can make these if you get cannon balls as a reward but you will use up way more then you ever get.\n\nStill playing, wow, if you managed to finally unlock the next section you will see that your little settlers now are asking for more goods that you can not make on your home island or your little tiny hemp island.  So now you hit your second paywall.  Do you buy a medium sized island, or a large island or a huge island.  Keep in mind they cost up to 19,000 rubies or $60 each and you can own 12 islands currently.\n\nIn my opinion you can buy the stand alone pc copy Anno 1404 and play it for about $10 and have a better, more complete and fun experience.\nFor a better all round experience I would recommend you pick up any of the Patrician series games, where you can actually move your ships in combat, fire the cannons etc.","October 23, 2015","false","29.0"," 84 of 102 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","84","102","8","1"

This game is constantly changing and always for the better.\n\nUnlike most Free to play games, Anno Online has NO PVP, which makes for a different environment.  My fellow players and myself have a very helpful community VS one out to kill each other.  Another thing that sets Anno Online apart from the others is that you don't need to buy the ingame currency to get anywhere, all you need is a little amount of time... I didn't hit the top population on the starting island till a year after I started playing, but no other player insulted me, or kicked me out of their guild because i hadn't hit the "End Game".\n\nGame play of Anno Online is very much like Anno 1404 AKA Dawn of Discovery (in North America), Except for a few major changes;\n\n1) There is no Spice/indigo/silk Islands - all the oriental goods that you made in 1404 are instead Sold by a NPC vendor\n\n2) Monuments -  In Anno Online Monuments are 100% different and there are more monuments than in any other Anno game.\n\n3) Island colonization - there is no NPC stealing the island you wanted in Anno online, you find islands for yourself and only yourself, they are 100% random and very different... but i will admit it's hard to find just the "right" island\n\n4) Interactions with other players - you help your neighbors in Anno online by sending buffs or your constructor over to their islands, and in turn you get rewarded for some of it... there is no hostile interactions between players.\n\n5) Construction - in Anno online, you can move buildings with no resource penalty but deleting you only get back 1/4th of what you put in. VS other Anno games where if you put a building down you have to delete to put it somewhere else, which in most missions you lose 1/2 resources.\n\n6)Combat-  In anno games you control the ships and they fight the other ships in real time with little to no rewards... in Anno Online, Possibly cause it's too much strain on the servers the combat is Turn Based, but every combat you enter gives you rewards, these rewards can be spent on fun things to boost your economy with one issue, it's a strain on your economy early on to be building up and doing PVE, and many veteran players suggest doing the PVE to mid/late stages of the game.\n\nNow it isn't a proper review without posting a few negative points;\n\n1) Zone locks- these freaks of nature can hurt, and sadly seem more frequent now with more players coming in from the steam community, but there is 2 ways that I know BB handles these... first is the auto script, it runs every day at midnight server time (8pm eastern time)- 90% of zone locks are fixed this way... I have had a zone lock and the auto script handled it.   The other way is BB has to go in and find the error, sadly this takes time and can take from days to weeks to even a month in some cases. however sad you do get reimbursed for time lost.\n\n2) Minor combat bugs - since this latest patch these might not show up... but on some maps after attacking and winning a boat may get 'stuck' and becomes unusable... i haven't seen if the map is still in the game after this last patch but they can happen if near an island for combat.\n\n3) Construction- losing 3/4 of resources spent is a major blow if you built the wrong building.\n\n4) early game - it's slow... very slow but that's why we have our friendly chat system to make you forget how long something takes.\n\n5) As with all multiplayer games, Trolls  just can't avoid them on the internet.\n\n6) This one is more personal- can't use steam client with the web started accounts.  This is something I would love to be added in the future.\n\n7) lack of a 2nd ruby cutter... would be nice to cut rubies faster... but it's again a personal complaint.\n\nAll in all I like the game and would recommend it to others!\n\nSince writing this post I started working on a US based fan site for Anno Online.\nIf you are looking for more information about the game, head over to AnnoAddiction.com","July 28, 2015","true","0.7"," 54 of 66 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","54","66","4","0"

How can a game be P2W if there is nothing to win, this is a single player building game not a moba.  All you can pay to do is speed up the game.  No one in their right mind would think being able to pay to skip a level in a single player game would equal P2W.  Besides the gems are entirely unnecessary to enjoy the game and in fact you get the gems for free throughout the game.  Now that I got that out of the way I'm not entirely sold on this game.  At the end of the day it's a resource management game and a very vanilla one at that.  Most people would find this game boring.  You should know going in that this is not a very exciting game and it takes time to get what you want done.  So if you go in expecting a slow methodical building game that you casually play to relax you'll have a good time.  If you want something more fast paced and interactive I suggest you skip this game.","August 10, 2015","true","17.4"," 57 of 77 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","57","77","2","0"

You log in, build a little, upgarde some buildings, and once you use up the resources generated over the past 15+ hours you are pretty much done and have to wait a day for your resources and money to replenish to continue.\nIf you don't have a lot of time and just want to build a little each day Anno Online is a good choice; however if you are after a game you can sit and play for hours at a time building up a huge empire without limitations you are better off with a full Anno game be it 1404 similar to Anno Online in style or 2070 with a futuristic setting.\n\nIn my opinion it's better to spend a bit of money up front and buy Anno 1404. You will get a lot more out of it and you don't have to constantly wait for things to finish.\nBut Anno Online is free, so no reason not to try it especially if you never played any Anno games before and if you'd prefer a lot slower pace with little building each day.\n\n","July 15, 2015","true","145.5"," 40 of 57 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","40","57","3","0"

Day of this review I try to get back to my town... loading screen took half an hour only for a small window to appear saying "Your zone was locked" with the only options being an ok button.  I figured it was a mistake so I reloaded the game four times.. each time the same result.  I checked their forum to see how to fix this and turns out this happens constantly... the game data degrades on you and locks you out and the unlocking period if you send in a ticket takes a long time only for it to happen days later.  I feel cheated in some way... literally wasted my own time I could of spent elsewhere on this game only for it to break on me.  This game may be free but apparently if you don't spend any money on it to buy gems from their in-game store you're dubbed a free player and your tickets are ignored... I didn't buy anything from their store with real money.  My only options are restart from scratch or waste more of my time on a game that stops working on you after a short time period.  This game.... left a very foul taste in my mouth... and made by the same company who I've already gave a bad review for another of their games turned crappy...

Although i did buy Anno 1404 just to try it out, I actually prefer this game to Anno 1404.\n\nIt's the sort of game where you play a little while then come back later. The fact that you can move buildings around to optimize population and farms is one of it's stronger points. There's a scoreboard tab in the quest book which shows population, so you can compete with other players if you want to.\n\nWhere it really shines is the quests they give you, simple things but it's fun to mess around with ships and population (more population, more gold).\n\ni personally ignored the ship battle part of the game, you can do that if you want, although you might be one island short at the end, but it doesn't matter. Yes, there are several islands you will be able to build on, and you can swap between them at any time, another good feature.\n\nYou can make friends and join guilds, but i never bothered with the guilds. I would have liked to play the Steam version with my old account, but it won't let me.\n\n1) A few tips before you start, don't spend your rubies, keep them to upgrade the Ruby Cutter, costs 2,999 rubies. You get rubies every week and when you increase in level.\n2) You can buy wood with gold from the store but it's limited to a certian amount.\n3) Do not place the Guildhall down, it is a waste of space, you can't remove it, and you won't need it.\n\nI recommend this game especially if you like the old The Settlers games, where it takes time to do stuff, it's made by the same makers.","August 5, 2015","true","0.1"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","0"

It's easy, very laid back and self-managing. The game has a positive, dedicated community (since all the add ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ here on the internet are driven away by their inherient ADD) and, although the first island is the same for everyone, the rest of the islands you begin colinizing (after a few days to a week of playing) are quite randomly generated (not ENTIRELY, yet still enough to feel satisfying, and make you picky enough to constantly look for bigger and better islands). It even has event with unique items apparantly, cant wait to see how this halloween turns out!\n\n\nThe only downsides I actually have to this game at all is that it's hard to load at times. If the game hogs on the loading screen after 2-3 minutes, close and reopen it, repeat until it works; this was a huge problem to start, but seems to be more stable after awhile. Besides that, it's a little buggy, and crashes, yet "nothing game-breaking".\n\nI don't know what else people who are complaining expect from this game....its a builder, you build things, hurr......don't need to pay them money to build, at all.

I'm sure a lot of people out there on Steam are tired of seeing mobile/browser games continually released on steam as Freemium titles, and yes, to the more enthusiast segment of gamers this game probably isn't for you.\n\nThat said, the Steam edition of Anno Online, in my opinion, is better than the browser equivalent for a couple of reasons.

This is truly just a little time killer that you check on every now and then to expand or construct a piece of your empire. It is slowpaced because of how the system works, much like Clash of Clans.\n\nNow, as for graphics, they truly are just 2D pictures painted on your computer screen. None if this fancy Blizzard 3D engine that takes a supercomputer to run.\n\nSo, in this game's defense, it is build on microtransactions to speed your game up. It's a money sink.

I am playing this game for 1 year and more, but I had a stop of something like 6-8 months. But since I returned I keep playing the game. So the game is typical anno- you construct, collect resrouces, trade with other players and if you want, you can make some naval battles.\nFirst things first.\nYou need patience for this game. It is the same typical time strategy. You wait for minutes or hours for something to be completed.\nSometimes you will progress very slowly and you will even think that you do not progress at all, but sometimes your progress could be fast as a bullet, shot from AK-47.\nThe economy is typical to the Anno games- for some tools and equipement you will need another one, created from a resource.\nYou discover new islands but you need to unlock the slot first.\nThe premium currency are gems. But because I have a building that actually I can make gems, I feel like I do not need to spend a cent for the game. You have daily log-in reward and every 7th day, you get some raw gems that you can transfer to real gems and use them. After you upgrade your building 240 raw gems = 240 gems, but before that it is 240 raw gems = 120 gems, so you better upgrade that building first.\nThere are people in the chat if you want to chat. The game is not dead at all. There are many people.\nThe graphics are good for the eye and you will enjoy them.\nThis game have naval combats, but they are dumb as ♥♥♥♥. I mean, you have to grind like a mad man to progress. I really do not enjoy this and I really do not make naval battles. You really do not need them to progress. So I suggest you skip this ♥♥♥♥ and probably come back when you reach your max level of lighthouse, which you can use total of 49 ships, with no upgrades. So yes, there is a ship limiter too.\nBut it is nice to see your harbours with the many ships that come and go with resources, trade ships that come to deliver the goods or buy some goods.\nSo I have unlocked all the buildings. This means that I have an island with more than 4000 nobles, which are really hard to get.\nOf course if you pay and get many gems, you will progress extremely fast.\nOverall I suggest this game if you have the patience to play it.","February 10","true","0.5"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","21","43","3","0"

Außerdem langwierig genug um das Gefühl zu haben man würde einen Vollpreistitel spielen.\nNegativ: Der Echtgeldmist. Klar, es ist FTP und irgendwie muss sich sowas auch finanzieren, aber tut diese Rubin♥♥♥♥e wirklich Not? Man kann die Rubine dem Spieler doch gleich so geben, ohne das er sie sich noch innerhalb von Tagen (!!) selbst zusammenstoppeln muss. Die Idee dahinter hab ich noch nicht ganz verstanden. Außerdem hätte man statt den "Missionen", die sowieso den nächsten logischen Schritt des Spiels darstellen, doch einfach Erfolge einbauen können. Das dauernde Aufploppen an der Seite nervt.\n\nUnd an alle Hater des Spiels: Anno online ist ein Spiel, das knapp 600 MB groß ist und nichts kostet. Habt ihr da wirklich erwartet, dass das das Spielerlebnis eines Anno 2205 ersetzt?

I'm still on lvl 15, and I can say: it's a good game. IMO, is the best browser-based game ever (since the others that I liked so much are dead now, like The Sims Social...).\n\nAlso, I've never payed a single "ruby" (cash) in this game, and my island still growing. The secret is: play some minutes today, you money and resources will end and tomorrow everything will be filled again. I'm doing this since March 2015, and today I've almost 3000 rubys.

The visual of the houses and the island itself as also very good. And the game is free, and the space is almost invisible to your hardrive.\n\nBad:\n\n- A think nothing;\n\nMaybe the difficult.

Its still far better than many/all mobile city builder games, those are horrific bad games that no one should ever pay/play ( so devs of such godawfull games never get any money and those games disappear forever, hopefully to be replaced by the likes of this or better).\n\nThis game is fairly fun, it fills a niche "check once in a while at work or when you have a small break from the kids". for full builder game experience i play anno 2070, but often theres no time for a lengthy game of 2070, so i glance at anno online, spend whats accumulated and turn off again. Havent spent any money on it yet, and depending on how slow it gets i may never, if it keeps a good pace ill buy the starter pack to support the devs, but if it degenerates into a "24 days to complete this or skip for 24 billion rubys", i wont spend i daim, ill just keep on playing for free. Devs of these kind of games should set a limit on how long anything takes to get built/done and it should never exceed 24 hours, maybe 48 in some extreme cases as to not fall into the category explained above.\n\nbrowser game rating 8.5/10\n\nThis may change based on future experince.","July 15, 2015","true","457.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It's not terrible, but there are definitely better games out there, and I never recommend that anyone waste their time.\n\nI tried really hard to like this game.  I gave it every possible chance to impress me..... but, no dice.  Frankly, it is under-featured, the gameplay is dated (at a date somewhere around 1991), and the development team seems so obsessed with controlling possibly offensive content that they have gutted any form or fashion of customization.  If you do play, take care choosing your nick-name, since it's the last thing you get to customize.  All island and ship-names are generated by the game.  So much for immersion.  I got saddled early on with two islands with the same name, and no options to fix it, which was prohibitively confusing, considering you have to coordinate shipping routes between these islands to grow the economy.\n\nAs far as city builders go, again, it's a "meh".  With no competitive play and the weakest PVE system I've seen in years, building and upgrading are monotonous and repetitive almost to pointlessness.  It was only a sense of "this game can't break me"  that got me to care at all.\n\nSo, now that the reason for the thumbs down is out of the way, here are the good points, kind of.  I have only played on the UK "Mermaid" server, so I don't know if all of these factors are consistent from server to server.\n\nThe moderators:  The mods were polite, and as helpful as they could be.  Apparently, however, their powers don't extend much beyond kicking people from the chat and answering an occasional question.  Twice I have been told by moderators that they had no experience with the Steam Client, and thus couldn't help with Steam-related issues.\n\nThe players:  This is the friendliest, most helpful game community I have ever seen.  The global chat looks like a constant beginner's tutorial, as players take time out from their own game to answer questions and fill in the gaps for the un-necessarily cryptic quest instructions  and inadequate game documentation.  Why did I play for seven weeks?  Because the players were fun, even if the game wasn't.\n\nThe price:  It's free.  I have, however, played many, many much better developed free2play games.\n\nIn the end, it's a shame, because there are building blocks here that could have been a really good game TWENTY YEARS AGO.  But, it's 2015, and experienced gamers (of which you will not find many on Anno-Online) have expectations of gameplay, challenge, immersion, and graphics that this game does not meet in any way.  I would seriously recommend to the developers that they play some of the games made by the competition, and get some idea of how a contemporary city-building game should look, play and work.\n\nLastly, I am a longtime fan of Ubisoft games.  If you likerd their blockbuster titles, or even the Anno franchise, do not assume that this game comes anywhere close to the quality of those games.\n\n2.5/10  I might log in now and again to say hello to the nice people I met in chat.","August 31, 2015","false","211.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Im thinking all the bad review I saw were right after it was released and it had some issues? I absolutely LOVE this game so far and am about 2 hours into it. It has a little bit of banished, and a few pieces of other city builder games that so  far has been wonderful to me.\nI have gotten no lag since I started playing, no loading issues, and no errors. Everything has run very smoothly. The buildings and graphics look great to me, very pleasing to the eyes.\nWith that out of the way I will explain a little on why I like it. You start out with a simple tutorial to show you what you need to know. Build a few houses, and make sure they have water and a market nearby. As you expand you get new items to build and open up new areas of the map/island. You get bonuses when you level up and complete tasks at the left side of your map. I havent seen a need to spend real money yet so far. If you missplace something or want to reorganize your town, theres an easy move tool so you dont need to demolish anything and rebuild it elsewhere.\nI think before anyone passes by this game to just sit down for an hour to learn it THEN decide if its for you. I will be continuing to play it. :)","July 8, 2015","true","2.2"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","11","25","3","0"

Anything which you can buy in the shop you can get in the game without paying a cent. you can earn and get runies in the game , sure its slower but its not a game you play overnight or in a week or even a month. its a long term game that you can play and enjoy for years , improving and building your city. The community on the server i play on (in the usa) if fantastic, very helpful. and yes its identical to the web based browser version except when you log in you can only access one server per account. in a web browser you can play on multiple servers , each one in its own world. it is a very addictive number chunching / time management game. there is always something to do , move stuff around to make it more efficient. collect the blue blobs of goodies that appear at times and every hour you get a ship coming in to give you more money.\n\nits a thinking game where you plan things and as you grow you have to move things around and keep supply and usage in ballance. there are lots of quests that will teach you and lead you through the game.\n\nin closing its by far one of (if not) the best FREE online browser game around. i have played many many over the years. its not a new game but is still being updated some people have been playing it since at least 2013\n\nAll the negative reviews are from those that don't want to understand the game as its not their style of game thats fine, however there are lots of people out there that are expecting it to be the next great slice of heaven, and have pvp (which it doesn't) and thats the beauty of it the community helps players. theres trading goods on the auction house\n\nI highly recommend it over games like evony etc. theres a lot more happening in it to keep your interest","July 15, 2015","true","664.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I think they are great. One of my favorites is Dawn Of Discovery (America) or Anno 1404 (Europe) (Same game). If I must compare the two, Anno Online wouldn't be a bad game itself. But there is tons of Micro-transactions and the game uses models from Anno 1404 that are degraded and look like a game from the early 2000's. Now don't get me wrong, graphics aren't what make a game good. Its the gameplay. The game makes you wait to get resources, the furthest (My estimate) is that atleast 60% of people got bored of wating. After the tutorial you wait long times for stone. Now my list:\n\nPros: Free to Play, Multiplayer, Good tutorial, Customizable icon, And that is about it.\n\nCons: Bad connection problems, bad graphics, poor combat, lots of Micro-transactions, Its unstable, seems like a facebook game.\n\nOverall Score: 5/10","July 21, 2015","false","3.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

All this without warning, just an email sent outright stating that (Due to the nature of the name you have chosen, your account has been banned) All the while, I am £7.22 out of pocket that i have just spent on it. If this is how moderators of this game treat it's gamers, I am no longer interested in playing it.. I have asked for a refund since I got banned without any warning, they refuse to issue me with a refund and throwing ToS at me. As a new player to the game that's cheeky. Whatever problem the online support moderator has had with my username which of course offended no one but the online support moderator herself, it seems the folks looking after this game are all too good at taking your money followed by insulting you in this way. I am using the same username on some other game that is alot more social than this without any problems from such folk as this one. Since this game is by Ubisoft as well, it will definitely make me think twice before going for another game developed by this company in the future.","August 13, 2015","false","14.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

You can reach and unlock everything as a Free2Play-user. ANNO Online is absolutely 100% F2P!! Wanna have useless cosmetics? Then pay for them [...] Those are NOT needed/required for the gameplay at all.\n\nIn my whole WWW history and life, I have had met the most friendly community within ANNO Online. It was unbelieveable. Well, I am talking about "german servers" and their german populations. I am not sure how the athmosphere is inside international servers. Older people as teachers, professors, etc, play this game too. For real!!\n\nANNO Online has a nice support, too, as well as includes in-game moderators who watch out for ANY delicts as for a simple written bad-word. You can even add moderators into your Friendslist. ANNO Online is nearly infected-free. You had seen a single "troll" every 2nd week, but, well, with the release on Steam I begin to feel bad things for ANNO Online's future and its amazingly & friendly athmosphere. As its gameplay the ANNO Online community is unique, yet!!\n\nWhat I really liked in ANNO Online was the trading system with other players. You are able to mass-product beer for example and sell it via your harbor and ships. ANNO Online is one of the best F2P Browser game out there as well as it is PvE-focused. No PvP - No Win!! You can even visit other players islands and watch them live.\n\nAs an ANNO fan, since its major relase with 1602 in the 90's, I have followed just everything about this genre. It is totally unique. ANNO 1404 and ANNO 2070 are masterpieces, and so is this "Browser game". I have never had any money problems in-game, you should learn to handle its unique economy. ANNO is so much fun.\n\nI highly recommend ANNO Online and its universe, and, please, ignore those yet ~20 bad reviews. You won't even feel that ANNO Online is a Browser game. After hours of gameplay in ANNO Online, you begin to feel to play it as it is a real ANNO game. There is so much more of positives to tell you about this game.\n\nWhy have I stopped to play ANNO Online a year ago, but talking only the best of it? Well, there is a daily log-in bonus and on anytime later, after months of gameplay, I lost my daily log-in bonus progress due to a technical / server-sided issue. It got a reset to "Day-0"!! The support wasn't able to revert it back to fix that. Every day.. for nothing...\n\n..I wonder if my account still exists there. I possibly try ANNO Online on Steam out, but later.\n\n\nBEST REGARDS\nN3\n\n\n\nEDIT_001:\n\nDon't trust any of these negative reviews about ANNO Online.\nThere are too many "trolls" who vote down since they have no any clue. Thanks in advance.\n\nMost or nearly ALL of them don't realize that this is a "Browser Game" and...\nANNO Online is 100% "NO" Pay2Win...\n\n#1: You can unlock everything as a Free2Play-user\n#2: PvE-focused\n#3: No PvP, no "win"\n#4: Wanna have cosmetics? Buy them...\n#5: Unlock whole and huge islands? You can do this without paying any real money!!\n\nANNO Online is all about fun and as a "Browser Game", of course time consuming.\n\n\nBEST REGARDS\nN3\n\n\n\nEDIT_002:\n\nI wanna show you an "older" ANNO Online screenshot about my "F2P" gameplay!!\n100% played without payed money... there is nothing different on the Steam Edition.\n\n+1337 income ^^\n\nhttp://abload.de/img/1337a5mpup.png\n\n\nBEST REGARDS\nN3","July 1, 2015","true","0.1"," 61 of 157 people (39%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","39","61","157","7","9"

I don't quite understand why people judge it as if it was of a same level. It is much more similar to increasingly popular mobile games. And it is free after all. I cannot say that I really like this game. It is OK. At one moment I realized that it is not really bad that this game keeps running while I am sleeping, working or doing other things away from my computer. And I don't worry about missing anything or finding my city in ruins upon my return. It is much more forgiving and less demanding than most mobile games. Is it P2W as many reviewers claim? Not sure about it. I played for over 8 hours at this moment, did not spend a penny, and never felt like I need to. And those reviewers have mostly less than 1 hour on record. Weird. I think this game is greatly underrated by extremely high expectations from acclaimed series. But it is free, so you don't really lose anything. So try it, I would recommend to try if you like city bulding and expecially if you played or play similar mobile games.","December 26, 2015","true","236.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I tried now.\nFor nearly 11 hours I played this game. I\'m at 2k population now with a couple of colonists and I thoroughly enjoy it.\nIt might still be a little early for me to review, but it\'s a positive one for sure.\nBeyond any expectations it immediately hooked me to the game after the first 15 minutes.\n\nNow, regarding micro transactions, I got tempted quite a few times already..\nI\'m not sure whether I will buy gems or not. For now gem production seems to go fairly quickly.\nEverything is achievable without having to lay down real money for it.\nIt\'s too early for me to say whether this is full F2P or only partially.\n\nThe graphics are not too special, nor is the combat. But it\'s a (steam ported?) browser game.\nIt only requires a couple of MB to play and it needs flash, which is a pity. But hey, it works, and it looks okay.\nI also completely love the music. Really good job at that. It makes the game that much more immersive.\nEspecially the female solo vocal. Wow!\n\nThis review will probably be updated later on with a bit more in-depth arguments on why I like playing this game.\nAs of now : It just got me interested and I\'d like to see my city grow =3\n\nI\'d give this an 8/10.\n\nCheers,\nNemesis Theory","June 1","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
