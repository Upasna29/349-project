Although the game sells itself as a 'Be a Hollywood movie-maker!' type of story, it actually goes in-depth about the atmosphere of fear and paranoia surrounding the McCarthy witch-hunts that happened around that time, lending an unexpectedly serious tone to an otherwise fairly light-hearted piece. That isn't to say that the part of the story to do with the film itself is unremarkable: the writer clearly has a great love and knowledge of the old way of making films and manages to capture quite a few moments of that old movie magic in a couple of scenes, especially in the super-dramatic and witty conversations. They just don't make 'em like they used to.\n\nAnd what happened on my first playthrough with Johnny Wheeler of the company Wheeler's Reelers? I played according to my conscience: honesty, loyalty, and above all, integrity. Although holding true to his convictions got Johnny blacklisted and forced him to make movies abroad or otherwise in secret, years later after the fear of Communism fades Johnny's films are discovered by a new generation, his faith in humanity upheld as they recognise his work and his bravery with a Lifetime Achievement Award - plus Johnny gets to hook up with the secretary, for whom I was secretly gunning since the beginning. Best. Ending. Ever.\n\nLooking back on it now, I must say the story reminded me a lot of The Crucible. Only with a happy ending, in my case.","May 1, 2015","true","3.1"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","34","36","3","0"

This may have something to do with the fact that I'm currently a university student, so I have quite enough reading to do as is, thank ya very much!  As it stands, however, I finished this one in just a couple of sittings, thanks to how exceptionally well-written and cleverly designed it was, and it gave me a few solid chuckles along the way as well.\n\nNow, if you're one of those people who finds themselves constantly complaining about the lack of actual CHOICES one gets to make in a lot of so-called "interactive novels", you're unlikely to complain about THIS one.  In the first ten minutes alone you're forced to choose the name and gender of not only your own but other characters, and almost everything that your character does or says from then on in requires a decision, sometimes from a pick of a good five to ten options!   You truly choose YOUR OWN adventure in this one.  (Just to give an example, by the end of my first scene I had decided that I was a film director named Cliff Flowers - I'm a Killers fan, what can I say - who had just pitched a studio exec a horror-comedy set during the Running of the Bulls in Spain!  That's exactly the kind of customisation you can expect if you give this baby a burl.)\n\nNow whether or not the story in question is liable to set your world on fire is a slightly more subjective thing, and obviously all the non-readers out there should just LEAVE THE STORE PAGE NOW and go find themselves a Sam to get Serious with (it's literally JUST WORDS, not even any pictures or music)!  Personally, I found it all rather interesting and enjoyable,  but then again, I've been an amateur filmmaker myself and have always been fascinated by the dubious ins-and-outs of the movie business, and there's no denying that the McCarthy era makes an especially intriguing backdrop to a game.\n\nI won't lie and say that I've played a whole lot of games in this style, but I'd be pretty darn surprised if this wasn't one of the better ones.  Oh, and for those of you concerned with cost, you can stop fretting: The sheer multitude of choices one can make guarantees EXCEPTIONAL replayability.  On my first two-hour playthrough, I've only netted 16% of available achievements, and I'm yet to even MEET Alfred Hitchcock, much less make a movie with him.  I CAN confidently say, however, that Orson Welles does have one little ♥♥♥♥er of a DOG...\n\nVerdict: 8/10.\n\n(PS You know you've got what it takes to be a real-life film writer/director/producer when you give yourself a CORONARY!  Even got the achievement to prove it!!)","December 11, 2015","true","2.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","9","11","3","0"

Film buffs will adore this game because the author demonstrated extensive knowledge of the film industry's inner workings and history. The choices, particularly related to how you make your studio's film, are very impacting and the game does a good job of tracking your stats. The customization with your main character is remarkable - your character can focus their energy into directing, writing, editing, acting, or producing. All of these skills are important at one point or another in the story. Although my first film ended up largely a failure, I nevertheless enjoyed the game thoroughly.

It's a Choose Your Own Adventure story only with fewer options that end in your death. If you can handle two hours of black text on a white screen, it really is an amazing story. Though devided into several chapters that stay roughly the same regardless of your choices, the events within the chapters do have a lot of room for change. The story is very well-written and engaging; I felt my heart rate go up every time my picture started to fall apart. Definitely has some replay value, though you'll find yourself skimming text once you've read it a few times.

Navigate your way through 50s Hollywood and decide where you want to spend your film budget -- will you ask your buddies to star as actors in your film or seek out more expensive but famous options? Not to mention who might direct your film... you could always get Hitchcock if you try your best! But maybe he wouldn't be the best for a sci-fi flick with a romance subplot.\n\nThe possibilities are endless. You get to customize your film on ALL levels, and will even get the opportunity to improve it on certain (weak) points while time progresses. In the meantime, against the backdrop of the Cold War, there's a lot of discussion about in what ways independent film studios are influencing the American public through Red propaganda. Are you a Commie or not? And is your film all you think about or do you have some time left for romance? Time will tell!\n\nPros+ Real immersion in the 50s world of Hollywood\n+ Lots of customization options for your own film that affect all the different endings\n+ The ability to also customize the people around you (friends, family, actors)\n\nCons- No save points\n- Pretty short, can be finished in ± 1.5 hours\n- The courtcase surrounding the whole communism/blacklist angle felt forced\n\nThe most enjoyable part about Hollywood Visionary was, to me, the ability to customize my film to such a great degree. You can truly create something that feels like it could be yours, and even get to enjoy the reviews/response once your film is released. The whole 50s vibe was amazing, mainly thanks to all the famous Hollywood people popping up here and there in the story. Though the Cold War angle could have worked, being pursued by an angry law-enforcing stereotype who drags you to court felt very forced (and distracted a lot from my precious film!).\n\nIf you like this kind of 50s Hollywood stuff, then this Choose Your Own Adventure game could be the one for you. I had a lot of fun directing and writing my own romance adventure film that bombed at the box office -- no hard feelings, because I eventually left Tinseltown with a happy threesome consisting of me, a handsome actor, and a stagehand.","February 12","true","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Like when Padme cries in Star Wars Episode III : The Revenge of the Sith?\nThis game is somewhat of the same. Two points in particular seem very blunt and in the eye, distracting from the good points. Firstly, the Fish Grundy character was pretty stereotypical and played out as one would expect. The bigger issue (which ties in to Grundy) is the focus on the House of Un-American Activities Committee. The whole drama around that seemed really forced (to overuse a word). I never could convince myself that I was being prosecuted by a government agency- it always felt like I was on trial by the game makers themselves. They wanted me before the Committee, and they put me before the committee.\nThe length of the game is certainly not worth five dollars, especially when up against the much longer and more entertaining "Tin Star." I played this one on the heels of "Tin Star" and wanted to like "Hollywood Visionary," but it just fell flat. Good character interactions (like with your neice, actors, etc.) seemed hampered by the looming Committee. In the opening, the game makers seem more intent on catering to the player's preferred sex pronoun than helping them become a movie studio exec. This ate up a little time which could have been given to more movie-oriented aspects.   The story, length, and price just do not place it in the same category as  "Tin Star."\nSkip this one at the box office, kiddies.","June 10, 2015","false","2.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

The first 10 minutes gave me the impression that the author seems quite fixated on sexuality, what I mean by that is that after you have chosen what gender title you would like to be, mr or ms or that/they, it then goes on about would you like your staff to adress you by mr or ms, it seems absurd. The only people I can see that this would be fitting for is transexuals.\n\nThe rest of the game felt quite predictable, and I must say I got disappointed  when I realised I had just played through the game, making one movie. What about including the possibillity to go on making movie with a few random scripted events happening?\n\nAll in all, I was entertained for 1.5 hours, 5/10","June 12, 2015","false","1.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

Making one hard decision after the next felt emotionally draining but when I reached the ending I found it hard to read between the tears in my eyes and the involuntary laughter. I really felt like I had achieved something, that my choices meant something and that it was all worth it.\n\nI can only think of a few other pieces of artwork that have come close to this feeling. I'll admit I'm biased as a film buff and artist in my own right, your experience probably won't be the same if you don't have the same attachement to the subject matter.\n\nI'll put it this way, if this game sounds interesting at all then GET IT. Or at least play the demo, just don't let the chance slip by.","October 24, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have only played it once so far, but there seems to be ample replay value here as well.\n\nIt's well written and rather expansive.\n\nWhat I like about this game (as well as "Choice of robots") is that it allows you to fail. Your choices will impact what happens, and often you'll find yourself wondering if the choices you made were the right ones - or if there even were right choices to begin with. This creates a degree of suspense which few games match.\nSo if you\n- like a decent story\n- like choice-based gameplay\n- are interested in cinema/making movies\n\nbuying this is a no-brainer.","June 21, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was the Steam summer sale and I picked up this "game" for a fairly cheap price. It is a book, a grown up electronic choose your own adventure one.\n\nI have very much enjoy this book. This book has the reader be a 1950s wanna be movie maker! It was very entertaining. On the first run through, my movie flopped but I ended up with two boy friends. I have "play" this for roughly six hours trying to get the different ending. I still haven't seen all this book has to offer.\n\nThere is one part in the book that I don't care how it is set up and that is the post production party. I have ran through the game several times and that is the point that drags, where nothing new is uncovered.\n\nDid I like this book? Very much so. I am going to try Aaron A. Reed other book and poke my nose around the Choice of Games section in Amazon and Steam for some more of these gems.\n\nIf you are a reader, take a chance on Hollywood Visionary!","August 25, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Never before had I played a game with such freedom, many other games from Choice Games LLC simply have a few different story lines for you to stick to if you want a fluid and sensical story. Hollywood Visionary changes that though, throughout the game you can change the outcome as different drama ensues on even the characters you thought unimportant. Never before had I experienced an interactive novel that actually makes me question my political stance and mentality; Besides a single bug (or a misclick on my part) the only complaint I can say for this game is that it isn't long enough. A sequel is definately in order where I return to my production studio and depending on the events of the first game, the entire second one will be different. The games has many loving and memorable characters that I simply felt terrible for betraying. There is no bad or slow scene in this interactive novel and I believe that I have the audacity to say that this game's story trumps that of even the best AAA games outdoing Mass Effect, Dishonored, L.A noire and so forth. This game is a must have for any story lover as never since Mass Effect 3 had I felt so deeply connected to the characters and even remembered all their names. This game is beautiful this Author is one of the greatest writers in terms of character development and though I do suggest putting some sort of music in the background while you play this game (I prefer to listen to the results I get on youtube after searching: Epic uplifting music), the case stands still, this game/novel is nearly perfect and I plan to put many more hourse into it.\n\n9.5/10","January 8","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really love it a lot! I know text-based games aren't for everyone but if you like great stories in text-based games, you will love this. Being interested in filmmaking (Not to sound like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥) also makes me love this game too. Overall, I strongly suggest it. It's brilliantly written and has a very high replay value. Also the Steam Achievements are great, as they make you play over and over, doing scenarios differently to obtain certain achievements. Some of the choices are actually pretty hard to decide, to the point where I kinda get worried if I made the wrong decision... But I digress.
