However there's no joystick deadzone, so if your joystick isn't PERFECTLY centered at rest then you'll be unable to control your ship properly.\n\nCome on, who forgets to put decent joystick support in an arcade game?\n\n- Can't rebind keyboard keys\n\nJust...why?\n\n- Poor fullscreen support\n\nFull screen isn't an option in the display settings, but you can make the game fullscreen by pressing ALT+Enter.  If you do that however, you won't be able to quit the game without pressing ALT+F4 to close it or by taking it out of fullscreen with ALT+Enter to bring back the X in the upper right corner.\n\n- Doesn't work well in Steam Big Picture mode\n\nThis is related to the above point and again, this is something that does work with fiddling.  It just doesn't work like it should.\n\nIf you put the game in fullscreen mode with ALT+Enter, then close the game it will open in fullscreen next time you open it.  If you do that before starting Big Picture mode then the game will start in full screen on your TV.  However since there's no quit button inside the game you'll have to use Big Picture's 'Close Game' option to make the game close.\n\nI'm using a TV set up as a second monitor.  If you're using a Steam Link or Steam Box I don't know if this will work or not.","April 20","false","4.5"," 104 of 122 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","104","122","6","5"

(Need to Alt+F4 or end process)\n-No key mapping\n-No Fullscreen option (have to use Alt+Enter)\n-No 360 arcade stick support (Mad Catz stick vetical axis is flipped, PS3 one works perfectly)\n-Analog Stick deadzone is awful, often moves left while entering no input\n-Needlessly massive downloads for such small games (800mb+)\n\nGame's themselves are fine, but these shells they are in are atrocious. Some very basic functions have been missed and basic input support has not been offered. Unless these aren't fixed quickly, then I would suggest avoiding these or getting a refund if you have already purchased them.","April 27","false","0.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","2"

Just really lazy. I've owned this on 7+ platorms, and this is by far the worst version I've seen.\n\nThere's no full-screen.\nIt seems to crash for a few seconds about once every load-screen.\nIt auto-centers the window for the game and doesn't remember where you last positioned it (really annoying if you have 2 monitors).\nYou can't change the key-bindings.","April 22","false","0.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

I've played it in arcades in the 90's and anywhere I see a Galaga arcade cabinet now. It's such an amazing 80's arcade game ('81 so very early 80's). The arcade version is perfect, but the Steam version is a port, don't expect perfection when you buy, but flaws are very minor.\n\nI tried playing with my arcade stick (Hori RAP 4 Kai) and it worked, but, if you move the joystick left or right nothing happens. You have to move the joystick up and down to get your fighter to move left or right...which is a little weird.\n\nMy stick is modded to play 3d fighting games though (Tekken). I have a Korean joystick, so playing Galaga doesn't feel as good as it does on an arcade cabinet. Playing on the keyboard works perfectly fine, no weird inputs and it doesn't work bad, imo. Keyboard is more sensitive, but not that bad.\n\nYou might be able to use something like Joy to Key to get the arcade stick to work. I haven't tried yet.\n\nNot a terrible port, imo","April 22","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well, sure, you can do that. But honestly, what's the difference between any other version of Galaga and the Steam version? Well, it's only a small fraction but you can actually read a fun little in-game "how to play" manual. Super simple and easy to learn (Always wanted to know how to get those double ships.) And last but not least we finally have an official Steam leaderboards for Galaga. Which is a hueg deal for shmup fans.\n\nOther than these small little changes everything from Galaga is intact. I primarily mostly got it for the leaderboards. If that's what you're wanting then I would pick this game up.\n\nEdit: ACHIEVEMENTS! How can I forget you?! There's also achievements in this game.\n\nEdit 2: Yeah lack of a controller support only seems to work only with Xbox controllers. I still don't mind it since you only move left and right and hit the fire button. arcade sticks I wouldn't even bother.","April 19","true","6.0"," 19 of 43 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","19","43","4","3"
