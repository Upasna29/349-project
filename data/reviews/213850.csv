Nothing different from MtG 2012 or 2013. Which I was okay with.\nAll I wanted was the ability to build my own decks with the new "Sealed Deck" Gametype and duel the computer. Maybe let the computer play one of my own decks. That would be cool, too.\n\nBut that wasn't happening. You can only play "Sealed Deck" twice until you have to buy new slots for your custom decks. No deleting decks allowed. After you draw your boosters, those boosters are locked to your acccount, and you can't shake them or Re-draft (Start from scratch). You have to buy more slots from WoTC. This is a money grab, plain and simple.\n\nWhen I dug into it, I found out their reasoning was for "Online Play", they didn't want people to sit around and re-roll decks to get the perfect combination and head to the top of the Online Ladder, so they locked cards in place. But then they let you re-roll decks anyway, however you have to "Buy Slots". Which means, people will still be doing the same thing -- sitting around and re-rolling decks to get the perfect cards. The only difference? They have to shell out three bucks everytime they do it, now. So, we can clearly see why they put this mechanism into place.\n\nWhich is the dumbest part. I suck at programming, but I know a monkey could seperate online from offline play and let me reroll my sealed decks, even if its just against the computer. But, they opt not to. Because they want your money.\n\nI'm not joking when I say I beat the Single Player campaign within an afternoon (3 hours), and when I found out I couldn't Re-Roll decks, I uninstalled this application and rebooted MTG 2012. It's a more solid / balanced game with more fun decks, and Planechase is Worlds Better than the current iteration of Sealed Deck.\n\nTry again, Wizards. Nobody wants to play a MtG game where they are paywalled for building decks. That is what this game is about. Building decks and taking them apart. Why are you preventing us from doing what the very foundation of this game is about? That's like telling a Kenyan Runner he has to complete the 400m dash, but you hack his legs off and charge him if he wants to use them. What is the sense in that?\n\nLunatics.","May 30, 2014","false","23.7"," 540 of 647 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","540","647","0","9"

Also, there are lots of other custom decks and custom cards that have been made. If you don't like what the community has made, there are great modding tools to make your own cards/decks. Installation of the mods couldn't be easier, because it is nothing more than drag and drop.\n\nAll of the modded decks can be used in online play(assuming your opponent also has the modded deck you are using). There is even an online community focused on playing with modded content, so you will be able to find an opponent, even when using the unofficial content.\n\nThe actual gamemodes are more of the same from the previous games in the series. The new gamemode is "Sealed" play, which is a total ripoff and should be ignored after you use your base game plays. Sealed is not enough like the IRL counterpart, to justify actually spending money on those DLC.\n\nThere are lots of purely cosmetic DLC, in the form of Foil Cards. They are completely pointless, aside from looking shiny. There is even an option to disable seeing the Foil skins on the cards that other people use, if you dislike their inclusion in the game. There is also a bunch of Deck Key DLC, which is nothing more than "skip the grinding" DLC. The Deck Key DLC should be skipped, as you can just use Cheat Engine, a Trainer, or sharing a gamesave to get all the cards without having to spend money or hours grinding.\n\nThe only DLCs that are worth buying are the Expansion Pack, and Deck Packs 1-3, since these are expanding the content of the game. Expansion Pack adds 5 more decks, and adds more content to the base game's gamemodes. Deck Packs 1-3 each add 2 more decks to the game. These 4 DLC give you slightly more than double the number of decks of the base game.  Luckily, Stainless Games has given the bundled option of all 4 of these DLC with the base game for a cheaper price than buying them separately. This bundle is called Gold Game, and is going to be the wisest way to purchase this game now.\n\nMagic 2014 is more than just a dumb nerd game. There is a surprising amount of depth to playing, without the need to buy dozens of IRL cards. Easy to learn, hard to master.\n\nAs an added bonus, you can enter promotional codes to get some extra cards for all 21 decks. I had to enter each of the codes a few times to get them to properly unlock the extra cards, but they will unlock with a few tries. Check the "Problems" section if you are unable to get the promotional codes to work. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=170231686 If that guide does not work, the excellent modding community I mentioned before has found another work around for getting the promotional cards.\nhttp://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=10898","November 3, 2015","true","24.3"," 116 of 118 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","116","118","0","0"

It's one of the best card game's I've played, and I've been an avid player for years, playing both the online versions (MTG 2012-14, MTGO) and the real life version. So jumping into this, I thought I would love it out of pure fanboyism. And in fact, I did. The campaign in this game is good, although there's still some problems with AI cheating. The challenges were fun way to spend the time if I got tired of basic duels. Most importantly of all, Sealed play (a game mode where you construct your own decks) was the most enjoyable part of the game, a place where veterans like me could go and test their skill instead of facing people with the same decks. Every opponent was different, and that's where a player's skill lies.\n\nSo what's the problem? The problem is that using my own created decks can only be so much fun. I said every deck was different in Sealed Play, but always within the same core group of cards. The variety was lacking, but this is it's first installment so I couldn't have gone it with too high hopes. So naturally, when I get tired of Sealed Play, I go to basic multiplayer with the dozen or so decks that the game provides me, right? Wrong. As the standard multiplayer is the main aspect of the game, it should have been the best, but ended up being the most terrible experience I've had in MTG.\n\nEach deck, without any cards unlocked, is pretty good in itself. If you used those decks in real life, you could play a pretty good game. In MTG 2014, as in the previous installments, the more games you win with a deck the more cards that are unlocked, usually good ones. To start off with, unlocking cards is painfully slow. 2013 had, let's say 30 unlockable cards, but each win would give you a card plus all of it's repeats, meaning you only had to win 15 or so times to unlock the full deck, so it didn't take too much of a grind. In 2014, each 30 cards has to be unlocked individually, leading to an incredibly slow grind that ultimately isn't feasible to do, especially since you have to win the game to unlock a card, could take upwards of 60 games to get the whole deck if you're good. When each game lasts around 10-20 minutes, that's just impossible, at least for me. The second problem is the card choices, each deck is riddled with the most overpowered game breaking cards imaginable, taking away all skill and making it a game of simply who can get out the most mythics (the technical term for game winning cards) in the least amount of time.\n\nWant to continue reading for a more in depth review?

I've always had some interest in it, but the cost of getting the cards and having to learn how to actually play the game was always a deterrent.\n\nThen came along a Steam sale, and I bought this game having read that this is one of the best places to learn how to play the game for beginners. And I'm glad I did. At the moment I am over 20 hours into Magic 2014 and enjoying it inmensely. This while not even having tried online gaming, nor the expansion which I bought in the bundle, or a "closed deck' game. As a matter of fact I don't even know what a "closed deck" game means, since I'm re-playing the campaign trying to unlock cards for the different sets. Again, this while being over 20 hours in the game.\n\nTo concur with the other reviews: this is a fantastic place to learn how to play the game for beginners. The tutorial explains everything perfectly. As you go further into the campaign you will have cards with certain attributes which weren't explained in the tutorial, and with a simple mouse-click on the card you can see what it does. I'm surprised how easily it was to learn how to play Magic to be honest.\n\nReplayability is necessary to unlock most of the cards. Considering the enemies in the campaign play the same way every time, one might think this becomes boring. For me this couldn't be further from the truth. I am actually enjoying replaying the campaign with different sets. Since you play with different cards, you'll have to rethink your strategy and despite the AI playing the same order of cards every time (I don't think this is the case for bosses though) it still becomes a new experience with every set.\n\nAs I said, I have never played Magic nor it's videogames, as such I can not judge this game by looking at other offerings and seeing what the 2014 version does worse (or better) than other versions. I can only tell that my experience with this game has been a very good one, and I would easily recommend it to anybody.","October 23, 2014","true","77.6"," 43 of 44 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","43","44","0","1"

It's not a good game for learning about deck building.\n\nWhy I recommend it: This is an excellent tool for learning the game mechanics. The pace is nice and slow, and the visuals make things very simple. The game won't allow you to make an illegal move, so as a new player it's an excellent way to learn what to do and when; it even goes as far as to show you which cards you CAN play at any given stage. It breaks down the steps and phases of a turn very clearly, so again, you can learn how the game works. Another, and probably one of my favorite features in the Digital MTG series is that whenever an ability is triggered, the game will slowly and visually show you exactly which cards are involved, with the option to enlarge the card and read the ability.\n\nIt's a lot of small things that help learn to play the game that you probably wouldn't get with a human player, regardless of their patince. They just don't want to wait while you read every single card 2 or 3 times and trace with a finger everything that's going on.\n\nI recommend this game 100% for new players or people who are interested in starting out. It's cheaper than buying a pre-made deck in stores and comes with the advantage of masterfully teaching you how to play, without being so all encompassing as to eliminate your reason to play the 'real' game.","February 2, 2014","true","42.9"," 140 of 225 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","140","225","0","3"

Like the other DotP games, Magic 2014 doesn't allow you to fully create your own deck, but basically asks you to choose from one of the premade game decks which aren't that bad. The extent of customization options are just some unlockable cards that you can add on to the deck while removing other cards to compensate. The Sealed Play mode is kind of cool, but it leaves a lot to be desired when certain cards you may or may not get turn out to be instawin for the player who uses them. Also like other DotP installments, the online mode also only works when there's a Steam sale and people have just bought the game, it never works or connects you to other players otherwise. In its defense though, the campaign always does a good job of teaching you your deck's strengths and weaknesses, which is very helpful to new players.\n\nIt's a good game for people just getting into MTG, but for average fans and veterans it just isn't worth it.","November 29, 2013","false","17.2"," 57 of 84 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","57","84","0","0"

Otherwise you just get prefabs with loads of mythic rares and you can select/deselect cards)\n*Collecting, comparing, trading, etc.\n*Great moments of triumph from strategy\n\nWhat you DO get in this version:\n*creature battles\n*spells\n*lots of land tapping\n*online multiplayer with a couple different modes\n*Pay for features you should get with the game for free\n*Pay for booster packs\n*Pay for each extra deck slot\n*Pay some more and then some more, and then more after that\n*streamlined phases and actions\n*a pleasant casual experience\n\nThey somehow took a lot of the fun out of the game, namely the collecting, trading, deck building, strategy, etc. But still have fun elements like creature battles, spells, art, etc. So this version could be called a streamlined version of Magic The Gathering's actual gameplay. It's sad that they didn't seem to care about adding the collecting and actual deck building, but I suppose they were either worried about competing with their physical cards' sales, or they just didn't think that the average Xbox 360 player (who this game is obviously targeted at, and designed for) have the patience or maybe even the capacity to collect, comprehend and create their own deck from scratch.\n\nI was rather disappointed to learn that the game lacked these crucial features (at least in a real experience), but found out through playing that although the most fun in the physical game is the winning with a deck that you built from scratch, the core mechanics of the card game still stands on its own. As for this computer game, it may not be a CCG, but it's a table top card game that is fun and casual but also a challenging experience.\n\nOne final sour point: As mentioned above briefly, there is a whole lot to pay for to get basic features that should have been included with the game. I don't really have a problem with the paying aspect as that's what the physical MTG game is, if you think about it. But I do have a problem with the growing sentiment that game development should be one half-released product and the other half behind an extensive series of paywalls. There are 49 addons for this game, and although not all of them unlock features, this is quite the pathetic attempt to disguise large payments by splitting them up into dozens of "DLC." I guess it is up to each of us individual players and whether we want to stand for this blatant capitalization of gaming addiction and half-product half-"DLC." I can't blame the industry for moving towards higher/hidden monetization of their titles, but I don't have to like it.\n\nP.S. About the Regenerate comment: activate Regenerate BEFORE combat damage and DURING the block phase AFTER they have assigned blockers. I know.. "Regenerate before damage, WTF?!?!"  I don't know why, that's just the way this game works.","June 24, 2015","true","29.3"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","29","38","4","0"

If you're a new player to M:tG, this is a great place to learn the very basic gameplay and mechanics of the game. You'll be exposed to cards from the very first sets all the way up to now. The game will have you unlock decks and stronger cards by facing other Planeswalkers. Deck construction is a bit limited, but with a pool of about  80  cards per deck, you should be able to come up with a few strategies for each of them. It's a great place to start if you don't want to pour money into the physical card game or Wizards of the Coast's Magic Online. Diehard fans may be a bit dissappointed with the game on the whole considering how broad and intense Magic can be outside of DoTP, but this game balances out the power curves you'll see in standard Magic: the Gathering play. You can add your own creativity in the Sealed Deck mode which enables you to build a 40-card deck from semi-radomized packs. You may have to switch your strategy as you play this mode, as you'll face different opponents who have different strategies. You won't get blown out by Pro decks, but watch out for the DLC decks as they are more powerful. You can join forces with your friends to face other AI Planeswalkers (which you can higher or lower in difficulty) or other human players. Overall, it's a great way to scratch the surface of a very in-depth game, hone your skills, and discover cards that could change the way your physical decks operate.","November 2, 2014","true","142.7"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","2"

Well, Magic 2014 is the collectible card game "Magic The Gathering" in its fourth iteration of the series "Duels of the Planeswalkers" (DotP), not to be confused with the Microprose game of the same name that also is known as "Shandalar".\n\nMagic 2014 allows you to compete with a number of pre-built decks (as of writing this: 10 in the base game, 5 in the expansion and 2 in the deck pack) with 60 to 100 cards against other pre-built decks or in the campaign mode against so-called "encounters" that don't follow the Magic deckbuilding rules.\n\nIt would be too complicated to go into details of the complete Magic rules, but the basics should be explained here: When you build a deck, you can freely choose what cards you have in it, which include any number of basic lands, up to 4 of each other card of the same name, and up to 1 of each restricted card. In the computer game I review here, the game takes care already that you can't build an illegal deck unless you have less than 60 or more than 100 cards. The "more than 100 cards" rule does not apply in real-life magic but because of the influence of luck generally a deck is considered more efficient with less cards in it, unless it is specifically built to maintain a larger card base.\n\nAfter you have built your deck you can play. In the computer game, instead you have the pre-built decks with unlockable cards. This means you can customize your deck to a degree but not as freely as you would in real life Magic. This is on one hand good to introduce you to the game, on the other hand it also limits your options.\n\nWhen you start an actual game, usually both players (it works similarly in a game mode with more players) draw a hand of seven cards each. You can exchange that hand for another one with seven cards, then six etc. down to one. You will usually want to have a certain number of lands and other cards in your hand.\n\nLands are used as a mana source. Almost every spell in the game costs mana. There are five mana colors in Magic plus colorless mana. A card that requires colorless mana to be cast can be paid with any mana, while a card that requires a specific color must be cast with that color. In the first turn, you will usually play a land - you can play at most one per turn unless other effects allow you to play more - and maybe cast a spell. There are different kinds of spells:\nPermanents are spells that go to the battlefield when cast. Those can be creatures, enchantments or artifacts. Creatures can attack the enemy, enchantments and artifacts have different effects that affect the gameplay. Usually a permanent can only be used by its controller, who normally is the one who cast the spell.\nThere are also instants and sorceries which are spells that can be cast to have effects on the gameplay, for example making a creature stronger or weaker until the end of a turn, or dealing damage.\n\nIn your main phases, you can play permanents and sorcerys, in your attack phases you can attack. If your opponent has the turn, he gets those benefits and you can block. Instants can be played at any time, even in the opponent's move. Two decks are even built partially around instants that prevent an enemy's spells from working.\n\nYour objective is to defeat your opponent who starts with the same amount of life as you, usually 20. When you win with a deck you unlock a new card that you can use in it later.\n\nRead the rest of the Review in the comments because of the artificial character limit by Steam!","November 25, 2013","true","688.3"," 145 of 251 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","145","251","0","11"

Although this game is more beginner oriented, it can still be challenging for experienced players.\n\nThere are many different decks to choose from, with 10 in the main game, 4 from the expansion, and then 2 from the first deck pack. Each deck has 30 cards to unlock from playing the game, and 10 to unlock from promo codes. Each deck also has completely different playstyles, even within the same colors.\n\nThe campaign is fairly standard, with different situations to face. Each situation has the same order for the computer to draw and play cards, making them good to practice against different scenarios.\n\nThe sealed campaign, although a unique new feature, is very meh. The sealed campaign is different than the normal campaign because instead of playing preconstructed decks, you make a deck from different booster packs you receive in-game. However, you can only have two different sealed card pools, so once you've played through it twice you either need to purchase more slots, or mod the game to randomize your card pool again. Overall, while nice, the sealed campaign could have been far better by allowing people to have as many sealed pools as they want, or to reset them.\n\nRegardless of this, the game has a high replayability value. One of the most enjoyable parts of the game is going through the decks, unlocking every card, and modifying them until they are exactly as you want them. In addition, once you have your decks as you want them, you can go online to face other players.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun game, and a great way to pass the time.

The visual style of the game is important for me so when I ran the game for the first time, I was pleased to see everything in the game as it is. The menu of the game is friendly, the color of the battleground is friendly to my eyes. The game itself is running smoothly while the newer "brother" from the series seems to have some "slowness problems" on the same machine...\nEven though I have never played previous versions of MtG so far, I still read many reviews and watched lots of game-plays which does not offer the same level of fun.\n\nCAMPAIGN\nThe campaign itself is pretty solid with all of those opponent's decks. Only the last fight against the main "villain" can be disappointing for someone. It is easy to face to someone (not only the "villain") who has some kind of disadvantage in the game. Actually there is a opponent's deck who is quite difficult versus some player's deck aiming on late game play-style.  If you want to use only one deck for whole campaign and own only basic version of the game, then you can "feel the pain" in some situations.\n\nSEALED PLAY\nEven I can confirm, that it does not offer anything special to players. It reminds me a draft, when it is difficult to collect a solid deck. And even if you buy new boosters, you can not use them all altogether. It is really weird.

Now, with millions of individual cards in circulation and a highly distinguishable brand that bellows across the tabletop gaming world, Magic: the Gathering (MtG) has evolved into a highly successful franchise that includes in its catalogue an assortment of comic books, novels, and other merchandise. Magic 2014 is a structured trading card game based on the physical card game of the same name, and is highly enjoyed by myself and  many others. Just like this variance of the game, it is quick and painless to learn, as everyone I have taught has picked up at least the basics during the course of one game.\nHere are some things that I enjoyed about this specific year’s instance of the video game series:\n\nStory - You take the role of a Planeswalker: a spellcaster that utilizes various forms of magic to defect countless enemies; this is also the premise of the player vs. player aspect in Magic: the Gathering. Throughout this story’s arch, you follow and ally yourself with Chandra Nalaar, a pyromancer seeking revenge against an enemy of great power. Chandra is one of the featured Planeswalkers within the MtG universe, her story told through multiple comic strips and novels since her original appearance in the 2000’s. Magic 2014 sequences the player against multiple opponents in turn-based card game action as the story progresses through said battles and cutscenes that are, in my opinion, pretty awesome.\n\nDraft Mode - Similar to real-life booster drafts for the trading card game, Magic 2014is the first of the Duels of the Planeswalkers series to feature Draft Mode, in which a player receives a given number of booster packs in order to create an in-game Magic: the Gathering deck, which is then utilized to defeat multiple enemies in succession. Though only two different decks are allowed through this game mode without having to dish out some extra spending cash for downloadable content (DLC), the player can earn additional booster packs that expand the total pool of cards they can use to modify their deck; this further enhances customization and overall play. There are also hints displayed on screen during deck construction that aide newer players when first creating and later editing a ‘library.’\n\nConnectability to the Card Game - Though it has very clunk player interfaces and you cannot tap your own mana, Magic 2014 is exactly what you’d expect it to be: a video game adaptation of the MtG trading card game. The similarities boil down to game mechanics, the utilization of cards that were in circulation, noteworthy Planeswalkers and other characters from the base game and novels, and even the ability to purchase foil deck conversions at an additional price as a cosmetic change. Magic 2014 is, simply, the same Magic: the Gathering trading card game that millions have enjoyed for years converted to a digital format.\n\nTL:DR - Magic 2014 is a great entrant into the Duels of the Planeswalkers series that can either be utilized as a teaching tool for card game players interested in learning the MtG trading card game or as a standalone title with varying styles of play and degrees of challenge. I would like to give a very special thanks to ‘the guys’ for enjoying the physical variance of this card game with me for many years. Also, a big thank you to my fantastic fiancé for being addicted to purchasing booster packs for me so that I could own more cards in an unbearable stack than I ever thought I could. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

It has improved on previous versions, but it is particularly annoying to know that a card works one way and DotP seems unaware of this fact.\n\nNew players won't notice this, and the 2014 version certain makes the UI a little more responsive, making it less likely for you to miss an opportune trigger.\n\nDeck building is a generous description of what really happens. each deck is, in essense a 90 card deck, and you unlock a good number of those cards throughout the playing of the game - or you can pay to unlock them. The final deck is no powerhouse, but when compared to the relatively terrible decks you are started with, it's a rewarding experience to take those powered up decks against previous opponents against whom you may have struggled and crush them mercilessly.\n\nThe sealed deck element is both brilliant and remarkably dumb at the same time. You can do sealed 2 times before you must buy more slots. This little money grab makes the experience highly frustrating. You can not delete the boring, or bad, pool of cards you once had. It was the most fun I had in the game, and the one reason I never went back after finishing them. If I wanted to pay money to draft, I would actually go draft online or in person and walk away with cards I can use for other things.\n\nNothing is overly challenging in this game, and with any level of decent magic skill, you will outplay your opponents easily. they are predictable, easily trapped and setting up blowouts can make even the unfair matches seem relatively easy.\n\nOverall, however, the casual magic player will enjoy this game, and deal with the limitations and weaknesses. All in all, it was a positive experience and I recommend it.","March 11, 2014","true","10.1"," 46 of 81 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","46","81","0","0"

Unlike the actual card game though, your options to improve your garbage decks are severely limited.  It's a good way to learn to play Magic: The Gathering, but frustrating if you already know what you're doing and looking to build a decent deck.  Some of the later campaign matches are especially asinine as the AI opponent starts with a stacked deck that allows them to play all their best combos at the beginning of the match every single time in exactly the same order while you get stuck with a properly random shuffled deck.  The only way I was able to beat the last few campaign matches was by restarting over and over until I got a hand that I knew would stand a chance against the first few combos in the stacked AI deck.  That is not how Magic should be played.\n\nI only recommend this game to beginners interested in learning Magic: The Gathering, if you are already a Magic player you will probably find this game frustrating and annoying.  Half the fun of playing Magic is designing and building your deck, and that entire aspect of the game is poorly represented in this digital form.  Combine that with the fact that the AI basically cheats and the cards are literally stacked against you, and you have a video game that is only marginally as fun and entertaining as the actual card game it emulates.","May 15","false","21.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You would be surprised at how clear cut the tiers are. Unless you play one of these select decks, you are going to lose unless by some stroke of luck you manage to pull just the right card. Its wraught with people who will blantantly admit they are there to frustrate you, and its just flat out a mean community. I have a fairly decent win/loss record yet most of these battles had to be won using these top tier decks. The main selling point of this game was Sealed Play which is by no means as good as it should be. You are given 2 slots to start with, and a select number of boosters to pull from. You can have the Computer assemble a deck for you based on your cards (which defeats the entire purpose) or you can build them yourself, however you are given extremely mediocre cards to use. The FFA mode is basically 1v1 (there are three way and four way matchups, but no one plays them) and once again, the top tier decks WILL WIN. People will reply with, "this deck beats this one if you have these certain cards" here lies another problem, you have to grind to unlock cards for premade decks to play with, or you can pay 99 cents on the store to buy the deck, and you can buy a 99 cent foil pack (which serves no purpose other than to take your money) and you can buy sealed deck slots (sealed was also a money grab) They have DLC by way of decks, and most of these decks are awfully overpowered compared to the others. As a casual player of the paper card game, this game is terrible by any standard. If you are looking to be frustrated by people, who are pretentious and rude, pick this game up, if not STAY AWAY and play the actual card game, there is a much nicer community in the actual product.

I got in during the Mirrodin block, a series of cards notorious for being much to too strong. It introduced two new things that upset a lot of people: 1. the new card layout. 2. Affinity for artifacts. The result was a metagame built around completely overpowered combos and cards and as a result Wizard backpedaled for the next block: Kamigawa. It was infinitely weaker and very different. Fast forward a few years and Wizard is preparing the biggest update in the game ever: Magic 2010. This changed some rules and introduced all sorts of loopholes to make more insanely powerful cards that make everything in Mirrodin seem weak.\n\nThe Duels of the Planeswalkers series in an attempt to bring the card game to the masses in a simplfied form. Basically you're given a set of Decks, each with a special theme or tactic and you have to fight your way through a series of computer opponents or against other humans with the same set of decks. This is the inherent problem with this game: everything is stripped down for the game. The inherent awesomeness of magic is building your own unique deck with over 30.000 possible cards. This game offers no such options. Obviously for dirty monetising reasons. Furthermore, the game is a complete wreck when it comes to flow. The animations are so overly long and uninteresting you'll lose attention and motivation to play before you have gotten to the core of the game.\n\nAll in all, as a player of the actual card game I cannot reccomend this.

You'll have to dish out some more dough if you want to use the game to its full potential.

Sadly, this is just another marketing ploy, a shallow attempt at introducing casuals to the limited Sealed Deck format. You open up boosters composed of cards available in DotP 2014, resulting in terrible mish-mashed decks (with still no non-basic lands available!) that you have to use against mono-colored decks. If you "unwrap" a terrible set of boosters, there is no reset button; after the initial two decks you can make you have to buy additional slots at $1.99 each. This game also features the worst decks in the series: STILL no non-basic lands and a terrible core set (m14 is incredibly bland with casualified slivers).\n\nOnce again locking you out of all but two decks at the start (Chandra & Garruk's again), DotP 2014 is a terrible introduction to MTG for new and casual players. Featuring the worst decks, the worst UI, easiest challenges, an awful campaign comprised of static decks (enemies pull the same cards no matter what, making the campaign little more than long challenges), and the worst game modes, 2014 is the worst DotP game since the original and not worth playing.","August 22, 2013","false","33.9"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","17","30","0","0"

For some complicated plays, the AI just does things without attributing a specific card.  The single-player campaign is short, but it can still be fun trying to beat it with different decks.

The deck building options are limited, you cannot design a deck based on a strategy, you have to design a strategy based on a deck.\n\nThe UI is utilitarian at best.  The menu system is poorly designed.  It seems to take forever to load, which is odd since there aren't any complicated graphical assets.  The pacing of the card play is slow, even after turning off all of the "pause to show card" options.

This however really annoys me. It also loads slowly.\n\nExtremely frustrating and very poorly balanced. Your first campaign starts you with two single coloured pre-built decks with no option to optimize each deck save to remove cards. Now this is fine until you reach the fourth duel in the challenge where you face an extremely optimized white fast creature deck and you are defeated time and time again. To progress I imagine you have to go back and duel the previous fights to get the right cards to begin tweaking your decks. Those who remember the "duals of the planeswalkers" computer game will befrustrated by an annoyingly steep difficulty curve without immediate access to tweaking your deck.\n\nLearning is slow paced for key concepts but for more complicated powers that involve interrupting play (e.g. regeneration) these are not explained.  Those who are prepared to grind the first couple of campaign scenarios (or spend money to unlock decks of course) might be a lot more satisfied. Play the demo and if you are a wiz at the game, consider buying if cheap.

Also viewing the cards can be troublesome sometimes when the game decides that you had enough time and now you should stop.\nThe game can be fun for usually simple campaign duels and playing against other players is easy and fun, which could easily make this game a good entry point to Magic: The Gathering over having to buy a bunch of cards. But the game is definitely best enjoyed with friends.\nAt the end of the day this game is just the at the time Magic:The Gathering game. Pretty soon a new one will be released if it has not already.

They're a great introduction to different deck types especially if you're unlocking decks manually instead of paying for them.\nMultiplayer is the heart of the game, but thanks to the only half-customizable premade decks it's kind of a rock-paper-scissors type affair in that victory is largely a matter of taking the right kind of deck into a match, and I've experienced issues with players disconnecting and each opposing side being replaced with a bot.\n\nThe 3D graphics are pretty, but unnecessarily reduce the compatibility with very old cards.\n\nI find the normal price overblown given the huge amount of DLCs, but I had a lot of fun learning Magic: The Gathering through this game.","June 23, 2014","true","66.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In fact, it might be more friendly to beginners than it is to long-time players, who might have some challenge adapting to some of the mechanic changes. The campaign isn't the longest, clocking in at under a dozen hours, and whilst the "tables" or backgrounds for matches have little to no diversity, the presentation as a whole is solid.\n\nStill, given the low price, it's good value for money. Of course, if you want to spend a lot of time making your own decks in sealed play, you'll probably want to shell out extra money to unlock the slots. Seems to function well enough - there's the occasional bug where effects do not play out as they should, and trying to double KO apparently breaks the game. All the same, it's fun.","November 28, 2013","true","150.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Decent mechanics at play for the game. However, it has many drawbacks. You are better off just playing MTG online. The campaign is the same every time without much variety in cards or ways through. Sealed tournament seems cool until you realize that you only get to play it 4 times. If you delete a sealed game and start a new one, you'll just get the same cards again anyways. This is a game that could have offered more but seems it just wasn't interested in doing so.

I have Magic 2014 for both the PC and the Xbox 360, and it's been fun every single time I play! I have every single DLC (Wich is totally worth it if you buy it in some bundle or during a steam sale, otherwise not so much). If you are new to Magic: The Gathering trading card game in real life, I highly recommend getting this game. It will help you better understand deck synergies and let you test out making your very own deck with a feature new to this title.\n\nFor the more experienced Magic: The Gathering players; I still recommend this game, but you may get tired of it early on. The limited deck custimization for campaign and multiplayer can become a drag after a while.\n\nNow for the people who love Steam badges and achievements, I HIGHLY recommend this game as it is VERY easy to get every achievement and the trading cards are reletively cheap (By reletively I mean less than $0.20). In the process you will also learn how to play Magic: The Gathering and I will have successfully converted one more person to the best card game on the planet. Hopefully you will realise how great of a game Magic: The Gathering is and I'll be able to play with you on Magic 2015!","July 2, 2014","true","26.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm still playing this awesome game now, I spend 2-3 hours each day for things dealing with MtG.\n\nRegarding this game, it's clearly not the paper game.\n- The pool of cards is not that wide, you have to play with a restricted amount of available cards, which is annoying.\n- I'm pretty sure that some IA opponents have pre-determined patterns : there are playing the same cards in the same order, game after game. It's not that fun to know what's coming next, especially when you play a game that involves a random aspect ...\n- The interface isn't great and doesn't allow you to use all of the mechanics of the game. In particular, it's not quite painful to use the stack.\n\nBut, in the end, this is still Magic, a great game, and you will have fun to spend around 20 hours to unlock all of the achievements. Then, you can still build decks and play with them against other players all over the world.","August 22, 2014","true","20.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is a tutorial for non-magic-players, and after that, you start with your first deck. Controls are simple and don´t seem to have any bug in it - i enjoyed playing a lot.\nSadly, like in all trading card games (as far as i know the genre), you can always pay to "win" - i bought myself a deck (they are quite "cheap"; 0.99€) and played the whole story with that particular strategy. If you don´t want to spend money, you can still win - but you must unlock 30 cards.\nThere are special cards which you can only unlock with a special code, but all them codes are found here: http://www.toptiertactics.com/19267/magic-2014-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-promo-card-unlock-codes/#axzz2tyzUHDlE\n\nThis was my first review, i hope it helped you with your decision - if the pay-for-a-deck feature bothers you, think of Magic 2014 as a 11€ game instead of 10€ :)","February 21, 2014","true","56.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd recommend free open source clients over this, I use MAGE for multiplayer and drafts but occassionally Forge but others exist like botarena (good ai) etc . MTGO is the official wizards client but that cost in others ways but is more flexible than this so you're best buying that with standard 600 odd cards as you'll get more cards and features for the price.\n\nCons first: In 2014 as with earlier you can ONLY use preconstructed decks and some are not balanced IMHO. There is no deck building per se; you can trim out cards from the vanilla build and change land amounts but not build properly such as build a mono green from all the green cards that exist in 2014. Also there is no drafting, limited cards, hardly any modes just 2 vs 2, duels and 4 player free for all. For single player the campaign is very short and an excuse to unlock decks. Missed opportunity since mtg has ton of lore and they could have packed it with backstory and introduction to factions, characters and so on. The ai sucks and is flawed yet even when it is tough it is more due to uncanny luck than strategy; seems to be able to get whatever it needs, it doesn't seem to use same system assigning cards to the ai that it does players\n\nPros: the interface is slick, easy to pick up and nice for a quick dual, prebuilt decks can even the playing field somewhat and good for fast simple games. Worth buying when on 70% or more off sales still and kills the time when not after complex thought out games with proper custom decks but I'd still rather be drafting BotG in somethign else haha.","July 1, 2014","false","98.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What they do not readily advertise is that the game includes microtransactions; certain aspects of gameplay are cut short by a requirement that the player pay more money to unlock extra gameplay. I'm talking specifically about the "Sealed Deck Play" aspect of the game. It allows you two 5-opponent campaigns that give you some ~150 random cards all in all. After beating all five opponents in a sealed deck slot twice players are required to pay additional money to buy another "slot" to play the 5-opponent campaign with som ~150 random cards. There are no other ways to build decks, Sealed Deck Play slots cannot be deleted or reset, nobody plays online and those that do have usually hacked the sealed (not that winning online games lets you open more sealed decks anyway), and offers no meaningful gameplay.\n\nWhat you are paying for is a software introduction to their card game with spiffy graphics and a lot of lore.

The tutorials aren’t boring and frustrating long either, it puts you right into a duel and teaches what you need to do to survive and flourish.\nNevertheless, the game failed to offer an open deck builder (sealed deck is a joke with P2W AND Cheaters). If I compare 2014 with MtG: DotP 2013, I got dumber basic decks (expansion/DLC improves that) and also miss Planechase mode, but I got epic music and beautiful graphics (with bigger cards!).\nSynthesing, Magic: The Gathering 2014 is an awesome game.

Except it's another rip off, if you get lucky you might get an OP deck, good for you! looks fun at first then you notice you'll struggle hard to find any player to compete with you.. and then once you unlocked those 2 "free" sealed deck bad surprise! if you want more deck or if your draws were terrible and both sealed deck you have you CAN'T reset them and you have to PAY to get more slots! and not just a few cents, no, 2 euros just for ONE sealed deck that might turn out terribad again, pure waste!\nActually until not long ago from the 6th sealed deck and up DLC you'd have to pay about 9 euros just to unlock 3 sealed deck slots packages! what a RIP OFF!\n\nso talking about price check it out, about 60+euros to have a full 2014 version, which gets you basically 3 or 4 decks worth playing but you'll get very bored of them fast, probably won't have any players to compete with within a few months with the 2015 version coming up and a game FULL of BUGS!\n\nYes another huge bad thing about the 2014: it doesn't resolve ANYTHING from the 2012 and 2013 (well actually a recent patch in the 2012 broke a deck you can't keep it unlocked anymore, it hasn't happened YET in the 13 and 14..), you'll end up with a limit to token on the board as usual, freezes, game sync issues which won't get solved until one of the players leave the game and to make matter worse when you're trying to unlock decks if your opponent leaves the game for rage quit or whatever reason you HAVE to fight the AI until it's over unlike the 2012 and 2013 where you could choose weither or not you wanted the AI to take over, making the unlocking process a pain in the *SS, basically trying to force your hand to pay 1e per deck key to unlock them!\n\nSo if you like magic what I recommend you best is to either go get some cards in real life and play there (that won't cost you much more than the sealed deck DLC anyway!!!) or buy the 2013 version which has much better decks and variety and pretty much as many online players anyway) or even get the 2012 if you get it on steam sales, you might struggle to get some multiplayer going but the decks are way more fun anyway (might wanna wait until the Treefolk deck isn't freaking bugged anymore though, how can you realease a patch 3 years after the launch of the game and BREAK the game is beyond me, just proves how bad the dev are and how much they do not care about their customers nor their games!)\n\nSo there you have it, DON'T give your money to vampires by buying the 2014, especially for the full price, at least wait until some solid 60+% sales or you might regret it, I DO","January 24, 2014","false","158.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

(Unless again, you are a hardcore magic fanatic and know what every card does). The last challenege alone took me roughly an hour to complete, and the only reason I did this was to complete the game. The game is valued at a good price and is fun to play with friends, but after awhile it will get very boring.\n\nAnother thing to add is the Sealed campaign. I found this very enjoyable, because I got to build my own creative decks for fun. The bad thing about this Sealed campaign is you get two slots to make different decks, if you want any more, well you need money for that. You can't delete old saves for the sealed campaign. I find this negative, because there isn't replayablitity unless you pay more for the game, which the game for full expansion is $20.00.\n\nA Numerical rating I would give this game would be: 5/10","January 13, 2015","false","49.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

I love the challenge and grind of unlocking the full decks. Just to make things clear, I have been playing Campaign only and I haven't even tried playing any other game modes. I will update in the future, but as far as my first ten hours go, I'm Loving It!","March 24, 2014","true","56.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","3"

And let me just say, when I'm playing a video game, I shouldn't be confronted with the decision to spend more money or stop playing within the first 2 hours of play. The base game might as well be free since Wizards will nickle and dime you for all you're worth. Enjoy sealed format? 2 bucks a pop after the first 2. Enjoy new decks? 3 bucks a pop. Want foil cards? Seriously? Why? Well, that's money too.\n\nThis game is the pinnacle of money grubbing developers, which is a shame because I don't mind spending money on a quality game I enjoy (up to a point), but just the feeling of 'pay me or you can't play,' makes me say 'Thanks, but I guess I won't play or buy from you again.'\n\nPros: it's magic, it's generally fun\n\nCons: obvious money grubbing, limited playability, you're better off going to shops and playing magic or just playing something else at all\n\nOverall, would not buy if you've played a decent amount of Magic before; BUT if you're looking to learn, you can pick this up pretty cheap and get a feel for your playstyle. Do not buy anything besides the base game since all the DLC is a waste of money.","January 1, 2014","false","34.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Card games are not that hard, right? I've cleared GBC version of Pokemon Trading Card Game pretty easily in the past, so there shouldn't be much of a problem for me at the beginning, right? Boy, was I wrong!\n\nThe tutorial started off pretty smoothly. They let you get a strong build and winning your opponent is a no brainer then. Its easy to overkill your opponent with more than 10 odds dammages, so I guess the tutorial is really built for players with no card gaming background or what sort. Fair enough.\n\nThen comes the real battle. You see, you start off with a "Hunter's Strength" deck (which was amazing during the tutorial if you figured it out how to play), and you have to fight this Chandra NaLaar girl with a fire head and a Firewave deck at the end of the tutorial. The fight was alright for the first couple of rounds, then the real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t came. Alright, she's already having the upper hand, fine, maybe I'm new, but then she summoned a holographic card. A phoneix with unlimited revival as long as you have enough mana. Seriously, wtf? If that's not bad enough, she summoned another phoenix with the same ability. After another 2 rounds, boom, i got overburnt with -8 hp remaining.\n\nI'm not saying that I played a lot of card games or what, but this IS a tutorial, and if you are "flexing" your muscles as a game dev during a tutorial, people will turn away. Come on, if we are being overpowered that much during tutorials, what else will happen during the rest of the game? Think about it, there are many people out there like me, who have no idea what this game is about and won't mind spending time and a bit of money on it. And that's how you kick start the game? This is ridiculous.\n\nAnd then I realize that you need to pay for new deck or card or whatsoever. Alright, I get it, so you want us to pay more for better cards. I'm glad that I came across this during Steam's free weekend.","June 7, 2014","false","12.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It wasn't what I expected. I expected basically a deck-building toolkit and the ability to play other people online, since I can't afford to go to local tournaments or keep updateing my deck every few months. This is sort-kinda what you get, but it has some severe limitations.\n\nThe biggest glareing issue is the fact that you don't seem to have any freedom in building a deck at all. Yes, there are about 30 different varaities of deck that you have (if you buy the gold edition), and more that can be unlocked as you play through singleplayer. But, each of those decks consist of approxamently 45 cards (not counting lands), and 30 "extra" cards that you can swap in or out of your deck to tweak it a bit; you're not allowed to greatly alter how the deck plays, nor build one from scratch. Those 30 "Extra" cards are also unique to each deck and can't be used in different decks, even if they use the same color. So if you wanted to, perhaps, move some mana acceleration from one deck to your prefered deck, or to help speed up a tragically slow deck, tough luck.\n\nThis said, whether or not this game would be good for you depends on what you're wanting. If you want free-range to build your deck and test it against other people, you're going to be greatly dissapointed. If you're a new player, unfamiliar with the game and wanting to learn how to play, then this offers a very nice interactive tutorial on how the game runs and what you can expect. If you're an experianced player, you're probably going to be frusterated by how restricted of a card pool you have to work with and how you MUST adhere to a specific archetype.\n\nI'm going to have to vote against it. It has some good points, to be sure, and will probably help alot of newbies get into the game, but the deck-building restrictions break it for me.","June 8, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Why would a company digitize that game and charge $15 - $50.\n\nThe offline game is a linear set of decks, and nothing else.\nMost content is pay and see, meaning; after buying the game you must also buy content created at the same time as the game. It's not new content. It's pay for content.\n\nThis game could be like the 1990's "MAGIC THE GATHERING" PC card game.  You could have craft your own deck, or explored a gui rpg world like fallout or an elderscrolls game.  Where fights could be settled with cards.\n\nA magic the gathering online game could include the ability to play as other editions of the original game, or have a special mixed aditions play.  In fact with todays technology a single engine could support multaple card games like pokemon, battle-tech, or the infamous my little pony.  Think of TF2 and how it evolves over time, or the halflife engine which has multiple games born from it.  you could have a main engine that lets you purchase the rights to different versions of magic as they come out, you could purchase an "orange box" that may contain ;fallen empires, arabian nights, 16th edition, Erza trilogy, Portal, Portal2 etc.\n\nBut you don't.  In fact you don't get much of anything in this game.  And considering how good computer games of the same price are. There is no excuse why these yearly released magic games suck so much, except for one; greed.\n\nI recomend you don't buy this, or any other magic card game for the pc. Especialy those yet to come out. Untill wizards cleans up their act.  But they won't because "MAGIC" is a fun yet expensive hobby. Andca digital verson would threaten that.\n\n\n","June 7, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The more I played it the more limited I realized it is. I LOVE the fact it covers so many different sets, I HATE the fact you dont get to build a personal deck. It's not even a DLC option which astounds me. I would consider this more a tool for teaching how Magic is played rather than a game. You go through the game one battle at a time to unlock preconstructed decks with up to a total of 100 cards available. There are many decks to unlock, but none of them can be mixed. Theres a booster campaign but those cards are locked to that specific campaign and you're limited to how much you can grow your collection.\n\nTLDR; Great learning tool, but if you're looking for a virtual MtG that you can just build a collection and play with friends, this is definitely not it.\n\nHow I think it could be fixed:\nIf they do start listening to customer feedback, this could easily be fixed by simply making a custom deck slot DLC and even selling booster packs (at a lower cost than paper cards of course, I mean, it's virtual after all.) They still generate money, and I get to have a nice neat virtual collection that I can play against friends with. Theres just something about winning against another person with something you created completely from scratch rather than a limited set of 100 cards.

After it was done downloading, I was ready to play the game. When I got into the game, the engine automatically set my resolution to 800x600, which confused me but didn't really bother my experience.\n\nJust like the first game, I started with the green deck and fought my first planeswalker. Chandra. I figured since there were going to be new cards, I should set the difficulty low and get to learn everything as I move along. However, with this mono-green aggro deck with its default cards (note you are FORCED to use this deck and only this deck until you win), you can very rarely win against Chandra, making it frustrating to continue along the game. After about 18 attempts, I finally beat her and continued on, slightly relaxed. The encounters were pretty standard and weren't ridiculous to pass through. I am a huge fan of Magic and love playing their games (if I get them cheap) but when I see a new game for the next set come out, I expect the cards from THAT set, not the previous 5 sets.\n\nFrom what I experienced all the way up till the 'Into the Roil' encounter, the only reliable deck is the mono-green which tends to get over all the creatures that threaten you. Then, you face a thing called a 'Roil' and get your ♥♥♥ handed to you and there's nothing you can do about it, no matter what.

As an owner of the first 2009 version I can quickly say that it has been several improvements over the years. You have more freedom with the decks, as you are able to swap all cards  from the preset decks out, and put your new and better unlocked cards in. The gameplay is still Magic 2014. Nothing to hold against them here, as they stay true to the source cardgame.\n\nThe decks are varied, and challenges you to try different gameplaying styles. Some are aggro, others are control, and some rely on specific strats. Each deck has 40 unlockable cards. Some of them are throwaway horsegarbage while other strengthens your deck signicantly. With the amount of unlockable cards you can see varians between how people choose to play each deck.\n\nThe multiplayer is lacking in content. Which is really Magic 2014 biggest weakness. With such a fanbase as MTG has, it should've been Stainless Games first priority to make the player vs player experience immense and filling.\nInstead you get a bareboned version. Where you go into "lobbies" with your opponent(s). Chose your deck and go. That's it. No ladders, no tournaments and barely no reason to play multiplayer other than playing against other human players.\n\nAlso the addition of sealed play feels like nothing but a tease. Here they could've done so much more. Maybe even made it into an arena (Hearthstone) type of experience.\n\nSummary\n+ Fun and varied decks\n+ New Deck packs are being constantly developed added(tho at a price of 3euro per 2 decks)\n+ Good AI, the best in the series so far\n+ Lots of gametime if you want to try and unlock everything\n+ Challenges and singleplayer campaign of decent length\n\n- Multiplayer is bare boned\n- Sealed play is bare boned\n- Some unlockable cards are utterly useless\n- Somewhat clumsy menu and UI.\n\nI would definitively recommend this to fans of cardgames and especially Magic: The Gathering. If you hate card games and/or lack patience, stay away.\nIt will not be like Magic online, which is much more advanced and challenging to both new and more seasoned players. So if you are a die hard Magic nerd,  you would probably be better off with Magic Online. That said, this is a good entrylevel for completly new player.","December 13, 2013","true","99.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You can only play the sealed mode twice before you have to pay for more deck slots to start a new game.  You can't delete your saves once you complete a sealed deck campaign and even if you're clever about it and delete the save from the game folder, the cards that come the sealed pools are saved to your Steam account, so you'll end up with the same cards.\n\nIt gets worse.  Let's say you really love the sealed mode, which I did in my two campaigns, and you really want to play more of it.  You want to play more of it so badly that you pay for more deck slots.  That's great, to each their own.  BUT.  They limit how many deck slots you can have even after purchasing.  So, even if you decide to pay to play more of a game that you already own, they won't even let you pay -more- to keep playing.  At a certain point, you're completely done with Sealed.  You just can't play anymore.  They added a format to make money, but don't want to take your money.  Fun.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is great and what Sealed you do get to play was super fun, but the fact that a replayable game can end is just a buzzkill.","April 10, 2014","true","17.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

Magic 2014 is by far a huge update from past games.  The co-op modes have been included and improved, and we finally see the beginnings of a serviceable sealed play format (think Hearthstone Arena or Scrolls Judgement modes).\n\nThe UI in this installment is slick and responsive.  I love that this game streams well, too, so I will be doing more YouTube and Twitch gameplay videos for sure.  There are tons of features packed into this game.  I'd say this is the definitive version of Magic online.  Campaign/single-player is satisfying as well.  I will say I found even the initial battles challenging so this is a great tool for shaking off rust or [re]learning the MTG ropes..  It's a fantastic introduction to the "Return to Ravnica" series, too.  Excellent across the board.\n\nAt it's core, this is still fundamentally the same game.  At $10 or less, it's worth it.  You can grind to unlock all the pre-made decks, which you can tweak a bit to your liking, or you can pay to unlock the decks.  Some complain about the microtransactions due to the silly business of buying foil conversions and deck slots but these items are more for the hardcore players..  or those who are impatient.\n\nMy only complaint, if I had to say something bad, would be that the DotP: SE version is pretty poop.  They should have included more deck slots for sealed play and perhaps a token to unlock your preferred deck.  The eBook and soundtrack are cool additions but that could have been a third tier bundle, really.\n\nI think this will be my last DotP purchase as it seems that Wizards is committed to releasing one of these every year, which sucks because it spreads the online community thin.  They seem to use this series as a glorified marketing piece but, fortunately, the replay value is very high in spite of these blatant greedy moves.  If you are looking for a definitive MTG experience, look no further!","January 1, 2014","true","71.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Playing the PC game really helps to understand the rules before you play the physical version. The PC version will only let you do something 'by the book', whereas if you don't fully understand the rules when playing in person you can end up doing something wrong.\n\nAfter playing both this game and the 2013 version, I'd say that 2014 is a much stronger choice. The 2013 version encounters were easier, so if you're a newcomer, I'd strongly recommend you pick that up first.","January 1, 2014","true","50.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As an owner of the first 2009 version I can quickly say that it has been several improvements over the years. You have more freedom with the decks, as you are able to swap all cards  from the preset decks out, and put your new and better unlocked cards in. The gameplay is still Magic 2014. Nothing to hold against them here, as they stay true to the source cardgame.\n\nThe decks are varied, and challenges you to try different gameplaying styles. Some are aggro, others are control, and some rely on specific strats. Each deck has 40 unlockable cards. Some of them are throwaway horsegarbage while other strengthens your deck signicantly. With the amount of unlockable cards you can see varians between how people choose to play each deck.\n\nThe multiplayer is lacking in content. Which is really Magic 2014 biggest weakness. With such a fanbase as MTG has, it should've been Stainless Games first priority to make the player vs player experience immense and filling.\nInstead you get a bareboned version. Where you go into "lobbies" with your opponent(s). Chose your deck and go. That's it. No ladders, no tournaments and barely no reason to play multiplayer other than playing against other human players.\n\nAlso the addition of sealed play feels like nothing but a tease. Here they could've done so much more. Maybe even made it into an arena (Hearthstone) type of experience.\n\nSummary\n+ Fun and varied decks\n+ New Deck packs are being constantly developed added(tho at a price of 3euro per 2 decks)\n+ Good AI, the best in the series so far\n+ Lots of gametime if you want to try and unlock everything\n+ Challenges and singleplayer campaign of decent length\n\n- Multiplayer is bare boned\n- Sealed play is bare boned\n- Some unlockable cards are utterly useless\n- Somewhat clumsy menu and UI.\n\nI would definitively recommend this to fans of cardgames and especially Magic: The Gathering. If you hate card games and/or lack patience, stay away.\nIt will not be like Magic online, which is much more advanced and challenging to both new and more seasoned players. So if you are a die hard Magic nerd,  you would probably be better off with Magic Online. That said, this is a good entrylevel for completly new player.","December 13, 2013","true","99.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Its good to have a digital version of this amazing game on Steam. It's very simple and easy to learn. Perfect for newcomers to the card game. However, for the experienced Magic player, or even someone who prefers deck building in general, this game can be somewhat frustrating. You do not have the ability to create custom decks. Only decks you can create AND create are sealed decks, and all the cards in the game are from M14 and M14 boosters. You can't create decks from scratch and only crack M14 boosters. Most of the cards are the same anyways. The game's Intellegence in-game (NOT the AI Opponent) is sometimes lacking in ability resolving, since it's intellegence doesn't stem into human reasoning when playing the physical game. Sometimes it does weird things that isn't intended.\nOverall, it's a good game to play Magic when you don't have your cards or you're not in the proper enviroment, however, if you want the full experience and the real deal, buy Magic cards or play Magic: Online (95% exact replica of the physical card game but in online format).\n\n6.9/10","April 7, 2014","true","26.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

You can only play the sealed mode twice before you have to pay for more deck slots to start a new game.  You can't delete your saves once you complete a sealed deck campaign and even if you're clever about it and delete the save from the game folder, the cards that come the sealed pools are saved to your Steam account, so you'll end up with the same cards.\n\nIt gets worse.  Let's say you really love the sealed mode, which I did in my two campaigns, and you really want to play more of it.  You want to play more of it so badly that you pay for more deck slots.  That's great, to each their own.  BUT.  They limit how many deck slots you can have even after purchasing.  So, even if you decide to pay to play more of a game that you already own, they won't even let you pay -more- to keep playing.  At a certain point, you're completely done with Sealed.  You just can't play anymore.  They added a format to make money, but don't want to take your money.  Fun.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is great and what Sealed you do get to play was super fun, but the fact that a replayable game can end is just a buzzkill.","April 10, 2014","true","17.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

I play Magic casually in real life (multiple different decks, and participate in drafts once or twice a month). Since I'm always trying to build a new deck that's odd and different for fun, that's were I had my biggest dissappointment: All the decks are pre built. You have to win a match (against the computer or real life players) to finish out all of the unlockable cards; which is typically where you find all of the powerful cards and all of the Mythics (the highest form of rarity for a card). However, I did find several of the decks very entertaining, especially the Avacyn's Glory deck (a deck that only uses White mana, and lots of human creatures until you can play angels like Avacyn, Baneslayer and Angelic Overseer). The AI was smart about most of it's choices for blocking and targeting with removal spells, and didn't give in when situations seemed hopeless like human players would. Though there were a few times that it seemed to gain an extra card or two, or play another card without mana at the right time while I was in campain (specifically the Simic Clones encounter mission). Speaking of campain, it was ok, though I had it done in an afternoon. Entertaining, but a lot of the lines felt cheesy, and the CG scenes made me cringe. The Sealed Mode was ingenous and moronic. It's the one way to truely build a deck that isn't already determined; but you can only have two without paying extra money, and any decks you make (no matter how bad) can't be removed.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game to anyone looking to get into Magic the Gathering, or anyone who is willing to keep an open mind and look past it's faults.","June 6, 2014","true","15.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The difficulty curve was unpleasant, and reminiscent of a 'pay to win' pve implementation.  You get two newbie friendly decks, no room to customize or edit (short of buying DLC) and then you get put against a superior deck.  Victory isn't achieved by skill, but by sheer dumb luck (getting all the right cards), lowering the difficulty, or buying DLC.\n\nNotice how I keep bringing up the DLC?  I think there's a strategy at work here.  As a longtime Magic fan and a big fan of the old MTG computer game, way back when (glitches and all), I'm pained that they've thrown their usual design philosophy out the window (See articles on Johnny, Timmy, and Spike - google them) and opted for the 'cash in on DLC' route.  No, you don't actually get to build decks, you follow the set builds they offer.  Why take something so open ended and creative and limit it so badly?  It baffles.\n\nI can't recommend.

But... My mind is blown at how poorly done it is. This must be one of the cheapest games in the world to make, besides a few CGI cutscenes and like, Chandra's voice actress.\n\nThe mechanics are OK, they do the job, but my biggest problem is the interface, at least on PC (can't speak for the tablet version). Like seriously, "Let's play a cardgame on opposite sides of the room." Great, now the cards on the board are distant, indistinct, blurry non-entities. Oh, but there's a top-down view? Let's try that. "Let's play a cardgame... From ORBIT!" If this is on the iPad or whatever, these cards must be microscopic. There is SO much wasted space everywhere. It's absurd. Why don't the developers take a look at Hearthstone, which is frankly a superior experience in almost every single way in terms of interface and user-friendliness, and remake this game to be more like that, where you can actually see the cards you are using and read what they do (being able to see what cards you have played, why would you ever need to do that?!), and see what your opponent has. Does it even show you the graveyards? I wasn't able to see that, although it was so far away I might be forgiven if I couldn't spot it.\n\nWake up Stainless Games, you have a mediocre product that needs a serious overhaul. The idea is alright, even with the very limited level of customisation (Hearthstone is also superior when it comes to that, too... Did I mention that HS is also free to play? I've not dropped a dime on it) it's just... Ugh. It leaves the sour taste of wasted potential.","July 25, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you are a MTG lover, this is a good place to be. The deck variety is very good, even with the base game alone, but the DLC expands on this greatly.\n\nThe different difficulty settings offer a choice for either new or old players, though even the lowest setting still provides a challenge. The highest setting, however, can be rediculous at times. Sometimes it feels like the AI is cheating to get whatever card is teh best at that moment. They will play a land card every single turn, and they always have just the right creature or spell to counter you. This can be very frustrating, and it is even worse in a 2v2 match against two AI's. The AI in Magic 2013 felt more...  organic, than it does here.\n\nSealed play is a uniqie mode that adds the real life excitement of opening a new pack of cards to the ever present grind. I have not played it as much as I have other modes, but I still enjoy it.\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes either Magic, Card games in general, or anyone who likes to test their brain.

There was alot I didnt like about Magic 2014, one of the biggest was that there was almost no real freedom with deck builds, thats something almost unheard of in dcg (digital card games) or card games in general. Another thing I did not like was the graphics themselves, dont get me wrong I dont expect alot graphics wise from a dcg but a table and cards are the last thing I would choose to do If I could make everything look "cool". It is almost like playing Magic the tabletop card game through a computer monitor. Its fun table top but when your able to do all sorts of cool stuff with a computer and you choose not to, well it just does not seem like a good choice to me.\n\nThere seems to be alot of extra paid content as well, I haven't looked into that very far but I have heard some complaints. Overall you should try Magic 2014 if you are a fan of the series, or are looking for a payed dcg, but I bet you can find a FTP dcg that you will have just as much fun with. Lets hope the next Magic game ends up better than Magic 2014.\n\nNOTE:  I am adding this note to let you guys know that I did like the game. I got a comment asking me why I gave the game a thumbs up if my review was negative. I did like magic 2014 It just did not live fully up to my expectations, I have been playing a bunch of other free dcg and I know how fun/ popular the magic series is so I figured it would be "better" than it was.

The interface is clunky and somewhat difficult to learn resulting in frustrating game play. The graphics are low-res. which normally wouldn't be a big deal for this type of game, but in this case it makes the card text difficult to read unless you zoom in on the card. The layout and orientation of the playing field is awkward making it difficult to see your opponents side of the board unless you change to the top down view. Unfortunately doing so results in a zoomed-out view of the entire board making it slightly easier to see your opponents cards but more difficult to see your own, and more difficult to read the text on all of the cards. In light of the recent release of another digital TCG by Blizzard, this games flaws become even more glaring. If you enjoy paper Magic already, this game is a poor substitute.

The developers have apparently decided that the players are far too stupid to be allowed to build their own and so the would be self proclaimed gods of the game, the developers, have removed our ability to play the game.  Don't be fooled by the 'sealed deck' play.  You are expected to make a deck, and it can be done, out of boosters alone, and they have allowed us only two decks for free.  Then they extort additional cash, for a game you paid for, for more of these worthless would-be decks.  Not only that, you are only allowed a booster as a weak kind of reward three times per deck.  So, you can only play the single, underpowered, deck in the sealed deck 'tournament' that it was created for and are given a smattering of cards to upgrade it.  A game built by the weak of mind, for the weak of mind.

But it is very clear to me from the outset that this is a game that relies entirely on luck. Yes, the campaign gameplay is more or less balanced, but unless you are willing to grind away at duel after duel like you've got nothing better to do you get stuck with what is essentially an out of the box preconstructed deck versus an out of the box preconstructed deck, so there is no skill involved in building a deck and even less (than usual) involved in using it. This goes doubly-so for the sealed campaign. Granted, your selection is completely random and you have to build a deck from that, but then you're limited to more or less basic strategies without--what's that called?-- Luck, again yes. Add to this the fact that you have to buy extra sealed slots (you can't reset them) AND the fact that there is over fifty dollars worth of DLC for this game and you see what the strategy is here: first taste is free, the next one costs you a child.\n\nAlso: What the heck is with premium foils? Uh. Hello? This is a computer game! Who gives a rat's rear-end about foils and who on earth is gullible enough to pay money for digital foil cards? If you really want to spend a small fortune on MTG, just go to your local gaming store and buy some actual cards.","January 13, 2014","false","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This exacerbates the luck factor, making the opening hand much more important than it should be if actual probabilities were used in the card draw.

I've had several scenarios where you need to have perfect timing to counter a spell or sacrifice a creature. If you mistakingly try to pause and do it one second to early or too late, you will miss your window and the action won't work. In fact, just today I tried to counter a very powerful creature and it didn't work..."No valid targets" it said. Then the creature was out and it was too late and I got smashed into the ground. If that counter worked who knows.\n\nIn addition, the timing system where it forces phases and rounds to glide by is entirely too fast. If you have 10 creatures and need to choose defenders for a spore rush that will kill you without careful planning and you only have 30 seconds....you will lose.\n\nOh, and do you want to read that 200 word card description to make sure it does exactly what you think?

But it is very clear to me from the outset that this is a game that relies entirely on luck. Yes, the campaign gameplay is more or less balanced, but unless you are willing to grind away at duel after duel like you've got nothing better to do you get stuck with what is essentially an out of the box preconstructed deck versus an out of the box preconstructed deck, so there is no skill involved in building a deck and even less (than usual) involved in using it. This goes doubly-so for the sealed campaign. Granted, your selection is completely random and you have to build a deck from that, but then you're limited to more or less basic strategies without--what's that called?-- Luck, again yes. Add to this the fact that you have to buy extra sealed slots (you can't reset them) AND the fact that there is over fifty dollars worth of DLC for this game and you see what the strategy is here: first taste is free, the next one costs you a child.\n\nAlso: What the heck is with premium foils? Uh. Hello? This is a computer game! Who gives a rat's rear-end about foils and who on earth is gullible enough to pay money for digital foil cards?

This exacerbates the luck factor, making the opening hand much more important than it should be if actual probabilities were used in the card draw. The previous versions, although not given the ability to adjust the land ratio, plays much better even with this problem due to the balance and design of the decks.","January 13, 2014","false","384.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've had several scenarios where you need to have perfect timing to counter a spell or sacrifice a creature. If you mistakingly try to pause and do it one second to early or too late, you will miss your window and the action won't work. In fact, just today I tried to counter a very powerful creature and it didn't work..."No valid targets" it said. Then the creature was out and it was too late and I got smashed into the ground. If that counter worked who knows.\n\nIn addition, the timing system where it forces phases and rounds to glide by is entirely too fast. If you have 10 creatures and need to choose defenders for a spore rush that will kill you without careful planning and you only have 30 seconds....you will lose.\n\nOh, and do you want to read that 200 word card description to make sure it does exactly what you think? English better be your native tongue and you better read fast fast fast because if not you'll easily waste over half your turn, which leaves little to no time to actuall DO your turn.\n\nThis game removes any strategy aspect of Magic and distills it down to complete luck, as any real strategy is lost when every 10th action you take is swallowed up without results by a clunky interface and unforgiving timer system.\n\nI expected something better from a multimillion dollar company, but cutting corners is all I got.","March 28, 2014","false","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They all added a new game type, mechanic, twist, and the decks were varied and interesting.  Chandra's deck in the previous installment could literally be played with no creatures...Jace's mill deck was surprisingly fun, and the demons of Liliana's were brutal and made for some interesting happenings.\n\nWhat I have played of this, and of the 5-6 decks I have played...each deck is LITERALLY the exact same.  Well...not exact, but they all follow a basic premise...mana ramp, play big creature, win with big creature.  Even the non-green (the color best known for mana-ramping) followed this pattern.  Whichever side dropped the bombshell first, won.  And the time I've played, only one deck acheived this on a consistent basis for you.  The AI pretty much cheats it's way to beating your face in.\n\nThe campaign itself only unlocks a handful of decks.  In order to unlock the myriad of others, you have to play a "revenge" mode, where you re-fight all the people you fought...with better versions of their decks.  And then, you encounter and unlock the other missing 10341 decks you didn't get before.  So much grind, such hassle.  Or, you know, the alternative exists...pay them real money to eliminate the grind...which also destroys much of the (non-existent) fun of facing new decks with what you have and winning.\n\nThis was the first DotP I did NOT enjoy in any sense.  I gave up on the campaign after losing repeatedly with the two decks I had at my disposal.  Eventually, i did succeed and tried other decks, only to find that I couldn't win ANY matches without using one specific deck, period.  And I play MtG on a quite frequent basis.\n\nBottom line, ignore this one...by 2013 instead.  Not quite as smooth, but far more fun, with far more versatility in the decks.","May 25, 2014","false","18.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Anyone who is a veteren or even moderate MTG player will immediately HATE this game.\n\nThe graphics look great.  The interface is a little touchy sometimes, but works pretty well as long as you remember to hit the pause button while you read card specifics.  The music is pretty well done, especially for a side-game that really never was intended to have a huge player base.\n\nThe biggest beef I have with this game is the fact that it violates the rules of MTG.  There were two giant rule violations in the first 2 battles you go into.

The added option of sealed play and greater deck customisation feel like necessary additions, but Wizards of the Coast have shot themselves in the foot due to a number of mistakes that are frustating due to the fact that they would be so easy to remedy. The removal of the immensely fun Planeschase, the limited number of sealed decks available (2 without forking over more cash for DLC, and your cards are fixed so no resetting) and the atrocious online multiplayer, which works fine against strangers but against friends it often results in error codes and disconnects. It all feels like a tiny step forward and a HUGE leap back. Only buy it if it's on sale and you've got a few friends to play against, otherwise just get DotP 2013.","December 3, 2013","false","66.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This really makes the heart of the game worthless in my eyes as it does not test the real strengh of the decks in a large game.   Aside from the fact that the cards they pump out these days are so overpowered as to take quite a bit of skill and fun out of the real game, the mechanics are just terrible.  Have your opponent down to 1 life and your sure to win next round?  Go in the kitchen and make yourself a sandwich as the AI will sit there for a good 5 minutes debating the next move to try and win.  It's so slow I usually have to find a book or watch tv while always waiting for the AI to make a move.  I admit this review is just for single player as I have not yet tried multiplayer but that does not change the fact that the lack of deck management takes away what I consider the best part of the card game which is developing personal decks and testing them out.","April 4, 2014","false","159.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you are new to the MTG scene or have not played in years, then yes, for 10 bucks you will have a whale of a time with this game. If you have bought the 2012 or 2013 edition though, don't bother unless you really want the new decks. I have no idea why but MTG has decided to make each year of the DOTP separate, it's a lot like one of those sports franchises that only change the players, except in this case you change decks so WTF? It's bad enough you can't build your own decks, now you have to own separate editions as well. Why can't all these decks be DLC attached to the 2012 edition? There hasn't been any fundamental change, even the so-called "sealed mode" is just a gimmick and could've been sold as an expansion so to be honest releasing a new version every year is just forcing everyone to keep buying the new edition at full price, something which is ok for a first timer but a total rip off for someone who already bought an earlier edition.  You can definitely make the argument that $10 is ok for a new edition, but the fact that you can't use your previous decks unless you keep the previous version is really limiting and keeps fragmenting the customer base with every edition they put out, unless you keep the games  installed in which case you'd have like 10 different DOTP games in your pc by 2022 or whatever.\n\nJust look at all the useless "DLC" on offer for this game, it is clear they are more interested in gouging out as much $$$ as they can without any regard for the game quality. IMHO if you want real value for money you are better off playing HearthStone or waiting for Hex, whatever amounts of money you invest into those games will be retained unlike this POS crap you need to keep buying every year.","April 5, 2014","false","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I get the rules, I play casually with friends. This isn't my introduction into Magic or anything. I also play a few other TCG's so I'm not entirely clueless either.\n\nThe tutorial is a cakewalk, up until the final battle: Chandra. You're sitting on a deck you can't alter with a list that will let you play one card a turn if you're lucky while she always has something up her sleeve. Five or six battles against her and the closest I got to beating her was getting her down to about half her damage. All that took was her not playing anything. Afterwards the AI woke up and stomped me, I didn't get a single damage down afterward and the dead draws started happening because, hey, a 4+ cost enchantment is really cool, except when you have no creatures to use it on.\n\nSealed started off pretty good. I got a deck that wasn't too bad and stomped Liliana even though she had death touch and murders up the wazoo. Then came Garruk (the owner of the deck you use in the tutorial) who proceded to consistently beat me. Why doesn't his deck start off like that for the tutorial? Or is my draw luck really just that bad? The one thing I will give them is that, even at Archmage, the AI is really good. If they have you, they know they have you. You have a first striker you're leaving untapped since it can block anybody they have and survive? They'll wait until they get the card they have somehow destroy it (for Chandra, this is practically every card).\n\nAs for the other aspects of the game, the mechanics aren't that bad. A minor annoyance in this category is the animations. I turned them off, yet the combat animations still seem to be pretty slow. I don't need to see the creature bite/burn/slash/stare at whatever they're attacking, just the damage. Sealed is pretty fun, though it's not going to ever be the same as a draft. Yet, they seem to be worried that it will compete with the actual game. With how frustrating the AI and preconstructed decks are, they have nothing to worry about.","July 14, 2014","false","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In a "Free For All" game between 4 players(3 being AI) you can bet that all 3 players will attack you first essentailly making it a 3 vs 1 match with no regard for strategic attacks on other players to help survive themselves.  This really makes the heart of the game worthless in my eyes as it does not test the real strengh of the decks in a large game.   Aside from the fact that the cards they pump out these days are so overpowered as to take quite a bit of skill and fun out of the real game, the mechanics are just terrible.  Have your opponent down to 1 life and your sure to win next round?  Go in the kitchen and make yourself a sandwich as the AI will sit there for a good 5 minutes debating the next move to try and win.  It's so slow I usually have to find a book or watch tv while always waiting for the AI to make a move.  I admit this review is just for single player as I have not yet tried multiplayer but that does not change the fact that the lack of deck management takes away what I consider the best part of the card game which is developing personal decks and testing them out.","April 4, 2014","false","159.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you are new to the MTG scene or have not played in years, then yes, for 10 bucks you will have a whale of a time with this game. If you have bought the 2012 or 2013 edition though, don't bother unless you really want the new decks. I have no idea why but MTG has decided to make each year of the DOTP separate, it's a lot like one of those sports franchises that only change the players, except in this case you change decks so WTF? It's bad enough you can't build your own decks, now you have to own separate editions as well. Why can't all these decks be DLC attached to the 2012 edition? There hasn't been any fundamental change, even the so-called "sealed mode" is just a gimmick and could've been sold as an expansion so to be honest releasing a new version every year is just forcing everyone to keep buying the new edition at full price, something which is ok for a first timer but a total rip off for someone who already bought an earlier edition.  You can definitely make the argument that $10 is ok for a new edition, but the fact that you can't use your previous decks unless you keep the previous version is really limiting and keeps fragmenting the customer base with every edition they put out, unless you keep the games  installed in which case you'd have like 10 different DOTP games in your pc by 2022 or whatever.\n\nJust look at all the useless "DLC" on offer for this game, it is clear they are more interested in gouging out as much $$$ as they can without any regard for the game quality. IMHO if you want real value for money you are better off playing HearthStone or waiting for Hex, whatever amounts of money you invest into those games will be retained unlike this POS crap you need to keep buying every year.","April 5, 2014","false","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I get the rules, I play casually with friends. This isn't my introduction into Magic or anything. I also play a few other TCG's so I'm not entirely clueless either.\n\nThe tutorial is a cakewalk, up until the final battle: Chandra. You're sitting on a deck you can't alter with a list that will let you play one card a turn if you're lucky while she always has something up her sleeve. Five or six battles against her and the closest I got to beating her was getting her down to about half her damage. All that took was her not playing anything. Afterwards the AI woke up and stomped me, I didn't get a single damage down afterward and the dead draws started happening because, hey, a 4+ cost enchantment is really cool, except when you have no creatures to use it on.\n\nSealed started off pretty good. I got a deck that wasn't too bad and stomped Liliana even though she had death touch and murders up the wazoo. Then came Garruk (the owner of the deck you use in the tutorial) who proceded to consistently beat me. Why doesn't his deck start off like that for the tutorial? Or is my draw luck really just that bad? The one thing I will give them is that, even at Archmage, the AI is really good. If they have you, they know they have you. You have a first striker you're leaving untapped since it can block anybody they have and survive? They'll wait until they get the card they have somehow destroy it (for Chandra, this is practically every card).\n\nAs for the other aspects of the game, the mechanics aren't that bad. A minor annoyance in this category is the animations. I turned them off, yet the combat animations still seem to be pretty slow. I don't need to see the creature bite/burn/slash/stare at whatever they're attacking, just the damage. Sealed is pretty fun, though it's not going to ever be the same as a draft. Yet, they seem to be worried that it will compete with the actual game. With how frustrating the AI and preconstructed decks are, they have nothing to worry about.","July 14, 2014","false","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Why?  Because for a sub-casual Magic player like me, it's good enough, and $10 is peanuts compared to the cost of playing Magic in a live setting.  I'll get at minimum 10 hours out of this, and probably more due to multiplayer with friends.  If you're new to Magic, this is a nice learning tool, and the limitations inherent in DotP are actually a good thing for a novice player with no deckbuilding experience.  And really, those people are the target audience for this product; If you're a seasoned Magic veteran, you know there are alternatives that give you greater freedom with deckbuilding.\n\nSo, with that out of the way, different things about DotP 2014 (as compared to previous DotP titles): there's more lore-related stuff throughout the campaign, though the story may as well be non-existent, which I consider neither a virtue nor a flaw for a title like this.  (You don't play Magic for the story.)  The client seems more stable and less sucky than the one for DotP 2013.  There's no way to skip encounters during the campaign, which is a bit annoying for someone who isn't really interested in "puzzle" games and just wants some vanilla Magic against an AI opponent.\n\nThe alternate game mode in DotP (replacing Planechase in DotP 2013 and Archenemy in DotP 2012) is sealed play, where you get access to two random card pools out of the gate--if you want to have additional sealed pools after that, you'll need to buy them for $2 apiece.  Some people loathe this, but as someone who has spent $25 a pop for sealed play in a live setting, I personally don't mind too much, and as extras go, I find it sealed play to be more substantive and enjoyable than Planechase in DotP 2013.  I've paid more than that for new deck DLC in previous versions of DotP which have offered substantially less replayability and enjoyment.\n\nMagic is a good game, and one that you'll probably enjoy if you like turn-based tactics games.  DotP is just one way to experience Magic, and if you've never played Magic, it's probably the best way.","June 28, 2013","true","138.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

You can play a number of pre-made decks against computer or human opponents, which unlocks more cards that use can use to tweak the decks.\n\nThe big improvements to this version are the music, which is pretty good now, and the story, which reveals something about the greater MtG storyline for a change. The graphics are nice as always, and the control is decent as always. The new decks are fun to play with, but most of them are very similar to decks in Duels 2013. New encounters make the single player campaign more interesting. Sadly, the challenges are much easier this time.\n\nA new addition this year is Sealed Deck mode. There's a huge caveat that they don't tell you, and it was almost a dealbreaker for me: you can only play Sealed twice. I mean, you can use your deck from Sealed as much as you want, but you only get two pools to make decks from. The rest will cost you $2 a piece. Unfortunately, I was done with Sealed very quickly, and it didn't add much to the game for me. At least it's better than Magic Online?\n\nIf you're going to buy a Magic: the Gathering game, Magic 2014 is the bet one so far, and it still had tons of content for the $10 price. It's definitely worth getting, but don't buy any DLC for it.","July 3, 2013","true","36.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sealed play was not fulfilling, within an hour you can unlock every card option for that particular deck. It also seemed to require many DLC purchases to fully flesh out.\n\nIf you're a die hard fan of Magic the Gathering, it's worth the money.

With many decks available you don't get bored. The single player campaign is pretty decent but the MP keeps things fresh.\n\nIts not perfect the MP lobby is severely lacking in polish, and there are a few bugs but nothing that really stops your enjoyment of creating decks (though you can't create decks from scratch - think of this as magic light).\n\nIts also  cheap for the amount of hours I've played it and it has regular expansions to keep your interest.\n\nIf you like magic you'll like it.

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!\n\nThe worst aspect about this game is that you need to zoom in to be able to see what the cards you have are. When you zoom in on a card, it is displayed in fullscreen, blocking the entire game board. This combined with the timer, leaves the multiplayer aspect of the game stupendiously difficult for new players. I have no idea why the designers of this game didn't use the screen assets more properly. The writing on the cards could have been made more legible, and the cards could be made to zoom on 'mouseover' to the empty side on the bottom left of the screen.

Why?  Because for a sub-casual Magic player like me, it's good enough, and $10 is peanuts compared to the cost of playing Magic in a live setting.  I'll get at minimum 10 hours out of this, and probably more due to multiplayer with friends.  If you're new to Magic, this is a nice learning tool, and the limitations inherent in DotP are actually a good thing for a novice player with no deckbuilding experience.  And really, those people are the target audience for this product; If you're a seasoned Magic veteran, you know there are alternatives that give you greater freedom with deckbuilding.\n\nSo, with that out of the way, different things about DotP 2014 (as compared to previous DotP titles): there's more lore-related stuff throughout the campaign, though the story may as well be non-existent, which I consider neither a virtue nor a flaw for a title like this.  (You don't play Magic for the story.)  The client seems more stable and less sucky than the one for DotP 2013.  There's no way to skip encounters during the campaign, which is a bit annoying for someone who isn't really interested in "puzzle" games and just wants some vanilla Magic against an AI opponent.\n\nThe alternate game mode in DotP (replacing Planechase in DotP 2013 and Archenemy in DotP 2012) is sealed play, where you get access to two random card pools out of the gate--if you want to have additional sealed pools after that, you'll need to buy them for $2 apiece.  Some people loathe this, but as someone who has spent $25 a pop for sealed play in a live setting, I personally don't mind too much, and as extras go, I find it sealed play to be more substantive and enjoyable than Planechase in DotP 2013.  I've paid more than that for new deck DLC in previous versions of DotP which have offered substantially less replayability and enjoyment.\n\nMagic is a good game, and one that you'll probably enjoy if you like turn-based tactics games.  DotP is just one way to experience Magic, and if you've never played Magic, it's probably the best way.","June 28, 2013","true","138.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

You can play a number of pre-made decks against computer or human opponents, which unlocks more cards that use can use to tweak the decks.\n\nThe big improvements to this version are the music, which is pretty good now, and the story, which reveals something about the greater MtG storyline for a change. The graphics are nice as always, and the control is decent as always. The new decks are fun to play with, but most of them are very similar to decks in Duels 2013. New encounters make the single player campaign more interesting. Sadly, the challenges are much easier this time.\n\nA new addition this year is Sealed Deck mode. There's a huge caveat that they don't tell you, and it was almost a dealbreaker for me: you can only play Sealed twice. I mean, you can use your deck from Sealed as much as you want, but you only get two pools to make decks from. The rest will cost you $2 a piece. Unfortunately, I was done with Sealed very quickly, and it didn't add much to the game for me. At least it's better than Magic Online?\n\nIf you're going to buy a Magic: the Gathering game, Magic 2014 is the bet one so far, and it still had tons of content for the $10 price. It's definitely worth getting, but don't buy any DLC for it.","July 3, 2013","true","36.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are a few that are fun to play (Dodge & Burn being my personal favorite), but most seem very simple. I miss the Landfall deck from a couple years back... Jace's deck is pitiful compared to year's past... And most just don't seem to have much flare to them.\n\nWotC is trying really really hard to put a story to MTG, but it is pointless and unecessary.

(He said like Chew Chew Nong Nong Head)... Actually my name is Walt, and I am a real Bard, and soon I'll be putting out a book. I got this game because it seems to fit in with my line of work . WOW is this ever involed ! I have no idea what I'm doing, so I went on Wikipedia to look up Magic The Gathering, and now I see that this is not just a game, but a hobby that could turn into a carreer ! Then I started clicking around, and I went into STEAM'S Community Guides, and I noticed that in order to win the "Phantom Mage"achievement, a fellow has to win a game controlling only illusions . This aroused my curiosity, as I was all ticked off about the lack of usefullnes of the illusion spells in Skyrim (unless you go with all the perks), so I went into downloadable content and found the Deck Key for "Mind Maze", which would allow a fellow to compass this mighty task . Wow is this ever involved ! If you're all done writing that book, get the game and the extra downloads, and maybe the cool kids (or at least the nerds, dweebs, and heads) will let you play with them .

Sure it's an alright magic simulator, but honestly, the game is coded like ♥♥♥♥. I have played about three games in the past twenty minutes. Every single one is plagued with bugs. When zombies die and can be resurrected from the graveyard, half of the time the game will not allow you. It's the same with phoenixes or other after death effects.\n\nMost of the time, it doesn't even feel like the game shuffled your deck. One match it feels like all the land has been put on top of your deck. The next it feels like every creature you ever had is on top of your deck.\n\nFor example. I used the card Flamebreak against a undying zombie card. It's supposed to allow any creatures to regenerate this turn. The zombie regenerated immediately. Later in the game, the undying zombie refused to regenerate when killed. There has been something like this in every single game I play. Where is the sense in this?\n\nExiling and regeneration also only seem to work half the time.\n\nHow does a game with this many bugs actually exist? I have played dozens of matches in this game. I only bought this game to play matches online with my friends, but every game just seems to be waiting to see who gets more bugs in their favor. I'd rather go back to texting photos of the card I played, than deal with this stupid game. I want my money back.","January 30","false","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a "strategy game" first and foremost so if you, as a beginner, don't have access to combining the color types, or even playing a solid color type you wont get far, nor does it teach you Magic because deck creation/play style is 80% of this damn game and there is none; so you cant try the strats that are more suited to your personality/play style ...you just cant. Sorry. There is no custom deck creation in this game and you are forced to use the very lame/un- thoughtout decks they provide. The interface is clean and simple to use however it takes way to long to go from turn to turn even if you go to options and turn off all the animations, pop ups, and tips turns still take way to long. Why do i have so many hours logged if i hate the game? Because i modded the ♥♥♥♥ out of it with custom mods, thats why, and no the game does not support mods.\n\nAi: First I want to say this game has incredibly sloppy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ai. I would even go as far as to say Rigged. As you go through the game unlocking cards to improve your deck you will quickly notice that the Ai is locked in its decision making do to the fact it is based on a deck strategy, the Ai will not alter or improvise in anyway. Hell ive even been in instances where the Ai has no idea as to what to do to counter what i had just done so it does nothing and just continues to lay down land cards even though he has cards to take action. Putting the game on max difficulty changes very little im terms of difficulty and is still far to easy. The AI os Aweful\n\nSecond battling other players just isnt fun AT ALL, everyone is using the same decks, the same strategies. What its come down to is the only thing determining the winner in VS is the one who gets the better starting hand (in other words luck, or in this case a flawed random generator) where as normally your deck strategy/in the moment decision making would decide the victor ...I also want to add this game has false advertising ALL OVER IT, at launch they made the game sound like something completely different than what it turned out to be and with held a GREAT amount of information from customers regarding deck creation. Wait what? ..i thought the game didnt have deck creation. Well that's right it doesnt but they sure as hell advertised it as if it did. Instead what you are given is 40 card limt deck option made using 10 random booster pack, and guess what? if that deck turns out to be crap or the the wrong color type, tough, your stuck with it ...oh wait but it gets better, if you want to make another deck and try again you cant can't. They wont let you delete the deck you just made and if you want to try again you have to spend $2.00 for another deck slot once more no guarantee that you get ANY! of the cards you desire.\n\nDO NOT BUY THE DLC the decks lack  massive amounts of creatvity and are not fun or interesting in anyway, it is a complete waste of money ....Zero effort was put into it.\n\nCaution Magic 2015: Wizzards of the coast is an incredibly money hungry company with one purpose in mind; to get you buying extra crap you dont need, booster packs, deck add ons, deck slots, and if they weren't they would be offering a fully functioning magic the gathering experience with all cards for a one time fee of 90 bucks or something ...but nope, they want you spending-spending-spending. A pre ordered copy of the magic 2015 was given to me by a friend so ill let you know how it turns out, but im willing to bet my left nut that they will be up to the same old sneaky ♥♥♥♥.\n\nTCG pro tip from a pro player:\nGambling, i mean buying booster packs is VERY addictive (see what i did there) and something you should always be thinking about when playing TCG (trading card games). Trust me i understand/know the feeling of "not" knowing what that next booster pack will contain, the surprise, the excitement, and the wonderful smell of freshly purchased booster box/packs meets no equal. All those wonderful highly addictive toxic chemicals.\nAsk your self this ...if your playing TCG games with friends or tournament out of love for the game why are you spending thousands of dollars on it? essentially throwing your future down the toilet. If your just playing with friends or even tournament i recommend this. Buy a good printer for around 90 bucks and print all the cards you want from the internet; you and your friends will have access to what ever they need to come up with awesome deck combos etc, etc, and when your ready to play the big boys in tournament you will know Exactly what to buy for that special deck you just made saving you thousands of dollars; use old crummy cards in deck sleeves to support the printed out paper card (because paper is very flimsy and hard to work with), if you dont have any search ebay for random lot of common cards you can get around a 500 for just a few dollars. Now if you cant see the simple logic behind this suggestion you are ether A: very brainwashed, or B: Highly addicted to gamblimng aspect and refuse to act sensibly do it causing conflict.\n\nThere is a reason kids go Ape ♥♥♥♥ over Pokemon, yugio, magic, cards.","July 10, 2014","false","66.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are a few that are fun to play (Dodge & Burn being my personal favorite), but most seem very simple. I miss the Landfall deck from a couple years back... Jace's deck is pitiful compared to year's past... And most just don't seem to have much flare to them.\n\nWotC is trying really really hard to put a story to MTG, but it is pointless and unecessary. The Planeswalker idea is dumb and needs to go away.\n\nSo, be as it is. It's another year of premade decks. Again, the sealed play is fun, couch co-op 2-headed giant is fun, and there are more decks this year.\n\nREMEMBER- They are not going to make it to where you can make any deck from scratch... you can already do this with hteir actual online MTG, so why would they want you to be able to do the same thing for 10 bucks? Go buy some starter packs and boosters and get started making decks on their actual MTG Online game.

I was playing with AIs and got up to the point where it isn't actually teaching so much so it should be even faster because AIs shouldn't need thinking time but it took such a long turn time and probably with the amount of hard thinking this game commonly takes, it'll take even longer with pvp.","June 15, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

I'm glad to say that it isn't as complicated as I had thought it would be, and I'm really looking forward to diving in to the world of tabeltop MtG now that I understand a bit more about how certain themes and decks operate, and that is largely thanks to Magic 2014 - Duels of the Planeswalkers.\n\nHowever, I'm sad to report that this game only gave me the briefest taste of the action, and fell well short of leaving me satisfied. As a brand new player feeling this way, I can only imagine that veteran MtG fans will be left disappointed. Once I had beaten the shot campaign (which is comprised of a series of duels against static enemies who always draw the same cards, in the same order), and felt I had a pretty good grasp of how certain cards could synergize with each other, I was disappointed to see that there wasn't much of an option to build my own deck and experiment. The only exception to this is the sealed deck mode, where you are given a small number of random cards, and can earn up to three booster decks to craft your own deck. However, this feels almost completely pointless, as once you have unlocked the three booster packs (For a total of 9 packs, I believe), there is no way to unlock any more. You're stuck with what you have. Like it or not. Your only options after that point are to continue fighting the same battles you already fought, but without the rewards.\n\nOverall, I'd say that Magic 2014 is a decent purchase if you're brand new to the game, and just looking for a stage to learn the rules of the game, and have a chance to play around with premade decks to learn a few possible tactics. If you were hoping for the possibility of actually building your own decks, though, then you should probably stable your expectations.","December 10, 2014","false","23.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

Sealed Mode sucks to play in, because you get a bunch of random cards that don't go together. And I know, that's the point, and it would be fine, if your opponents followed the same rules. The AI uses decks that actually work. They don't use Sealed decks like you have to. They have their own decks, that are pure type(all a single color), unlike you, that has to create a multicolor deck that does not synergize well at all. Even at the lowest difficulty level, they hand perfect hands that countered every single thing I did. If I summoned a creature, they destroyed it. zIf I played an enchantment or sorcery, they negated it. Total waste of time.

First I really liked it; I was into Yugioh before. But this "version" (at least) isn't even close to it. Campaign lets you unlock decks and playing with those decks let you unlock more cards FOR that deck. So you're very limited on what you build.\nThe sealed packs part was what I looked forward to. Unlock packs to get cards to make a custom deck. But no. You get several pack to open, then do the best you can with the crap cards you have to do the campaign to open 3 more packs. That's all you get. No more. That's the end of it. But anyway I made the most of it playing with my friend. I have no reason to play anymore.\n\nTL;DR: Short, watered down game.

The worst things about the game is that there is no multiplayer and there is no create any deck you like and test it on others or on in-game opponents. I also found the paying to unlock deck slots a bit ridiculous! Come on Wizards, you can afford to sell a game and give unlimited deck slots and in put the features I described here. We crave for these additions and milions of Magic players would pay for these options, even if you released a new version of the game every year(like most/ every sports franchise ever). Plus I can see charging for updated cardlists so you can have the newest cards at the ready for custom deck construction.

What an jerkhole move.

Its not the same deck, they purposly took out most of my "good" low cost creatures and gave me garbage. Garbage that is designed specifically to lose to a certain opponent. It is trucking reDICKulous. Im so aggravated at how , just, how completely anushole it did me. Its just unconscionable. wow. Im not buying Magic : the gathering - Duel of the Planeswalker for $2.50 on its free/70% off weekend promotional. N o way am I going to paying real money for "fake" cards. It just stole the ones I liked and gave me new ones that are worthless, and it never told me it was doing so. Then it gives me an opponent that has a perfect counter for the cards it just gave me, and the ones it took away ( without telling me it was doing so) would actually help me win. The low cost creatures I got will die to the AI opponents swarm decks first 1 mana creature. It gives me all 3/1s and 3/2s for 2 mana, and a bunch of spiders that cant block.

It feels like they prepared the first part of the game well, but began rushing it for release; I don't know why: a game like this could withstand an extra year of development, take advantage of new cards being released, and use the time to add maybe triple the levels. There's some nice ideas here, but it's overall too short; especially with the amount of stuff to unlock: there's not enough gameplay here to use even a third of it at all really, unless you're really into multiplayer.\n\nAs far as gameplay, this game does a fair job of showing you the rules and helping you progress through each step correctly. However, there's no way to queue an action: more than once, while defending, I've wanted to enhance one of my monsters with an instant spell; you can't cast a spell specifically while choosing your defenders, yet the window of time before the attack starts--and you can't use a spell during the actual attack--is so short, that I've often missed it, even while trying to use the card as soon as I'm able. You have to endure this "wait window" over and over throughout the duel, and it's tedius; yet when I actually want to make use of the window, there's always some animation just before it starts, and then there's no kind of alert the window has started ticking by, so it seems as soon as I try to use my spell, it's already too late! Or too early! It's not like I want a longer window in this game, but it's so frustrating when the enemy plays a spell and I'm going to play a counter to that spell but they're still in their casting process so I can't actually cast mine yet, so I wait, for, what, I'm not really sure when one step ends perciesly; next thing I know it's too late! After playing through the campaign, I think I only had a 50/50 success rate for using a spell when the window was relevent. It's easily the most frustrating thing about this game.\n\nIt's fun, and an easy way to play Magic, but there are freeware multiplayer Magic programs that allow a much broader selection to play with, so there's really very little reason to actually play this one. If only the campaign for this game had been developed more--or if the multiplayer had more cards you could choose from--it could be a good game. It's still fun, and worth the fair price, but this is definetly some distance from the premiere Magic experience.","December 8, 2013","false","15.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

While I haven't been playing Magic for the longest time, I'm decent at the card game. Therefore I can tell when the game is fixed. The opponent you are playing against is controlled by the computer. Therefore, if it doesn't want you to win, you won't win. For instance, if you're playing against a blue deck and he's used tons of counters and you have your most powerful creature right in your hand and you cast him because you know he can't have anymore counters, guess what? One more counter! The controls are awkward and clunky too. It's hard to understand how to block and attack because you have to go through at least 3 "are you sure you want to attack" screens.","November 30, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpectraDevil/recommended/213850/","SpectraDevil","SpectraDevil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpectraDevil/","267 products in account","What is Magic??\n\nWell Magic is a strategy based card game that can be played with up to 4 players. You are given decks that you can edit and devise a strategy with the cards given in that deck (keeping in mind that you can only use 60-100 cards and 40% of them have to be land cards. Every card in Magic has a mana cost (except lands) to pay for these mana costs Magic uses 5 different elements known as land cards that produce mana: *Fire ~ Mountain *Darkness ~ Swamp *Earth ~ Forest *Water ~ Island *Light ~ plains, Each element has its own things that they are good at and bad at and part from your life force bar these lands are your main resource. In away lands are a bit like money you spend them witch leads to investing in more money and when it your turn again you get paid again, of course the more money you have the bigger and better things you can buy and so on. To win the game you must think carefully and play your cards right to either take your opponent's life force to 0 or make them run out of cards and its very rear that anyone comes to a draw. Matches can last anything from 5 mins to an hour and a half but a good average match lasts about half an hour.\n\nMy opinion & More Info\n\nI wouldn't say this game is totally mind-blowing but it is in all fairness its a grate game! Out of the 150+ games i have on my list its the most played and iv met some good people and made some friends from all over the world with magic 2014, but i don't just recommend 2014, all of the Magics are great and i recommend them to all, even if your not a fan of card games, i know people that hate card games however, they love this one. For me 2014 just feels nicer and more user friendly, it only takes 1 or 2 matches to pick up most of the rules, plus i like the new game mode "Sealed Play". As for the campaigns they are all fun, not very long but that has been balanced out in difficulty and the amount of of them, some of the matches you will find easy some you will learn to hate, it depends on how you build your decks. progressing threw these campaigns unlocks decks, but you still have to win about 30 times with each deck before you have all the cards in them decks (unless you buy them instead!). No doubt that you will find online mutiplayer easier than playing against the AI as the AI has a very big and bad habit of cheating and i find 2014 cheats more than the previous Magics but hey that makes the win even more rewarding right!! Plus if an AI in a card game wasn't able to cheat then it would be too easy and boring and would make the game rather lousy.\n\nGame Modes\n\nFree For All - This mode is hole idea of Magic and is the most played it can be played by 2 players or anything up to 4 players there really isn't much to tell about this mode other that what iv already told you. like all the other game modes its just some good relaxing fun and if you can get your opponents talking you get a good giggle out of it, even more so when you are really good friends with that person.\n\nTwo Headed Giant - This game mode requires a little bit of team work and 4 players. The game mode works the same way as Free For All but with a twist, you are split into teams of 2. you and your partner share the same life force and do your best to defend it, you are able to see yours and your partners hand so then if they a card that can help you or the other way round you can just tell them (unless your partner is an AI of course) but the only the abilities or effects you own only work for you and you also have your own supply of land cards the rest of the game is just like Free For All. This game mode can come up with some interesting results as some decks just don't mix and others compliment each other rather well.\n\nSealed Play - This mode is like a sub game mode its completely different form the other two main modes (Free For All and [/b]Two Headed Giant[/b] use the decks you buy or slowly unlock). Sealed Play is made to make things more like the paper version of Magic. You get given 5 booster packs of random cards and then your expected to make a deck of at least 40 cards (there is an auto build option) and then you can fight your way threw that deck's campaign to earn more cards but you can also use it in online multiplayer, sadly at the moment there is no way of trading cards with friends or resetting decks also you can only go head to head with this game mode, I'm looking forward to this changing because Sealed Play has a lot of potential and i don't think it has met any where near its potential (lazy Dev's or maybe there just gathering ideas for the future of this game mode).\n\nThanks for reading all this, its a lot i know but i hoped it helped and you at least give it a try as its not that price heavy and you can get a really good time out of it, like i have. One last thing if there is cards you cant seam to unlock that is because there is something called promo cards that you have to unlock using codes.","February 25, 2014","true","555.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Matches can last anything from 5 mins to an hour and a half but a good average match lasts about half an hour.\n\nMy opinion & More Info\n\nI wouldn't say this game is totally mind-blowing but it is in all fairness its a grate game! Out of the 150+ games i have on my list its the most played and iv met some good people and made some friends from all over the world with magic 2014, but i don't just recommend 2014, all of the Magics are great and i recommend them to all, even if your not a fan of card games, i know people that hate card games however, they love this one. For me 2014 just feels nicer and more user friendly, it only takes 1 or 2 matches to pick up most of the rules, plus i like the new game mode "Sealed Play". As for the campaigns they are all fun, not very long but that has been balanced out in difficulty and the amount of of them, some of the matches you will find easy some you will learn to hate, it depends on how you build your decks. progressing threw these campaigns unlocks decks, but you still have to win about 30 times with each deck before you have all the cards in them decks (unless you buy them instead!). No doubt that you will find online mutiplayer easier than playing against the AI as the AI has a very big and bad habit of cheating and i find 2014 cheats more than the previous Magics but hey that makes the win even more rewarding right!! Plus if an AI in a card game wasn't able to cheat then it would be too easy and boring and would make the game rather lousy.\n\nGame Modes\n\nFree For All - This mode is hole idea of Magic and is the most played it can be played by 2 players or anything up to 4 players there really isn't much to tell about this mode other that what iv already told you. like all the other game modes its just some good relaxing fun and if you can get your opponents talking you get a good giggle out of it, even more so when you are really good friends with that person.\n\nTwo Headed Giant - This game mode requires a little bit of team work and 4 players. The game mode works the same way as Free For All but with a twist, you are split into teams of 2. you and your partner share the same life force and do your best to defend it, you are able to see yours and your partners hand so then if they a card that can help you or the other way round you can just tell them (unless your partner is an AI of course) but the only the abilities or effects you own only work for you and you also have your own supply of land cards the rest of the game is just like Free For All. This game mode can come up with some interesting results as some decks just don't mix and others compliment each other rather well.\n\nSealed Play - This mode is like a sub game mode its completely different form the other two main modes (Free For All and [/b]Two Headed Giant[/b] use the decks you buy or slowly unlock). Sealed Play is made to make things more like the paper version of Magic. You get given 5 booster packs of random cards and then your expected to make a deck of at least 40 cards (there is an auto build option) and then you can fight your way threw that deck's campaign to earn more cards but you can also use it in online multiplayer, sadly at the moment there is no way of trading cards with friends or resetting decks also you can only go head to head with this game mode, I'm looking forward to this changing because Sealed Play has a lot of potential and i don't think it has met any where near its potential (lazy Dev's or maybe there just gathering ideas for the future of this game mode).\n\nThanks for reading all this, its a lot i know but i hoped it helped and you at least give it a try as its not that price heavy and you can get a really good time out of it, like i have. One last thing if there is cards you cant seam to unlock that is because there is something called promo cards that you have to unlock using codes.","February 25, 2014","true","555.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You can easily learn the rules at your pace and see some examples of particular strategies. If you like it, you can consider starting with the actual card game, which will give you the freedom this game lacks.\nThe second thing you might use this game for is if you already are a Magic player and want the chance to try out some thematic decks.

It's just that it's ultimately Magic without the deck building, which was really the best part of traditional Magic.  Decks are premade with a few cards that you can shuffle in or out.  You soon face computer players with better decks that are scripted to get cards in useful order.  If you had the flexiblity to build decks to counter there decks, rather than play with the pre-mades, I think this would be fun.  The frustrating thing is that I have a solid pool of cards between the premades - you just can't use them as a pool.  It was worth the $5 though.","January 5, 2014","false","11.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Thats kinda deal breaker.\n\nIF you wanna play against your friend, it wont happen!\nIf you wanna just play random people online then this is game for you.\n\nPure MtG gold wrapped in worst coding i've seen in a while, seriously...\n\n","January 5, 2014","false","5.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Opening boosterpacks to create your own deck! It's almost as fun as the real thing. The game feels very refined this time around even the sound effects and some of the lesser mechanics of the game have been improved. Anyone who's even remotely interested in MTG should give this a try. it is a great way to get back into the game if its been a while or even if you are an active player it can be a fun way to experiment with the different card mechanics, test decks and you will enjoy the Planeswalker story in the campaign that is starting to really flesh out into a pretty cool story. it offers some interesting motivation to your games that are already very engaging. The nice thing about MTG is you can draw perfect cards or the worst cards from your library and lose either way. It takes intelligence to win and excercising that with the hand you are dealt is supremely engaging and satisfying. losing is sometimes frustrating but when you finally get your opponent down with a strategy that you engineered yourself it is extremely rewarding!","December 30, 2013","true","85.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"
