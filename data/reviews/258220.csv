There's better eye candy for less money on the Internet.  The game feels like it was made in a weekend.  It feels very guided, even for a hack and slash, Devil May Cry wanna-be.\n\nWhile I appreciate the time it must have taken to make the game, it needs about another year of developing and overall reduction in the amount of things that say "This is the first real game I created".  If we were in 2003, the gameplay mechanics would have been right up there with the best of them, but the very few things that make the game stand out are very gimmicky and not maturely integrated into the game.  In almost a Frankenstein sense, they took three ideas that CAN work well together and mashed them all together into a game that is just passable.\n\nThe depth of the game reminds me of the first couple LEGO Star Wars games - very superficial.  The attacks don't feel powerful, either, which is a big pet peeve of mine.  Games like Devil May Cry 4 and DmC, when you hit an enemy, they appear to be jarred by your attack.  In this game I just didn't get that feeling of power in my attacks.\n\nAs with any indie game, I really root for the developers and can overlook small issues, but I didn't really have anything solid to grab onto with this game.  I didn't really feel like I was doing anything for a purpose, it feels like the game starts about 30 minutes into the actual story and nothing really feels like it has a clear goal.  The character acting is not great, and while the game looks good, just like the pretty girls in high school, there's very little going on under the hood of this game.","December 2, 2013","false","3.8"," 44 of 56 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","44","56","0","0"

It is right up my alley. If you're looking for a Game of the Year contender, this isn't it. But this is a simple, entertaining, fun little adventure that I would recommend to anyone looking for a little mindless fun.\n\nQuick summary:\nFun, mindless hack 'n' slash. In terms of gameplay, it is similar to The Bard's Tale, which I also enjoyed.\nTakes about three hours for a single playthrough, and fun enough to go back to play to unlock different endings.\nDecent story for a video game, with branching story options, though generally quite linear.\nSome minor character upgrades.\nSimple loot system, where new items found are better than existing items, and it really only makes sense to save your money to buy the best weapons in the game towards the end.\nGamepad controls reasonably intuitive.\nGraphics and voice acting are good enough.\nVery stable. Not a single crash.\nAll in all, I would give it a 7/10. There is nothing in this game that is bad -- it's just not going to be on anyone's top 10 list ... except maybe mine.\n\nIf this were a film, it would not be an Oscar contender, but it would be one of those movies that you'll just sit there and watch and enjoy whenever you see it playing on the TV years later.","November 15, 2015","true","7.5"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","22","22","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmwfte/recommended/258220/","tmwfte","tmwfte","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmwfte/","4293 products in account","It's more action than RPG, with only a handful of side quests to distract you from the main plot, despite having mechanics similar to Diablo or Torchlight. There's loot, but it seems largely inconsequential compared to the ability upgrades that you'll receive. There's no way to max them out, though, as once your finish an area, enemies do not respawn and you cannot revisit them for more loot or missed blood coins.\n\nWhich leaves us with a fairly short (5-7 hours) main story. It's by no means terrible, but its' the sort of thing that you'll see as a somewhat unintelligible direct-to-TV b-movie. The voice acting is generally well done, although some of the scripting strains credibility and intelligence. If you're not laughing out of embarrassment by the third time the priest says "but first I will use my healing powers" in the introductory battle, you're likely to cringe through the remaining dialogue. The limited dialogue choices do have an effect on the outcome of the game, and there is apparently an entirely different ending you can achieve, but don't mistake this for a particularly deep RPG.\n\nThere are some platforming mechanics incorporated into the game and, while they do offer an interesting change of pace, their implementation are less than good. If you're using a keyboard and mouse, it will be an exercise in frustration as you leap to your death multiple times as often the next platform will be at an angle not recognized by your keyboard buttons.\n\nGraphics and animation, however, are fairly well done. It's at the very least a nice looking diversion for a few hours. I can't recommend paying more than $10 for it though.","November 18, 2013","true","10.6"," 99 of 154 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","99","154","0","0"

From top to bottom, nearly every aspect of this vampiric hack-and-slash is unapologetically bad, yet I find myself in an odd situation. As terrible as it is, and it really is, I enjoyed playing it.The game’s plot, which is often told through hilariously stagy dialog, revolves around a vampire-hating Templar knight who, for reasons never fully explained, gets eternally bound to a vampiress archer. Then the knight becomes a vampire himself, which really makes it a game about two vampires bound together. The obliviously shallow story continues all the way up to the game’s not-shocking-at-all ending.The combat consists of a regular “light” attack and two “power” attacks that are on cooldown timers. Characters also harness their vampiric magic to push or pull enemies and key environmental elements which sometimes became part of the game’s simplistic platforming segments. Feeding on the blood of enemies serves to replenish health and was probably the most satisfying aspect of the combat, however for reasons that are never explained away, strong enemies and bosses are immune to these powers.Hacking away with a sword and then seamlessly switching to Alysa in order to fire off a stream of arrows works well, but the action fails to evolve in an interesting way throughout the game. Boss fights suffer a yawning lack of imagination, with many encounters amounting to little more than working a strong enemy’s health down only to have them heal and send in a wave of lesser enemies while you rinse, wash, and repeat the process a given number of times.Worse yet, when bosses reach a “defeated state” the game cuts to a cinematic scene.The lack of transition and the speed at which these scenes engage is disorienting. Worse, when it happened in the middle of an attack chain ending the final boss fight it caused me to inadvertently skip the majority of the game’s concluding scene.While it’s okay to like a bad game, it’s not an excuse to call a bad game good.With so many true classics now available on download services, there is really no reason to pick up Blood Knights.Overall 4/10.","September 25, 2014","false","20.2"," 54 of 80 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","54","80","0","3"

Just don't go into it expecting a deep vampire rpg rich with lore because it's 'not' that game.\n\nGameplay is your typical story driven arpg, quite linear. Get shuffled down the corridor killing guys, hitting checkpoints and eventually coming to a cutscene. Sometimes this scene will give you different dialog choices but nothing changes the outcome of the game. Just elaborates on the current situation. The 'twist' here is you have 2 characters which you can swap between on the fly. Which does add something to the otherwise stale attacks. (standard, standard, special).\n\nSkill trees are basic. You get access to almost all abilities from the get go and can just select what you wish to put the points into as you level up. Collecting 'red coins' along the way will also allow you to bump up the characters basic attributes.\nItem randomness doesnt really exist. Had a couple of playthroughs and each time I received indentical loot from each chest (no loot grinding here). Voice acting will probably make you cringe a little at times with its stiffness but overall it's acceptable. Soundtrack is slightly higher quality but does get a bit repetitive.\n\nIf you enjoyed Dungeon Siege 3 for what it was (not the dungeon siege we remember) and don't mind your vampires. Pick this one up when its on sale. Otherwise probably avoid as there is better options out there. Would definitely be recommending a 360pad for this game as well.","January 9, 2014","true","2.4"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","26","35","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paul_snow/recommended/258220/","paul_snow","LoveJesusHateTheGovernment","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paul_snow/","947 products in account","Wow. I'm really baffled reading all of the negative reviews this game got. Maybe I'm just easier to please than most people but I absolutely loved this game! It was a real gem. I was fortunate enough to get this on the steam summer sale for three dollars, but after playing it, I think it's worth the full price tag. From what I can gather reading the negative reviews, the majority of complaints seem to be that it's linear, a poor pc port of a console game, doesn't have AAA graphics, and poor voice acting. Other complaints are repetitive combat, boring musical score and poor story. These last three I strongly disagree with, and I thought the graphics were pretty good for a $15.00 title. First of all, I loved the story which revolved around a world where humans and vampires are at war for dominance of the planet. Some spell forges the souls of two enemies: your character, (a male human) and a female vampire, (admittedly this is never explained but it's supposed to help the humans turn the tide of the war somehow). They are stuck with each other and have to keep each other alive because if one dies, the other does too. Well, your character gets turned in the first chapter of the game, so now you are a vampire also, as well as your companion. I very much liked the dialogue and chemistry between the two main characters, which I thought was pretty entertaining. The combat was very fun. If you are anything like me, you will probably use the male, (former human) 70's percent of the time because he uses melee attacks which I find to be a lot more fun. However, you will find yourself relying on the female (vampire's) ranged attacks  more as the game progresses and the enemies get stronger. I found the combat to be very fun and fluid, and didn't get boring to me at all. I liked the two main characters and the story, which unfolded more and more as the game progressed, with an interesting turn at the end. The final villain, (who is not introduced until fairly late in the game) was very VERY cool, not just as a final boss, but as a character as well, and is accompanied by an awesome musical score during the final battle. It is my favorite musical score in the game! Sadly, my copy of the game did not come with the soundtrack. I would have liked to have put it on my i-Pod.  The aesthetics of the game were very visual rich, (if you read any of my other reviews, you will see that aesthetics are VERY important to me). I especially liked Noah's pass and the second to last level, which has the ruins of Noah's ark mounted in the sky on top of a mountain peak.  The controls were very easy to pick up on. I normally hate playing rpgs with controllers, perfecting a mouse and keyboard, but this game was incredibly easy to play with a controller. This is probably because it's not really an rpg. It is primarily an action, hack-n-slash, with only the bare minimum elements of an rpg included, (basically leveling up and earning gold for better equipment). There is also skills to be learned as your character gets stronger, but they are very basic skills. This game is fantastic for what it is: a very linear action hack-n-slash with a cool story and mediocre voice acting. The length of the game is roughly 7 to 8 hours on normal difficulty. This was just perfect. It told a neat sci-fi/fantasy story without being dragged out. If this has been longer, it might have started to drag out a bit. Here is some advice for anyone playing for the first time. Don't buy anything from the trader. All equipment you need can be found during the quest. Save all gold you collect until about 3/4 the way through and then buy the bada$$ sword called "SATAN'S JUSTICE!!" ...best name for a sword ever! LOL! I really get a kick out of that. I guess I never really thought of Satan as caring too much about justice.\nThe only two flaws I can really think to say about this game is that you can't control the camera angle. But don't worry, it's not bad and the camera keeps focused on the action.......most of the time. (There was I think two times where the camera angle obstructed my character's path that I can remember). But don't worry, it's not as bad as other games like Garshasp, where the lack of control of the camera angle took some serious getting used to. Also, the platforming can be a bit annoying, but fortunately there isn't that much of it. Overall, I really liked this game a lot. It does not deserve the negativity that some people give it. I think people buy a game like this expecting the quality of a sixty dollar, AAA title and get disappointed, (I'm only speculating. I honestly don't know why it's gotten so much negativity.)

I haven't tried the controller yet, but the keyboard and mouse controls are pretty bad, especially as the female/shooter vampire. I find her aiming system pretty hard to get used to, but I've had similar problems with similar controls. The voice acting is a bit shoddy, sometimes the animation is off, and some of the characters sound.. hollow, as if there's an echo behind them.\n\nThat being said, once I get past the intro and become the actual vampire, it becomes a bit better. I haven't gotten very far into the game yet, but I WILL be trying it again, and giving it another shot with an actual controller, hoping that it's a bit easier to handle (it reminded me toward the end of my play session of the old Gamecube Baldur's Gate games, which means that I owe it to myself and the developers to give it another try).\n\nIt DOES get a bit better as you continue to play, as you get used to the controls, so I'm going to give it another go and then edit this review after.\n\nAs of right now, however, at full price I cannot recommend this. I picked it up for pretty cheap on the Humble Store during the Spring Sale (I would say around or less than $5, but I'm not entirely sure) and in my opinion if you get an hour of playtime per $10 price, you're at least getting as much time out of the game as you spent to buy it. So, if you want to try to grit your teeth and get past the difficult/clunky controls and just play a hack'n'slash, and you have the chance to pick it up cheap, you may enjoy it.

Full 3 hours. Yes thats the whole game.\nAnyways, the gameplay is quite okay, just mash buttons over and over. But there is a cool feature where you can grab people and push them around in the air and or away. Thats possible too with your friend so you had to do , lets call them little riddles, where you had just to push your friend up, then he you and that over and over until your upstairs. A little bit funny to push your friend instead down a cliff and get him killed. Very funny indeed. Anyways, there is an upgrade system that is completely useless. Like 3 % Crit chance etc. You can buy and sell loot , but mostly you didnt had to. Game is pretty easy . The story is okay, i liked it, but nothing really impressive. The story behind the vampire and templar that have to work together should have made a cool story, but well the dialogue sucks, pretty uninterestening and boring. I had my fun with it, but only because it was so short and stopped when it got boring. If you are looking for a quick co-op game for the evening, go ahead and buy it at a sale.

Voice acting was fairly poor, but worked alright with the writing style I think so I didn't actually mind it that much. Environments were beautiful and varied considering the size of the development team. Gameplay was pretty good and the combat was responsive and seemed to be balanced really well. I played on normal and still died a fair few times, but always because I was stupid in combat rather than because of anything out of my control. Navigation was a bit of a pain at first, but I got used to it slowly. I did enjoy the different characters you could play and swapping between them during combat turned out to be useful. I thought it was just going to be a gimmick at first. It had some RPG elements, but nothing too great. Just inventoray management, limited skill and attribute leveling and a couple of story decisions that really didn't make a difference in the long run.\n\nWhat I didn't get used to was the directed camera. I HATE directed cameras and it served no purpose in this game except to make some areas more hidden than they would otherwise be and to make combat more difficult. When an enemy is in front of me, I want to be able to see them, not have them hidden off my screen by a camera that randomly decided to zoom in on my character cause I entered a particular section of the map. I think directed camera's are one of the worst design decisions a developer can make, and it annoyed me throughout the game.\n\nIf you want a quick, fun dungeon crawler and don't mind a directed camera, then I would recommend this game. Otherwise, you may find it too frustrating with not enough good elements to make up for it.","October 15, 2014","true","4.9"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Sure there is a lot of potential to improve it, but this is always the case. In the time you play the campaign it will rarely happen that you think, well that should have been made different / better.\n\nFor example the “fixed” camera can sometimes be a small handicap.

Blood Knight?... well it should be called Blood Knight because there is only one knight and the Vampire Mistress Alysa... isn't exactly a knight but more a Huntress.\n\nOkay now that the basic title misleadings are out of the way, lets write something about the game itself.\n\nWell you might have guessed it, Blood Knight(s) is about Vampires, you play as either a Vampire Huntress which was bound by a contract or as a human knight.\nThe basic idea behind this is / was, to exploit the Vampires power against their own kind... but as such plans are always prone to fail, this case here makes no difference.\nVery early in the game, the male human counterpart finally dies and turns into a full vampire... much to the displeasure of his following knights and the priest Bartholomäus.\nThe priest and the knights, now your enemies, catch your strange duo in no time but fail to properly execute them, again these type of mistakes are prone to lead to ones downfall.\n\nYou don't push a hero from a cliff and leave in the thought that the fall has killed him. You behead him, chop him into pieces, burn his remains and spread them in the ocean.\nThat is proper hero disposal procedure, to be read in the "The Top 100 Things I'd Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord" paragraph 13, which can be found here: http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html .\n\nBut to their defense, neither the priest nor the knights probably read that written piece of knowledge nor are they anywhere near of being an evil overlord.\n\nNow without further spoiling the storyline, lets say something about the gampelay.\n\n(To be fair, Blood Knight(s) is probably a game you would want to play together with a friend, a huge monitor / projector or tv and a box full of cooled beer, neither was to my avail during my run... which kinda reduced its possible fun factor.)\n\nThe principle is simple, it's a basic third person hack and slash game, with rpg elements, based upon a very very linear storyline and with only the smallest amount of free choice a player can get. This manifests itself with having the freedom to chose weapons and gear as well from a short list of abilities which can be upgraded as well.\n\nNow each of those two playable characters (Alysa the Vampire Huntress and Jeremy the former Knight) feature a very different set of gamplay, focusing with Alysa only on ranged fighting while Jeremy is more fit for the rough close combat brawl.\nAnd here is also the point with the most lost potential, combat just doesn't feel super awesome with neither characters, just okay-ish.\nAlysa for example seems to be somehow overpowered which shows mostly during the endbosses where she can run before a boss for hours, pumping he/she/it full of arrows from safe distance, while Jeremy has serious problems with everything that can't be stunned or tossed or in anyway kept from harming him which is mostly the bosses or minibosses.\nAnother flaw or rather an uninteresting necessity (in single player), is the switching between chraracters, it does not work well with the rather fast paced combat and you always have the feeling that you made the wrong choice.\nMy biggest grudge is with the jumping sequences and the incoherent camera angles such sequences always seem to come with. An annoying amount of deaths was caused not by the game being ultra unfair or hard BUT by strange camera angles during those jumping sequences.\n\nTo its redemption, as sayed, combat is rather fast paced, it won't let you hang for hours searching for something to battle, puzzles (if those could be called that way) are easy and the game provides you with a steady stream of gear and gold as well as experience points for leveling up. Save points are also not very rare and in my opinion are not to badly placed.\n\nSo to say something about performance, first time starting, I was plaqued as many others with this strange stuttering where the framerate was down to 5 - 10 fps, a pc restart solved that problem. There was only one instance I could call a BUG where the game script broke and did not notice that I had liquidated all enemies in an area. Luckily there was a save point just before that and reloading an redoing that one segment brought me save over it.\n\nAll in all, this is not a bad game and could be a fun game with prerequisites like a second player, a cooled box of beer and a huge monitor.\n\nHaving written down all of this, I will give it a positive note.\n","November 15, 2015","true","8.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If I could I would give this game neither a thumbs up or down.  So the best I can do is give it a thumbs up but I'll also give it a 4 out of 10.\n\nTo sum up what this game is, a poor man's Castlevania.  It feels like there is a rich world to explore but ultimately falls flat in showcasing it.\n\nCharacter progression is done through leveling and assigning points to various passives and finding predetermined gear scattered throughout the linear levels.  Ultimately you will be using the same attacks and strategies the entire game.  Though I suppose the progession doesn't have to be too deep considering how short and easy the game is.\n\nThe voice acting is atrocious.  You will either become very annoyed any time someone opens their mouth or you will get a good laugh in between combat sequences.\n\nThere are worse games out there but Blood Knights isn't a whole lot better.

However, I can understand why people would suggest that it is a poor game. However, having only bought this from the Indie Gala Blood Knights Bundle because it was a part of the Steam Trading Cards program I have to suggest that it's been worth my while. I'm not certain that I'll finish this but  for now I'm satisfied.\n\nIt's your typical A-RPG style game. The camera is a negative - I wish it were controllable but it apparently isn't. If there are "secret" areas that can be found the camera is a hindrance in that department. The first boss battle was more pot luck mashing buttons than knowing what to do. The game tells you to destroy the alter but doesn't give you anything else to explain how to do so.\n\nIf you don't expect an epic game, it isn't, you wont be disappointed. I can think of many other games that are worth less time than this one.","May 30, 2014","true","2.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It is horribly generic. I bought a $3 bundle with this game in it because it looked good in the videos on the store page. It is a flawless example of good looking video then you actually play it and it's sh-ttingly bad. Its regular price of $15 is laugh out loud funny. The combat is extremely clunky and generic like something you would find at the bottom of a flea market bin like a unknown action game from 2001, and a bad one at that. If I had to pick a game to describe what "cheap feeling" is, this game is it. The voice acting is some of the worst ever and the sound and music are instantly forgettable. The graphics are dirt poor and the character mouth and body movement in cut scenes looks like sock puppets. All you do is hammer X to attack and press a few other buttons for skills. I'm not saying that that is what makes it bad though. There are a lot of great games that are button mashers. But when a game is this terrible, the fact that you mash buttons the whole time gets easily amplified into a hugely negative aspect because combat is so incredibly clunky and generic.\n\nIf you like sock puppets and soul crushingly generic gameplay, stop wasting time reading this review and buy this game right now. If you want a similar type of action button masher that actually does things right and has a good high quality feel to it, buy RAW Realms of Ancient War. That is just a good one off the top of my head. There are plenty more if you look. Don't look here though. It's like paying $15 at the carnival to go looking into the freak show to see something cool and all there is on stage are two guys fisting and blowing each other.\n\n3/10","January 8, 2015","false","0.5"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","18","34","0","0"

I actually love short game, and got this game because I thought its short.  But just when my characters got good enough gears, and I started to like the characters, the game ended. I just feel like I wanted more.\n\nAI bug, that's one phrase that I have forgotten for years until I played this game. Sometimes, when you go out of range of enemy, they retreat to their original position. But as they are retreating, you attack them(with range weapon), they will come back and attack you.   And you just adjust the distance between the enemies and you.  Once you get to the right distance(sweet spot), the AI don't know if they should retreat or attack, so they will keep turning back and forward, and now you can keep attacking them without worrying them attacking you.\n\nOne thing that I really didn't like about this game is the camera angles, it gets annoying when you accidentally jump off ledges because of bad camera angle.  As for other aspects of the game, like soundtrack, voice acting, and graphics, I have no complains, pretty mediocre stuff, but good enough for me.\n\nOne of the best thing in this game is the ability to switch between characters; being able to switch between range and melee characters make the gameplay much more fun and interesting.  But what I love most about this game is the characters and their interaction; more specifically, their cheesy dialogue, really funny.  It's just what I expect from game like this.  I mean, who doesn't like a game with vampire story lines, even if it is a cheesy one.\n\nI know, it seems like I wrote bunch of bad things about this game but at the end recommend it(I should really stop doing that, maybe that's why my reviews get lots of not helpful votes, lol).  Well, when I think about it, I really want a sequel of this game(as long as it's not worse than this).  I want the same characters with cheesy dialogue and the mindless hack and slash(with exploitable AI bug). It was a fun game nonetheless despite all the flaws.","February 13, 2014","true","9.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There is a lot wrong with it but at the same time it was at least mildly entertaining enough to keep me interested enough to finish it maybe it's because it's the kind of game I like.\n\nThis game is an action third person perspective game, that has some platforming, and RPG-ish qualities. The camera is fixed and cannot be changed by the player so in a sense it is similar to Ninja Gaiden/God of War/Devil May Cry, but is no where close to those games in quality. There is thankfully no backtracking in this game, but it is very much on rails, though there are hidden areas in levels where you will find some loot and blood coins used for upgrading your stats. Loot from the chests in the game are not randomized but fixed so you will get the same loot every time from the chests even if you die and reload from an earlier autosave spot. Also the best weapons are sold at the merchant not found as you play. Saves happen at fixed spots and you cannot save whenever you want. There are 2 playable characters both fight differently. The Male one is a melee fighter and has some rather limited set of moves and can dodge. This makes the game play similar to Ninja Gaiden, but unfortunately the controls and combos are severly lacking. You upgrade your weapons as you find them but the animations are the same always and no effects happen from them even if it looks as if you have a flaming sword. There aren't any good fighting counters or timing of strikes, like you find in the better action games like Devil May Cry/Ninja Gaiden/God of War, so it's basically a button masher. The female is a ranged fighter and has no dodge, but the playstyle then changes from a Action fighting style to basically a twin stick shooter type game. Overall it is a less interesting way to play, but at the same time makes the game much easier. The problem with either playstyles is the AI is dumb as rocks. You get into range they swarm you, you back off to a certain point they retreat back to their starting positions. This makes the ranged fighter extremely easy to play, and the melee fighter lets you get out of danger temporarily. This decreases the tension and the preceived danger of encounters. The platforming parts can be a bit of a troublesome thing because of the fixed camera. There were a couple of times where I died for no other reason than misjudging the distances due to the camera angle. Some spots looked as if it were possible to make it but you can't unless you hit a switch. So in general you see a switch press it and see if a platform appears.\n\nThe story is okay. It's a vampire vs humans genre, and isn't that bad overall. The game's budget really shows here though as the voice acting is at best passable to bad throughout the game. I might have enjoyed the story more if it had no voices at all because sometimes you just cringed at some of the dialog being delivered. There seems to be some choices to be made as you go that contribute to alternate endings than the one I saw but I only went through the game once. With that said this is probably the only limited amount of replay I see in the game as the fighting and loot system don't seem to be something I would want to replay it for.\n\nPros:\nDecent story\nmultiple endings\ncontroller supported\ndecent graphics\nbargain price\nno backtracking or much filler "quests"\nCons:\nBad voice acting\nFixed camera\npoor AI\npoor fight system\nnon randomized loot in chests\nbest weapons bought not found\nplatforming can be problematic with the fixed camera\nShort game length (approx 5 hours) with limited replay valueSo overall I have to say I can't recommend the game, the cons outweigh the pros, but it at least held my attention enough to finish the game which is why I said it's kind of hard to review the game. The short length could be both a pro and a con in this regard. A pro because it keeps you on target to the end and doesn't unnecessarily bore you with filler side quests to artifically increase the game game length, and a con because it makes the game feel kind of short.","September 20, 2014","false","5.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It sells for a "budget" price but it is really a well-made game.  The gameplay hook is that you switch between two characters on the fly, a ranged character and a sword fighting character.  They both play well and add variety in the single player campaign.\n\nGraphically the game is pretty, the gameplay itself is smooth and you travel to the typical medieval locales and they all look good.  The character models are solid and all of the equipment and weapons you find reflect visually on your characters.  The cut scenes look nice, a little plain but they work, the ladies look like a teenage boys idea of fantasy women but it worked for me.  The voice acting is a bit wooden at times however the action sounds really add to the immersion, the music never gets repetitive.\n\nStory wise its vampires vs the church, you do have some dialog decisions but nothing that really changes the outcome of the game, but it still gives you a chance to leave your mark on the adventure.  The game is a bit short at only 6 hours but for the price it’s fair.  My only complaint is the camera is fixed, this never hampered gameplay for me, but in 2014 not having a camera to move around is really strange, I’m guising this is where the “low budget" came into play.  Overall Blood Knights was a fun if short adventure, and I enjoyed my time battling the vampires and undead of ancient Rome.

Blood Knights is actually such a game. The biggest problem in Blood Knights is the camera, which is clunky at it's best and not accurate at all. In the beginning i had this problem of instead jumping on a platform above you that my char falls into the big black hole. And that happened a couple of times in an other level too.\nThe dialogue gets on your nerves sometimes. The fighting is ok i guess. The AI however is as dumb as an ox.\nNo, Deck13 didn't do a good job this time. Now Venetica was also not everything, but that one was better.\nNevertheless it's a little fun game to play, if you look past the errors. Characters itself look quite good and the landscapes are interesting. Story is ok, not very interesting. But that camera, that nails it. And that dimwitted dialogue.\nIf you're a fan of vampiregames and look for a game to play with a vampire, then there are better options.\nVampire the masquerade: bloodlines for rpg and the first 2 BloodRayne games (available at gog) if you want an action game.

I've even had where the lighting in a cutscene completely disappears when it's done.\n- The animations, man the animations. Why does everyone walk/run like they have a stick up their ars!\n- The dialogue all sounds like it's phoned in. The voice acting is /wrist worthy. There is no emotion in anything. In some voices, you can hear an echo from the room they were recording in!\n- Fighting is repetative and controles are bad. Playing as the male guy (already forget/don't care his name) plays your normal hack and slash game, but the female vampire (again) tries to have Twin Stick shooter controls, but they simply do not work well with Cinamatic Camera Systems. She has auto lock on, and won't always lock onto what ever you are pointing at, which is anoying. I've had to aim pretty far off of enemies before the lock on would even work.\n- LOCAL COOP ONLY! Are you kidding me?! If there was online play this game would be a little more fun to play with a friend, but you can't.\n- Maps/Levels are not too interesting. But my main issues is some of the "platforming" sections. Having these bad controls, and trying to jump platform to platform, only to have the camera move, and fall to your death. AND find out that the last checkpoint was 5 min ago. I've had checkpoints not go off, even going up and touching the checkpoints and still not activating, forcing me to play to the next point and hope it works.\n- Borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI. I've had enemies get stuck on rocks, run off cliffs, run into water and drown themselves. I've even had enemies clip through the floor and walls.\n- Bugs, oh so many bugs. I've actually KILLED NPC that give you dialogue in a cutscene, and it played through normally, but you can see them dead on the ground.\n\n\nThe only "good" things I've been able to get out of Blood Knights are as follows:\n- Steam Trading Cards\n- Achievements\n- All female characters wear very reveling clothing/armor and have big chests?\n- Items look pretty cool, and do change what your character looks like.\n- There is a speach volume slider. It does go all the way to off.\n\n... That's it I'm afraid. I personally say do not buy at all, but if you are curious and really wanna hurt yourself, as always wait for a Steam Sale. This is not worth $16.99 (CAN), or even $5.  I gave this game a good try, but I can't play it. Glad I got this from a bundle.","February 1, 2015","false","2.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","9","17","4","0"

That was the question going through my head when playing this. A terribad something that tries to cater to all kinds of people, falls flat in every respect and tries to cover it up with huge mammary glands (more like Boob Knights, am I right?). At one moment in time this might have had potential - but as it stands it's a less than average mix of action, twinstick shooting, hack'n'slash, RPG elements and a silly B-movie plot.\n\nIt's not that these elements are wrong, but they don't click in Blood Knights. Everything is so limited, and doesn't fit the scale of this game. You have RPG elements - but it's not like you can actually grind for XP, you will reach max level by the end of the game anyway. You have skillpoints, but skills don't do much besides giving you that awesome +2% crit-chance you always wanted and none of them alter gameplay drastically. There is loot too, but it is again so limited and hardly game-changing, you do more damage and can survive longer for the most part. All of this feels tacked on and kind of out of place - after all, you basically go from stage to stage clobber everyone and everything up, take their stuff and watch unfunny and stiffly animated cutscenes, rinse and repeat. Why do I need levelings and loot? Right, I don't.\n\nThe action itself is pretty okayish, the hack'n'slay parts I don't really care about, too lightweight and buttonmashy. However, the female vampire sporting the dual-crossbows felt nicely "twinstick-shooter" and quite fun to play. If they had only stuck to that mechanic and built a pure action-game around that. Instead, you get some lacklustre platforming, simplistic switch-puzzles, the aforementioned RPG-stuff and even an empty, barren "hub" that you can return to in order to trade with excatly one merchant and grab one of like three sidequests (the one I did was "shoot 4 torches" - amazing, I know!). If this was an amateur project to experiment with various gamesystems and ideas, I could understand the patchwork-like design choices and the limited variation but as a retail product I don't get it. I mean, you have a handful of enemies that you fight again and again in small arenas, there are maybe 4 bosses that vaguely could be called that, and you usally fight in the same-ish areas (ruins, mountains or mountain-ruins with a random castle-intermission thrown in every now and then) - why on earth would you makes this a game that only does everything?\n\nA whole other topic is the non-sensical storyline (lots of relics, the catholic church in rome and well, vampires!) and the particularly embarassing portrayal of female characters in this. It's the worst kind of "forever alone"-material outside of certain japanese games that I have seen in a long time. When your characters defining traits are "big boobs" and "bigger boobs" you are doing it wrong. The first half of the game the dialogue between the male hero and female hero could be summed up as "shut up, woman!" which is not my idea of witty banter. Needless to say this fits the overall quality of the game quite nicely.\n\nFor the fan of abyssmal b-movie trash turned videogame this might actually be a little gem (if you have enough beer at hand), it really is that cringeworthy. But for anybody else, I see little appeal. None of the system implemented are fleshed out enough to justify a purchase AND there are tons of alternatives that do them better anyways.\n\nWhy bother with Blood Knights? I have no idea. Save your money or spend it on Vampire: Bloodlines or the Legacy of Kain-series instead.","May 4, 2014","false","4.4"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

Enjoying  Blood Knights requires a fondness for "So Bad It's Good" games. Those looking for a quality RPG should keep looking, but for people who like to laugh at - and with - their games, Blood Knights is silly, dumb fun.\n\nBlood Knights' story is basic: two characters, one a balloon-boobed lady vampire and the other a former knight turned into a vampire, are on a mission to destroy or save a relic that will bring on a vampire holocaust or something like that. You won't pay much attention to the plot, although the bad script and worse voice-acting provide ample laughs.\n\nAction is the primary focus of Blood Knights, either in single-player or local two player co-op (there's no online or LAN play). Kill monsters to gain experience and upgrade skills, loot treasure chests for better weapons and armor, and search for hidden items. Standard stuff. The combat in Blood Knights is simple, intuitive, and fast-paced, albeit very easy once you level up a few times; you won't die very much over the course of the five or six hours it takes to complete the game.\n\nBlood Knights is silly, cheap, and charming. It's not a very good game, but it's hard to resist. Buy it during a sale and have a friend over for a laugh or two.","May 3, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story is trite and filled with wooden characters and campy dialogue. The enemy AI is as basic as it gets, so most enemies can be shot to death from a distance and most bosses (including the anticlimactic final boss) can be killed easily by kiting them or running back and forth while attacking. Game progression is linear, and peppered throughout are a small series of choices for the player to make, though they only make a difference to the story if you make particular combinations of choices. Sound is buggy, and frankly, so are many aspects of the game. It's full of gameplay ideas that probably sounded great when they were pitched, but by the time the game was done, everything just ended up as a severely underpolished and generic hack n' slash. For all of its many faults, I will say that Blood Knights provides brief glimmers of really satisfying gameplay, and I did have enough fun playing it to devote just under 5 hours to beating it. It's probably worth at least one playthrough for most people, but with all that went wrong, I'd have problems recommending it at its ridiculous price of $14.99.","March 19, 2015","false","5.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Customer feedback is an indication that not all gamepads are equally supported (a Xbox 360 pad is recommended -- I don't own one).\n\nAdditionally, there hasn't been a single patch since release (as far as I know).\n\nHaving said all that, I am having fun. Not a lot, but the enjoyment is there. If only for the general cheesiness of the storytelling.\n\nI have completed two single-player playthroughs, each time focusing on a different character (one is melee, the other ranged).  The melee character has proven to be a lot more satisfying (and challenging) to play as.  Note, you still need the ranged character for certain challenges.\n\nI reckon the devs (Deck13) really need to start paying attention to this PC version (it's also on consoles). They're soiling their reputation in the process of ignoring the issues.\n\nSCORES\n\nGraphics:  61 %\n\nHints of greatness;  with other games we've seen these guys can do great art;  sadly lacking here.\n\nSound:  64 %\n\nCheesy voice acting;  some really nice atmospheric music though.\n\nExecution:  50 %\n\nConstantly moving, horrible camera that often causes you to lose your bearings;  also leads to many instant deaths as camera fails to reveal gaps and falls (game has some ill-considered platforming segments).  There are hints of a much larger background story that is never explored, sadly the developers have failed in their attempts to bring that story across in any way that is involving or interesting.\n\nAddictiveness:  68 %\n\nI've completed the game twice.  That's saying something for a product that clearly has its problems.\n\nOverall:  60 %\n\nShort but reasonably fun.  I havn't played co-op yet (remember:  game only has off-line co-op) but I can imagine it begin fun, provided the horrible camera doesn't follow one character, which could cause a puke inducing sensation for player two, who would be unprepared for the constantly shifting viewpoint.\n\nTo close off, the developers, Deck13, are so much better this.  They made the great Venetica, for crying out loud.  How and why they fell this low would undoubtedly make for an interesting post-mortem.","April 9, 2014","false","10.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Within an hour of playing, I could only describe everything about the game as abysmal. The game plays alot like God of War, except badly, and on a PC instead of a console. And it's not like God of War was a great game to begin with. You play as a human who was bonded to a vampire, and you can switch between the two. One character you have is a melee character, and one is ranged. The ranged character is insanely powerful, and the melee character dies in just a few hits. If you like autoaiming crossbows that only shoot where the game wants you to, then this game is for you. The game was really easy, but then you get to level two and find yourself chasing vampires and demons through a beachside scene. Well apparently, vampires in this universe are worse than the aliens in Signs. If you touch ANY water, you immediatly explode into a game over. What's even better is half the time you can't even tell the difference between water and regular ground, so you just end up running around and dying alot. If you also like a fixed camera angle that rotates around as you try to navigate difficult gaps you need to leap over (with water at the bottom) this games for you. I think the best part of the game was when during a cutscene, a NPC pathed through some fire in the beginning and died during the scene, but still kept talking to me. That's when i fully realized exactly what i wasted my money on.","June 22, 2014","false","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Due to this fact, jumping from one spot to another was a crap shoot.  I found if you use the mouse pointer as your target destination it lessened the chances that you'll fall off a cliff, but I found I died more often being unable to judge jumping distances/platforms than I did from the enemies.\n- horrible aiming especially if you play as the female character.  I had a general rule that the mouse pointer was the crosshairs, but that wasn't 100% all the time, and the special crossbow shot would more often than not wind up missing its mark.\n- while not critical, the voice acting was deplorable, especially the banter between jeremy and alyssa (I can overlook this point though, as it doesn't impact the game too much).\n\nI found buying anything at the trader a waste of gold coins, if you grind it out long enough you'll find good weapons.\n\nI don't know if this is a good or bad point, but the game is relatively short.","July 7, 2014","false","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My opinion is neither better nor worse than any other (IMO).\n\nUnfortunately this isn't the end of the review.\n\nBlood Knights follows the misadventures of Jeremy. He was a vampyre hunter but now he's Alysa's little ♥♥♥♥♥. This might be Jeremy's story, but Alysa seems to be the one with all of the advantages. The most obvious is that she has a sweet pair of.... auto-crossbows. If you don't mind the sound of "thwip thwip thwip" for nearly 4 hours straight, Alysa is your go-to gal for massacring all of those pathetic humans, stupid were-wolves, butt-ugly undead, and wimpy demons. Jeremy is more of a diplomat. He does most of the talking while Alysa looks at him with this constant "Is this geek for real?" face.\n\nThe plot (I nearly forgot!) involves finding and protecting something called a blood seal. It's like a bandage that protects the world from devastation. Somebody or something wants to cause the deluge, which could kill millions of humans. Somehow Vampyre veteran Alysa and vampire-newbie Jeremy have to work out their differences and straighten this mess out. While there is a village for purchasing supplies and a map-screen, this is a very linear game. You can't revisit previous areas to find stuff you missed or grind out some extra experience levels. Jumping all over the map would probably take focus away from the story. That was the part where you chuckle to yourself.\n\nAnyway, each level involves lots of killing, platforming, switches, and traps. Attribute-boosting blood coins can also be found if you're willing to poke your nose in various places. Otherwise, expect the majority of your acquisitions to be equipment upgrades. Level-ups award skill-points, which can be used to unlock skills (fascinating!). Early on you might have a little trouble, because enemies do heavy amounts of damage. This game suffers from reverse difficulty. As you progress, the game gets easier and easier. After awhile, the enemies just seem really in-effective. Most of your deaths are going to come from the janky platforming sections, and a handful of traps.\n\nThe bosses of Blood Knights are the biggest losers on the planet. At one point you fight a succubus. Wait...Actually you impale a Succubus a hundred times while she floats in the air and does NOTHING. Before that, there's a fight with some big dude who was probably Jeremy's buddy. His attack pattern is spinning around with his axe, and doing some leaping move. In the very next stage there are enemies that have that exact same move-set! The final boss is also a bum. He runs like he's skipping through a garden of posies. He's referred to as "Rome's Greatest Warrior", which is just the biggest insult to Rome imaginable.\n\nOn its own, this game isn't good. It's still enjoyable though, thanks to how unpolished it is. The voice-acting is hilariously bad, the cut-scenes are silly, and there's this wonderful aura of ineptitude throughout the game. One of my favorite moments is\n\nSPOILERS\n\nwhen you defeat the Succubus. She's talking about where the bad guys took the Blood Seal, but then makes one last attempt at seducing Jeremy. For her trouble, she gets a bolt in the chest. Jeremy gets angry at Alysa for a hot second and then says "It's just... she might have known all their plans. Now we'll never know."  Alysa responds with "At least we know the last thing that went through her head."\n\nThat joke might have worked IF SHE WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD!\n\nBut, I think that's what makes it funny. If Alysa shot the succubus in the head and then made the joke, I'd probably just say something like "Seriously?" or "Oh...oh that was a joke...oh God." or *GROAN*. This screw-up completely justifies the scene.\n\nBlood Knights is not a game I can recommend on normal terms. I'd compare it to a B-movie, but it's about twice as long, and requires you to hold a controller and press buttons. It's certainly not a good game, due to the complete lack of challenge and compelling game-design. This is something you can play high, or drunk, or on some experimental drugs not even fit for sponge consumption. Maybe that's appealing to somebody out there? I don't know.\n\nAll I know is that I actually don't regret the time I spent with this game. That's saying a lot, considering how short and precious a life is. I won't give it a thumbs up though","November 19, 2014","false","3.9"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","11","24","3","0"

I just... couldn't. So let's just starting batting off against some of the major issues I found, shall we?\n\nThe voice acting ... I guess "acting" is a word that can be layered ... like a cake ... or an onion, or whatever. It's dreadful. It's beyond help, as one could say. It's the kind of voice acting where you feel like you're playing a cheap comedy bit of a real game where someone has put bad voice acting on top of the game just to get a giggle out of you. And it just gets to the point where you wish for everyone to shut up because it's destroying gameplay.\n\nThe game looks dreadful. It looks like it was was a graphically horrid game on the consoles and then someone falsely remembered that you're suppose to downscale the graphics when porting it to a PC, instead of upscaling it. The camera also throws you around like a ragdoll at a birthday party for five year olds with severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). And don't get me started on the storyline.\n\nThis PC port also states that you can play with keyboard and mouse, but you get the strange sensation that whoever was in charge of porting the controls over to PC has never seen a keyboard and mouse before. Okay, so I switch over to the controller... and notice that there are actually functions that they have skipped when porting the controls... you know; there are two analogs sticks on a controller but none on a keyboard-mouse-setup. But then you try to hit anything with the half-naked-girl-vampire (come on, guys, grow up) who's double wielding crossbows (that apparently can reload automatically and notice that you'll be hit those poor walls more often than the enemy.\n\nEh... I don't know if this game was playable on console, but on PC it's really a "no go", and even on console... I mean; you can't really disregard the voice acting and story even if you get over the graphics and camera.","September 29, 2014","false","2.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I just... couldn't. So let's just starting batting off against some of the major issues I found, shall we?\n\nThe voice acting ... I guess "acting" is a word that can be layered ... like a cake ... or an onion, or whatever. It's dreadful. It's beyond help, as one could say. It's the kind of voice acting where you feel like you're playing a cheap comedy bit of a real game where someone has put bad voice acting on top of the game just to get a giggle out of you. And it just gets to the point where you wish for everyone to shut up because it's destroying gameplay.\n\nThe game looks dreadful. It looks like it was was a graphically horrid game on the consoles and then someone falsely remembered that you're suppose to downscale the graphics when porting it to a PC, instead of upscaling it. The camera also throws you around like a ragdoll at a birthday party for five year olds with severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). And don't get me started on the storyline.\n\nThis PC port also states that you can play with keyboard and mouse, but you get the strange sensation that whoever was in charge of porting the controls over to PC has never seen a keyboard and mouse before. Okay, so I switch over to the controller... and notice that there are actually functions that they have skipped when porting the controls... you know; there are two analogs sticks on a controller but none on a keyboard-mouse-setup. But then you try to hit anything with the half-naked-girl-vampire (come on, guys, grow up) who's double wielding crossbows (that apparently can reload automatically and notice that you'll be hit those poor walls more often than the enemy.\n\nEh... I don't know if this game was playable on console, but on PC it's really a "no go", and even on console... I mean; you can't really disregard the voice acting and story even if you get over the graphics and camera.","September 29, 2014","false","2.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Maybe next time Deck 13 will do better. Their Venetica was way more fun then this Blood Knights. I can compare BK with Dungeon Siege 3. It looks way more sloppy then DS3, gameplay is sort of in there, but does not feel like fun (just like in Dungeon Siege 3). Plus this game needs controller just like steam page says.\n\nLong story short: if you are looking for something new or something that will replace your favorite game in same genre - don't buy it. If you are just bored and want to see Blood Knights in action-go ahead. But I would recommend buying something else instead.\n\nYet once again you can't expect much from 3D game that costs just 15 usd. But if you have only 15 usd on a game, I would reccomend you buying CoJ:Gunslinger. Sure it is different genre, but damn CoJ:G is worth way more then 15 usd.","February 7, 2014","false","0.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The female protagonist gives a voice over with as much passion as the recorded voice that plays after the dial tone ends. Much of the other characters have similar uninspired voice overs.\n\nIt does have decent combat, it is a button masher with a few power attacks that have cooldowns. The gear progression is nothing special, most of the purchases you could make from stores should be avoided because you will be finding the full sets in the treasure chests scattered through the next area. The rpg elements seem unnecessary as most of the important power ups are automatically awarded and the skill point distibution makes minimal difference on gameplay; the fake enemy difficulty is neutralized by adding a point to make your attacks deal more damage. This leaves a rather flat experience that could have been achieved by keeping the starting gear and starting enemy hit points and damage.\n\nI can only recommend this if you can get it on sale for 80% off or so, and have someone to play the game with you. Was not terrible, was not great, just average and a little unpolished. If there was a neutral button, I would have clicked it instead.","January 5, 2015","true","6.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

This is my review of action RPG Blood Knights. It's a rather mediocre experience overall, the addition of platforming mechanics make it even worse and I have to wonder why they would add platforming mechanics into an isometric action RPG because it doesn't work. Jumping is innaccurate, character models look like bricks and Alysa (the vampire) looks like she has rigor mortis in her arms because they're constantly extended which looks incredibly weird and painful. If you're looking for a new action RPG I'd recommend looking elsewhere as there isn't a whole lot of fun to be had here.

The story itself isn't written very well and the script and voice acting was uninteresting.  Monsters get bugged on the ledge if you're on a differen't level so you can hit them for free making this game very easy.  The female protagonist is much much more OP than the male protagonist and this unbalance of power makes the game less interesting.  I like the different maps or atmosphere as you go to different levels and the "secrets" are easy to find (sometimes items just become much less visible with the camera angle).\n\nI will say I got this game for free from someone who bought it from a bundle so very little money was spent on this game and it was worth that little amount.  There is some replay value for people who are interested in different achievements.  I wouldn't buy this game unless it is 80-90% discount.  However, I might have been spoiled by bundle sites that allow me to buy games at low prices that I've played a lot of bad and boring games and this is better than those average games as such I took the time to complete it. 6.5/10","January 10, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall not bad.\n\nCONS:\n-Controls can't be remapped.\n-Default control mapping is TERRIBLE (WASD to move, F to dodge; very unnatural key especially when trying to move in the D direction)\n-Camera can't be controlled. (Combine this with the poor default controls and instant death platforming...)\n-Animations are clunky and awkward.\n\nI skipped all the cutscenes (as I almost always do in games like this) and this was a breeze which is important as forced cutscenes (esp in areas where they are repeated due to deaths) is an incredibly infuriating experience, but thankfully here it is not.\n\nHowever, the poorly mapped controls combined with an inability to remap keys is a major deal breaker. There are several platforming elements that result in an instant death and send you back to the last save point, which means you usually have to fight a number of mobs just to get a chance to make the jump again....and if you fall....fight those mobs again...tedious and frustrating since the only reason you will fall is due to the bad controls (the platforming elements themselves are VERY simple and straightforward).\n\nWith some polish this game can be quite fun, but it needs to fix the controls first and foremost.","January 23, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The melee combat, atleast. As for the crossbow combat, well its someone lack-luster. Its shooting crossbows with the ability to toss a fire arrow out here and there. The Vampire spells also aren't anything to write home about but i enjoy them none the less.\n\nThe enemies aren't the smartest but they can swarm on you and at some points gain a little more difficulty. The bosses are different but they aren't anything game changing.\n\nThe story is fun. Its the battle till the end of time between humans and vampires. A beloved general is turned, becomes a mix of both, and has to prove that you can fight for the good in both sides.\n\nBIGGEST GRIPE is the platforming elements.

It's more of an arcade game with some tactical elements like buttons to open door, moving floors, platform with fixed camera angles.\n\nOverall I like it even if the game has it's small flaws. Beyond the small flaws , it's a small gem of an arcade game.","April 11, 2014","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall not bad.\n\nCONS:\n-Controls can't be remapped.\n-Default control mapping is TERRIBLE (WASD to move, F to dodge; very unnatural key especially when trying to move in the D direction)\n-Camera can't be controlled. (Combine this with the poor default controls and instant death platforming...)\n-Animations are clunky and awkward.\n\nI skipped all the cutscenes (as I almost always do in games like this) and this was a breeze which is important as forced cutscenes (esp in areas where they are repeated due to deaths) is an incredibly infuriating experience, but thankfully here it is not.\n\nHowever, the poorly mapped controls combined with an inability to remap keys is a major deal breaker. There are several platforming elements that result in an instant death and send you back to the last save point, which means you usually have to fight a number of mobs just to get a chance to make the jump again....and if you fall....fight those mobs again...tedious and frustrating since the only reason you will fall is due to the bad controls (the platforming elements themselves are VERY simple and straightforward).\n\nWith some polish this game can be quite fun, but it needs to fix the controls first and foremost.","January 23, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've ever enjoyed truly silly, cheesy 80s films with disjointed dialogue and cliche characters for their campy, goofy style and are in the mood for adventuring in that sort of camp Blood Knights fits the bill. It would have been better titled Vampire Plan from the Sealed Crypt: Fangs for Blowing up the Moon!\n\nSimply put, the game is of average quality in most things. The art and audio aren't bad, the music is generic, the story is pure cliche camp. Nothing about it is really exceptional in either direction, except the voice acting is gloriously silly and the two lead VAs seem on the verge of laughter. But I did have fun with it, because I went in with low expectations and honestly the game worked fine.\n\nSo if you're in the mood for a great game with a stunning story about the human conditions and the depths of the mind - get something else! If you're in the mood for something silly to play, possibly with a buddy since it has coop, and laugh at how ridiculous it is, then this title will suit you just fine.","April 7, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes only 5 hours to beat the game and it doesn't really have enough time to bore you with all the flaws mentioned above. At some point you take it as a parody to modern RPGs. The acting is hilarious, but it makes it more real. Not sure if devs expected this to be serious at all or I just made it up in my mind, but this "parodyness" feel is what I liked about this game.

The story itself isn't written very well and the script and voice acting was uninteresting.  Monsters get bugged on the ledge if you're on a differen't level so you can hit them for free making this game very easy.  The female protagonist is much much more OP than the male protagonist and this unbalance of power makes the game less interesting.  I like the different maps or atmosphere as you go to different levels and the "secrets" are easy to find (sometimes items just become much less visible with the camera angle).\n\nI will say I got this game for free from someone who bought it from a bundle so very little money was spent on this game and it was worth that little amount.  There is some replay value for people who are interested in different achievements.  I wouldn't buy this game unless it is 80-90% discount.  However, I might have been spoiled by bundle sites that allow me to buy games at low prices that I've played a lot of bad and boring games and this is better than those average games as such I took the time to complete it. 6.5/10","January 10, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Feel powerful,  look cool, wreck ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe games as shallow as the above paragraph, and the combat is as dynamic to match.\nThe story, characters and acting are all quite naff, but the combat is more than entertaining enough to carry it, for its short 5 hour duration. Interesting premise and setting incidentally.\n\nTechnical wise, it's a bit juddery occasionaly in cut scenes, but gameplay'is super smooth, and it looks good. Has fantastic controller support- probaly essential as I see other PC players complaining about the controls, no complaints here using a pad.\n\nIf you can pick this up for  $5 or a bundle, I heartily recommend it.","March 15","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And not just because I'm obsessed with vampires.\n\nThe camera control -- or, more accurately, lack thereof -- is a little strange, and sometimes it'll hide important things from you -- like one lethal pit toward the end -- but it works rather well, once you get used to it. The voice acting is good at times, not so much at others, but certainly charming and really (intentionally) funny in some parts. Looks good and has pretty excellent gameplay.\n\n8/10, will play again.","May 29, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Incredibly BAD I mean ! There aren't many games with vampire so when I saw this one I pre-oredered it like an idiot and paid full price. I tried to play it but got stuck on an overpowered boss ( in normal, not even in hard ). The characters just die way too quickly and the controls suck so much there is nothing you can do about that.\n\nAlso the game displays 60fps but stutters like crazy it's unplayable, no matter the settings ( well, there aren't any settings anyway except resolution and some slider for graphics quality that does nothing ). Tried to deactivate Vsync, it doesn't work, tried launching in compatibility mode without Windows fancy visuals, still stutters.\n\nI tried starting a new game, the tutorial bugged out after 2 minutes, when you take control of the girl and needs to kill two guys with yout crossbow : one of the enemy didn't show up, no way to continue...\n\nOn top of that the voice acting is laughable, the graphics are worst than a 2010 game, and it's just not fun to play, at all.\n\nI like to play "bad" games, you can learn a lot from other's mistakes, gameplay wise, but at least the games I generally play WORK. This one doesn't.\n\nAvoid at all costs.","April 16","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
