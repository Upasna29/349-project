All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I pick the good ones.\n═══════════════════════════════════\nOVERVIEW\nFirst of all, this is not a rythem based platformer, even though it tells you that in-game, I saw nothing of the sort.\nSecondly, this is a vary hard, fast-paced, score-based jumping platformer.\nbased on these, expect to die a lot, replay stages to improve your score, and be very happy to finish a level and go to buy new upgrades.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/408750/\n\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\nPros:\nsimple controls, left and right and thats it\ngreat soundtrack\ncolorful, electro theme\nhow the ball controls\nchallenging\naddictive\n\nCons:\nupgrades feel worthless\nthe lives system only serves to bother and annoy than to punish or encourage not dying\ntoo many leaps of faith that sometimes lead to uncalled for deaths\nsome bugs\nbackgrounds remain the same throughout, it leaves you wanting for a change\nthe upgrade screen is a stage of itself that requires you to do  bit of platforming to reach the upgrades you want\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\n6.5/10\n\nthis is a hard jumping platformer with an addicting nature.  its small, its light, its cheap, and it keeps you on the edge.\nif you love simple/casual platformers with a challenge, then this is value for your money.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curtations here!","November 5, 2015","true","2.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","3"

(I shall explain more)\n\nAbout the game's music, as you can see from Tacomancer's review i did say it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dubstep, so i will say it again, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dubstep than you can only enjoy drunk.","January 11","true","0.9"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","1"
