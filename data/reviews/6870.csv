This game was a pleasant surprise.   Although the genre is described\nas action, the requirements for success are sufficient to classify Battlestations Midway as action/strategy.   The ability to control\nvirtually every ship and aircraft in each scenario provides a variety of means to achieve the objectives.   At the same time you\ncan control all of the action and strategy with the use of the tactical map.  You have plenty of options.  In addition to the\ncampaign, that  begins with Pearl Harbor and concludes with the last two scenarios at Midway, the ship challenge, plane\nchallenge, and the submarine challenge will certainly test your skills as they are fairly difficult.  I highly recommend this game.","February 1, 2014","true","455.6"," 71 of 74 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","71","74","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KikotheExile/recommended/6870/","KikotheExile","kiko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KikotheExile/","42 products in account","This review is not really much of a review. I aim this at trying to be more helpful to people who already bought the game and were disappointed.\n\nReview part:\nPlay this game if you love older flight sims, naval sims, strategy and micromanagement.\n\nDo not play this game if you expect an easy flight sim, easy RTS, easy naval sim, or easy sub sim. Nothing about this game is easy, it tries to do many things at once and does them all well. The challenge is in managing every little thing.\n\nMe trying to be helpful part:\n\nTips and Tricks:\n1: You have finite resources, manage them well. Use fighters as bombers by equipping them with bombs, use bombers as fighters by enabling CAP (Combat air patrol), and don't send your ships into the slaughter single file.\n2: Damage control isn't a myth. There is actually a damage control screen. Pay attention to your ships issues and fix them accordingly in battle.\n3: This game also has a RTS component. Use your map to issue orders. Your map is your friend, and your AI will hit more often than they miss (Excluding with free fire torpedos which are more likely to sink friendlies.)\n4: You have to lead your targets and have a basic grasp of physics and timing. Physics is real in this game. Your speed, the speed of your target, and your overall range is not calculated for you excluding aircraft. Sometimes you have to shoot at open water now to hit your target 5 seconds later.\n4.5: This can often be negated by aiming at the waterline on the very front of the enemy ship. This will usually make your shots hit their engine room and bring them to a full stop, or slow them down enough for your shots to hit their mag and blow them up.\n5: Friendly fire is real, you can kill your own people. Do not shoot torpedos at enemy vessels that happen to be engaging friendlys opposite of you. Crossfire hurts. Hell, you can shoot down friendly aircraft with unlucky artillery blasts, you can dive bomb the plane you are flying by running into your bomb as it falls, I once had my own B-17 crew take out an entire group of my own torpedo bombers.\n6: Use binoculars for everything you can, all the time, always. Just use them. They help. Seriously, use them. The things you see through called binoculars. These things you can see through, they can zoom, use them. Do it. If you don't, you have no reason to complain about missing your shots.\n\n\nUpon reading the reviews, I realized that so many people dislike the game for BS reasons.\n\n"The controls are awkward!"\nThat's easy to fix by hitting esc and changing your controls.\n\n"The battles feel uneven in single player!"\nThey are, as they are meant to be. Do you really want a game where you *Always* have an unfair advantage?\n\n"The graphics suck"\nKeep in mind the scale of the game and its age, not to mention the price you are getting it at.\n\n"I can't tell when my guns are reloading!"\nYes, you can. If the little green dots aren't green, either that gun is reloading, damaged, or they don't have line of sight. Yes, line of sight is a real thing, it's a real issue. Guns on the back of your ship can't shoot targets in front of you. Get sideways.\n\n"I can't fly!"\nThe flight controls aren't arcade. Try to use your rudder rather than constantly banking.\n\n"I can't shoot down enemy aircraft!"\nIn air to air combat: Try to attack from above. Theres a little circle to shoot at, shoot at that, not the aircraft itself.\nOn surface craft: There are range limitations, be sure to target them, be sure to only shoot at them when they are entering range.\n\nThat being said, the negative reviews have some good points. The story is short, the gameplay is dated, the engine is old, mulitplayer no longer has a legit existance and so on. Still, it's $7 unbundled when not on sale, and an amazing game for its price and age.","July 27, 2015","true","9.1"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

First things first, the tutorial missions may just be the most boring thing I have ever had to do in a video game. They take for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ever, but I will admit they are very useful to learn about all the things you can do in this game, which is of course their purpose. They honestly just should have found a way to make an almost 45 minute tutorial fun. Once you get into the real game though, you are automatically hit with one of the most cheesy, awful video game campaign stories ever with laughably bad dialogue and characters that look like plastic dolls and act like them too. Henry Walker and Donald's bromance makes the bromance from Pearl Harbor not look like the worst thing to come out of movies in the early 2000s. Everything else about the story is forgettable, but it does stay true to what happened in World War II's early pacific campaign which I guess gives it a few points. Graphics-wise, as mentioned earlier, it looks pretty terrible but the game is from 2007, basically 2006, so you gotta let it slide. Plus graphics don't make a game anyway.\n\nSo I just trashed everything not important about this game, but I had to get it out. The gameplay is actually extremely fun, and even would I dare say replayable. It's a shame the campaign is so short, but this replayability definitely helps that fact. Some missions are just so much fun to play that its nice to go back every once and awhile to play again. However, if you are not playing on the highest difficulty (and normal on some missions), the game is laughably easy. I kind of like playing on easy though because it lets you focus on destroying every single unit the Japanese have in store without dying. The plane gameplay is extremely fun and very much like arcade mode on War Thunder, just with a lot less realism. This is definitely not some flight simulator, because I don't think the things I pull off sometimes in those planes are actually possible. Submarines are also a blast to play as for obvious reasons, they just don't show up in the campaign enough is the sad thing. Captaining boats is not the most fun thing in the world, but it could be worse. It is usually in boats, mainly aircraft carriers, where you use a lot of the tactical stuff this game has to offer. These real time strategy parts of the game are what keep it from being another average war game, and they are very well done and easy to use. Just get ready for a whole bunch of multi-tasking if you are playing on higher difficulties. There are also special missions for each class (sub, plane, ship) that are unrelated to the story though, and they are usually fun but much more difficult than the main campaign.\n\nAll in all, even though this review starts with a bunch of negative stuff, everything I blasted is basically irrelevant to the game. If you are looking for a game that is a lot of fun through and through, this is one to definitely consider. I recommend this mainly for all into war games, World War II's pacific campaign (the game isn't a history channel documentary but it'll do), tactical games, and games like War Thunder, but basically anyone can probably pick this up and enjoy it. 7/10 from me. I am looking forward to trying out its sequel for the first time, Battlestations: Pacific.","January 14","true","6.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Despite not doing the "Naval Academy" missions as I didn't know that was the tutorial missions in the game, I picked up on the controls and the way to play the game easy enough; though I do wish I had done the Tutorial as there's a ship repair screen I still don't really understand.  The game actually has a lot to do in it and is pretty well done!\n\nYou can take command of individual pieces in the war (a specific plane, ship, etc) or more manage the war from the map and just tell the pieces where to go.  It's fabulous what you can do.\n\nThe GOOD:+ Great missions with a good variety of goals\n\n+ You can take control of many individual pieces:  planes (in air-to-air, air-to-ground, and air-to-ship combat), and ships (using AA guns, torpedos, depth charges, and artillery)\n\n+ You can manage the entire fleet from the map and let the computer control the individual pieces\n\n+ The game offers 3 skill levels for the missions and the "Regular" offered a good challenge.  I had to redo several missions a number of times.\n\n+ It's a good length of a game.  My campaign lasted 10 hours (and that's not counting the various training missions, or the other 11 challenge missions)\n\n+ The graphics.  Even factoring in the release date of the game, I think the game (gameplay) looks pretty good; better than I was expecting given its age.  The videos, granted, are terrible on a variety of levels.\n\n+ Has multiplayer, but hadn't tried it at all, but it's nice they put MP in the game.\n\nThe "OK":~ Story.  The settings and missions themselves were great, but the videos between the missions where they tell the story of your character; that was borderline at best.\n\n~ Some missions are a little long, and being new at the game and a good challenge, if you loose, that was almost an hour you have to redo.  (Ahem, a couple more times in my case cuz I didn't want to go down to Easy!)\n\n~ I had to change the controls from the defaults on a few different pieces (eg: planes controls seem to be inverted for mouse anyway); but the game does allow you to change them to whatever.\n\n~ Planes don't seem all that manouverable when flying manually.  It was a challenge for me just to fly the plane and even SEE the enemy at times.  :-D\n\n~ Some control screens just aren't intuitive such as the ship repair screen.  Granted there's a tutorial, but it's a single screen; you'd think I could figure it out, but ... I'm not really sure what effect my changes are having.\n\n~ The UI isn't the most intuitive either.  Again, it may have been covered in the tutorial, but the red/green circles by the targeting crosshairs; that took a bit to figure out.  (Number of circles = how many turrets/torpedos you have.  Red Circle = a particular turret/torpedo can't fire in the direction aiming, Green Circle means the turret/torpedo is ready to fire.  Red Flashing Circle means that turret/torpedo is reloading.)\n\nThe BAD:- The videos.  You really have to get past your plastic looking people in the animations and just enjoy the missions themselves.  Thankfully the videos and the gameplay are completely and totally different.\n\n\nI'm so glad I stuck with it to try the rest of the missions and look past the videos / story.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 22\nBattlestations: Midway\nPurchase Date: 7/23/2014\n\nI picked this up as part of the Humble Square Enix Bundle.  I admit normally I don't play World War II games, although I've always had a soft spot for the original Battlefield 1942, so I was curious to see if this game would be similar.\n\nFor my hour review, I played the US Campaign.  The game offered a multiplayer option based on Gamespy, but that is now defunct, and I don't know if there is a workaround for this or not.  If you are looking specifically for multiplayer, you likely will want to look at a newer game, or do some research to see if there are any workarounds for Gamespy.\n\nThe first campaign mission takes place at Pearl Harbor as the Japanese are first attacking.  Bookending each of the mission segments are video cutscenes, which bounce back and forth between the style of a historical documentary, and from the perspective of an individual soldier.\n\nMissions are broken up into segments, and in the starting segment I found myself driving a boat while also shooting at Japanese planes which are bombing the harbor.  It was a little tricky at times trying to aim the guns at planes in the sky while also trying to pilot the boat.  Often I would be at an angle where I couldn't actually see where the boat was going, and found myself ramming other ships at times.\n\nThe first mission does a pretty good job of also doubling as a tutorial.  Each segment changes the vehicle being piloted and/or the vehicles the Japanese are in.  I piloted a boat for one segment, and was flying a plane of my own in another.  I shot at planes mostly, but there were also times I fought other boats or a submarine.\n\nI originally started playing with mouse and keyboard, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the controls, so I ended up switching to my XBox 360 controller, which the game also supports.  The game does also let you tweak the control scheme, which I was grateful for particularly in the flying segment where I could reverse the axis for making the plane climb and dive.\n\nOne minor complaint I had is the game will occasionally give you visual cues on what to do (such as switching weapons to a depth charge to target a submarine).  The cue is supposed to include which key to press, but with the XBox controller it would occasionally display a blank space in place of the actual button, leaving me to have to use trial and error to figure it out.\n\nOverall the game is pretty straightforward.  The controls are not very complicated, and the mission objectives themselves were not that involved, at least to start with.  I definitely get the impression that things will get more involved as the game progresses, but in my first hour of play the game kept things pretty simple.\n\nMy least favorite part of the game was the airplane combat.  Even with the XBox controller I struggled with the controls.  I had to restart this mission segment quite a number of times as I kept crashing.\n\nOverall I think the game is decent by today's standards, and even better judged by the time it came out.  Given the budget pricing, I think makes for a good value.","July 19, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It does this with more scope than BF1942's gameplay, and is more arcade balanced than a serious simulator. That's not to say it's devoid of tactics/management, and a need for well timed accuracy and judgement. It's a game far from perfect in it's execution, having a limited amount of freedom by limiting itself to set campaign missions and a few challenges. It lacks singleplayer skirmishes, which multiplayer makes up for as being the most engaging multiplayer I've experienced in a game(if you can find anyone online). Overall it's a game simple in design and full of charm. I come back to it for that feeling of being in a torpedo bomber alongside my AI wingmen, getting as close as I can to the battleship that's about to ruin my mission, knowing I can't afford to miss, and might get shot down if I get too close. The entire battle hangs on those few seconds of judgement.","December 6, 2013","true","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There was no ability to save the game mid-mission which left me with a lingering bitterness every time I had to restart (which was quite often).

It's got solid controls for the ships, and decent controls for planes. Nothing spectacular. What really makes the game less-than-stellar for me is the main campaign. You learn about all these tactical maneuvers in the especially-long tutorial, and I was getting geared up for a lot of fun, even fights. Were they fun? Arguably. Were they even? Hardly. There are plenty of missions where I could only control so many ships that can produce so many planes, and yet the Japanese have far more ships and planes than I do, and just launch them off like they're nothing more than paper planes, which really throws me off and had me frustratingly banging my head against my laptop screen as my ship would fail because I only had fifteen planes, and the Japanese had about thirty. Of course, I died! Only a complete idiot could kill twice as many planes as their own with THESE flight mechanics!\n\nBut what about the story that connected all these assorted battles over small, generic Phillipine islands over massive bodies of water? It was alright. It wasn't Oscar-winning material. It got the job done. Although, I will say that while the graphics look a step ahead of the rest of the game in the cutscenes, the animation is very stiff and robotic. I laughed during a scene where the protagonist nearly drinks some whiskey with his commanding officer, and they both raise their glasses like two preprogrammed machines.\n\nAnd, also the game tries to show the Japanes and Americans as equals, while at the same time completely undermining their message. I find a photograph that a Japanese pilot kept of his family (incredibly convenient, I might add), while the Japanese are shown in the cutscenes to be in the shadows, and being given a menacing look. Almost like they're inhuman demons that deserve to be shot down. I mean, this isn't Full Metal Jackets! This is a video game! We have to have SOME motivation for the player to actually kill these guys, right? ...

I had a little fun with this game and I'm sure I would've had a lot more pleasure with Battlestations: Midway if the controls were tuned and actually working properly!\n\nPROS:\n+Switching from controlling planes to ships to submarines is fun (but unexplained in the game... actually found out by mistyping another keystroke!).\n+Actual combat is pretty fun (once you get the hang of it).\n\nCONS:\n-Awful and questionnable controls.\n-Visuals both in graphical quality and models are very dated and bad looking (2007 ain't that far no?)\n-Gameplay can be hard at times (difficulty spikes).\n-Learning curve is extreme (aside from the PT Boat tutorial, you're left on your own afterwards).\n-Game speed is way too slow. (takes forever to reach your target only to fail and have to start all over again 'repeatedly' is frustrating.\n-Campaign is short and rather dull.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nI would not recommend this game to anyone other than WWII purists and even then, you surely can find better alternatives out there! Best recommendation would be to get World of Warplanes and/or War Thunder instead... much better alternatives!\n\nRATING:\n5.0 / 10","January 3, 2014","false","2.7"," 12 of 35 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","12","35","0","0"

I really got to hand it to the people who made it.  I'm a big WWII nut and am fascinated by it for some reason.\n\nFor a 2007 game it looks great, all the little details from the crewmen walking around a ship your zooming in on to the little bubbles your depth charges make to just the way your ships move through the water and the smoothness of seeing planes in the distance dive bombing a target and landing on a carrier, to the way a ship you've just either torpedoed or hit with a volley of guns slowly sinks.  It has a really nice look to at and I'll admit I'm one of those graphics make a game better kinda people.  I'm an artist and I love to see computer art just to see what has been done.  This may be old but I am really impressed and I haven't even started with the gameplay.\n\nThis is a simulation and a great one at that.  Everything is just how I would ask it to be done if you asked me how I would like this type of thing be done.  You can take control of everything and it is just seamless and just works right and when your not in control you can count on the AI not to go full Ben Stiller in that one movie, which is a huge point if your gonna do this kind of set up.\n\nThis is just a neat great find of a game that I had never even heard of until I saw it while looking for something cheap to get.  I got the Midway and Pacific bundle and can't wait to see what Pacific is like as it is 2 years later, I hope it's even better looking/playing.\n\nIn other words if you want a good SIMULATION experience with just the right amount of hands on action don't even hesitate like I almost did because of the price and obscurity (to me anyway).  I capitalize simulation because before I purchased I looked up a gamespot review (I know) and though they liked the game they kinda complained about long times between action or some such.  GOOD!  I'm sorry but WWII didn't happen in a way that fit in snuggly with your COD expectations and being a simulation I want things to play out how they would naturally and if that means I lie in wait for what might be an entire level in another game so be it.  I love fast games myself but when I want strategy I don't want punches pulled for the whiners out there and they didn't.  Not to say nothing happens far from it.  This is as I stated before very exciting stuff for me as I've watched these ships and planes on film for so long that to be able to realistically control them whether directly or through commands, and see what (sorta, it is a game after all) challenges first hand goes into actually getting something done on such scale is great.  I could honestly go on and on, I haven't researched this title or companies involved and have no idea where this IP is at, but Oh Wow could I imagine what they could do with todays PC's.\n\n","December 29, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics seem pretty even today (I really like just to give orders and observe the battlefield, admiring dogfights in the skies with flaming debris dropping from the heavens), and gameplay is captivating. Just imagine: you guide an aircraft carrier, give orders for B-17s to ruin enemy airfield and for torpedo bombers to hit an enemy destroyer, jump to the Flying Fortress to direct bombs yourself, switch to the Avenger to close in and drop a torpedo, change the formation of your squadron, jump to your cruiser, and fire a salvo at the enemy patrol boat - and all this happens in 2 minute time!\n\nHowever, there are some minor setbacks. Firstly, AI of your units is stupid. Fighters and ships can put a decent fight, but bombers... I don't really remember many times when my torpedo bombers managed to hit (not to sunk, merely to hit) a target smaller than an aircraft carrier. However, behavior of your rivals is much more commendable, and they are always coming in great numbers to give you a hard time. Secondly, although the game is fairly easy, in some missions you will have to act quick, because if you don't, enemy reinforcements won't leave you a chance to complete mission. And thirdly, I have had some problems with sound in the in-game videos, so I had to tune settings a bit to bring it back.","July 24, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics seem pretty even today (I really like just to give orders and observe the battlefield, admiring dogfights in the skies with flaming debris dropping from the heavens), and gameplay is captivating. Just imagine: you guide an aircraft carrier, give orders for B-17s to ruin enemy airfield and for torpedo bombers to hit an enemy destroyer, jump to the Flying Fortress to direct bombs yourself, switch to the Avenger to close in and drop a torpedo, change the formation of your squadron, jump to your cruiser, and fire a salvo at the enemy patrol boat - and all this happens in 2 minute time!\n\nHowever, there are some minor setbacks. Firstly, AI of your units is stupid. Fighters and ships can put a decent fight, but bombers... I don't really remember many times when my torpedo bombers managed to hit (not to sunk, merely to hit) a target smaller than an aircraft carrier. However, behavior of your rivals is much more commendable, and they are always coming in great numbers to give you a hard time. Secondly, although the game is fairly easy, in some missions you will have to act quick, because if you don't, enemy reinforcements won't leave you a chance to complete mission. And thirdly, I have had some problems with sound in the in-game videos, so I had to tune settings a bit to bring it back.","July 24, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played this on the Xbox 360 when I was younger and thought it was stupid. After getting it on sale and playing it all again, I saw that younger me was wrong.\n\nThis game is a fun way to re-live a lot of the WW2 ship battles between the US and Japan. It lets you control all types of ship classes from PT boats all the way up to the huge carriers. You can swap between ships and planes (when you can control them) to be able to do more than just sit in the water.\n\nThe difficulty scales up through the campaign fairly well. It starts you out easy but by the end, the matches can go for more than 30 minutes a level.\n\nI would recommend getting this game if you are into WW2 history and naval combat.","April 27","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the graphics might be outdated, and multiplayer is dead, the game is doesn’t lose its fun and the answer to get multiplayer back, you use GameRanger to host and join some multiplayer games.  You’ll be surprise to see how many BSM lobbies there are that are open when you use GameRanger. Is it worth the time and price, of couse it’s a yes and I do recommend the game. When I played this game on Windows 8.1, I had no problem with the game, so it should work on the latest Windows operating system that’s available.","April 23","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is an easy game to learn for the most part but hard to master. The game doesn't do much handholding because it is probably made for a time when a game came with an instruction manual as part of the package, so you either need to go to the internet or just figure out the controls for yourself and pray you get used to them before you get gunned down by a Zero or broadsided by the Yamato.\n\nThe game leads to silly moments, like I am still unable to figure out how to dive bomb a ship, so I find myself often smashing into it Kamikaze style. One hilarious moment was when I got the control over a destroyer and was told to sail to the other end of a canal. While I got attacked by planes, a battery and torpedo boats I thought, geez, lets just bomb the Japanese base to smithereens, which I proceeded to do. After returning with an seriously busted ship to the end of the canal feeling smug for wrecking the Japanese base and everything in it, I got the message that I was about to be engaged by a destroyer.  The fight that ensued was totally awesome as I managed to outmanouver the enemy so it got stuck between me and the coast, forcing it to slow down and thus giving me the opportunity to give it a full load of torpedos, most of which missed, but enough hit home to sink it.\n\nFun game if you don't take it seriously.\n\n\n\n\n\n","April 14","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
