"http://steamcommunity.com/id/edgarallanwoah/recommended/356570/","edgarallanwoah","Edgarallanwoah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/edgarallanwoah/","1326 products in account","This is an interesting game. Mostly due to the fact that you play a guy who just wants some sleep (which I can relate) and he goes around murdering parties full of people to get it (I cannot relate to this).\n\nI mean there isn’t much else to say about the game. It’s like playing a horror game in which you are the killer. You must be creative using traps in the environment to kill people. Though I still question why there was a panda at that party.\n\nYou can use Stun bombs, or smoke grenades, change of clothes (which I still find interesting that you can change in front of a cop and they immediately leave you alone)\n\nA big part of the party will change if you fail, some traps might not be there, the item pickup will be different. So something you did that worked before, mig11ht not work again.\n\nYou can shove people off of roofs, throw them in fires, roll a car over a crowd. All that matters in this game is that you don’t get caught by the cops, or the ridiculous bouncers.\n\nWhich leads me to my first complaint.\nThe bouncers.\n\nI can understand the cops, and their Speedy Mc Speed Speed to catch you.\nWhat I don’t understand is that if you waltz near a bouncer you instantly get curb stomped for breathing his air. I mean it’s a party, and that is just mean. I just want to go hang out with sally over there, maybe get a little stabby, but nooooooooo. Mr. Bouncer here is going to chase me around first.\n\nAlso the difficulty ramps up and down like no ones business. Some levels have passages that allow you to shoot around them sneaky like, and others don’t. Learning which do and don’t make your game much more enjoyable. If on the levels with these you over-use them, some mario looking mother-f****er shows up and smacks it till it’s shut.\n\nBut really, that’s all I have an issue with.\n\nThere’s a story built into the game, is it on par with a big budget title, no. But for the price you can’t argue with it. And really for the price it’s a steal. It’s a solid game, entertaining enough while allowing me to Dexter all over the place (just don’t take it seriously). The music is great and gets stuck in your head. Just keep in mind that with this game what you see is what you get. This is a pixel game where you stab other pixels in the most creative and inconspicuous way that you can. It doesn’t get really any deeper than that.\n\n\nThe game never takes itself seriously, nor does it ever appear to promote any sort of actual violence. There are clowns, horses and cows dancing around.\n\nThe game seemingly has intergration with Twitch streaming, which I’ve not yet tested, but I would love to do so. (twitch.tv/8bitlanparty) /endnamedropping\n\nAt it’s core Party Hard is a romp through an 80’s inspired party scene that knows just how much it can get away with, it’s a stealth game of a new variety and it doesn’t step on anyone’s toes other than the most conservative person in the room, and even then, if they can’t laugh because a horse just kicked the player in the face and ended their murder spree, well they should probably have left the room a while ago.\n\nThe question of the hour, would I recommend this game.\nWould I recommend it to a friend?\n\nYes, for the price I’ve already gotten more than enough entertainment to make it worth it, and I foresee much more enjoyment out of it.\n\nWould I let my son play it? No, but he’s 9. Why are you asking if this would be okay for a kid?","August 29, 2015","true","5.3"," 349 of 374 people (93%) found this review helpful 216 people found this review funny","93","349","374","216","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/356570/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4510 products in account","Party Hard is a slightly randomized strategy / stealth game where you have to kill everyone in a level, without getting caught.\nThe game has a beautiful and richly detailed pixel art style and is accompanied by a thumping dance soundtrack, perfectly fitting the levels (which are all parties).\n\nRandomization means that while a level will always be the same in layout, the placement of party-ers and other elements can change. One time you may see a drug deal or robbery take place, another time you load it the same room will simply be empty or filled with a beer keg instead.\nThe various pick-ups which can spawn, or be delivered by a helper character, will also be random. This makes each playthrough unique.\n\nGetting caught by the police means restarting the entire level (with new randomization), so you don't just have to rehash the exact same level.\n\nThere is also optional integration with Twitch chat for streamers, where your viewers can trigger some of the random events. These range from relatively normal like extra party goers, to a zombie invasion or a Sharknado. Seriously.\n\nFortunately these elements can also occur at random in a singleplayer game without Twitch involvement.\n\nThe game is almost punishingly tough at times and at others laughably easy, even on the same level, thanks to the randomization, but that's part of its charm.\n\nBeating the game unlocks extra characters who have their own characteristics, for the completionists.\n\nThere's also a story tying the levels together, but that's just your cliché slasher film affair. It doesn't add much but doesn't distract either -- at least it's told in beautiful pixel art comic style.\n\nWorth picking up if it meets your price point. As I'm writing this review I'm 5 hours in, not beating the game yet, and I pid about 6.50 for my copy. At a Euro per hour, it's a good deal for me, since I enjoyed every second of it.\nEven replaying the same level six times in a row because I got impatient and got caught...","September 10, 2015","true","11.2"," 74 of 83 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","74","83","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/356570/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nParty Hard is a stealth action based title released in August of 2015 developed by Pinokl Games and published by tinyBuild. You play the character of someone who just hates the loud noises of late night partying and you go on a murdering spree across America to put a stop to it.\n\nThe game is played in an almost isometric view as you control your character. You have the choice of a few different characters to play as on some levels, the most fun I found has to be the ninja character - who doesn't love a massive ninja blade?! Each of the characters have their own special equipment, as well as being able to pick up extra equipment that is scattered around all of the levels. The aim of the game is to kill everyone at the party without being caught by the authorities, whether it is the police or security guards. The way you kill people can be as creative as you like, some of the best ways I found would be causing dance floors to explode, pushing people off boats into shark pools and nudging people into air vents to get blended into a fine puree! If any of the other part goers see you kill someone, you either have to be very quick to escape the scene before they can call the cops, or well....take them out too. Either way you have to be very quick with your actions and this can lead to some very hectic chain killing scenarios as well. The game expects this to happen as it also rewards you for pulling off long chains of combo kills.  After you kill someone, you of course need to deal with their body; so again think creative, dumping bodies in dumpsters, haystacks, sewer pipes, all become common ways of  getting rid of the evidence but there are plenty of ways to hide them if you put your mind to it.\n\nA lot of time you have to pick your moments when to strike very wisely, being patient certainly pays off here rather than going in gung-ho all of the time. If you stalk your prey and wait for them to separate from the crowd, you are going to get away with murders a lot easier than doing it in the middle of a crowded dance floor. Although, that being said, you are also rewarded with a higher score at the end of each level for completing it in as fast of a time as you can - catch 22! I personally went with the slow and steady approach.\n\nParty Hard has a very pleasing graphical art style, the pixel graphics are represented very well here, and has a very much same look to it as some games such as Hotline Miami. Even though there aren’t massive amounts of detail in any of the character models, you still feel as if they are fleshed out and all feel alive and vibrant.\n\nThe plot in Party Hard is very much a detective style story, and although it has serious undertones, it isn't a massively complex story that should be taken very seriously at all. The story itself is mainly progressed through the cut scenes in between each level, and the voice acting is at times OK at best, one of the characters voices is really whiny and actually starts to grow very thin on your annoyance levels at times. Party Hard's soundtrack is awesome though - obviously since all of the gameplay takes place at a party, you are going to have party tracks, so upbeat high temp songs on every level keep the gameplay feeling even more fast pace than it should be.\n\nThis is a pretty difficult game - it takes a good session for you to be able to get to grips with how to actually kill off almost fifty or so people every level without being caught, and it does take a decent amount of skill and practice to be able to pull it off, with maybe a pinch of luck too. Be expected to fail a few times on each level as you work out the best ways to knock people off in the most effective way possible.\n\nEach of the levels in Party Hard has an element that is procedurally generated, but the main gist of the map will remain the same throughout. All of the maps have a variety of different interact-able objects that you can use in your murderess plans and it is highly encouraged that you do so as otherwise it will be really difficult to progress. A couple of the levels have shortcuts allowing you to easily traverse from one side of the map to the other, making quick get-aways even easier to pull off - don't use them too much though since they do actually get blocked off after a few uses to stop you taking advantage of them.\n\nI have been playing Party Hard offline on a laptop for a few days now, and it has taken me almost four hours to complete the game's substantial amount of levels. I was perfectly happy with that time, and given that there is also an element of replay ability in that levels are randomly generated, and unlock-able extra characters, then you really get your money’s worth out of this game. There are about 6 or so extra characters to unlock - so you can squeeze about 15 hours or so of gameplay out of this title if you so desired.\n\nParty Hard is a technically sound game, I didn't have any issues at all whilst playing. The game is strongly recommended that you use a gamepad, simply because just works and feels better on a pad than keyboard. At the time of writing this review, I couldn't get used to using the Steam Controller with it though, so would recommend you stick with an Xbox pad for now.\n\nTo sum up, Party Hard is an excellent little title that I wasn't really expecting much from, but was pleasantly surprised. The game has a brilliant art style and amazing sound track. This is a game play element which I have not seen before so it was nice to see something original and done to a high standard. If you can ignore the voice acting sloppy voice acting in the cut scenes, then I wouldn't say there is that much wrong with this game. The regular price tag of £9,99 is priced for the amount of replay ability in this game too. Stealth genre fans will get a massive kick out of the game, and anyone wanting to play a game that is a little different to the Hotline Miami franchise, will certainly find a huge amount of enjoyment in Party Hard.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I really struggled deciding between a thumbs up or down, but decided to go up because the game does have fun moments.\n\nI really like the idea of this game and it is fun, but it falls short in execution in my opinion. The pacing is what kills this game for me. It really could have taken a lesson or two from another retro graphic murder simulator game that I'm sure inspired it, Hotline Miami, and had smaller more focused levels (At least at first) and quicker restarts. I ended up just quiting the game entirely a few times after my 4th or 5th time failing a level with only a few people left to kill. Not a big deal if the levels were under 20 people, but when they are all over 50 ( at least the 5 or 6 that I have played so far), it just ends up being a chore having to redo everything again and again. Add to that that the guy move SO slow and can only sprint for a few seconds and it just becomes a drag. That and the "Busted" event needs to go away. I get it. You got me. No need to drag me to the car for the next 15 seconds giving me time to realize how frustrated I am and therefore giving me time to decide to quit. Hotline Miami was frustrating too, but you were back in the action so fast that you never had time to realize how frustrated you were until you beat the level and by then you were thrilled that you accomplished that and moved on to the next one. Faster loading times would be nice too. Another small issue is that the story is pretty poorly written and corny in my opinion.\n\nI'd say wait and pick it up on a deeply discounted sale if you are interested or just pass as it's not worth the full asking price in it's current state.","August 27, 2015","true","1.3"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","34","46","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/recommended/356570/","alexngregory","alex.n.gregory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/","3023 products in account","Party Hard is a game that proudly wears its 80s slasher influence on its (blood-stained) sleeve.\n\nCombining the aesthetic from Hotline Miami, every John Carpenter horror film you've ever seen and the quirkiness that comes standard in games published by TinyBuild Games, Party Hard is a incredibly enjoyable retro stealth title that offers hours of replayability and fun, though with a handful of elements that could be improved.\n\nYou play as a man who is brought in for questioning by a police officer, and tells his story of being present at certain murder scenes. These cutscenes act as a framing device for the levels themselves, which task you with killing everyone however you see fit due to your hatred of loud music. Poisoned drinks, environmental hazards, errant golf carts, malfunctioning power boxes, subterfuge... it's all here, just begging to be exploited and used on the unsuspecting yuppies and partygoers that populate the parties.\n\nYou'd never know that this was developer Pinoki Games' first stealth action title, because the controls and level setups are honed incredibly well. The player character is just an everyday guy (with a knife), and has several disadvantages that players have to utilize and exploit to overcome large crowds. You can't run as fast as the police, so you always have to be thinking two steps ahead when you decide to stab someone. You can sabotage items and lead NPCs to beat up each other in confusion. You can set up explosive/environmental traps and use the scattering crowd to mask your exploits. You can even set up long chains of kills and go for high-score combo bonuses. Digital murder never felt so fun.\n\nParty Hard is very well-crafted in that respect, and encourages replayability to understand. It's a joy to run through levels and try for high scores, helped by the fact that each level is semi-randomized and doesn't always have the same traps as the last time you played it.\n\nThat being said, the game can also be punishing at times. You'll almost certainly experience situations where you get beaten up (for dancing, ironically), and have to wait for a minute while your character lies sleeping on the ground. Dealing with the cops requires the player to have an almost-clairvoyant sense of the level design and where a cop is going to run at you from, and it's all too easy to be close to a dead body when someone walks near and blames you.\n\nIt also feels like a game that was made, first and foremost, for Twitch streaming. The story is disposable filler, and the real joy comes from the randomized events that are proudly showcased by the developers (allowing the streamer to be influenced by rare events that are voted on by viewers). However, at present, these events aren't accessible at all in the single-player mode.\n\nThe game also has two additional characters that unlock after the ending, but I didn't really see the advantage in using them. It's far more fun just to use the default character and work around his weaknesses.\n\nIn the end, Party Game is one of my favorite titles so far this year. I've put in 25 hours myself, and there's something strangely compelling that keeps me coming back for more.\n\nUnn tiss unn tiss, baby.","September 9, 2015","true","112.4"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","25","32","5","0"

A party killer who has marked him forever!\n\nParty Hard is an action/stealth/ strategy game were you are playing an insomniac psychopath (at the start of the game and you will be able to play others during the course of the game) who has had enough of loud parties. Armed with a knife, you will join and disrupt 19 parties across the great U.S. of A! In each party, you will be able to use some objects and make deadly traps out of them and hopefully wipe out a large number of partygoers. Look around for suitcases, they have items that could be very useful for your killing spree: smoke grenades, which are great to conceal yourself while ravaging the party; stun grenades, which are helpful for a short time; dynamite, which needs to be placed in the right spot to be effective, but will trigger the SWAT team to come around.\n\nIf you can’t find any suitcases, look out for the guy with a black coat and hat - he always has great goodies (another insomniac, I guess)! Make sure nobody sees you doing your grim business or the police will be on your tail and escaping is not that easy! Random events can help you too, you might be lucky and a bear can jump into the middle of a party and ransack it for you! A bit like a Spanish toreador, just watch and enjoy!\n\nI really like the randomization in this game, each time you restart a party objects might not be in the same place as your last attempt, and they might not be there at all. Which gives this game a good re-playability. It is a challenging game and it will take you several efforts to ruin a party to death!\n\nNice pixel graphics with a funky audio!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/356570/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Party Hard is an amazing stealth action game that looks great, plays great and sounds great. After quite a few hours played, this is now one of my favourite games.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:Your neighbours are having a party just when you wanted to get some sleep. In order to stop them, you have to, well, kill them. All of them.\n\nPros:    Graphics | This game truly looks awesome. Just look at the screenshots! Everything is coloured just right, the shadows and lights look good, the animations are also great ... I seriously love it. Pixel-ish graphics are usually not my cup of tea, but this one is certainly a masterpiece.\nSoundtrack | Another great thing about this game. Since there is no soundtrack DLC (licensing issues, sadly), I sometimes just leave the game running to listen to music. I don't know who is the author, but he is really talented.\nStoryline | A piece of a story comes with each level. You are being interrogated about the mysterious serial killer. The story is really interesting and I like how it develops together with your progress in the game.\nCharacters | There are a few different characters. To unlock them, you need to beat certain levels or unlock achievements. The idea of the gameplay stays basically the same, however, your abilities to kill are changed and it brings in many additional hours of gameplay.\nLevel Layouts | Every level is slightly different. There are different traps, escape paths, rooms, hiding spots, guard placements and many other things. I really like how some achievements are more appropriate for some maps, while other maps are just extremely fun to repeat many times without any obligations.\nLevel Editor + Workshop | Recently, Workshop support was added to Party Hard. You can now build your own levels and share them with others. The editor is powerful and you can build your levels almost exactly how you want them to be. You can browse community levels in a very convenient level browser from inside the game.\nController Support | I don't write this often, but I have to say that I had a lot of fun playing this game with a controller and it plays with it better than most games.\nTwitch Integration | If you're a streamer and want to engage your audience, this game makes this really easy. Your viewers can select random events that occur every once in a while and make your gameplay more random and sometimes a bit more challenging. This is definitely a very good way to promote your game as well. I was just a part of a live stream recently and it was very fun influencing the game someone else was playing.\nSteam Integration | There are Trading Cards and Achievements enabled for this game. Achievements are very fun in this game, although some of them need a lot of work and, if you're into that, using scripts for launching the game very many times.\nSupported Operating Systems | This game runs on Windows, SteamOS and MacOS. I had the chance to try it on two of those systems and both builds were running flawlessly.\nCons:    FBI Agents | When you kill too many police officers, FBI Agents come to the party and start searching the area. The problem is that, somehow, they know very well where to look for which sometimes doesn't really feel very fair. But you shouldn't really make them come to the party very often, which doesn't make this a very big problem.\nLimited-use Escape Paths | Well, I don't mind that you can't use escape infinitely many times, but I would really like to have a few more uses instead of just one or two.\nNo Steam Cloud Support | Sadly, you lose your progress if you switch to a different computer. It should be a relatively easy thing to do, so I don't know why it's not implemented yet.\nThe final verdict:This is easily one of the most fun games I've played in a long long time. The music makes an awesome party ambience and the gameplay makes an awesome, uhhmm, killing ambience? Anyway, this game looks damn pretty, it has many many hours of gameplay and an awesome story.\nIf you have the money, buy it. It's definitely worth it.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.\n---\nNo drama, Just Reviews.","April 28","true","14.3"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

The main difference between these two games is the fact that Party Hard is a slower paced stealth game, but besides that they so incredibly similar. Party Hard has an amazing art style and soundtrack. Just like Hotline Miami it also has an incredible funny story. To sum it all up Party Hard is about ta serial killer who kills people who are being loud at parties because he just wants some quiet. The only thing that I could honestly dislike about the game is the voice acting sounds like it’s all done by the same person.

Instead of Hotline Miami, the game feels like a top down Hitman game, albeit the difference being that you must kill everyone while avoiding detection. It's very fun but is marred by a few issues, these being:\n\n*Glitch that can happen where random NPCs can act as bouncers (bouncers are a 1 hit kill NPC)\n*The movement speed... oh god, the movement speed. You walk at the speed of molasses on a cold winter day. The run speed is tolerable but does not last nearly long enough and takes forever to regenerate. NPCs, even when not panicked, can sometimes walk faster than you and you can't really do anything except either burn your run meter or wait til they stop. It's just painfully slow how slow you move.\n*The lack of characters. They're all essentially pallet swaps (2 literally being pallet swaps with no abilities) and it just ends up being very limited with not much replay value.\n*The voice acting is House of the Dead 2 levels of awful. I get that it's an indie game but there's a good reason why games like Hotline Miami didn't have voice overs.\n*Highly exploitable AI. The game becomes ridiculously easy when you realize that only one person can call the cops, so you can go on a mass murder spree and as long as you stop and get away from any bodies when the cop arrives, everyone forgets you did anything. It makes the core gameplay trivial button mashing instead of being methodical.\n*No replay factor at all. No real unlocks as all the characters follow the same general ruleset and there's no hard mode, level editor or anything like that.\n\nBut I do recommend this game; really, I do. It's fairly unique at what it does, has an excellent soundtrack and good use of pixel art. Playing it sly like it's intended is always fun as you try to outwit the massive ammount of NPCs clustered together. With a few bit of changes and more content, it could be as good as Hotline Miami though instead of a high octane feel, it's a more smooth, methodical game. If you can get it cheap, by all means go for it. If not, it's still a very solid game for its price.","August 28, 2015","true","11.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","18","22","3","0"

Party Hard puts you in the shoes of effectively a 90's Slasher movie, where you are the serial killer.\n\nYou travel the country going party to party, silencing the fun, and ending all heavy parties you can. In between each level is a rather interesting little narration/interview where a police detective is being interviewed about the case and what they tried to do to catch you.\n\nIt makes the rather long loading screens bearable , as this takes place during each level.\nThe soundtrack is also great, although I would have liked if more tracks were played during each level. For me it takes an average of 30 minutes per Party; and during that time difference music would be fantastic.\nAs mentioned the average level takes me around 30 minutes, this is because you have to be rather patient during your kills.\n\nYou can't just go nuts and slash madly, you have take your time; wait for someone to be isolated and then deal with them. Accidents are key though, and the more the better. Sabotage items, and have people fall for that. That way you don't have the attention drawn to you.\n\nEven with as many precautions as possible though, make sure you are Never spotted near a body. Even if it was an accident, if no one saw the accident, and they then see you they will instantly connect you to the death and call the police.\n\nIf the police is called on you though, you can escape them. First you can try and find a change of clothes, that'll make them lose you right away. The other method is to use trap doors to move between areas. Eventually the police officer will get tired and just leave.\n\nOnce this happens though; Mario shows up and proceeds the lock and block off these escape routes.\n\nOccasionally you also need to deal with Bouncers; which will beat you down until you die. Avoid them, until you get the chance to take them down which can be a challenge.\n\n\nAll in all Party Hard is a heck of a lot of fun. I've played 6 levels so far and I'm still really enjoying it.\nI would happily recommend it to anyone.\n\nPC Gameplay Footage\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5aR3Fmb4ZA","August 25, 2015","true","2.0"," 34 of 51 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","34","51","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/356570/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","IntroductionI hate parties. There, I said it. They make me feel awkward and there always seems to be a forced atmosphere. It’s not that I want to murder everyone when I’m being at a party, though, so when Party Hard came along I was intrigued by the idea to say the least. So, if you’re like me, and want to know if you’ll have a better time playing this game than being at an actual party read on!\n\nGameplayClearly the game is meant to be over-the-top, while still feeling somewhat realistic in terms of environments and kills. Yes, ‘somewhat’, because even though your goal is to kill everyone at the party you can’t go around and stab everyone just in the face and be done with it (well, you can try, but you’ll most likely end up being arrested or beaten up).\n\nThe story is being told through flashbacks of the events that (recently) occurred – these are your missions - while cutscenes tell us a bit more about the current situation. This is mostly told through a detective’s perspective (who is being questioned/asked about the killings), but to avoid possible spoilers I won’t go into it any further than this.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527066665\nThe game’s style reminded me a bit of Hotline Miami. It’s not as vibrant, though, and a lot of the people found in the levels won’t even fight back. This doesn’t make it easy, mind you. On the contrary: although it’s not a main objective the goal is to still try and create a big combo in order to score big points. You will have to rely on luck, stealth and skill in order to do this. I’ve managed to create a combo of, I think, 10-12 or so, but that was because a lot of the people were turned into zombies and standing close to one another, since, well, zombies are mindless. Again, it sounds very easy this way, but trust me when I say that I had to retry the level more than once.\n\nThe levels are pretty big in size, but they’re limited to just one screen. Despite that there is still more than enough detail in them and you also have plenty of room to move around (freely). Unfortunately, it can be hard to see where you can or can’t walk sometimes because everything is shown in 2D with pixelated graphics and because of that objects sometimes lack the fine(r) detail that normally distinguishes these parts (a bit) better.\nLevels include a cruise ship, dance club, biker party and garden party (and many others!) and the AI characters move around freely in all of these levels, doing their own things. This can frequently become annoying, though, because your character doesn’t stand out all that much and if there are a couple of people (walking) near you you might just lose track of it all.\n\nSo the goal is to kill all of the people who are currently present at the party. The people are randomly generated so if you play the same level a different time then you will have to kill a different amount of people. Same goes for the available objects in the level. Some of them are static, but some of these are also randomly generated and placed. It adds a bit of replay value but to be honest there’s not much incentive to replay a level once it’s finished, unless you want to improve your high score.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527066628\nYou will be able to kill people by stabbing them or by using the environments to make it seem like an accident. Keep in mind, however, that you must not be caught, because if you’re close to a murder scene then it’s likely you will be pointed out as the murderer. The police will then chase you until you’re caught or until they’re too tired to chase you further. You can then start killing again, just like before. If you’re lucky a different guest will be arrested and this will then also count as a ‘kill’. So sometimes it pays off (but most of the times it doesn’t, because crime doesn’t pay!).\n\nFrom time to time you will also be able to find items in the levels in the form of a suitcase and once opened these will give you either a smoke bomb, explosive bomb or different clothes (handy if you’re being chased), among a couple of other items.\n\nYou can also use a dance move to spread out groups of people (because they somehow don’t like the way you dance; well, it’s their loss) and you also have a sprint button (with limited, but rechargeable stamina bar) and a listen button that shows you all of the available interactive objects around you.\n\nAudio & VisualsThe music is just amazing; there are a lot of catchy, upbeat songs, and best of all, this music would actually fit in a game about parties. Just for the music alone I could easily recommend this game. The sounds effects are mostly basic but, as always, at least get the job done. The voice acting ranges from mediocre to good, but I *think* this might have been done on purpose, since it’s meant as an over-the-top experience.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527066688\nVisually the game also looks stunning; it uses beautiful retro graphics and a realistic color pattern/scheme. Only problem is, unfortunately, that the graphics don’t have enough detail and because of that it sometimes is hard to see where you can exactly go to. I think ‘cutout’ 2D or just regular 2D graphics would’ve helped the game in this department. It’s not a big deal, but could’ve been easily avoided with a little more care (maybe even by just changing up some of the graphics).\n\nLength/Replay ValueEach level should take you about 5-10 minutes, but it’s unlikely you’ll finish most of the levels on your first try. Since there are 12 levels I estimate it will take an average user about 5-7 hours to complete, including retries, which is more than enough in my opinion. And also considering the price, of course. We don’t want the game to overstay its welcome and thankfully it doesn’t, but this will of course differ per person in the end.\n\nConclusionIf you ever played Hotline Miami and wanted something similar then Party Hard might just be the thing you’re looking for. It uses similar, pretty, retro graphics, it has amazing audio and the gameplay is just solid. The story might be a bit ridiculous, but if you can look past that then there’s a fun and engaging game to be found here.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Retro graphics\n+ Amazing music\n+ Fun, sometimes challenging, gameplay\n+ Pulling off a perfect ‘run’ feels very satisfying\n\nMixed:\n+/- Not vital, but it’s sometimes unclear where you’re character starts off\n+/- Random objects and amounts of people give the game a bit of replay value, although not much\n+/- Environmental kills are fun, but sometimes it’s a bit too limited (read: there aren’t always enough objects in a level to keep it (very) interesting)\n\nCons:\n- At times there are too many people walking around, close to each other, and you can lose track of it all\n- Some of the levels feel a bit empty in terms of environmental interactivity, which is disappointing\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer.\nRating: 8.0 (out of 10)\n\nWant to read more of my unbiased reviews?

I say stealth action and puzzle because while the game is real time which constitutes the stealth action part, your character is no super human and with screwups can easily be killed and arrested so you have to make use of traps, tools, isolation and your situation to either not be seen making your kills or to pin blame on others (which pinning blame on others is prolly the funnest part about the game for me)\n\nThe game has 11 stages (I do not count bus party a "stage") all with their own backdrops and traps to use, many of the maps have variation to them so its not always 100% the same every time, even then however you'll likely proceed through a map very similarly each time. the music is atleast fitting for each stage you'll be doing your murder romp in.\n\nIs the game worth the price? Even with its 11 stages the game will likely not last one too long, which is its only real negative to the game. Perhaps wait for a small sale. However if they added workshop support where we can make our own parties... the price would be worth it.\n\n2/15/2016: and so workshop support is on its way, the games biggest flaw, its length is now no longer an issue, go ahead and get this game, its quite entertaining.","September 3, 2015","true","17.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","0"

The core of the game comes down to strategy in where to take out victims and where to be patient: and that part of the game does truly work. If you're expecting an action game with tons of killing sprees in short bursts: you are probably looking in the wrong place (although it CAN happen). The levels in their first few playthroughs work, but eventually they will only really be replayable for those who like score attacks and perfecting runs. It gets the subtle humor of a horror movie down with little things, and overall, it's the kind of game that some gameplay footage shows exactly what kind of game it is: and that's a good thing. Whether or not it's for you is whether you like the strategy stealth genre, and if you have patience.\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nStrategy gameplay at the core is fun if you play it like a stealth game, which is actually is in my opinion. Waiting to take out a person and hiding the body has it's own thrill to it.\nThe goofy sense of humor, not just in the story, but in the little things that the game has inside of it, put a smile on my face. Feels like a horror movie at the core.\nEnemy AI does enough to cause you problems without being overly complicated. You want “lambs” to the slaughter here, and it does enough to keep a challenge without taking that away.\nMusic and environments work.\nThe dance button. It serves a purpose, but it's so goofy fun to use.\n-:\nOver time, variety in stages will hurt the game as while there's some random generation of it, it's only a few items in the big picture.\nAction players will probably not find the game they'd be looking for here.\nSome levels can punish a mistake harshly, almost too harshly at times.\nWould like to see more interactables.","August 25, 2015","true","3.9"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","30","48","3","0"

Instead, every level feels like a slog and that's partially because the player character is always the SLOWEST, most PLODDING sprite on screen.  Your standard speed is slower than anyone else, and your "sprint" lasts only moments and just puts you on par with the most standard of NPC's.  This is probably the worst element of the game, because it means even moving across the screen is a tedious exercise, never mind trying to accomplish anything.  If someone actually decides to run, you're out of luck because without a massive head start you can't catch up or out-run anyone.  This in itself is a terrible design decision but even without that you still move like molasses in a deep freeze.\n\nWhat about the game play?  Well one would think playing the psycho trying to kill a bunch of mindless morons would make for at least a half-way entertaining game but not in this case.  The NPC's don't even have slasher-film-victim levels of personalities.  They react to dead bodies and pools of blood, but not someone throwing a live person off a building or into a bloody fan trap.  They don't notice a dwindling number of guests, they don't care if you carry unconcious ones around, and they don't seem to mind when people get run over by the cops.  The only thing they react to is your dancing (and not in a meaningful way), dead bodies, you stabbing someone and explosions.  There's a mechanic to allow other people to take the blame but it's not consistent enough to be useful.  The special NPC's all fail to be meaningful as well.  The bouncers always try to chase you down for no reason if they spot you, but that's all they do.  The cops give up the chase either ridiculously easily or not at all due to the game's mechanics (you usually get one escape grace) but you still need a ludicrous lead because your character's inability to move faster than a crawl at the best of times.  Then there's the mechanic and paramedics who you simply can't do much about because they're clearly game mechanics and not subject to any rules and thus just leech more fun out of the game.\n\nThere's just not enough traps or enough variety to make doing anything have any feeling of satisfaction.  Due to the fact that EVERYONE out-runs you it means that eliminating the stragglers is just a chore.  So there's no joy in using the traps, no entertainment in eliminations, it's just a slog and a grind because you have to treat every situation with caution because if one NPC makes it to the phone you'll have to have to gimp from the cops and hope you had enough of a lead to start with or it's back to the start of the level all over again.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that the game doesn't teach you the mechanics properly.  There are newspapers with tips -- most of which are after they would have been useful.  Worse, there's no real rating after completing the game so you have no idea if you blundered through or aced it, and the fact that you CAN blunder through easily means you can get by without learning any real mechanics.  It's entirely possible to just murder a pack of idiots because they all run for the phone you're right in front of, but it's also possible that one idiot will decide to actually be smart and run for the other phone... which means you're screwed because you can't catch up to them unless they're unconcious.  So the game punishes you when it shouldn't with your crap movement speed and yet doesn't punish you enough for screwing up so you can learn.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is the 'story', because you'd think the plot of "You're just a grumpy guy who wants to get some sleep and people keep having loud parties" would be funny, right?  Make the protagonist sympathetic despite being a murderous psychopath, right?  Nope.  It... seems to take itself straight.  There's not enough wit for it to be satire, and not enough humour to be a parody.  Everything from the voice acting to the dialogue to the unfolding story feels bad-bad instead of hilarious-bad.  I kept playing, waiting for it to get better but instead it got worse.\n\nThis game was a horrible disappointment.","December 27, 2015","false","4.4"," 66 of 117 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","66","117","4","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bernardoone/recommended/356570/","bernardoone","BernardoOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bernardoone/","4943 products in account","Disclaimer: Key was provided by the publisher.\n\nParty Hard is a game where our character, finding himself unable to sleep due to loud parties, comes to the only logical conclusion: Kill everyone at the party, and then do the same to parties all over the US.\n\n\nFor this, you have several tools at your disposal. Throughout the level there will be several traps you can use. Many of them are randomly spawned in set locations, so you might have different opportunities and ways of approaching the level each time you play.Placement of the victims in the level is also randomly set to an extent, as are some events (sometimes a robbery can take place, a drug deal, etc, etc) You will be able to poison food and drinks, tinker with electric devics, rig speakers to explode, start the engine of cars so it runs over, people, etc. You will also find tools like stun bombs, bombs, new clothes and smoke bombs on a briefcase that it's somewhere on the level, or given to you by a strange man in a trenchcoat.\n\nThe game in concept feels somewhat like a mix of Hotline Miami and Hitman, coupled with a soundtrack that wouldn't be out of place in the former. While good, the soundtrack really needs some more inclusions, since you will restart the levels several times and many of the tracks are shared between levels, so it can eventually become somewhat annoying and make you mute the music.\n\nYou are encouraged to keep it stealthy, as otherwise the witnesses will call the police and pin you as the murderer, which will run after you and most likely catch you, as sadly in this game your own movement is too slow, and the sprint ability is both way too short and takes too long to "refill", so you will need to be smart to where and from you into (if you manage to evade the police office for enough time, he will give up). You can use the shortcuts scattered through the level to have easy escape card, but you are punished for using those shortcuts while being chased by the police. A Mario-lookalike will spawn, and close whatever shortcut you used, and you will be unable to use it until the level ends, so you can't really use it as an easy way out without consequences, you need to use it smartly.You can also activate many of the level traps and lead the officer onto them. You can hide bodies so people don't call the police, and you can grab blackout-drunk people, put them somewhere hidden and kill them there and dispose of the body. As well, you will need to pick out slowly people who stumble into less populated areas(bathrooms, bedrooms), as if you try to stab people in heavily populated areas, your ♥♥♥♥ will be quickly kicked by the party-goers. Slowly picking out people, playing it smart and activating traps at the correct time is essential, and when everything fits perfectly it was a very nice flow to it.\n\nHowever, there's definitely some issues with the game. One being that your success will be somewhat limited by the randomness of the spawns. Be unlucky, and you will be looking into a level with very few traps or victims that barely ever go near it. This will make your progression awfully slow, and you will spend a awful lot of minutes waiting for people to go to places where nobody can see you. Coupled with this, the game has a combo system that encourages you to kill as many people as possible in quick succession, but this is very rarely accomplishable within the level design and your own character limitation. Your character moves awfully slow, and you will barely be able to kill a couple of people before everyone runs away or kicks your ♥♥♥. The only way to really get a good combo going is having the luck of a stun grenade or smoke bomb spawning and then you will be able to exploit it in heavily populated areas. Your success is more times tied to luck than it is to skill. You will be repeating levels many times, which will eventually make you bored of the soundtrack, which while is good, gets quickly old after quite a few repeats between levels that themselves will be restarted many times.\n\nBy completing various objectives, you will unlock new characters. A Police officer than can send another officer to arrest someone, and that can move dead bodies without suspicion( as long as he isn't seen killing them before). A girl that can kick people to knock them out before killing them( which makes a few levels way too easy, as you can just knock out anyone and drag them to a hidden place) as well as a few others I won't spoil, each one with different abilities and limitations (though some levels do not play all that well with them)\n\n\nI really like the game and the concept, and I would love to see it being improved in a sequel, with more tight level design and expanded social stealth gameplay. It's not quite a "gem" yet, but it could easily be with some improvements. Let me able to sneak into a party if I find the right attire, access to closed-off areas with a VIP pass, poison drinks just as one of the employees grabs them and distributes them between party-goers, or having other ways of attracting people to places other than the pizza item(that spawns way too rarely in this game).\n\n\n7/10\n\n+Great soundtrack\n+Feels great and has a nice flow to into when everything is in the right place\n+Satisfying stealth\n\n-Repetitive\n-Soundtrack is not big enough and eventually annoys you after too many repeats\n-The outcome of the levels feels way too tied into having the luck to have good item and trap spawns in the right places\n-Character movement is way,wayyy too slow.","September 13, 2015","true","12.5"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","20","31","0","1"

The points I make may not bother you and you may still enjoy the game.|||||||||||||||||||\n\nTitle: Party Hard\nGenre: Action, Indie, Strategy\nDeveloper: Pinokl Games\nPublisher: tinyBuild\nRelease Date: 25 Aug, 2015\n\nGame key was supplied by the publisher.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nParty Hard is a top down, 2D,  mass murder simulator in which you play as a someone who gets a little cheesed off at his neighbours for having an extremely loud party at 3am. He decides to take matters into his own hands and goes on a murderous rampage. As you do.\n\nAs much as I hate to say it, that is pretty much it with the story. However, you do get a quick cutscene between each mission which shows the story of detective John West as he tries to catch the ‘Party Hard Killer’. Although these cutscenes are extremely badly voice acted, and even though the speaking characters are changing, it sounds like the same voice actor desperately trying to put on a different voice but failing miserably. If you are looking for a game with a detailed progressive story, this is not the game for you. Although most people buying this will see from the get-go that this game is not designed for it’s story.\n\nThe gameplay is as you would expect, fun but shallow and without any real challenge. Your character will walk around the party wielding a knife, slowly bumping each person off until no more remain.  If you murder someone, the police will pay a visit and put the body in a boby bag, leave it on the middle of the dancefloor and then bugger off somewhere else without even investigating what happened. This will continue happening as you stab as many people as you see fit until the dance floor is strewn with body bags and the rest of the party attendants still dancing their night away like nothing has even happened- occasionally going off to the buffet table because the sign off a mass murder has given them a craving for pineapple and cheese sticks.\n\nThe fun element will come from the traps that you can use throughout the map. There are a great amount of traps and each time you replay the mission, the traps may have changed or may be in a different location. These traps range from exploding speakers, to poisoning the food and even driving a car over a hoard of people (you do not control the car) However, these traps still fall under the same problem as the stabbings – the car could have driven over 10 people at once and they are now currently mush on the pavement- but nobody else will care (they won’t even call the emergency services) because THE PARTY MUST GO ON!  Trying to get the perfect ‘massacre’ is where the fun begins and ends, trying to get best kills without getting caught is really the only thing this game has to offer, which is a real shame.\n\nIf you do managed to be silly enough to get spotted and you cannot wipe them out before they get to the phone to call the police, then the police will come. Only one officer though. You now must escape. How do you do that you ask? Drive away? Kill the police office? Don’t be silly, just play the ol’ switcheroo by climbing in and out of a window (or other trap door locations) Just as the police officer gets near you, climb out of a window, and then as they try going back round the front door to get to the other side, climb back in. Once you have used an escape route to escape from a dimwitted officer, Mario will come and board it up and you cannot use it anymore (seriously, he looks like Mario).  Be careful though, the police are not the only ones who will arrive- other units such as the SWAT team and FBI can also make an appearance, which makes the game a tad bit harder.\n\nYou are able to hide bodies in certain locations. This will help stop anybody from seeing the dead partygoers and in turn, the police will not be called. The thing that irks me is that you can stuff as many bodies as you want into a dumpster. Want to cram 50 people in there? Sure, go ahead! Games such as Hitman have done this better by only allowing a maximum amount of bodies to be hidden in one location. The game would have provided gamers with a bit of a rush to make the body disposal areas in places that maybe get a bit more lively. Having a dumpster outside that only about 1 person walks to at a time makes no challenge. However, putting a disposal area in say a bedroom cupboard, where you have to quickly dispose of it before any moment someone can come walking in. (although this would not work because you can see the entire map and where everyone is at anytime, maybe they needed to add in a line of sight feature)\n\nOne of the redeeming features were the songs they used in the game, I am a bit disappointed that there was such a small amount of music variety used. What is currently there is amazing, it gets stuck in your head instantly and is very enjoyable to listen to- but a larger library of music would have been preferred.\n\nAnother redeeming feature is the graphics. This art style has been done many times in the past, so don’t expect anything to ‘wow’ you, but it really does work for this game. Everything looks simplistic and you can easily see the entire map. Saying that, there are some problems with height of things, sometimes I get caught because I think a window is a lot lower than I thought- so I couldn’t just walk under it holding a dead body over my shoulder.\n\nAll in all, I just couldn’t recommend the game, it just doesn’t do enough right for me to really enjoy playing it. If the AI reactions to murders was maybe a bit more realistic then I would have enjoyed this a lot more. There just isn’t much difficulty in a game where you can leave dead bodies around and nobody will care, the police won’t even investigate the brutal murder(s) that just happened. It seems that most missions can be done by standing by an area where bodies can be hidden and slowly killing 1 by 1 until you get to a lower number, then going and killing off anybody that’s sleeping and then activating any traps to kill more.\n\nIf you don’t mind a game that has no challenge- you just want to run around killing people in different ways and try to beat your previous times/scores- then you should take a look at buying this (you can always refund it if it’s not for you) Personally, it wasn’t for me.","August 25, 2015","false","3.4"," 163 of 299 people (55%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","55","163","299","14","10"

Apparently the only way the sociopathic gentleman can sleep is by killing everyone at every party he can find. I might suggest three tylenol PM or even 2 ambien, but different strokes right?!  Above is a short preview video of the game, and below are my initial thoughts.\n\nA review copy was provided to TheHiddenLevels.com by tinybuild and for that we thank them greatly.\n\nI'll be honest, initially I found this game distasteful at face value, likely due to recent events. I am glad that I spent some time playing it because it's far from the tacky simple game I judged it to be by it's cover. What I played is a strategy game, with a good mix of fun, style, and humor. I have killed millions of digital mobs, but rarely have I had this much fun when the task was simply "kill everything". It's a unique game with some really neat little easter eggs to find on each map.\n\nI really enjoy people's reactions to certain things, they are funny and generally quite crass. Dancing for extended periods of time let me konw just how these folks feel about this guy. That's all the motivation I needed to set up a speaker bomb, and watch their bodies burn on the dance floor. My preferred method is to set up a "kill room" and keep piling the bodies in it as they become discovered less frequently that way.\n\nI'm concerned about the judgement of these party goers... I'm thinking that after the 2nd or 3rd murder, I'd consider leaving the party for the night, or at least going to a diner for some eggs. If I were a band hired to play a party and our guitarist was killed and thrown in a trash can, I think we'd pack it up and call it a night.\n\nThe only thing I felt was lacking in the game a bit is the voice acting, especially during the cutscenes. I'm not sure if it's the voices, the dialouge, or a mix of both, but it just seems off. That really is the only downside I found, the game is challenging and fun. I would suggest this for adults with a darker sense of humor, those nostalgic for the leisure suit larry days, or who would like a strategy game far outside the conventional box.\n\nThanks for watching and reading.

You play as a man who get's annoyed by his partying neighbors at 3 AM so you get up and wipe out the entire house. But now the quench for blood begins and you set out to kill all party goers across the US.\n\nGameplay is simple but it get's complicated really fast. You can do three things. You can set up traps that will killd anyone around them, you can use the knife to stab people and you can pick people up and carry them around and hide the bodies or you can pick up sleeping people and carry them and stab them. But if you slip up, the victims can call the police which will patrol around the map trying to find the killer. You can evade police but it's harder each time they arrive at the crime scene.\n\nGraphics are simple pixel art and they look awesome. Every little detail is just awesome. From the sharknado in the Miami level to the Mad Max vehicles in the Party Bus level. All of it is just amazing.\n\nSoundtrack is just awesome. It's awesome and I would buy it by itself, it's great. Now there's not much sound effects apart from people screaming and explosions.\n\nThe game get's incredibly difficult. The Miami level is one of the hardest things I had to do period. Overall expect a challenge when playing this game, cause it's not easy.\n\nLevel Design is pretty simple. You see the map from a over head view and you see everything from there on out. But some levels are in open areas where there's no where to hide making it a pain to play through.\n\nThe game took me 4 hours to finish every level and the Miami level took me an hour all by itself. The game has a randomized levels. But this boils down to small details like certain traps not being there and more victims in the level. You do get one more character which you can use to play through the other levels.\n\nIf this review was written five hours earlier, I would have said it's pretty buggy, but after I closed down the game I found the patch that fixed a lot of problems. The game ran smoothly from start to finish apart from a minor bug where AI would glitch into walls.\n\nParty Hard is a really fun game and without a doubt I highly suggest to try it out. It's addictive gameplay will make you want more murder and chaos and the incredibly fun gameplay will make you come back. I give Party Hard a 8.5/10\n\nThe After Party Update: Brief Review.\n\nThe developers added 7 new parties so you can continue the rampage once more. There's nothing major to report. There parties are all the same with different objectives, like staying alive for a certain amount of time or even trying to complete a level in a certain amount of time.  These new parties are just as hard as the the main ones. It took me 3 hours in total to finish all 7 of them. I highly suggest getting the game already if you haven't.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 31, 2015","true","7.6"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","1"

It's amazing how this game blends some "simple" gameplay into a great story of a serialkiller. The game itself is so funny with random generated maps and the music is just firing you up to killl everyone at that party :D Also really funny are the traps that you can use. It's so funny to see what happens when you use them for the first time... got one of the achievements with just one of those traps haha. Oh to not forget the acheivements... kinda funny challenges tbh and not those boring achievements like in other games where you just have to spawn stuff..\n\nAll in all... you just have to kill everyone in the party without being seen or getting busted by the police or worse!\nBut... still this sh*t is so fun like omg. Also kinda makes you want to play more than just that one party. If you fail you just try again until you get damn salty or you completed it. This is the game.\n\nGood:\n+Fun to play\n+Nice pixel art\n+Great music/soundtrack\n+Makes you wanna finish the party (well I guess that's good xD)\n+Nice effect sounds... Loved the thrilling sounds while being in the bathroom for example xD\n+Easy gameplay once you get used to the controls (pretty easy lol)\n+More than one character to play with different skills\n+Funny events happening (Zombies, FBI, SWAT teams rushing into the party.... and so on)\n+Nice Campagne story\n\nNegative:\n- It's not really possible to kill the Cops, Engeneers and so on (except with traps)\n- Too few tracks.  Well  you can mute the game and put on your own musik but then you miss all the nice explosions and so on.. But I can live with that :P\n\nHuh..? :\n? The DJ keeps playing after you kill him... Well the party has to go on I guess :D\n? Random events like raining sharks.. Yes you hear right sharks falling from the sky. xD\n\n\nI found out about the Level/Map editor... I played a few of these parties already and damn it's just too much fun xD\nI might try to make a Map myself soon but yeah.\n\nGreat game and I only can recommend it to people BUT I'll warn you:\nIf you get easily frustrated... then this isn't for you. <3","April 25","true","5.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/recommended/356570/","aldershot","[F!] Aldershot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/","2454 products in account","Party Hard has an interesting premise where you play the role of a psycho who simply does not like loud parties. His solution? Kill every one at the party of course! If I was to try an nail Party Hard to a single genre, I would say it's a tactical stealth game, though murder-sim also comes to mind.\n\nThe idea of putting the stealth genre into a crowded, open room, as Party Hard has done, is a pretty unique experience. In most other stealth games, the area is sparsely populated with tons of corners and objects to hide around, but in Party Hard you're in a large open room, where every one can see every one else. It makes stealth tactics much more interesting as the player will have to be creative on how he or she approach any given situation., with witnesses littered every where.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnDMC4SjQI\nIn Party Hard, the most basic way of accomplishing your goal of murder is simply to stab someone. It's also recommended that you dump the body somewhere unseen as they'll alert other party goers. The key here is not to get caught, even if someone alert the cops, as long as you don't get pined with the crime, you're still good to go. The game also gives you an assortment of randomly generated environmental traps and dangers, with each stage featuring it's own unique RNG generation. You can activate any of these traps at any given moment in order to help you murder the party. The game also encourages creative play, as each scenario plays out more like a sandbox. For example, there is a stage with a swimming pool. I got creative, and experimented with carrying passed out partiers into the pool to see if they'd drown. Indeed they did, and this is just one example of how you can get creative with the many "kill tactics" available to you. The overall premise of this idea, with how sandboxy the stages are designed, coupled with the random event generation that comes with every play though, the game does a good job at encouraging replay, while keeping things interesting and surprising.\n\nThough the core of Party Hard is pretty enjoyable, and if nothing else, unique and interesting, it's not without it's faults. Your character's movement speed is at a snail's pace, with only a short, and slow regenerating stamina bar to help with it. It also encourages a lot of moving back and forth repetitively in order to dump bodies safely. Couple these 2 slow elements with the fact that when you fail a stage, you have to start at the beginning. Considering that some of the stages can take upwards to, if not over, 20 minutes to complete, the game can feel tedious at times.\n\nParty Hard's overall creative stealth play, with it's interesting random event generation, I found it more enjoyable than tedious. It's overall a very unique and enjoyable experience, though some of the tedium will turn some players off.\n\nPros:\n- Unique stealth gameplay design\n- Good visuals and audio\n- Lots of dark comedy\n- Random event generation keeps the game fresh\n\nCons:\n- Punishing fail state that waste time rather than teach a lesson\n- Slow movement pace\n- Can be repetitive","September 7, 2015","true","3.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

To get further in the game you have to perfect your skills, which every now and again, is screwed up by the randomness in the game, but isn't that big of a deal, but when you get past the "story" (if you can call it that) things take a turn towards just plain frustrating. I have played a lot of this game and I have enjoyed most of it, but in the later levels, you can do things PERFECTLY and still lose because, this ONE TIME the game decides that your smoke bomb doesn't work, that guy who is dead stands back up and reports you to the cops, one person in a group is immune to your traps, your attack doesn't work, or that the game decides to kill your allies but not the enemies being run over. Things like this happen more often in the later levels as the game pushes the concept as far as they could.\n\nIt all depends on if you like a game that might waste your time or not. I mean that in terms of the amount of time you need to wait and execute your plan only to have it ruined by a bug, logical glitch or random event. If you can look past that and want a stealth game where you murder people using traps, stabbing, stealth, bombs, calling in a random group to come in and screw with the scenario, then sure, buy this game. It can be a lot of fun, but I have also have had NO FUN with the BS this game pulls based on a random number generator deciding that this game, the one time am about to win is the time the game decides a chainsaw weilding psychopath will hunt me down while I am trapped in a room with no escape.\n\nSo, ultimately, if you have the time and the money and are looking for a funny stealth game to play, because you are not playing this game for its SUPER CLICHE storyline, but to cause mayhem and have fun... which you will have throughout the beginning of this game, but the endgame is beyond rediculously punishing no matter how well you play.\n\nThe NO rating is because this needs to be addressed, the game has bugs and issues with indicating things to the player that needs to be addressed and no, I wouldn't recommend this game to most people I meet because I would be worried they would ultimately get frustrated with the game.","February 5","false","22.7"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","18","30","2","3"

The setting is the 1980's and you are an every-man who just wants some quiet, no matter where you turn, it seems someone is throwing a party. You set out to stop the partying lifestyle but how? By killing everyone you can without getting caught by the cops, the feds or even swat teams of course!\n\nThe semi-procedurally generated levels are bright and colorful, you are given a variety of objects in the environment to interact with, allowing you to come up with some pretry unique and creative ways of slaying your victims. Rig objects in the environment, make a phone call to call someone in to create a diversion, use hidden routes to escape the cops, dispose of corpses to avoid suspicion from partiers. The music is fun and matches the game's energy. It's very 80's with alot of synth and electromic beats. The sounds from the npc's are a bit comical and the noir narrative in between levels is comparable to Sin City or Max Payne. It all vibes together well for this short but fun and addictive game.\n\nThe weapons in this game and how the player can (or must rather) showcase them are true to the classic Friday The 13th and Halloween films. Very bloody at times but there's also very cheesey moments... you'll see random sexual things you'd naked women dancing and guys staring at those girl's naughty bits, kids sneaking off to the bedroom for oral relations - that means both lips to lips or sometimes even lips to other things. Probably not a game for children (even if the game os 16-bit, it's still pretty easy to see what's going on).\n\nYour main weapon is a knife but there are other things in the environment that you can find and pick up if you are willing to explore, these items include swords, smoke grenades, poison, stun grenades, ect. And since the levels are semi-randomized, the items are as well and may not be the same item next time you play the level. It's very easy to get beat up by bouncers, get caught by the police or even get beat up for dancing in a way that no one likes. So you have to be patient and careful. The level of strategic finesse you must use in each level makes up for the game's short length. Each party is different, has a different feel and is it's own playground for the player.\n\nPros  Unique Twitch User Interaction\nKiller Soundtrack (no pun intended)\nSimple easy gameplay, hard level\nRefreshing concept\nColorful graphics, retro sprites\nFull controller support\nCons  Can get repetitive\nA couple of levels aren't up to par with the rest\nThere was a "can't pick up body" glitch (may be fixed already)\nFinal Thoughts:\nI was surprised by this game, pleasantly surprised. I would recommend it if you are a fan of 80's campy horror type flix like I am and if you're a retro gamer you'll love it even more.\n\nRating (8.8 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","January 17","true","7.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","5"

You're usually walking around a party with a few traps and no way to lure people into them. After you've used all the large area traps, you'll have to bumble around hoping to widdle out the 30 or 40 people left shaking their groove thing. It's a game with an interesting idea that doesn't know how to keep the murder flowing in an active way.\n\nIt's a real shame too, because the pixel animations are fantastic and the music is boombastic. Too bad the game never really explains how to pull off high profile kills, or trick partygoers into a death trap. If they would have upped the ante and allowed for more freedom, I think this game could have taken the industry by storm.

No not insane, inane. There are some more maps after you beat the game but after I tried the first extra map I had finally had enough. The game is extremely inconsistent in several ways. Overall it has so many nonsensical game flaws that you would think whoever made this was in special needs classes in school. I wanted to like this game pretty bad because it looks and plays awesome, but ultimately it is just not even worth the $6 I spent on it on sale. When it was over I breathed a sigh of relief and looked forward to forgetting the developer's constantly glaring bad mistakes that I experienced the whole time that put a sad sheet over how awesome the game could have been.\n\n+ Awesome graphics/effects\n+ Mass murder simulator\n+ 80's theme-ish\n+ Fun traps\n+ Fun gameplay\n+ Works great with xbox 360 controller\n+ Very fun for a few levels\n\n- Only a few traps per level, sometimes as few as one or two.\n- Most traps have a very tiny kill radius or are gone after someone walks into them once.\n- Immediately turns into a stabfest. Out of the 40-50 kills needed per level, you will have to get 30-40 of them by stabbing. For the first few levels I didn't care and was having a blast. After that, it got real old real fast because all levels are just tedious, long, drawn out stabfests.\n- Killing people means just stabbing, waiting for a cop or medic (who for some stupid reason wear tall white baking hats) to come and cover them up and leave, then stab some more, move around to not get caught or linked to a kill, and that is all there is to the game really.\n- FBI agents will sometimes start running after you even though they had no way of linking you to any murders.\n- Cops will bust you without proof you killed someone, just because you are standing in their walk path (can be avoided with practice).\n- Bouncers will attack you at first site even if you just started the level and just walked close to one. Why? Why me when I am just a party goer like everyone else? Are they psychic and know I will start killing people? Is there a secret APB out to all bouncers to stomp to death anyone fitting your description?\n- Bouncers stomp you to death when they catch you. Why?\n- The campus party has bouncers. Why? What campus party has ever had bouncers? Let alone the four to six that are on that level. Ignoring the fact that it is insanely stupid to have bouncers at a campus party in the game, why have so many?\n- Sometimes you get linked to the murder just because... well just because the game felt like it.\n- The music is sub-par at best, and it got so mind jarringly repetitive that I very quickly couldn't stand it and played 95% of the game with my headphones around my neck. The problem is that when you retry a level 20+ times and have to hear the same one-tone one-beat music restart every time you retry, it makes you hate it quickly.\n\n7/10 for a few levels\n5/10 otherwise\n5.9/10","December 17, 2015","false","7.8"," 27 of 48 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","27","48","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lovely_Death_Reaper/recommended/356570/","Lovely_Death_Reaper","Lovely Death","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lovely_Death_Reaper/","295 products in account","No game has ever had me say, "How?" and "What the f**k?" more than Party Hard.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the concept is great and the game can be fun to play. I can see why people love it, however I found the experience more annoying and frustrating than fun during my playthrough and here's why...\n\n-The line of site is almost completely broken in this game:\n\nVictims and cops can see you and bodies behind objects and walls that should be impossible to see. Not to mention, the game tries to balance this by making their line of sight moderately short range taking away from the fun. I think the game could be much improved with longer lines of sight and improved obstructions of said line of sight. As of now it's pretty much flipping a coin on each kill unless you're totally secluded from everything else.\n\n-Traps and placements are randomized every time the mission starts:\n\nNow this is actually a cool and interesting feature but I'm afraid its a double-edged sword. More than often you find yourself spawning with barely any ways to kill or distract crowds with a near to zip chance of succeeding. Of course, there's players who seek this challenge and like to pull it off. I just feel an average player with moderate skill like me is going to find themselves restarting the mission over and over until there's at least one worthy trap.\n\n-Every other map has a totally broken trap/phone call that can clean house hands free with zero work:\n\nThis is very unfortunate because maps with traps like these tend to lack good design and are thrown in there like a cheat to skip the mission. It's mind blowing not a single victim/guard cares if your phone call brings people to the party and are obvious threats knocking people out and killing left and right.\n\n-The police/guards make no sense at all in this game, especially considering their methods of public safety:\n\nUpon arrival the police almost always run over people killing them instantly. I'm sure most people wouldn't write this off as a bad thing because who cares, free kills. Wrong, I think it's beyond stupid as you can't even use this feature to your advantage like luring crowds into the street and getting the cops to run them over. The swat beat everyone down if they're called but for some reason you get "BUSTED" for being beat down like anyone else. (The people beat down aren't even arrested.) Finally, the guards... These guys beat you down just for showing up. I can understand if they're at the front door serving as a bouncer like in the second mission, but otherwise it's a dumb mechanic. How would they know if you're invited or not with all the people and partying going on.\n\n-Horrible blame and accusation system:\n\nI can't even state how many times I was busted for doing nothing wrong at all. If anyone at all dies near the player everyone assumes its the player and calls the cops over for an arrest. Countless times I've been walking on the brinks of the map to try ang get away from people dying and cops who are passing by will stop to arrest me for walking away like everyone else. Sometimes it's its not the cops and just random people who will call the cops for no reason. An interesting yet broken feature is the ability for victims to accuse and call cops on other victims. This leads to the most random arrests I've ever seen and it doesn't help the player's experience as it can't really be triggered on purpose similarly to police running over victims...\n\n-Handful of small bugs that aren't "game breaking" but result in the player's death all the time:\n\nTypically, the cops are supposed to leave and ignore any more crimes the second they have someone over their shoulder or have bagged all the bodies but I've been arrested with people over their shoulder's twice in my time playing. Is it a feature? Possibly. It sure doesn't look like it. These police have pretty broken behavior and do random things they shouldn't more than often.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall the game is fun yes, but success is a crap shoot and mostly RNG. When I say it's RNG I mean RNG... Going back to replay the game with end game knowledge and skill barely helps in this game. The game offers a mediocre story with TERRIBLE voice acting. The only real replay value in this game comes from the steam workshop allowing the player to download other player's missions and play them. Note, there ARE unlockable characters in this game with some really good pros but, they have horrible cons that render them useless. People say this game is a "stealth" game but it really isn't at all.\n\nI would recommend waiting for a sale to pick this game up. I think it's worth a playthrough but isn't an amazing game you'll be playing a lot. Heck, I'll probably forget about this game a week or so from now. I don't mean this in a bad or rude way, the game just didn't leave a memorable impact on me at all.\n\nSide Note for Hotline Miami fans:\n\nPeople compare this game to Hotline Miami all the time, but the two are nothing at all alike aside from being a masked killer who cleans house. If you're looking for a good alternative to Hotline Miami 1&2, I would recommend Deadbolt and not this. Deadbolt features a 2D world with one hit kills. It provides better challenge that requires planning very much like Hotline Miami.\n\nFinal Rating: 4/10","June 5","false","6.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

All of the time I have logged in this game has literally been on Saturday nights with a group of four people at a party. Its great to just pass the controller around and see who can complete the level. Its great fun.\n\nEssentially, you are trying to pick people off one-at-a-time without getting caught. You can brute force stab them. You can use traps, and even items that you find. There is definately a moderately deep layer of strategy that you can use. There is tons of content, achievements, and unlockables.\n\nPros:\n+Artwork is really great.\n+Everything occurs on a single screen. No panning or breaks.\n+Music is super appropriate, and easy to listen to.\n+Simple to learn, impossible to master gameplay.\n+Tons of unlockables and levels. Lots to do here. Now I hear there is Workshop support?! Crazy.\n+Controller and keyboard support is great. Controls are minimal and easy to reference.\n+Lots of throwback references and good humor.\n\nCons:\n-I can't really think of any - except that the voice acting is subpar, but I'll chalk that up to super cheesy.\n\nTotally worth full price, and best played in a group.","March 4","true","2.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","1"

While the first levels are actually fun to play, the game quickly becomes more and more random, ending whatever plan you have with a stabfest. Ain't nobody got time for traps, since they seem to be working randomly anyway. Stealth system and AI are also random, as you can get linked to a murder for absolutely nothing, which is painfully annoying past a certain level (Miami thing) since you cannot plan anything due to the amount of random, and must resort to either stab everyone as fast as you can, or play stab'n'hide in a corner of the map. Which is sad, since as I said, 80s ambience is well made, soundtrack is decent, but the game as a whole is just boring.\n\n\nTL;DR: Just go play Hotline Miami.","April 6","false","2.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Ok, maybe you\nshouldn't party that hard personally but that's how you do it in Party Hard by Indie Dev Pinoki Games. Party Hard is a game about a man who is fed up with his neighbors\nconstant partying and he justs wants to get some sleep. However that man is also a brutal psychopath choosing to end the party by any means neccesary without stopping\nuntil going around the country and crashing each party he encounters. You'll enter each party armed with nothing but a knife where the only goal is to kill everyone.\nYou also have the capability to rig traps, sabatoge environments, pick up other weapons and tools, and also call in support from time to time. Regardless of your approach\nyou have to be careful and not be seen doing any of these attacks. The overall system works very well with party goers only calling you out if they see you commit the crime,\nor walk in on you standing near dead bodies.\n\nThe environmental attacks work as a sort of freebie and won't alert people to your pressence but if they see the dead body\nthey're likely to call the cops which tends to make things more difficult until they leave. If I had one complaint here, it's that I wish there was even more environmental\ninteraction. With the procedral style level design these objects change position making it interesting with room for replayability, but I still would like to see more to\ninteract with. What tends to happen is you stab a few victims, hide a few bodies and start activating traps, only to run out and wait for the npc's to break away from the\ncrowd one by one thus repeating this step over and over. It's still satisfying to single out victims, but the game gets really exciting when you unleash a big attack forcing\nthe scragglers into other surrounding traps.\n\nThat brings me to the overall design and tone. Party Hard is a modern day 16-bit game in a half cocked birds eye view, which definitely brings a comparison to the similar\nstyled game Hotline Miami. But, where hotline miami was a fast paced shoot & slug fest, Party Hard takes things a bit slower invoking a lot of technical planning and\nthinking. I think this is great because rather than be a copy, it's a very different game that will appeal to the same audience. If you enjoyed Hotline Miami, and enjoy\npuzzle like stealth then you'll enjoy this. The music will also likely get you pumped and excited as you play. Right away I was bobbing my head and enjoying the music the\nmoment I started until it was over.\n\nThe story was good as well with a recollective style narrative involving a cop and interviewer discussing the path the murderer took. It kept me hooked in and was very well\ndone with a few twists and decent voice acting. It took me a bit over 7 hours to complete but I'll definitely be playing again to try and get faster times and better\nscores.\n\nOverall Party Hard is a game you should play. It has good replayability, the gameplay is smooth and I encountered only a few technical issues. Its gritty story and\nviolent nature are entertaining and the soundtrack is just awesome. The only negatives are as I mentioned, the enironments could use a bit more interaction, and I would like\nto have had more weapon options and traps. With that I'm giving Party Hard an A-. This is definitely one to pick up and I wouldn't be surprised if there is a second one.\n\nI'm Conner and thanks for watching my review.

It's much more chill, though. You have a lot more incentive to lurk around and see the flow of things, keep it cool and wait things out and plan your attack.

The premise is simple: you're a psychopath on an insane cross-country killing spree. You have to kill everyone at each party you attend without being arrested or dying yourself. You can stab people, or kill them in groups with various amusing traps. The core gameplay is super fun, though the game can occasionally get frustrating when you get stuck on some of the harder levels. And the difficulty is inconsistent, with a few levels feeling almost impossible at times. Still, as your skills grow, you'll appreciate some of the subtle strategies more and more. After beating the regular campaign, you can play another half dozen bonus levels that are wacky variations on the regular levels, and you can also unlock four additional characters, each of which have their own restrictions and extra powers that significantly change the nature of the game. It took me about ten hours to beat all the regular levels, but I feel like there's probably another 20-30hrs for completionists who want to beat every party with every character. Some of the combinations are incredibly challenging. So yeah, if you're looking for something a little different, where you're the unapologetic bad guy, check this out.","January 9","true","19.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It reminds me a lot of the old Sega Genesis game "Haunting", except for just trying to scare them out of the house, you're trying to murder them all. You set traps with items around the area and stab people while no one is looking. It sounds grim, but they keep it light enough to make it fun without any accidentally induced psychosis.\n\nThe voice acting is meh, but that's hardly what you're looking for in this game, and it only pops up once the level has been completed. Take this line from right after the "inspector" gives his opinion of the heinous nature of these murder sprees:\n\n"Mr. Smith, let's stick to the facts! What do you think he was doing at this time?"\n\nHow can you ask someone to stick to the facts and in the same breath ask him to speculate? LoL.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I found this game. It's light enough for older laptops, really fun, you can play for 1 min or 3 hours. I can't wait to see some of the updates they plan on releasing. One thing I'd really like to see is a level editor.

Though this is by no means as bad as SYABH. It's just not very good. It fundamentally misunderstands both the stealth genre and Hotline Miami giving you a hodgepodge that doesn't really do justice to either. There's so many basic design mistakes that playing this ends up being a frustrating experience rather than an elating one. And it's a shame because the concept is absolutely brilliant.\n\nThere's the components of a good game here, and it's very pretty, but levels are too long for the ease of failure, mechanics are poorly explained, there's no indication of how far an NPC can see which prevents effective stealth, it's buggy - I've had the AI glitch out on 2/6 runs, and there's not enough different mechanics leaving very little variation in how parties play. The game feels like someone took a game jam prototype and expanded the number of levels to full game length without thinking through what needed to be added in order to accommodate that much content.\n\nIt would take so little for this to become an enthusiastic recommendation, but Party Hard is unrefined to the point where it overshadows all merits that the game has. There's no reason to pick this up, I'm hesitant to even give a 'get this when it's in a bundle' recommendation.","December 31, 2015","false","4.2"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","1"

Perhaps you have a mask laying around, convienantly stored near a large knife (because these two things go together naturally, right?).  Instead of giving the player the option to call in a noise complaint to the police or this being "Walk Next Door And Nicely Ask Everyone To Keep It Down Sim 2015", you do what any normal person who stores a knife and mask together would do.  And for this I am grateful.\n\nThis is a game about seeing how many people you can kill without/before you get caught.  Each level has environmental triggers to assist you which are randomized each playthrough.  There is an actual storyline, and despite it being very Hollywood B-movie, it actually seems to work quite well; even at its worst, it still managed to keep me entertained.  The gameplay is addictive--things can go to hell real quick and become very chaotic, typically ending up in you needing to try the level again, but personally I find myself eager to do so and easily losing track of time.  This is the mark of a good game to me.

The game feels like an 80's game experience with the synthesizer music, flashing neon colors and pixel-art although the game is a true 90's horror slasher game.\nParty hard follows a series of killings at parties throughought the United States of America, dialogued by a detective called Mr John West who will do the narrative about these Party-hard-killings.\nThe game has 12 levels to beat and some of them are quite hard to break, just like the old NES games back in the day.\n\nYour main goal within Party Hard is to not get caught while you pick off victims one by one.\nThe only things you can use to your advantage are for instance traps within the environment, special guests by dialing a phone number and weapons/items found inside briefcases or  poison provided by dark merchants with creepy jackets.\nYour opponents are the Cops, FBI, SWAT-team, bouncers, party people (who can notice your mass murders) and Mario the plumber/carpenter who locks off areas by blocking windows of trapdoors so you can't easily flee from the police forces.\n\nI really can recommend Party Hard to anyone who is looking for a challenge to beat, to get creative on a bloodbath, pixel-art, synt-wave music, references to classic retro movies, games etc., dancing bears or simply if you like to Party Crash!\nIf the game is on sale then you really should pick up this title and give it a dance!\n\n\n","August 31, 2015","true","18.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Finally a psychopath I can relate to!\n\nIn all seriousness though, I'd queue this game for one of my GOTYs. It has fitting music and fun gameplay, though, I will have to give it a small minus because it reuses certain traps over and over again, even if they don't really fit into the scenario (Why are there bubble gum machines everywhere?), which, thankfully, the game makes up with a large variety of different levels and level-themes.\n\nEven as someone that isn't a big fan of pixel graphics, I did enjoy them in this game since they were usually clean, spot-on and somewhat high-res.\n\nThe story has a nice twist, though, it's mostly just giving you a bit of back-story to what you're doing. Unfortunately, none of the events in said back-story have any affect on how the game plays out. (The police doesn't start re-inforcing parties in which 40 people have already been killed, the game tells you about vigilante-mobs roaming the streets and taking the problems into their own hands, though, you'll never meet one of them. Neither does the story ever crack down on the laziness the police officers seem to have.)\n\nParty Hard also features several characters which you can unlock , which, as the game says, you get through getting achievements, for example completing the game. They're obviously supposed to get some replayability into the game, though, unfortunately, one of the characters I unlocked was only usable in a single mission and the other was somewhat useless, since it was broken to a certain point. (By disabling the ability to interact with most objects, you're unable to go into areas such as the pool, therefore, you couldn't access certain areas). But even if you don't have problems with that, there's still the issue of replaying the same levels you had already visited again, in the exact same state By the way, without the ability to interact with most objects...

And the game actually follows up with a solid experience. It's genuinely fun to blow people up, poison them, run them over, frame them when the cops show up, and stuff their bodies into sewer grates. Once you're used to it, the game itself is fun to play.\n\nBut that's the thing, you have to be used to it. After the tutorial, the game immediately throws you into a party of sixty people and lets you loose. There's no "learning curve" quite as much as there is being thrown in wholesale, where you need to figure out all the mechanics yourself. It's jarring, and it might shed players once they hit it. The level is, admittedly, easier than the others. But it's only easy once you know how to manipulate it, it's not _intuitively_ easy.\n\nThe story is thin. It tries to cover up its lack of substance by putting cheesy 80's-esque cop narration, but that doesn't entirely work either. The cutscenes between levels are a good idea (they reward you for winning by showing you how you get to the next party, or use the next character), but they're just not well executed.\n\nBut if you can ignore that, and are willing to stick with it until you've learned how the game works, it's fun and rewarding for a couple hours.","September 3, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's replayablity comes from entertaining events that come about from drug busts to robberies to another murder coming around to swat teams the different levels themes also adds to this....\n\nThe cons,  There isn't enough traps changes to make it a trap only killing game  and if you not into a game that can be very hard and will restart the whole level on you when you die.... and you will die or get busted from the cops a plenty but beating that one level without leaving a single body is Super satifying.

I know that I probably used "Fast Hack'em" to get a copy.  ANd I wouldn't have paid for it.  But d*mn it was fun!\n\nThis game reminded me of my high-school days.  It's one of the few retro games that I think actually captured the spirit of the 1980s.\n\nThis game is surprising deep in the amount of strategy required to succeed.  Sure, you can just go on a rampage and start killing everything in sight.  But to do so successfully, without being caught -- therein is the rub.\n\nLike many games, I could do without the plot.  I don't particularly care about why this guy is killing a sh*t-ton of people.  Though I do think it's pretty funny that basically he starts his killing spree because his neighbors won't stop partying and keep the noise down so he can get some sleep.\n\nThere is a ton of humor in the game -- it's funny sometimes to watch how the protagonist (who I guess is more anti-hero than protagonist) how he manages to kill people.  And perhaps the most satisfying elements is that you can take a hatchet to many of those hard-core gamers who live in their mothers' basement.\n\nMore than enough laughs here.  Hit the Lamborghini so that it runs over everyone standing at the entrance to the club.  Make sure that nobody see you duck out the window with that corpse.\n\nAnd who truly know that dumpsters could hide so many bodies?  Nevermind, I don't want to know if you already had an estimation of that...\n\n$13 is about right for this game.  There is a lot of content, a ton of replay value, And enough intrigue and strategy to make the idle moments of a Sunday afternoon pass with a high degree of content and satisfation.\n\nAs everything I write and review -- I am a casual gamer.  I have a life, a family, a career, and I work hard to pay off soul-crushing student loan debt.  I evaluate games based on whether I would purchase them again because they help me espace the real work.\n\nBuy this game.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  Buy it.

The idea of the game is you're a guy trying to get some sleep, your neighbours are having a house party, so at 3am you go around there and kill them all, even the DJ. From that you go on an anti-party psychopathic rage around America crashing parties and killing everyone in your path.\n\nThere's small (skippable) cut scenes between levels which help set the narritave, but aren't important to watch if you just fancy killing 40 odd people on a rooftop party instead.\n\nThe gameplay itself can be quite slow, but not to the point of where it's boring, to me it makes it feel more like the character you're controlling is cool, calm and collected; although it can be annoying when trying to outrun Police/FBI/Bouncers. There's a sprint bar which depletes *very* quickly, a slight shame if you're waiting to speed up your murderous rampage. Different 'events' can and do happen per level which can be a help or hindrance. SWAT might turn up, FBI might turn up, Pest exterminators might even turn up. Level design is nice and the mechanics are good, I think the odd thing could do with a slight tweak, but it still perfoms solidly.\n\nThe soundtrack to the game is pretty decent, and will end up staying in your head for hours after you've exited out of the game. The sound effects suit the game to a tee.\n\nAt the time of writing this I had completed the 'main' story within 7 hours, that's with several restarts on one level, so I suspect it could be completed within 5-6 hours. There's scope for replayablilty with extra unlockable characters with different abilities and probably even better a level editor and steam workshop thus allowing for arguably endless playability.\n\n\nAll in all, it's a decent, humourous game; a solid little indie title which I would recommend to anyone.","April 20","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a lot of fun if you enjoy murdering people, you psychopath.\nThis game is is seriously demented.  The whole premise is that you must kill everyone at a party.  Stab them, push them, burn them, poison them: kill them without getting busted.\n\nThe game is cheap, that is low-quality.  Many of the levels resort to you standing in one spot waiting for someone stupid enough to walk by you.  While the levels certainly look very different, the game play is largely the same on each level.  Unlocked characters help to relieve the monotony and improve re-playability.  The graphics are as ugly as the game is perverted.  The music feels uninspired.  While the game draws on the same nostalgic vibe as Hotline Miami it fails to deliver the same level of charisma.\n\nThis title may not have a greatness, an everlasting quality, but it is most certainly fun.

There is a story which drives you to find out more about the main character, which is very rare to find at all, let alone being as properly executed as it is in this game. I cannot sing enough praises about this game. Pixel art done right. A gorgeous soundtrack for each and every party scene. Completely worth the price and time put into it.\n\nEven if you buy this game for nothing else, you should definitely buy it for its catchy soundtrack. I beat this game over six months ago and I'm still singing these tunes.\n\nFor those who don't know how this game works, you are a man who is tired of the constant partying that you've heard throughout the night, and instead of calling the police, you decide to take it into your own hands and start slaying at the party. Literally. Your objective: kill every single person at the party without getting busted by the police. You are given many tools and environmental traps to get it done. Hide the bodies, or leave them out for the cops to find, the choice is yours.\n\nThe Steam version has a feature that is not yet (as of writing this) available to other versions, which is Twitch chat integration. This allows your own Twitch community to help and hinder you as you play. Maybe they'll fumigate a room for you. Maybe they'll send in a killer bear.

Poisoning the drinks, breaking the oven, knocking down trees, setting fire to the loudspeakers or outright stabbing people. But you can't just go on a rampage in the middle of the dance floor because you'll be quickly overwhelmed by the party goers. You have to be smart about it, try to utilise the enviroment to cause a panic or pick off lonely targets snuggling in some bedroom. Hell, once people start dropping from that poison you poured in the drinks maybe theyll blame some random unlucky dude and the police will take care of him for you.\n\nThere's a lot to do and you'll need to think fast because people are constantly on the move and one wrong move can lead to an arrest or getting your ♥♥♥ kicked by the bouncers.\n\nIt takes around 10-15 minutes to beat a level but you're practically guaranteed to be restarting each one a few times until you get the feel for it (or just manage not to screw up).\n\nThe game keeps things fresh by randomising some elements of each party like the traps or certain rooms. To top it off there are random events happening now and again where a bunch of bikers may crash your party to kick someones ♥♥♥. Another time the feds might get a wind of you and start patrolling the party, or a dancing bear might show up to bust some moves on the dance floor.\n\nThere are two problems with it though.

Poisoning the drinks, breaking the oven, knocking down trees, setting fire to the loudspeakers or outright stabbing people. But you can't just go on a rampage in the middle of the dance floor because you'll be quickly overwhelmed by the party goers. You have to be smart about it, try to utilise the enviroment to cause a panic or pick off lonely targets snuggling in some bedroom. Hell, once people start dropping from that poison you poured in the drinks maybe theyll blame some random unlucky dude and the police will take care of him for you.\n\nThere's a lot to do and you'll need to think fast because people are constantly on the move and one wrong move can lead to an arrest or getting your ♥♥♥ kicked by the bouncers.\n\nIt takes around 10-15 minutes to beat a level but you're practically guaranteed to be restarting each one a few times until you get the feel for it (or just manage not to screw up).\n\nThe game keeps things fresh by randomising some elements of each party like the traps or certain rooms. To top it off there are random events happening now and again where a bunch of bikers may crash your party to kick someones ♥♥♥. Another time the feds might get a wind of you and start patrolling the party, or a dancing bear might show up to bust some moves on the dance floor.\n\nThere are two problems with it though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coaldust-numbers/recommended/356570/","coaldust-numbers","Coaldust","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coaldust-numbers/","235 products in account","I bought Party HARD for Halloween and thoroughly enjoyed it, but it's definitely not for everyone.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe premise and gameplay of Party HARD is chock full of dark humor.  Remember Mortal Kombat back when it was satisfied with being silly (punching people two stories, people exploding and having dozens of hearts and stomachs fall out, dropping arcade machines on people, etc.) instead of serious?  It's like that.\n\nWhile it uses pixel art, it's not because the developers can't draw and won't hire someone that can, as is often the case.  It's actually good.  Each party is uniquely themed, and there is a lot of variety in how partygoers look.\n\nThe music is memorable, and I liked it.  I think the voice acting was pretty good for it to have been done by one person.\n\nMost of the time the AI behavior is surprisingly good, and amusing.  Individuals choose between fight or flight based on the number of partygoers around them, and their behavior.  Paniced characters will often wrongly accuse others, usually the one nearest the body when they spot it (as it should be).  Large numbers of frightened partiers will often move together like a herd.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe funny setup is squandered on a serious generic slasher flick plot.  The cinema scenes clash badly with the gameplay.  They should have gone with something more fitting, like the poor guy moving after killing his noisy neighbors, only to keep having the same thing happen time and time again.\n\nAnother thing that clashes with the humor is the surprisingly high difficulty.  I find laughing and feeling frustrated to be mutually exclusive.\n\nFor the most part, the levels are badly designed.  It's easy to blame this on procedural generation, but procedural generation can generate well designed levels (e.g. the original X-COM).  It's just harder to program.\n\nThe real culprits behind the bad level design:\nhigh population density\nlack of cover\nlack of variety\nWhile it makes sense for some parties to be packed, not all of them should be.  Anyone familiar with stealth games should understand why this is a problem, but it interacts with several other problems to make things much worse.  By itself, the excessive number of enemies on each level primarily inflates play time, without adding any enjoyment to the game.\n\nYou can't save in the middle of a level.  Due to the glut of enemies on each level, if you do get caught, you may have lost a half hour or more of progress.  This is the primary cause of the excessive difficulty.\n\nWith so many eyes on you there better be lots of places to hide, pick of stragglers, and dispose of bodies…  Well, there aren't.\n\nThe ninja was a great idea for a character with a very different play style.  Unfortunately, due to there being eyes everywhere, placed arbitrarily at the start of the level, and little or no cover, he is almost impossible to play.  It's not unusual to be spotted as soon as the level starts.\n\nYour character is poorly equipped to deal with the overpopulation problem.  You can dance (and risk getting beaten almost to death) or use freshly killed bodies to scatter partiers, but this is repetitive, and provides poor control over victim movement.\n\nYou might expect an unabashed murder simulator to provide you with many items you can use to dispatch victims in creative ways.  Prepare to be disappointed.  On most levels you're going to be stuck with the variation on a knife (knife, sword, or chainsaw) your character starts with.  On some levels you may find a knife with a slightly longer reach (i.e. a sword) if you don't already start with one.  The lack of ranged attacks feels especially strange.  The only remaining items that can be used for killing are (time) bombs and poison.  The rest (extra clothes, running sneakers, smoke grenade, and stun bomb) just make your job slightly easier.  Everything except the sword is limited use, and there is usually only one item per level, which makes some items, like the extra clothes, almost worthless.  The ninja can slowly regenerate smoke bombs, at least.\n\nThere is considerably more variety in ‘traps’.  I use the term traps loosely, because I lack a good word for “object or feature that can become dangerous in the right circumstances”.  Each level will start with quite a few.  Sadly, there still aren't enough to keep the game feeling fresh.  About midway through the game you will have seen all the traps there are.  It doesn't help that most traps are single-use (forcing you to rely on your much more boring knife most of the time), and many have the same effect (namely exploding after a short delay).  The traps could have been made so much more interesting by allowing you to place or move some of them, and set up chain reactions.\n\nContinuing with the theme of lack of variety, its a good thing I enjoyed the music, since there's so little of it.  The same tracks get used for party after party.\n\nI mentioned that most of the time the AI behavior is good.  Well, the rest of the time it is very bad.  The worst problem is when a body is found and someone calls the cops, you are frequently known to be the murderer even if you were never spotted, and the police automatically know where you are and are impossible to hide from.  The police also move faster than you, so are usually impossible to get away from.  Less serious problems include silly behavior like the drug dealer calling the cops, and the firemen, handyman, and medics not caring about you killing people in front of them.\n\nDespite having the graphics and sound options PC users expect, there is no way to remap the keys.\n\nThere are bugs unlocking the characters (specifically The Butcher) and achievements (most of them).  They seem to only work if you perform the task in the expected way (see Youtube videos), instead of merely meeting the requirement.","November 17, 2015","true","19.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Party Hard is basically a mixed twist of features, both good and bad. There is also a story, of sorts, which throws a few surprises your way which have no impact on the gameplay, other than to provide a shaky narrative to connect different mass murders with each other. Overall, it's a fun diversion for a few hours, but despite the replayability factors, it's not polished, memorable or a game I'd expect myself returning to at a later date.\n\nTHE POSITIVE:\n\n+ The game can be challenging despite it's simple appearance and gameplay.\n+ The game will definitely keep you on your toes on your initial playthrough due to the amount of unexpected random events and occurences.\n+ Easy to understand core mechanics and get into the game after the initial tutorial level.\n+ Despite the seemingly simple premise of letting yourself loose upon an unsuspecting crowd, the game does take some tact and planning to complete most of the levels, barring the fortunate accident in which all the random resources scattered about the map provide enough coverage to wipe out all the party-goers.\n+ Level Editor for player made content, providing more bang for the buck.\n+ Apparently Twitch compatibility, but I am not an user so I can't really say much about that.\n\nThe Negative:\n\n- Basically, the AI is a dunce. As some have already mentioned, corpse pickups don't respond to player mayhem in any way and you can literally toss people off roofs or chuck them into barbeques or rotating steel fans without anyone so much as batting an eye. The parties will keep on going despite the player leaving a trail of bodies in their wake, and sometime the only response the player's actions elicit from the locals is 'Can't someone clean this up, this is killing my party buzz?'\n- The techno soundtrack might not be everybody's cup of tea. I personally found myself toning down the music since it got to be a nuisance in prolonged maps.\n- The player characters all run like they had lead weights on. This is to counteract the law enforcement game of tag the player faces if they happen to be caught redhanded in their wanton carnage. Basically, fleeing from the police is impossible, other than abusing the pathfinding by putting as many turns between yourself and the boys in blue as possible or taking one of the shortcuts in the maps, which brings me to the next item...\n- The shortcuts, for some miraculous reason are always expended if you're being chased by law enforcement officers while you take them. A Mario expy will pop out and hammer them out of commission, depriving you their use for the rest of the mission. Granted, this is more a nuisance rather than a real shot in the leg- if you're already doing horribly, you're liable to restart anyway.\n- At the time of playing, I encountered several bugs ranging from broken features to cosmetic glithes to a random slow-down.","April 8","false","3.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","3"

I'm still not sure.\nTL:DR - wait until it's in a bundle\n\nI played the first half of Party Hard's missions with great enthusiasm; the music was funky and the artwork engaging. Although the play time of each level seemed to stretch more than necessary - I put that down to lack of skill level. Once I picked it up again the next day, I was disappointed to find that the gameplay quickly became repetitive as the mechanics brutally punish risk. I found myself shying away from special items and resorting to walking back and forth between secluded spots to kill people. This is by far the dullest way to achieve the end result but at least it worked. It's quite the opposite of Hotline Miami's twitch reaction play style that some may be familiar with.\n\nOnce I decided I simply wanted to finish the main story and be done with it, I couldn't help but pick out other issues. The most grating is the narration between levels which I'm sure looked good on paper but seems to lower the professionalism of the entire title. That combined with the 'twist ending' is enough of a motivation to turn off the cutscenes altogether.\n\nOn the whole, I don't think this game is worth the £10 I paid for it. Even with the new levels, I don't imagine the core gameplay has improved. If anyone with more patience than I can advise me otherwise, please do so.","October 26, 2015","false","4.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

One such example of where things didn't seem to work as intended is where I was no where near any dead bodies and hadn't been seen killing anyone but for some reason got arrested.\n\nI feel that the body guards that are scattered around are irritating as hell as well and feel there needs to be a better way of getting rid of them. Certain levels lack interactivity in terms of traps and seem to rely on you somehow managing to off people one by one in other rooms or out of sight.\n\nI feel that a suspicion meter would make more sense in terms of whether or not theyaccuse you of being the killer (with someone seeing you stab someone filling it up, but someone seeing you next to a dead body as maybe a quarter of the bar, just as an example). This would also go down over time without suspicious acts so as to not penalise players for messing up early on but then doing really well towards the end.\n\nAlso, so far the two characters i've played have been exactly the same in every way except cosmetically. I feel it would be appropriate to add more characters and give them special abilities or traits, such as the main hero being able to change masks or something to reduce suspicion, maybe another character who's faster or has more stamina than the other characters and etc. etc.\n\nOverall, enjoying it but finding it rather frustrating when i'm getting arrested for stupid things such as being seen near an already discovered dead body.\n\nWill give 3/5, hoping that certain features get more polish and it becomes a lot less frustrating to play.","August 28, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Bad AI leaves more to random chance than to skill or prediction, and game is very difficult, requiring you to at one point kill over fifty people in a very small area.\nAlso, yeah.

This is the game you've been waiting for...\n\n\nPLOT:\nA man woke up at 3 : 00 am and starts a vengeful massacre on his neighborhood.\nThis carnage is the start of the deadly roadtrip around USA. Will you make the perfect Party Hard cleaning ?\n\nThe story is correct (still quite disturbing) and cutscenes with voice acting (not completly in tune) helps alot for the immersion.\n\n\nGRAPHICS:\nIt pixel art in the same spirit of "The Curious Expedition" or  "NOT A HERO" and "Hotline Miami".\nIt's cute and minize quite alot the violence of the game. There are many different models for characters and sprites for the many "accidental" takedowns.\nBut the game is in general quite "simplistic" with just average animations. Party Hard is still correct, some locations are a bit messy especially if you consider that you see levels from above and some walls hides bodies. Verifiying lines of sights or some obvious bugs such as the balconny in the first level, can be really annoying.\nCutscene are pictures in pixel art, not very detailed but still colorfull. Menus are nice, like on the USA map where each parties are represented by a poster.\n\n\nMUSIC:\nI was well surprised at first. I liked very much the first level. But the second and even the third were just correct.\nConsidering the fact that the music never changes, because you always stay on the same floor and it's a bit annoying (each maps is on ground floor contrary to Hotline Miami). It's a good soundtrack but we are far from the games named before.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nYou're a psychopath and you must kill everybody on each levels (some phone calls may bring new targets or new takedown like the exterminators). You can stab with you knife, lift bodies and hide them in containers. Activate devices throughout levels to create accidents and cause more chaos.\nBut be ware any bobies discovered will draw attention on you and the police may chase you.\nYou can still escape if you run out of their line of sight or use a special item such as spare clothes.\nKilling many people in short amount of time does combos. Each kills, accidents, body hidden, escapes, ect... gives point to increase your final score. You can also discover achievements and unlock new characters.\n\n\nCONTROLS:\nNothing special to say except for stamina that needs to be activated when idle to see its level. Very disturbing and confirm the impression that the psychopath we play is a patient in terminal phase unable to run more than 4 or 6 meters straight.... boring. You can't use much special items, for the moment i've only found some poison, clothes and the sword.\nThe sword is absolutly useless especially for a killer who loves knifes and kills in one hit.\n\n\n\n\nTO CONCLUDE:\nParty Hard is a nice little game, however even if there is fun to kill people and find new ways to increase your score or discover secrets characters... the game gets annoying quite quickly. Due to poor game mechanics and controls. You kill  often in the same way, take huge risks to speed up the level because in general the number of victims is important. And even accidental takedowns are the same from a level to another.\n\nWhen I saw Party Hard i though i would be like Hitman better in terms in variety for accidents... and i was wrong.\nYou have around 10 levels with a reasonable life span due to leaderboards.\nIt is still a nice game but must be played in short sessions.\n\n\n\n\nN.B: It would be cool to have more planning and more events during levels because for the moment it's still the same thing, find a location to dispose of bodies, wait one by one victims, "dispose" of them, continue until it's over...","October 13, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You accomplish this by your knife and evironmental interactions.  You also must hide the bodies so nobody gets wise of what you are doing.  The levels are also partially randomly generated and the behavior of the people at the party always differs.\n\nThe game LOOKS a lot like "Hotline Miami", but dont make the assumption it is the same type of game. This is a much more slow-paced game where you have to decide who to take out next. Picking the right victims and the best times and using all the resources available to you is key.\n\nThe game is really quite fun and well made. My only real gripes are some of the voice acting, dialogue in the cut-scenes, and while the music is catchy, it can get old, especially when the levels are 25 minutes long.

There is a story, pieces of which are revealed after each level's completion. Each level includes traps which can be set off to kill (make horses buck and kill passersby, make outhouses mysteriously tip over onto a sleeping victim, rig speakers to explode, etc). There are also devices you can use to kill, like stun bombs, smoke grenades, big ol' swords, and more.\n\nNew levels and characters have been added since the game's release. Plenty of cool achievements to try for, maps (including Vegas and Halloween party maps, among other intereting venues) to enjoy, and party-goers to kill.\n\nThe creator is very nice and can communicte with you via Twitter.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YoreIore/recommended/356570/","YoreIore","Azathoth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YoreIore/","300 products in account","A pretty fun game for what is a simple concept; kill everyone on screen.  Use environmental traps, hide bodies, outrun the cops and move around each level in full sight, but hidden.  It's a great concept and I think the graphics, music and simple controls really make it a fun experience.  At first I assumed it was similar to Hotline Miami ans in some minor ways it is, but it's certainly not as frantic and the real similarity is in visual style and music...not in gameplay.\n\nThe story isn't very interesting at all, but the gameplay is pretty much spot on and it's a very addictive and fun game.  It's rarely cheap and if you fail a level then it's usually due to some mistake you have made.  Most of the time this mistake is not taking your time and trying to kill someone at the wrong time. I was guilty of this often, though you want "just one more turn" until you get that satisfaction when you complete a level.\n\nThere's potential for replayability with the ability to use different characters, each having their own particular skill.  Unfortunately the repetitive gameplay means that going back to do it all again with other characters can seem a bit pointless.  Playing through the entire story is good enough and it doesn't really need 20 hours of content.\n\nAfter failure, the level is randomised.  This means you cannot learn the layout of a level and practice to perfect it.  This could be a bad thing for some players, but it actually adds to the challenge.  I never found the random levels I was given to be either too easy or too hard.  They are all challenging in their own way.\n\nParty Hard is a nice take on the stealth genre and is a nice change of pace.  There's perhaps not enough content to justify a full price purchase.  Get it on sale and you will have enough to entertain you for a dozen hours or so.  Nice gameplay, fitting music and enough of a challenge without being ridiculously frustrating.","December 17, 2015","true","13.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It’s a fun premise, but the game suffers from some shortcomings, chief among them how unclear many elements of the gameplay are.\nLength: 6-8 hours (Main game)\nGenre: Stealth / Action / Murder-Sim\nScore: 5.5/10\nReview Date: 2016-01-04\n\nFull Review: A friend of mine told me about a game where you play as a serial killer, and that was enough to sell me on it. Sadly, Party Hard wasn’t able to deliver on that as well as I’d hoped. (It didn’t help that I originally had it compared to Hotline Miami, which is a very different game).\n\nThe game offers very little in ways of tutorial or how mechanics work. As such, most of the gameplay must be determined via trial and error, and even after having completed the game, I still don’t know how some mechanics work. Mind you, trial and error isn’t per se a bad thing for a game, but Party Hard doesn’t implement it as well as it should. Please, allow me to elaborate.\n\nYou play as a man who just wants to get some sleep, and since a loud bunch of party goers are preventing that, you grab your knife and decide to kill everyone at the party. If you’re spotted, the police will be called, upon which they will arrive shortly to arrest you. You move much slower than cops do, so you can’t outrun them, save for if you take a secret passage to evade arrest.\n\nYou knife will be your main method of murder and mayhem, but you can (and must) also dispatch using various traps strewn about your environment; which range from poisoning food, setting a bear trap, lighting a room on fire, and rigging things to explode. That probably sounds like a lot of fun, but the execution wavers.\n\nThe traps scattered throughout a level, as well as the number of people and their behaviour, are semi-random. This is a two edged sword. On the one hand, it helps create more variety and replayability; on the other, for a game that makes you learn from your mistakes, this makes trial and error sometimes untenable, as things will not play out the same way on your next attempt, were you to fail the previous one. The game is oftentimes too unpredictable for its own good. While it’s fun when a cop decides to arrest a random civilian, or the party goers proceed to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of a random guest, it’s infuriating to spend 15 minutes in a level, only to have it ruined by a partier randomly beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.\n\nThis problem is further compounded by the fact that levels take a long time, and the gameplay is very slow. Again, neither things that are per se problems, but when you’re killed by something you couldn’t reasonably predict, it’s aggravating to have to redo a 20 minute level from the beginning. I understand that as a stealth game Party Hard isn’t going to play at a breakneck speed, but it would still be behooved to move a little faster, as even when sprinting, you’re character is still slow as hell.\n\nNot to mention that you exert almost no control over the behaviour of your intended victims, so you must wait for them to move near a trap, or to an isolated area, so that you can kill them without anyone else seeing you. Your influence extends no further than you dancing awkwardly, which will randomly either repel or attract people from you, sometimes both at once. The unpredictability and unreliability make it nigh useless most of the time. This is the key reason why levels take as long as they do, you must patiently play a long waiting game for the right opportunity to strike, lest someone calls in a 1-8-7.\n\nThe game uses a pixel art style of graphics, and while they do a passable job, they just don’t grip me much at all. On the bright side, the music is better, though ultimately not very memorable either; it’s at least enough to be entertaining at times while playing.\n\nThe game has a basic story about the protagonist murderer and the cop who tried to catch him, but it’s predictable and uninteresting, and features so-so voice acting.\n\nThe game will probably take in the neighborhood of 6-8 hours to complete. I pumped in about 8, but it should’ve been less, as I had a few levels that glitched out on me at the end, thus requiring me to replay the entire level again. (Specifically I killed all the victims, and even though my counter read it as 50/50, the victory animation didn’t trigger, and the game wouldn’t progress at all).\n\nThis all works together to hinder what could be a really great game, but instead is just an okay game; I hesitate to recommend the game, but I know it’ll have its niche audience that it’ll appeal to. Still, if you think you might be part of that audience, it might still be worth a shot, but I’d recommend waiting for a sale.","January 4","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You just sneak around and try to kill everyone at the party without getting caught.  Works great on my Alienware Alpha (i7) with Windows 10 on my 1080p TV, with my Xbox 360 controller.  It launches initially with a lower resolution that doesn't fill the scree, but then you just alter that in settings and now you are full screen at 1080.  It even uses AlienFX to control the color lights on the system :) .\n\nThe game is rather easy, but you get caught a lot.  I only found 2 levels to be particularly challenging.  Generally if you are just a little patient, you can get to everyone.  You can also dance (hold A on gamepad), which irritates people around you so you can get them to separate and then go kill them when they are alone.\n\nI find it a rather fun game that I keep wanting to come back and play the next level.  It has only ever crashed once when exiting the game and was returning to desktop anyway.  Also, when you adjust the volume in settings, the music volume stayed lower than usual until I restarted the game and was fine there after.  After 11.3 hours, I completed every level, only 1 crash total, and I really enjoyed it.","January 10","true","12.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The "Party Hard" name, the neon aesthetic, the mask-wearing slasher with a strange theme to his murders - everything fits so well that you'd almost expect to find this on the shelves of a run-down video rental shop in a dog-eared VHS box with rad over-the-top box art.\n\nThe core gameplay is stealth in a top down enviroment. You set off traps such as gumball machine bombs, giant speaker fires, electric dance floors, shark attacks, spooked zeebras, exterminator fumigations and use your quick knife to slash your way through the party. Witnesses will call the cops, who will one shot you in melee range, so run until they say something like "I'm too old for this ♥♥♥♥" and give up. If you hide the bodies (dumpsters, shredding vent fans, throwing them off the roof of the roof party) you may go unnoticed through entire levels. There are unlockable characters, achievements and mayhem all set to a cool dance music soundtrack.\n\nPros:\n+ Top-down Stealth Gameplay is rare and done well here\n+ 80's aesthetic\n+ Dance music soundtrack sounds great\n+ Choice and strategy in clearing levels\n+ Unique perspective character\n+ Some challenging situations\n+ Unlockable characters change the gameplay\n\nCons:\n- Story is barely there\n- Cinematics between levels are primitive\n- Voice acting isn't top tier\n- Short-ish\n- Not a lot of depth to mechanics, there are area effect traps and basic melee and that's it\n- Experienced a couple freezing NPCs and other bugs requiring level restarts\n- Some achievements require tedious, skilless, ridiculous grinding. Such as starting the game 100 times (I used a batch file from the forums to automate it) and dying 100 times (I had only died 20 or so times the entire game).\n\nParty Hard was 100%'ed for this review.\n\n8/10","February 23","true","13.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

One such example of where things didn't seem to work as intended is where I was no where near any dead bodies and hadn't been seen killing anyone but for some reason got arrested.\n\nI feel that the body guards that are scattered around are irritating as hell as well and feel there needs to be a better way of getting rid of them. Certain levels lack interactivity in terms of traps and seem to rely on you somehow managing to off people one by one in other rooms or out of sight.\n\nI feel that a suspicion meter would make more sense in terms of whether or not theyaccuse you of being the killer (with someone seeing you stab someone filling it up, but someone seeing you next to a dead body as maybe a quarter of the bar, just as an example). This would also go down over time without suspicious acts so as to not penalise players for messing up early on but then doing really well towards the end.\n\nAlso, so far the two characters i've played have been exactly the same in every way except cosmetically. I feel it would be appropriate to add more characters and give them special abilities or traits, such as the main hero being able to change masks or something to reduce suspicion, maybe another character who's faster or has more stamina than the other characters and etc. etc.\n\nOverall, enjoying it but finding it rather frustrating when i'm getting arrested for stupid things such as being seen near an already discovered dead body.\n\nWill give 3/5, hoping that certain features get more polish and it becomes a lot less frustrating to play.","August 28, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the indie action/stealth game, Party Hard. Party Hard was released on August 25, 2015 by Publisher tinyBuild and was developed by Pinokl Games.\n\n(NOTE: This was a review from a game in my own Steam library, it was NOT provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/r3GpF9l3PD4\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nDid you enjoy Hotline Miami? Want to slow down the pace, but add more kills? What are you waiting for?\n\n4/5 Worth $10\n\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nThis game was awesome. I loved it entirely. The premise, the pixelized graphics (which I usually could care less about), the music, the gameplay. I was hooked from the beginning. I saw it and picked it up thinking, huh great story. Guy wants sleep, it's 3am and there is a party next door. So, you handle it exactly how you always wanted to handle it...efficiently. I died about 15 times in my first 30 minutes of playing until I started seeing the pattern and picking up exactly how to go about the room. Then, it all clicked. Even when a new level would start. Was this game training me to be a proper sociopath? Was I going to be capable of infiltrating large parties, and even public places, to chaos mayhem after all this? Is that voice actor finally going to just say "I'm Batman" already? Even knowing when to strike and avoid all eyes, then slowly stroll by the cops like nothing when they'd inevitably arrive to check things out become an art and a game to me. This...this is Party Hard. It's making me a better person, really. Won't you join me? It's a solid 4/5 and worth $10 easily. I feel like I stole it (small crime, relatively speaking) by getting it 50% off.\n\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","November 30, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A little remeniscent of Hotline Miami and the SNES Metal Gear games, the high contrast colors, thumping beats and constant euphoric injections gel very nicely to fuel you with adrenaline when you pull off successful sneaky combos.\n\nThe game is decently meaty with procedurally generated elements, unlockable characters with different playstyles and custom community maps provide some decent replayability. The story is over the top and predictable but this isn\'t a game which focuses on narrative. The mechanics are solid and provides a refreshing experience. While it shouldn\'t be a slow game, some patience and planning is required.\n\nOverall an enjoyable game that\'s easy to put down and pick up when you\'ve an hour to kill. Definitely play this with a controller and headphones with the bass up. A little tidbit that\'s nice is that the game also takes over your Alien FX lighting system for Alienware rigs to sync with the catchy soundtrack to create your very own mini disco.","June 1","true","20.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Every stage consists of one pixelated screen featuring a giant boat, biker party, disco setting and the like. Your mission is to murder everyone involved without being caught. Activating traps usually can be done while being in the vicinity of NPCs, however the act of murdering should be done without being seen, as all NPCs will call the police, which will arrest you, without you being able to actually do much about it, unless you are close to a window to jump through without the cop being able to follow you. As soon as you have been detected, the NPC in question runs faster than you are able to move around the screen and thus a restart is more often than not warranted.\nProblems?The premise of murdering partying neighbours is undoubtable funny, however the gameplay for me is too slow paced and not offering enough variation. The peak in the level’s difficulty is right when you started, since, as soon as you cleared a certain part of a level, you can freely murder everyone daring to walk into that area. Most confusing for me was that when the police was called due to your murderous actions, they merely stuff the bodies into bags and are on their marry way again. Future discovery of these body bags does not lead to any response. Thus you can easily murder everyone and just walk away without caring about future discovery, as long as you are not nearby while the body is seen. This leads to a quite boring mid to endgame, when about a third to half of the partying pixelated pornstars have been dealt with. With about half the screen cleared or at least a certain area of the map cleared, you just wait and slowly drag the targets one by one into that part and kill them. This is tedious, repetitive and quite frankly boring. But it still took me about seven to eight minutes after having essentially won the level, to achieve victory without facing any challenge whatsoever. I would love to see more interesting kill mechanics or possibilities of mass murder. Also, the movement speed of the player is sooo slow, even with the running shoe item, you feel sluggish. Overall, for my taste it takes too long to clear the level, with the stage getting actually easier and easier as you progress.\nWhat would rescue the game?The big thing would be to implement some kind of a panic mechanic, which would lead to the rest of the people fleeing from the party, ending the level prematurely after a certain amount of discovered bodies for example. In contrast, if the player would manage to secretly hide the bodies and avoid too much discovery, he would be able to kill more party guests and thus earning much more points, which incentivises more stealthy play.\nVERDICTAll in all, I currently cannot recommend Party Hard, as I feel it is too slow paced, bares much challenge and does not offer any interesting stealth possibilities. The Twitch integration is nice, however does not enough to spice up the game for the general crowd.","August 25, 2015","false","3.0"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","20","41","2","0"

It's "Hotline Miami" with a goofy detective noir storyline. The goal is straightforward and the retro looking pixelation fits. I can't complain about the difficulty because it scratches the keep-banging-one's-head-against-the-wall-futility itch that makes "Hotline Miami" so endearing.\n\nMy biggest complaint is not one of story but of game coding: the pathing mechanics for the computer. Your job is to murder the partygoers; patience and luck is required. I get that. The perception ability of guests (and especially police officers) is almost psychic at times, declaring my guilt to a murder that they were not witness to nor am I nearby as a suspect. Paired with the ultra linear level designs, the computer has a tendancy to wander into the same traps. Picking a spot near a body disposal area and killing the guests one by one isn't a challenge, it's a fetch quest. If the designers are willing to open levels up a bit (preferably by adding doors or removing obstacles), I will consider changing my views. Until then, prepare for a great deal of frustration above and beyond what is expected for the game.\n\nAlso, in a game about creative murder, why is the environment only selectably interactive? "Dead Rising" took the philosophy that everything is a weapon. Knock things off the wall, pick up small furniture, and especially allow more randomness into the available room options. With a limited supply of traps, the game feels like it's telling you to only have fun in a pre-approved way. I don't think that was the intent, but it came out as such.\n\nThe game isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. I simply can't give it a thumbs up at the current price point. Considering this developer gave the world "No Time to Explain", I'm disappointed. Pick it up on a deep sale price.","August 30, 2015","false","17.6"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","15","31","2","0"

Here's what I reckon so far (bearing in mind there's not much to it, two hours feels like enough to judge).\n\n1. It's kind of fun, in general. The standard business of picking folks off alone or in groups is enjoyable for a while. Not super enjoyable for very long, but it'll do for a bit.\n\n2. Elements of the map design are random and this isn't really a good thing. Have done maps that felt really sparse in terms of traps, or that had no food to poison and these can be a chore because you're basically just stabbing everybody. Also the problem with this randomness in a game where you're trying to set high scores is that your high score is going to depend on a good map spawn, which renders the scoring system moot.\n\n3. It's a bit too simple and a bit too random. Way back when I used to play a game called Skool Daze on the Spectrum about being a prankster in a school, and it feels about that kind of level of sophistication. And that was about twenty five years ago. Feels like more could have been done in terms of interacting with the crowd or reading their behaviour. Not asking for realism, just more elements to play with.\n\n4. The traps are often a bit rubbish. You can have loads of fun with poison, especially when people start to blame each other for it, but the others vary between being amazing bordering on overpowered and just being a slightly more cumbersome alternative to a stab. Doing things like blowing up a methlab ought to have more to it.\n\n5. Graphics aren't great. And yes I know Pixel Art is a style, it's not about that. The style is fine, it's just not implemented very well. There is no visual indicator for how far people can see, you have to guess a lot of the time which walls, such as they are, can be seen through, or what height things are at, if they are even at a different height. The indicators for when you've got the cops after you and for when somebody has seen something and blamed another person for it, they work well, but there could be more.\n\nAll things considered, it's not offensively bad, it's not hellish, it's not like I've come out of playing it going THIS SUCKS, but it's not Hotline Miami, it's not Postal, it's not even Skool Daze. Some people are going to embrace this game and love it and squeeze it and call it George. If you think you might be one of those people, take a punt on it. Might get lucky and love it. For everybody else, probably not worth the time, and probably only worth the money in a sale.","August 25, 2015","false","2.0"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zreese/recommended/356570/","zreese","zreese","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zreese/","1207 products in account","Summary: Party Hard is a wonderful premise marred by quality issues.\n\nParty Hard has a solid elevator pitch: "an 80s slasher movie where you play as the killer." That game practically makes itself. Tongue-in-cheek, stealth mechanics, appeals to anyone who was a teenage boy at some point. I was a teenage boy at one point. I still can watch a Friday the 13th movie if I stumble across it while flipping through channels at 1AM. Not even one of the good Friday the 13th movies, either. One of the high-numbered sequels, the ones that became inexplicably paranormal.\n\nThe game is as follows: you control a mask-wearing man with a knife and travel from party to party across the United States killing all participants. You do this by stalking them in a single screen, cut-away view of the party. You press a button and stab a person, then pick up their body and hide it somewhere. That's essentially the whole game, which is okay, because this game is an 80s slasher movie where you play as the killer.\n\nThere are a few issues with execution. There is no visual indicator for detection. Many, many times I thought I was totally hidden but someone on the other side of the party had a red exclamation point pop up.\n\nThere's no complex logic behind any given level. You just wait for people to separate from the pack, then you find a way to kill them. It can sometimes take a long time.\n\nAnd in that long time, all you can do is wait. This is not so much a simulation of a party as it is a presentation of a party. There is no cause-and-effect. The party-goers seem undeterred by a police officer putting six people in body bags. They dance, they wander, while the police man walks back to his car. During a party at a ranch, an Oldsmobile races uncontrollably through the patio. A waiter offers a tray of drinks to the new ruby red smear on the grass. He didn't even blink.\n\nThat's the biggest problem with Party Hard: no one really does anything.There are no routines, no unexpected behaviors, not a fleck of individuality among these party-goers beyond being having varying appearances. The party-goers seem to have three states: dancing, wandering, and standing around idly. They mostly stand around idly. Sometimes little pink word bubbles pop up. But no one ever has a conversation. Just little one-shots, like "OMG!" or "YEAH!" It's as if every participant showed up to the party without knowing anyone else there.\n\nThere are other, smaller issues. Things that don't contribute to an overall good impression. Like the music volume control. I set the music to zero because it looped after about thirty seconds and drove me crazy. But when the music was set to zero, the voice-over in the interstitial cut-scenes didn't play. It's not a huge thing. It's not a game breaking bug. But it is the sort of problem that would be easily (easily!) reproduced and fixed during testing. To me, this indicates either one of two things: the developers did not do very thorough testing to the point where they didn't try playing the game with the music off, or they were aware of the issue but didn't consider it worth fixing before launch. Neither one of those is a good scenario.\n\nIt all adds up. The in-game tutorial tells you that smoke grenades can be used for cover, but doesn't tell you how to use them. If busted by a cop, you have to wait to be carried back to the squad car -- in real time -- before the big GTA inspired "BUSTED!" takes over the screen. It's sloppy. The sort of stuff that you'd iron out immediately in a polish pass.\n\nI am legitimately disappointed. Party Hard suffers from an extreme lack in attention to detail. This doesn't feel like a finished game. It feels like a rough draft. I am hoping that it will improve with time through post-release patches and updates. As of now, I feel like I would rather have my ten dollars back.","August 29, 2015","false","4.2"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","0"

In some cases, I was even able to knife people without recourse (The party DJ specifically was nailed while playing music, and no one cared).\n\nCan't tell if the voice acting was terrible on purpose, or just terrible.

The game's graphics are quite decent, if not for the out-of-place characters. I would be able to get past that, if it wasn't for the broken English - if we could even call it English, at that point. "WITH SWORD YOU CAN MAKE CLEAVE ATTACKS" Can anyone make sense of that for me? I tried - it induced way too much cringe for me. Anyway. So, since the tutorials/hints aren't exactly helpful, as they're either extremely obvious, or... That... The gameplay MUST be pretty simple and forgivi- Nope, guards that aggro on you for no reason, civilians that mark you as the killer for no appearant reason, and MANY bugs. Including one that was pretty gamebreaking, since a dead body was literally attached to my character. How that happened, I have no idea, unless you'd count "This game wasn't tested" as one. I've encountered that bug 10 times in ~5 hours. It clearly wasn't tested. Either that, or I'm unlucky. Whichever. The soundtrack was pretty good, though, that much I'll admit. I'll also admit that the story was pretty interesting, despite its cheese. However, as I was unable to finish the game due to how broken it can be, I don't think I'll be seeing the conclusion anytime soon. Oh, well.\n\n+Soundtrack\n+Story\n+Art style\n-Many frustrating bugs\n-Engrish\n-Artificial "intelligence"\n\nSo, in MY opinion, this game is a definite pass.

The stealth system in the game ranges from good to completely random.  I played through and still have no idea why the police would be alerted to me. The basic idea is to kill people who are isolated and then give yourself some distance so that when the bodies are found you are not in the area. This is O'Kay but 50% of the time I will be across the map doing absolutely nothing and they will still pin me as the killer. When this happens you're basically dead because your character moves so slow unless you plan ahead and give yourself distance from the police it's impossible to escape. Basically the way it works is the police chase timer starts off low and then goes up either time they are alerted to you. This leads to a frustrating and slightly boring playthrough. The traps are cool and make things a little more interesting.\n\nDo I recommend it? Not really.

So lets list them shall we?\n\n-There are certain enemys that will attack you and knock you to the ground with little warning and leave you lying there for a while, and sometimes the police then show up and decide to arrest you while you are lying on the ground, because the game is programed to do that if the player has been knocked down by NPC's, which normaly only happens if the player openly stabs people in a crowd. But they will still knock the player down later into the level if there are bodys around, EVEN IF THEY DID NOT SEE YOU KILL THEM\n\n-Most of the time NPCs have a very small field of view while other times they will have magic eagle eyesight and see you stab somebody from across the map\n\n-You do not have attack priority, meaning you need to stab an attacking npc by predicting where they will move, this would be okay exept as mentioned before they often attack you with no reason very suddenly and you have no way to counter this\n\n-The random level design can be very annoying because often the traps will be placed in areas the crowd never goes to\n\n-Npcs will always know it was you that killed someone, even if it would be impossible to gain that knowledge from what they saw (such as if a body is in a room with 4 people looking away then they know somehow you are the killer)\n\n-Cops will instantly arrest you if you are the first person they see getting out of their transport, even if you are nowhere near the reported body\n\n-the sword is mostly useless because this game does not reward killing NPCs quickly\n\n-There is no bound button to activate the ninjas power you need to wait, which will result in your detection 90% of the time\n\n-in the endgeme there are FBI agent enemies that cannot be killed by stabbing, you need to kill them only with traps, also they will attack you for no reson and be able to chase you infinitely, and they show up even if you do not kill any cops\n\n-paramedics activate traps when they pass by them and cannot be killed\n\nSo that covers it, this game could have been much better then it was but I can still recomend the soudtrack\n\n","January 26","false","5.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Nothing really changes from level to level other than different level layouts and having a few new trap effects.  Things actually get really tedious once you're used up all the traps and gimmicks on the level, and there's nothing more you can do but wait for people to slowly move off somewhere alone.  I get it was meant to be simple, but having to gradually hack down 30-40 people while waiting for police and medics to come and go every time quickly becomes more annoying than fun, particularlly if you fail towards the very end of a level and have to start all over.\n\nI'd suggest you watch a Youtube video of the gameplay first and decide if it's something you'd be okay doing over and over again.","May 29","false","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Hope to see more put into this concept from this dev. Multi part traps. More involved puzzles to access upgrades or traps. or multi part triggers. Traps that need you kill the bouncer for a part. This game needs a better defined sight line when an NPC can see you. Or color codes on floors to tell you if the sight line is the same. Very good games with lots of possibilities. Better defined what is body disposal and what's a trap. More maps are needed. It looks like there is room for adding this stuff to the game. Lets hope they finish it.\nI'm no longer listing games on a 1-10 scale. I will be listing them to what the games buy point is. When this game is worth taking a risk on. Some is going to be date limited.  Now that the prices of games have jumped to double in some cases. With half the content only to be sold to us later. Making it 4 times the price. So I think this is a more telling number of where this fits into todays market. In my opinion this is the price point that this game in it's present state is worth to me. I will also put a potential price point for what this games finished potential is. I think this works for new and old games tripple A and indie.

For example, aside from maybe a shark washing up on the boat and eating someone, it isn't meaninfully different from the house party. Most of the gameplay can be summed up as: poisoning the punch bowl, dragging bodies in front of some object rigged to explode, and stabbing lone partiers with a knife. There are exceptions of course, but the aforementioned methods of killing people will constitute your main arsenol.\n\nThis game could have been really great if there was just more variety.

It wants to be clever, making you think you are a sly killer in a crowd, but it still falls back on the old tropes of "stay away from this type of enemy or you will die immediately." Also, the RNG as far as spawns and items go make it incredibly frustrating at times. It makes it more of a rush to kill as many people as you can and hope you get lucky rather than strategically planning out every move, especially in the later levels. It tries so hard to be unique, yet the generic elements are still there to hold it back somewhat.\n\nRegardless, the theme, soundtrack, visuals, and little nuances here and there make it an exceptional game.\n\nAlso, I hate people that interrupt my sleep, so this speaks to me on a spiritual level.","August 26, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Murder your neighbors because they won't stop partying? Count me in!\n\nOnly, the game is practically unplayable.\n\nIt's SUPER hard in a terrible way. There's not enough traps on a given level to take everyone out, so you're going to have to stab a fair number of them. This involves waiting for them to wander away from the other people until there is DEFINITELY no line of sight, because that's a very hard thing to tell, stab them, and either hide the body or get out of the room before someone else wanders in, which is very likely because there's a reason your victim wandered over there in the first place. Inevitably there's always two or three that just won't separate, and so you have to try and stab them all before the cops come. Except, while everyone else can run forever, you are apparently horribly obese and can only run for two seconds. So no, you won't catch up with them before they get to the phone, and of course the cops show up immediately no delay.\n\nAnd there is no difficulty setting. And you can't save during a level, so no save scumming. My latest death (I'm at number 15 or so, and have only made it past level 2) involved me thinking something was a timed trap because literally every other trap so far had been so, only it wasn't and so I electrocuted a musician in front of everybody. Which means that I have to start the whole level over again. Nevermind. I get a better win rate out of solitaire.\n\nIf you like pointless exercises in dying, and hate fun, you'd probably like this game. Otherwise, stay away.","February 23","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For example, aside from maybe a shark washing up on the boat and eating someone, it isn't meaninfully different from the house party. Most of the gameplay can be summed up as: poisoning the punch bowl, dragging bodies in front of some object rigged to explode, and stabbing lone partiers with a knife. There are exceptions of course, but the aforementioned methods of killing people will constitute your main arsenol.\n\nThis game could have been really great if there was just more variety. Adding maybe more weapons or mechanics for the player to use would make this game significantly more interest. Sadly, every level begins to blur into one.","September 5, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Lack of inventive traps\nPros:\nFun and captivating. lots of replay value.\nSimplistic mindless puzzle and sneak game.\nVery captivating right off the bat. Hope to see more put into this concept from this dev. Multi part traps. More involved puzzles to access upgrades or traps. or multi part triggers. Traps that need you kill the bouncer for a part. This game needs a better defined sight line when an NPC can see you. Or color codes on floors to tell you if the sight line is the same. Very good games with lots of possibilities. Better defined what is body disposal and what's a trap. More maps are needed. It looks like there is room for adding this stuff to the game. Lets hope they finish it.\nI'm no longer listing games on a 1-10 scale. I will be listing them to what the games buy point is. When this game is worth taking a risk on. Some is going to be date limited.  Now that the prices of games have jumped to double in some cases. With half the content only to be sold to us later. Making it 4 times the price. So I think this is a more telling number of where this fits into todays market. In my opinion this is the price point that this game in it's present state is worth to me. I will also put a potential price point for what this games finished potential is. I think this works for new and old games tripple A and indie. I'd like more people to adopt this in personal reviews but not in comercial or profeccinal reviews.

Your mission is simply to kill everyone at a party, or rather at party after party. Just that - without being spotted and caught by the cops or the bouncers. You can stab people, poison them or use the environment and traps to maim them. All in beautifull 8bit style graphics, and with a pumping soundtrack with 80's beats.\n\nIt's a short game (2-5 hours depending on how fast you clear the dozen or so parties), but replayability is guaranteed as you unlock additional characters with different abilities after each playthrough. With those you have to find new strategies to solve each map (eg. the first alternative character may carry bodies without raising suspicion but can't use traps).\n\nIt's  well worth it's money even when not discounted.

Your mission is simply to kill everyone at a party, or rather at party after party. Just that - without being spotted and caught by the cops or the bouncers. You can stab people, poison them or use the environment and traps to maim them. All in beautifull 8bit style graphics, and with a pumping soundtrack with 80's beats.\n\nIt's a short game (2-5 hours depending on how fast you clear the dozen or so parties), but replayability is guaranteed as you unlock additional characters with different abilities after each playthrough. With those you have to find new strategies to solve each map (eg. the first alternative character may carry bodies without raising suspicion but can't use traps).\n\nIt's  well worth it's money even when not discounted.

I thought "Hey, someone is ripping off some graphics from old PSX Metal Gear Solid."  I'm glad I had this thought because I was introduced to the most hilarious, satisfying, and dark experience I've ever had with a video game.  From psuhing people into fire pits to lacing the party punch with poison, Party Hard will keep you busy as you try and reclaim some peace and quiet from your disrespectful neighbors.  If you have bad neighbors, you need to get this game and vent your frustrations into a healthy outlet.  Play PARTY HARD and put each and every one of them six feet under with the hipsters.  The developers really took this dark concept and made it into a wholesome game that the entire family will love.","August 28, 2015","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It wants to be clever, making you think you are a sly killer in a crowd, but it still falls back on the old tropes of "stay away from this type of enemy or you will die immediately." Also, the RNG as far as spawns and items go make it incredibly frustrating at times. It makes it more of a rush to kill as many people as you can and hope you get lucky rather than strategically planning out every move, especially in the later levels. It tries so hard to be unique, yet the generic elements are still there to hold it back somewhat.\n\nRegardless, the theme, soundtrack, visuals, and little nuances here and there make it an exceptional game.\n\nAlso, I hate people that interrupt my sleep, so this speaks to me on a spiritual level.","August 26, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Murder your neighbors because they won't stop partying? Count me in!\n\nOnly, the game is practically unplayable.\n\nIt's SUPER hard in a terrible way. There's not enough traps on a given level to take everyone out, so you're going to have to stab a fair number of them. This involves waiting for them to wander away from the other people until there is DEFINITELY no line of sight, because that's a very hard thing to tell, stab them, and either hide the body or get out of the room before someone else wanders in, which is very likely because there's a reason your victim wandered over there in the first place. Inevitably there's always two or three that just won't separate, and so you have to try and stab them all before the cops come. Except, while everyone else can run forever, you are apparently horribly obese and can only run for two seconds. So no, you won't catch up with them before they get to the phone, and of course the cops show up immediately no delay.\n\nAnd there is no difficulty setting. And you can't save during a level, so no save scumming. My latest death (I'm at number 15 or so, and have only made it past level 2) involved me thinking something was a timed trap because literally every other trap so far had been so, only it wasn't and so I electrocuted a musician in front of everybody. Which means that I have to start the whole level over again. Nevermind. I get a better win rate out of solitaire.\n\nIf you like pointless exercises in dying, and hate fun, you'd probably like this game. Otherwise, stay away.","February 23","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrickMcSlabHouse/recommended/356570/","BrickMcSlabHouse","Viktor Vasko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrickMcSlabHouse/","297 products in account","Party hard is another great title to add to your steam library. Party hard is a game centered around stealthing through different parties killing everyone in them by any means necessary. With that said this is harder than it sounds with a lot of planning and thought needed behind every move because the police can be called on you and each time they are called back they are harder to avoid than the previous time. So you must use any means you can to take each party goer out one at a time whether that be by stabbing them, poison, or even calling in the swat to essentially do the work for you. Almost every time you play you will have a different experience with each party being randomly generated you might have an item in one go but die and fail and then have a seperate item. Or maybe there is a punch bowl and then the next time there isn't. Those are just some examples. The game itself has a very funny and comedic atmosphere lying under the murderous rage of your character who just wants to get some sleep. The game itself is narrated by an investagator who was on the party hard case tracking the main character down as he ruthlessly slaughtered his way through party after party. The game itself is somewhat of a rinse and repeat experience with generally no switch up in gameplay until the last level, in which you play as a different character who honestly just sucks. So overall the game is great fun but maybe wait for a sale if you can as the $12.89 pricetag is a little steep for the amount of content. However if you don't mind the price I would highly suggest nabbing the game up and playing it through it's well worth the time. 8/10 Great fun. If you would like to see some gameplay here is a link. I almost forgot to mention the excellent soundtrack to the whole game. If you enjoy hotline miamis fast paced techno rave style of music you will more than likely fall in love with this games soundtrack like I did it's certainly one to remember.\nhttps://youtu.be/XkdrjPNhe4Q","September 17, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

In Party Hard, you play as someone who is really tired of the neighbors having loud parties. Instead of calling the police, you decide it’s a better idea to kill everyone – using your faithful knife and the environment. The tactical strategy follows a series of killings at parties through-ought the USA.\n\nThe developers used to work mostly on casual, family-friendly games - until they participated in a game jam, creating the first prototype for Party Hard. TinyBuild backed up the original developers – Pinokl Games – to create a full version that’s coming to Steam on August 25th.\n\nParty Hard has semi-procedural environments and focus on unique ways of killing people. In the greatest traditions of sneaking games, your main goal is not to get caught, while silently picking off unsuspecting victims one by one. Dancing and blending in during a suspicious situation is key.  - Highly Recommended!","September 23, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

You can walk right into the middle of a drug deal, pick up the... poison..? being traded and walk off with no reaction from anyone (even the armed gaurds you just waltzed past). Going back to stealth, though; It's not even a viable option, unless you'd like to wait hours on end for 50+ AI to randomly wander into your particular zone. Alone, that is. Environment hardly reacts at all in terms of gameplay when they happen upon any dead bodies. As long as they dont see you do it, you're fine. They just call the police, bag the bodies, and leave them to rot without even stopping the party. Also, if the police see you, you can't react at all. You just sit there and take it while they knock you out and arrest you.\n\nMore or less a novelty item. The gameplay is one of those things were as soon as you start to understand it and realize how shallow it is, you really have no motivation to play.\n\n(If you watch the clip in the update announcement for the level editor, thats just about the same reaction to that sort of chaos as the AI gives in game as long as they dont see you actively stabbing someone)","May 5","false","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's the same mechanics and traps in almost every stage, just different stage settings and music. I found it way too easy to beat as it was less than a strategy or a stealth game. My tatics sorely relied on timing than anything else, along with luck that the NPC moves away from other people from time to time. Story was a nice touch, but it's inevitably hopeless when gameplay is hindered.\n\nFurthermore, I did not see the random generated people or stage setting as mentioned at the Gamecom preview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM9xV9QaOsw (starts at 4:41). In the first stage, I see a methlab in one, and then when the player restarts stage one, there's a weed den. But in this final and released copy, the setting of each stage stays the same, regardless of how many times I re-enter the stage. Where is the randomly generated stage setting? It's a minor details, but it was one I was looking forward to as this game still lacks "variety."\n\nI was hoping for "endless, randomly generated" game play, in the same way great games like Spelunky or Rogue Legacy.

There are things about this game that I really enjoy, and both my girlfriend and I have had a lot of fun playing it.\n\nHowever I have to be honest in reviewing it, and in being honest I have to say that I cannot recommend this game.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt is basically broken as a game.\n\nNo, I haven't experienced any game breaking bugs, but instead, the core game mechanic is entirely flawed because it is simply pot luck in the later levels.\n\nBy the subway level you are faced with a party of 44-46 people, with 2 bodyguards who will attack you on sight without provocation, and then after any number of kills, 2 secret agents will show up. These guys break the game. They are faster than you, nearly impossible to kill and will also attack without provocation.\n\nHowever, if by some miracle you beat them, or they don't show up, the game decides that that isn't good enough and will just have a random party guest attack you without warning. No anger bar, nothing. Just simply kick you to the ground and you are dead.\n\nI have no problem with a game being difficult, providing it is fair and can be beaten with skill and practise. But this game is hard because it is poorly finished.

It also has partially procedurally generated levels in that the items used for killing can vary each time you restart a level.\n\nSo far, all I've sung were praises. However, this game is far from perfect and the developer should fix these things right away.\n\n1. I can clearly see that the variable weapons/traps in earlier levels are well thought out and polished. However, as the levels go on, the levels become clearly more linear in that the items are the same in each restart. This is not necessarily a problem for all players but as Party Hard favors stealth (biding your time) over a quick massacre, a lack of variables equates to less playability for some. (Especially since there are only 4 characters)\n\n2. A slightly bigger problem, but not necessarily game breaking. In appropriate animations at certain points. People sleeping standing up after dropping them from carrying them. Carrying people without using any hands at all. People floating across the map without initiating the walking animation. All aesthetic stuff since I still had a good time up to this point.\n\n3. Here's the game breaking bug: upon finishing the game and starting as the newly unlocked character, I was unable to bury bodies or interact with traps. Which is vital to completing the game. And since I never (SPOILER) used the 3rd character in the first playthrough, I was wanting to unlock him by completing the second playthrough. Unfortunately, being unable to do anything else other than stab and run, will make that impossible. Trust me, I could not have gone through all the levels on the first playthrough by relying only on my knife and my terrible cardio. (The character in game runs as well as a morbidly obese being).\n\nThat being said, I do recommend the game because I felt that it was worth $9.92. But for those looking for a game with good replayability, I suggest watching a few gameplay videos and read a few more reviews before making a final decision because I personally do not think the game is worth any more than $9.92.","August 26, 2015","true","7.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The story is incredibly weak and the dialogue is cringe-worthy nearly all the time. Thankfully, this takes up only a tiny bit of the time you spend playing this game. And the game will suck you in, as each murder party is really a sort of puzzle - some of which take a few tries to figure out, while others are quite easy. The difficulty jumps up and down, rather than ramping up each level, but finishing a puzzle is generally rewarding and failure feels mostly fair.\n\nIt's a weird game. The story is awful beyond belief, predictable, and involves murdering hundreds of innocent party-goers. But it does have interesting mechanics and good puzzle design, that makes me want to recommend it. Unfortunately, the story giving the context that you are basically murdering innocent people makes the game less fun and the story, again, is so, so poorly written that I'm going to mention how bad it is again. So, no recommendation from me.","August 26, 2015","false","8.0"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

Overall the game is challenging, but usually fun.  All the traps and their resulting  aftermath is fun to work with and the NPCs reactions are gold. There are a fair amount of levels and the layout of the levels is randomized everytime you exit to the main menu or get busted, so if you like a particular setup you can restart until you get it.\n\nI would love to see a brief five minute tutorial where all the rules, effects of items, and NPCs to watch out for are explicitly laid out because with a tutorial the game would be less trial and error.  You never know what an item/NPC/trap/whatever is going to do until you try it and more than once I've tried it and been busted then and there.

Alternative game name was include "How to Hide a Body Simulator".  The pixel graphic-style reminded me of an old Atari game, Keystone Kapers, mixed with a tactical stealth game like Metal Gear Solid\n\n~Excellent Soundtrack\n~12 levels, most will take somewhere from 5-20 minutes to complete from start to finish\n~4 characters, 3 of which have different abilities/mechanics that force you to approach things differently\n~Levels have some degree of randomness, its enough to be noticed, but not enough to drastically change the level\n\nWhile the game has only been out for about a week, the Devs have continued addressing concerns.  Just today they commented on adding new content (for free) starting Monday.  Pretty awesome, if you ask me.  Some of the achievements seem a little buggy as of launch, but again, the Devs are looking more into that.\n\nOverall, I feel like I got a great value from this game, but I can understand those that decide to wait until it goes on sale.  Depending on your skill level, you could easily complete your first play-through in an afternoon, or you could get frustrated on the Miami Beach level... just saying.","August 29, 2015","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your a nut job going from one party to the next trying to kill everyone unseen.  Harder then it sounds since each stage is packed with crowds of several dozen people that you have to widdle down a little at a time. if someone spots you killing someone or even near a body that hasn't been discovred then the cops will show up and try to arrest you.  your only defense in these situations are one of the levels enviromental traps (provided you haven't used them to thin  the herd) or failing that you have to pray you can run away long enough for the police to give up and leave.  Unlikely since you move at a snails pace and can only sprint for a couple of seconds and the cops always home in on your position.  It makes for a fun game of cat and mouse...if the mouse was also trying to kill other mice and get away with it.\n\nThe game is alot of fun but there is some strange logic you have to wrap your head around that the game doesn't do a good job explaining to you.  Like you can throw someone off a building or push them into a bonfire and no one will bat an eye but if you poisend the food and someone happens to be in the same area as you when they finally drop dead then everyone will instantly know it was you.  Also it seems kind of random when bouncers will come after you.  sometimes you can walk past them and they won't do anything other times they'll try to come after you even if they spot you outside a window.  Its strange but you eventually get the hang of how the game thinks. until then things can seem a bit too random.\n\nAlso i'm not a huge fan of the script.  The characters talk like there in a bad max payne spin off or somthing.  I think the game would have been better if they had done somthing like hotline miami or just had no story beyond "a party is keeping awake. kill everyone" instead it tries to be an edgey crime drama writtne like a Sin City comic.  Thankfully the story is limited to cut scenes that play after you complete a mission so it never interupts the gameplay its self and i will admit i liked the twist ending.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this game.  I was a big fan of games like Tenchu back in the day and this game scratches that itch Nicely.  It only took me about 5 hours to beat the story but theres some unlockable content and the randomization of the crowd, traps, and events mean that the game has a decent amount of replayablity.\n\nIf you like easy to pick up stealth games or just want to feel like a masked killer stalking a bunch of college kids then this isn't a bad choice, especially for the price.","January 26","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, this game is for sure a novelty/niche game in my view. I played it in a group setting as we passed the controller around from level to level. The game has so many fun eliments and the struggle is real when you mow down 65 people only to get busted with 1 last kill remaining.\n\nMy primary complaint, however, is that the payoff seemed to deminish as the game went along. We had committed to beating the game and did over the course of a few days, but what had started as me having a freakin'blast ended with me saying,"F*CK YOU FBI! F*CK YOU SECURITY GUARDS!

You can kill them with your knife and with traps. Since there are always different traps and different people each time you start a level, the levels are never the same. So if you play the one and the same level the difficulty varies depending on the items you get, the number of bouncers in the level (who will bust you if you are not careful) and the number and sort of traps you get.\n\nStabbing people is pretty straight forward, of course you have to be sure that no one sees you or your knife is faster than their legs.\nThere are many sorts of traps, like poisoning the food, making a horse kick people to death, burning ppl in a stove, etc. If you kill ppl with a trap it will be considered as accident and not murderer even if you push them off a roof (Oh my, that wasn't on purpose). Only exception is poisoning if a poisoned person dies near you, you will be considered the murderer, though this can happen to other NPCs as well. Ppl standing near dead ppl are always considered murderer, even if they didn't do anything (like in real life).\nIn the levels you can different item. Their use vary. You can have spare clothes so you can change your appearance if you were seen red handed, so the police won't recognize you. With a smoke grenade you can kill people within the smoke without being seen. There is a katana to chop humans in little pieces.\nAnd there are events. like a sharknado when sharks are raining on the party and start to eat the party people. Sometimes there are dancing bears going wild and looking for tasty young teens. You can make phone calls and different things happen, like fast food delivery so the party guests come out of the VIP section, Bikers appear and beat the crap out of everyone, etc.\nThe time a level takes depends on the way you are playing. If you don't want to be seen and hide every corpse you produce, it can take quite some time to beat a level, like 30 minutes, depending if the party guest are going in a lone corner or stay on the dance floor. If you use traps and kill 2-3 people in a row it takes about half the time. Normal gameplay is somewhere in between.\nOh, and in the game while carrying dead people is a no go, carrying drunk people is considered pretty normal (maybe the developer thinks for some people this is the only way to to literally pick someone up), so you can drag them to a dark and lonely place to introduce your knife to them. ^__^\n\nIf you are looking for a nice little game in which you can kill people in various and sometimes funny ways and like to play for short times, I can really recommend this game!","September 1, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept is fun, but isn't anything revolutionary. This game has the most unrealistic AI I've ever seen, which can be seen as both a good thing and a bad thing. I'd like to rename this game "You'd think at some point..." because that's what you'll be yelling at the game the entire time you're playing.\n\n"You'd think at some point they'd cancel a party after 30 people have died."\n"You'd think at some point they'd catch on to a guy awkwardly running around with a Jason mask."\n"You'd think at some point the cops would just stick around after being called for the tenth time."\n\nWhile I believe the game is worth getting, the game doesn't require as much stealth as it would have you believe. The people have pretty narrow cones of vision, and if you outrun the cops you are immune to getting arrested until they leave the scene completely. You can hide the bodies you kill so that the cops aren't called, but as long nobody saw you actually kill the person you'll never get in trouble. Just some things to keep in mind if you are looking for a good stealth game instead of a silly diversion.

It's pretty, but shallow.\n\nLong:\nGame's got a fun aesthetic, doesn't rush you, gives you a lot to take in, the music isn't awful, and is paced with the idea that you'd plot out the largest and most interesting kills each semi-random level can offer. But off paper it quickly becomes repetitive and slow, and you start just cherry-picking stray guests that happen to wander near body-hiding spots. Mass kills don't feel hugely rewarding once you've played a level once or twice already, and while there are plenty of Easter eggs, they don't detract from the shallow mechanics. Each level is ultimately the same.\n\nBut that isn't even why I can't recommend the game: it has got to have the worst scripting and voice acting of any game I've ever played. I don't  know who their writer/voice actors were, but it's wincing. I've never been embarrassed to be watching a cut-scene before, but this game managed it.","December 22, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You never know what an item/NPC/trap/whatever is going to do until you try it and more than once I've tried it and been busted then and there.  There are some newspapers lying around that you can read for tips but they don't go into the finer points of the game.

You can have spare clothes so you can change your appearance if you were seen red handed, so the police won't recognize you. With a smoke grenade you can kill people within the smoke without being seen. There is a katana to chop humans in little pieces.\nAnd there are events. like a sharknado when sharks are raining on the party and start to eat the party people. Sometimes there are dancing bears going wild and looking for tasty young teens. You can make phone calls and different things happen, like fast food delivery so the party guests come out of the VIP section, Bikers appear and beat the crap out of everyone, etc.\nThe time a level takes depends on the way you are playing. If you don't want to be seen and hide every corpse you produce, it can take quite some time to beat a level, like 30 minutes, depending if the party guest are going in a lone corner or stay on the dance floor. If you use traps and kill 2-3 people in a row it takes about half the time. Normal gameplay is somewhere in between.\nOh, and in the game while carrying dead people is a no go, carrying drunk people is considered pretty normal (maybe the developer thinks for some people this is the only way to to literally pick someone up), so you can drag them to a dark and lonely place to introduce your knife to them. ^__^\n\nIf you are looking for a nice little game in which you can kill people in various and sometimes funny ways and like to play for short times, I can really recommend this game!","September 1, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is simple yet sometimes tricky at the same time. The game as a whole is pretty easy but very additive. It is a good game to replay since not every level is the same. The map sometimes changes if you get caught or just want to retry it. so you might not be able to use the same tricks that you used that time on that level. Not only that but you can also unlock characters. New characters mean you can do certain things to make the game harder or easier for you. So you get to go on different murder rampages! The AI can get a little weird though. Sometimes the bouncers would bother you and other times they won't even if you are seen. Then the changing outfits infront of the cops. For some reason the cops suddenly forget you are the killer even if you change righ in front of them. I can't really complain about that though. It has saved my skin a few times. I just wished the game was longer. I went through it fast even though I knew it was not going to be all that long. However, i can not say I was disappointed. The story was pretty interesting even though I did not care about it at first. Either way, the game is great. Different versions of levels, unlockable characters, creative ways to kill 50+ people. It is worth the money. More people should give this game a try because not many games allow you to party hard. It's just a fun dark humor game.","September 1, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your character walks at a speed slightly faster than civilian NPC's, can run, but runs out of breath half-way through a reasonably-sized room, and the levels are big enough to notice the slowness of it all. One could argue that it encourages a methodical approach, but in reality, once you find a quiet corner, all you do is press E when someone comes.\nThe other difference is that violence is not as visceral: most bodies stay intact, regardless of the cause of death, and they don't bleed that much.\n\nEvery level contains environmental traps, which allow you to kill about 50-60% of the population, and then it's back to stabbing walkers in a corner. The traps are nice to use, it's a pity there's so little of them on the map. Also, they are randomly generated within the level at every other retry (so, for example, a bike and a horse will swap places, or a music column won't load, etc.), so there is no streamlining a run to perfection over and over, you have to come up with the plan on the go. Considering the aforementioned slow pace and the scarcity of traps overall, this is a drawback for the game.\n\nThere is a story. It's presented between the missions and it has some "Eh" levels of voice acting, but there's nothing mind-blowing or worth mentioning about it. It's just there.\n\nThe tutorialising was done poorly (2 tips you've already understood which are given every now and then), the difficulty curve is all over the place, some menus are questionable, and the music is REALLY LOUD even at the lowest setting.\n\nAll in all, fun while it lasts, but nothing to write home about.","September 3, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some very challenging levels, and sometimes I found myself having to restart a level so many times that I ended up hating the level's song temporarily, but none of the levels are impossible to beat. The bonus characters you unlock make the game even more interesting, though I do have to say that I dislike the character you unlock halfway through the game just because their abilities were a hassle to deal with.\n\nOverall, I think that this game is worth buying, and I haven't played anything similar to it recently so it may well be the only game of its kind in your library. The game is surprisingly gorgeous despite being made up of pixel art, and I did like the music used in a lot of the levels. I also appreciated that the levels were randomised-- that is, the layout of a level would be the same no matter how many times you died or restarted, but the positions of the victims, bouncers, and traps would be different every time. I also really liked the fact that there were "bonus" levels included after the main story line, but they're really weird and I'm not sure why the setting of these levels is the way it is... but it doesn't take away from the game so I can go with it.","February 29","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When the game was included as part of a sale, I snagged it and I have not regretted my decision. Party Hard is a great time killer (no murder puns intended). You play the role of a guy who's so sleep deprived that he's finally snapped and decides that the best solution for putting an end to his noisy neighbor's 3:00 AM party is simply to murder everyone! You've got the basic knife for quick stabbing, you've got a wide array of traps and items you can use to deal with the partygoers, places to dispose of bodies to avoid anyone becoming alarmed...etc. The interesting thing is, that no two playthorughs of any level are the same. There are small changes that occur regularly everytime you play a level such as bear traps, randomly appearing zombie hordes, a shady guy who offers you various illicet goods such as bombs, poison, a sword, etcetera. So get down and party hard!\n\nThe only thing I would change for this game is the option of a profanity filter but that's negligable.","October 16, 2015","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found myself playing it far longer than I planed. With unlockable characters and over 10 levels to play, there's plenty to do. The NPC's say funny things, the animations are great, and the music is very catchy (even though it will get repetitive when trying to clear a level for 20 minutes). The graphics are a breath of fresh air in the over used 8-bit style. My only (and very small) gripe is the voice acting of the story cutscenes. It's pure trash. Which is a shame, because the animations and pictures durring cutscenses are great! I would have much rathered them leave the spoken words as text only - it's already subtitled. Thankfully they only last about a minute or two.\n\nI highly recomend this game, if for at least, a time killer.","January 3","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play a serial killer who runs through parties across the country with the goal of offing everyone present, anywhere from 30-70 people or potentially even more during certain levels with special conditions, in pre-generated levels utilizing soft randomization of certain elements such as trap layout, item availability and head count.\n\nKilling is easy, as simple as walking up to somebody and pressing the stab key, or setting one of the many traps available throughout the levels.  Getting away with it is the tricky part.  If someone sees a body, they're quick to call the cops and, unfortunately, our hero hasn't done nearly as much cardio as the party-goers and there's little chance chasing down anyone running away from you...or chasing you.  Not to worry though, cops do little to disrupt these parties and will do little more than bag bodies...unless you're seen with a corpse, in which case they'll chase you for longer and longer periods as they become called on more and more.  You can fight them off, of course, though it proves difficult.  Cops, and most special temporary NPCs like paramedics and the Mario-like construction worker, are immune to stabbings (and the non-threatening NPCS to traps as well) so your only hope is to either outrun them (typically with help of special escape routes which teleport you to a different part of the map they cannot follow through and, if you should use one while being chased will call in the aforementioned worker to barricade them) or to lure them into a trap.  Both can prove difficult without pre-planning as cops can easily outrun you and the vast majority of traps are very limited in use.  Manage to off two of them and the Feds show up to scour the map for you, and chances are you won't be coming away so easily from them.\n\nThus the game, whilst bearing a resemblence in graphical fidelity, era of style, acid-like trips, music and ultraviolence to the Hotline: Miami games, tends to require a more patient, methodical approach than the high-speed twitch action of those titles.  However, like the second Hotline: Miami, you may unlock characters with wildly different abilities for added replay value, such as a stealth character who throws smoke grenades, hides against walls and has a sword strike which can kill multiple victims at once, though alerts anybody who sees him to call the cops, or a woman who kicks people unconcious before stabbing them, allowing you to safely drag victims away from prying eyes, albeit at the cost of precious time.\n\nAlso like Hotline: Miami, there's a story to tie all the violence together, but rather than the mysterious, almost noir approach of the former, Party Hard leaves little to the imagination.  Between levels we're offered cutscenes of a police officer who followed the case being interviewed.  The recording is nearly as mediocre as the dialogue, unfortunately, and the plot twists are as cliche as they are shallow, with the writer often attempting to hide their obviousness with nonsensical wordplay.  It's the worst sort of cheese, the kind that takes itself a bit too seriously, though fortunately cutscenes can be skipped to throw you right into the next level.\n\nUltimately, Party Hard is a fun game which doesn't overstay its welcome.  Very simple with enough level layouts, traps and random events to keep you on your toes, though any longer and it might have been a slog.  It's a good game to turn your mind off to and just have a little fun, but don't expect anything more than that.","October 20, 2015","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In short: the pixel style is very nicely done, fits the game well and is very detailed. The story is interesting, you want to sleep to you kill every single person at a party with your stabbing knive.\n\npros\n- Nice style, very detailed\n- Music is fun and catchy\n- Game is not overly easy\n- The levels are not always the same\n\ncons\n- Music can get repetative if you take long to finish a level\n- Sometimes things ingame happen that do not make sense at all\n\nTo elaborate on things not making sense: the level is not always the same. If you get caught or die it spawns other objects, other traps. Which is fine, it adds to the difficulty and does not allow you to make a strategy by just playing a level a lot. However other things do not always have the same outcome, for instance party guests can get paranoid, and when they are overly paranoid they will kick your ♥♥♥ if you are not careful, however sometimes this killed me but other times it just stunned me. Also, escaping from the police, sometimes i have to run 2 paces and he gives up other times i have to run 16 circles. While I like the fact that the level changes in what things it spawns, these type of events should be a little bit more predictable.\n\nThe game is challenging some levels took me about 4-5 tries but overall i finished the main game in about 4 hours. There are some bonus levels though you can play after that. However i do not think i want to replay any levels because it takes usually a while to finish it and that is satisfying, doing it another time will not have the same effect probably.\n\nI do recommend the game. Even though it took just 4 hours (excluding the bonus levels which will also take a bit probably) i had a lot of fun with it. Hopefully they will add more content at some point or DLC.","October 24, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is less a test of skill and more a test of patience. Enjoyable and addicting none-the-less. The complexity of each scenario is pretty well paced as I never felt overwelmed on any particular level however I did feel quite stressed through each stage. Only one wall-/collision-glitch on the Halloween Party level, but nothing game-breaking due to where it is on the map. The story and voice actors are terrible, but if you're overly into that kind of montra while playing a pixelated serial killer then you may have more... "personal" issues that should probably take priority.\n\nAll-in-all I have never played anything quite to this exact flavor and enjoyed the new experience. If you're tired of playing rusted-out "tried-and-true" genres then I highly recommend you pick this game up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/recommended/356570/","muenzz","Love9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/","322 products in account","As a huge fan of Hotline Miami, i was both excited and sceptical going into this. Turned out the two games only thing both games really have in common is the theme "mass murder". You are a dude who just wants to sleep, but your neighbors are having a party and are way too loud. It's up to our anti-hero with mask and knife to not only go to the neighbours next door, but go on a complete rampage all across the US to stop 11 obnoxious loud parties. That's basically how the story goes.\n\nThe gameplay itself was pretty interesting to me. The goal of each stage is to murder every single person at the party. Doing so proves a little bit more difficult then expected, the places are crowded with people, most of the time close together, and lots of times these people don't hestitate to call the cops to investigate or worse, get you arrested. So what do you really do to kill everyone? Our beloved mass murderer isn't the fittest guy, being exhausted after a 2-3 second sprint, just enough to get out the scene or escape the cops (atleast for a short while, as the cops get more persistent). Besides sprinting, the main character is capable of killing, obviously, picking up sleeping person or corpses or setting up various traps around the stage.\n\nThe game encourages using the traps, as there are many different on each stage, each with different effects, may it be poisoning food, gumball machines which explode or a horse which kicks your victims to valhalla. But also multiple items are avaiable in the game, such as Smoke grenades, bombs or Spare clothes to escape the cops.\n\nStealth is a very important part of Party Hard aswell. You must be quick, efficient and not to  be seen while stabbing a person. Hiding bodies in trashcans or other various places is also an option to not get found out about your rampage.\n\nThe level design can be a bit frustrating at parts (especially that damn Miami Party), but overall i liked it. There are multiple 'variations' for each map, meaning that some traps are in other locations, switched with others completely, etc. Every time you start the map new (or get busted/die) you get a different variaton. I enjoyed this system quite well, as all the maps and every playthrough felt familiar, but still different. Also the music in this game is just great.\n\nOnly thing i could complain about is the price tag and the lenght. The game may be a bit difficult but can still be finished rather quickly, depending on your skill. Also the voice acting in the cutscense wasn't really my cup of tea.\n\nOtherwise i can recommend this game  alot. In the end it was pretty different to Hotline Miami. It's a way more calm killing spree, but that's what i really liked about it. I just hope there will be a second Party Hard aswell, as i think there are still much possibilities for this gameplay.","September 10, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept is fun, but isn't anything revolutionary. This game has the most unrealistic AI I've ever seen, which can be seen as both a good thing and a bad thing. I'd like to rename this game "You'd think at some point..." because that's what you'll be yelling at the game the entire time you're playing.\n\n"You'd think at some point they'd cancel a party after 30 people have died."\n"You'd think at some point they'd catch on to a guy awkwardly running around with a Jason mask."\n"You'd think at some point the cops would just stick around after being called for the tenth time."\n\nWhile I believe the game is worth getting, the game doesn't require as much stealth as it would have you believe. The people have pretty narrow cones of vision, and if you outrun the cops you are immune to getting arrested until they leave the scene completely. You can hide the bodies you kill so that the cops aren't called, but as long nobody saw you actually kill the person you'll never get in trouble. Just some things to keep in mind if you are looking for a good stealth game instead of a silly diversion. Worth the price, though.","December 5, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The thing about this game is it revolves around understanding the mechanics and patience. I am a big fan of stealth games so I loved Party Hard. It has cool mechanics, a nice story that you learn about between levels and it presents a real challenge. The game is nice because random events take place, but the more you play you understand how they are mostly not random. Someone saw you stab that guy? if something happens to them before they get the phone then you are fine, with more events like this. A note to the developer: While I know this is an indie game I did notice a few things that dont make sense, for example when you are discovered and they tell the cop as he is leaving he just gets in the car and you are fine, and on some levels you get discovered immediately with the ninja. I noticed that this is because events happen in the game as the loading screen is still there. I could move, get discovered and die in that time frame as the ninja depending on the level spawn.\nOther than that I give a 9/10 because  the game doesnt tell you all the controls\n\nIt took me roughly 10 hours for me to beat the main storyline.","January 2","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of calling noise control our 'hero' takes matters into his own hands and brutally murders everyone associated with the party.\n\nAfter a very brief opening level to explain the concept its straight into a set of large parties where the objective of the game is to murder everyone. Premise is simple, you can kill people by stabbing them. You must avoid being seen by other party goers or they will call the police who will arrest you and game over. If your seen near a dead body your guilt will be automatically assumed and the police called (even if it wasnt you). In each level you will find a limited number of traps and items like bombs that will take out a group of people at once usually without consequence.\n\nSounds simple, but it aint. This games takes a lot of patience and thought into successfully completing each level. Unless you get a head start in a chase the cops will always catch you. If you use a trap door or short cut to escape the police a handy man will come along and close it. Other threats could come along like the FBI but also some events that could help you. Prepare to restart over and over. And everytime you restart a level it will be slightly different to what it was in your previous playthrough to keep you on your toes.\n\nDespite it being highly frustrating I recommend this game. Everytime I failed I said to myself one more go, will nail this on the next run. Game is relatively short level wise but potential for new content and I would highly recommend in a sale.","September 8, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are...well, they aren't meant to be stellar, but it's easy to tell what everything is, and it works.\nI've seen people talking about the gameplay being repetitive, and I don't know about that. I guess it can be repetitive. This can be a pretty difficult game until you really get the hang of it. You'll most likely end up trying the same level 3+ times, but the game adjusts for this by randomizing a lot of the items and traps that are available to use. This helps make things a bit fresher, and allows for different approaches to the same level. Now, back to my original thought...is the game repetitive? Yes, but I felt like the gameplay was solid enough that I never felt myself getting annoyed by this.\nThis is kind of short, but well worth the money. I spent about 9 hours on a single play through, including the times I had to retry the same levels.\nThe story is interesting, but not exactly something that will keep you on the edge of your seat.\nThe tutorial should be reworked. It doesn't adequately introduce you to all the tools you have at your disposal. I didn't even know about the "listen" action until the final level, though I did fine without it. It's never explained what the point of dancing is, I had to experiment to figure out that it can be used to break up crowds of people that aren't moving.\n\nThe overall experience is very worthwhile, and definitely worth the price. Bear in mind that this is a game that relies heavily on strategy, stealth, and patience. If that doesn't appeal to you, you might want to steer clear. This game reminds me a lot of the Hitman franchise, with a focus on finding creative ways to dispatch your targets (which is everyone on the map). I'd give it an 8/10, based entirely on the amount of enjoyment I had playing it.","September 8, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You use different ways to kill everyone in the map- kill directly or use the traps. It's not that hard to find traps since they're all marked at the beginning but during the game, the maps looks pretty good and you always have lots ways of killing.\n\nA detective is telling his story to link all those levels- and apparently you are the psycho he's talking about who kills everyone on site without a reason. So kill everyone and survive from the cops is your goal. I found this game not so intriguing due to:\n\n1. You cannot save during one level.\n2. Lack of principle- sometimes people see you murder NPC they call the police, sometimes they just ignore you.\n3. You can't tell who's watching you who's not. A radar for NPC to display their sight is not rare in many games but this one missed it. You can't tell which direction a NPC is looking exactly or how long one could see. It lowers the fun since you hesitate when you have a good chance.\n4. You can't lure NPC to your traps. It's all about luck how many people you kill per trap, and when you run out of traps, killing is painful.\n\nGuys, try Hotline Miami.","December 25, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are traps which help lowers the numbers a bit... but they are mostly just things walk up to, interact with, then hope in the four seconds it takes to spring people are near so they die. Some traps are no better than just stabbing people.\n\nThe mechcanic for getting caught is wonky as well. Cops get called each dead body (and with 50+ people, that's a lot of police) if you don't hide them. But it's a waste of time hiding them though, the police just runs to the body, bags it, the leaves. So if you aren't between him and the found body, you get off scott free.\n\nControls a wonky and don't always work. Hitboxes seem off as well.\n\nOverall, very dissapointing. I do not understand the rave reviews. Even in the best light, it's bad attempt at a stealth game.","December 24, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It mixes stealth with awesome music!\n\nThe story is funny yet somewhat stupid, you basically are a guy who tries to sleep but at 3am you wake up to listen to your next door neighbours throwing a wild party, what do you do? You KILL them! The game does have story along the way, after completing a level, it will give you a mini cutscene with some story to fill you in\n\nBasically, the gameplay goes that you are the murderer and you have to try and kill every single party member by any means possible without getting caught by other party guests, the police or any other people. The gameplay is fun and challenging but it can get frustrating and hard  because of the unpredictability of the police and the other guests and that some guests won't do what you want, I wish that the developers would make it slightly easier for us few gamers that don't like very hard games, but, probably they won't...\n\nThe music and visuals are really nice to listen to and to look at\n\nOverall the game is fun to play and the developers constantly update the game to feature new levels and new ways to kill your party guests and there is also a twitch.tv integration in which if you broadcast to your twitch channel, the viewers can decide who crashes the party next and so on. The only flaw to Party Hard is its unpredictability and hard difficulty but overall its a fun game to KILL time!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","November 15, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If memory serves you get almost double points for stabing someone than you do for setting a trap. You also get more for evading cops than you do for hiding bodies.\nMusic, it's not bad I can listen to that genre of music, but it only has a few songs for levels and they get old pretty quickly, suggest turning sound off and playing your own.","December 20, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Party Hard isn't a bad game overall but it has pretty much no playable variety, even when you reach the last stages or unlock new characters it doesn't really feel like you are going anywhere in terms of gameplay, the whole game is what u saw in the first map, straight up. Story video makes no sense for me in this game in particular, it just serves the pretentious purpose of give a context to our actions and tell us the sub story of a detective... i don't really care, i mean, wich are the real implications of that guy in the game? none, don't tell me such things in clips between the levels just show me ingame wtf, that's a terrible decision from my perspective, and by the way, that kind of noir-film ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t conversations displayed in the clips got no logical tie with the colorfull aspect ingame (even being about killing people) it just can not be taken seriously. On the other hand i really enjoyed the classic pixel art of the game, appreciate some of the cool sprites etc. Most of the levels are fun don't get me wrong it just seems like a really early and plain idea with some senseless clips to me.

It has a multitude of levels to play as well as some bonus levels and the workshop which lets you play other people's levels. With the base levels you get about 6 or so hours worth of playtime though each person might struggle with different levels, miami beach for example, I beat it on my third attempt in about 13 minutes but i've heard some people saying they were stuck on it for an hour and a half.\n\nI had an issue with my PC which made me lose all my data on my hard drive and when I got back up and running I installed Party Hard to find that I had lost my progress ( I was finished the final stage and about to start the bonus stages.) But I kept all my unlocked characters so I got to experience the story a second time in about 2 days it was still fun.\n\nThere are unlockable character's, The guy trying to get some sleep, The cop, the ninja, Katie and the butcher, each character plays differently i.e. the cop can carry bodies without suspicion but can't use traps.\n\nNot many games compel me to finish entirely and get all achievement's but this one was definitely good enough to make me do it, Toward the end of the game I already had a good 10 or so achievements out of the 26 I believe and that was with me only trying to get one (the 20 kills combo to unlock the butcher) the others came naturally though the game.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty great though It did start to get a bit repetitive towards the end of missions considering it's a pretty small loop but it's not too bad.\n\nI may start to try get all the cards so I can finish the badge next and i'll basically have done all I can with this game.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to any one who enjoys Hotline Miami or even Hitman and it's definitely worth the price though if you aren't sure if you'll get what you paid for then wait till the sales and buy it then but I guarantee it'll be worth it!","April 19","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your goal is to silence the party next door by killing everyone there without getting noticed, busted and killed yourself. But this won't be the only party you visit as you continue your party killing spree across the USA.\n\nYes, the plot sounds unnecessarily cruel (it's not like you do all the murders for a good purpose) but to be also brutally honest: "Party Hard" is so entertaining.\nHowever, don't imagine yourself running through the crowds swinging your knife. It's about stealth and patience, the right moments and the right places. Cops, guards and the FBI are your worst enemies if you don't pay enough attention.\nAside from that you can use traps and tools that help you, mostly with killing people.\n\nHow is the gameplay?\nThe gameplay is fine, at least for me. I've always played with the keyboard but it's also possible to use a controller.\nThe degree of difficulty is very okay here. It took me a while but I almost never saw the game as too unfair or too hard. So I guess it's also suitable for beginners.\nUnfortunately - also with version 1.12 - there are a few small bugs that can be in the way of your actions. But with version 1.12 (by the beginning of March 2016) it at least got a bit better and more playable.\n\nThe graphics, as I mentioned, are in a retro style, looking like an 8 bit game. It's done very fine and beautifully. There are funny designs and animations all over the place.\n\nThe soundtrack is so cool as well as the few sounds you get to hear in the game (the silly voices of the party goers for example).\n\nThere are achievements, some extremely easy, others again quite challenging.\nSpeaking of additional goodies: Prepare for a row of unlocked bonus levels as soon as you finish the last level.\n\nI recommend this game hard. It's a lot of fun, full of cool ideas and designs. I also enjoyed playing it after work very much.","March 19","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perhaps, you want to ♥♥♥♥ of animal to slaughter the guest, maybe turn on a car to mow down what's left. There are many ways to kill in this game, and while I wish there were more traps per level, I can see how the game could get too easy.

When I started playing Party Hard I immediately thought of Hotline Miami where you are a slasher who has to strategically set up the moves that you are going to make to reach your end goal which is to kill everybody in a 2 mile radius. The differences between the games are that with Hotline Miami you can get frustrated and just go on a murder spree and you will win but with Party Hard they will call the cops who will then arrest you and cause you to start all over again. Some of the problems I have with Party  Hard is that since it uses a board game like view it is hard to tell where you are in between the 60 other people. Also when somebody calls the police on you it's really hard to kill them before they get to the phone because they will run to phone and you are stuck with a slow walk or a fast walk at the most. That's really all I have against it so if you like games like Hotline Miami then you will really enjoy this game.","March 22","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is nothing but stabbing, poisoning, burning, running over and throwing people to sharks, yes it's pixalated but the story clearly states that you're a psychopath killing people because they party.\n\nGetting over to the review part: This is a fun and challenging game with a simple premise, don't get caught killing the party people. The story starts of with a man that as far as you know, simply snapped when he couldn't get to sleep because of the party next door, after that he takes his killing spree on the road. Every level you start with a party, a set amout of people (which can change during the level, after all people arrive at parties at different times) and different traps to help you reduce the amout of people at the party. If someone sees you killing another they will of course run for the phone and call the cops, which leaves you with the task, run until the cop realizes he's "to old for this". It's easy to learn but requires thinking to understand each level and which traps to use at what time. The twitch support is really fun. The chat can add more party guests, or something to help the player with at times, which usually results in more and more people, making it much harder for streamers than casual gamers. The game have nice graphics and a great soundtrack. The loading times are short which is really appreciated when it's a game you tend to fail a bit in. In the end it still felt a bit short, with not too much variation. But I still had a great time with this and I highly recommend this! 8.0/10","March 20","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember seeing a let's play of this and thought it looked really fun. Well, it is!\n\nFirstly, the music is incredible. It reminds me a lot of the music in hotline miami 1 & 2. The visuals are pixel-y, but in a good way. The cut scenes and story are interesting and gives nothing away, which really drew me into this game even more.\n\nThe gameplay is straight forward and doesn't overload you with a bunch of controls. It's more about knowing what to do and when, seizing an opportunity, that kind of thing. You can play however you like as well. You could be the dude hiding in the bushes waiting for people to stray away from the crowd or you could go wild and start knifing people left and right before throwing on some new clothes to throw the cops off the trail. Tons of traps, body disposal, and random events to give this game a lot of replay value.\n\nThere's also something morbidly cathartic about murdering people for the sake of getting some peace and quiet. Also, the sweet music that plays when you beat the level is nice too.\n","October 15, 2015","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DepressedCubone/recommended/356570/","DepressedCubone","✗{PK}✗ Depressed Cubone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DepressedCubone/","63 products in account","Party Hard  is a topdown classic 'clear all enemies' game with a different and interesting mechanic. First of all if you have played Hotline Miami 1 or 2, then you may go into this game thinking that it is very similar. It is not.  Party Hard  is actually more reminiscent of the original Metal Gear games, while still having SOME feel of Hotline Miami. The main objective of  Party Hard  is to eliminate all enemies in the stage without getting killed or arrested. The trick is, that if a party member sees anything suspicious, like dead corpses and you stabbing people, then they will likely attempt to call the cops. If you are not seen committing the crime, then the cops will NOT come after you. If you have handcuffs over you, then the cops are onto you and you must try to evade them to continue your mission. Upon completion of each level, a little story is told to the player of a police officer who was investigating the 'Party Hard' killer(you). Each level gets harder and harder, as well as includes a multitude of items, traps, and anything else you can think of.\n\nParty Hard  is another instant steam classic and a must have, all though not much content, it is very enjoyable and actually quite a challenge. It also nails the soundtrack department, having possibly some of the best tracks of 2015. The graphics mimic the simple style of old SNES games, which is always a plus for me, at least.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nGameplay(75%): 9/10\nStory(15%): 8/10\nSoundtrack(7.5%) 10/10\nGraphics(2.5%) 9/10\n\nPARTY HARD\n\n94/100","March 5","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The thing about this game is it revolves around understanding the mechanics and patience. I am a big fan of stealth games so I loved Party Hard. It has cool mechanics, a nice story that you learn about between levels and it presents a real challenge. The game is nice because random events take place, but the more you play you understand how they are mostly not random. Someone saw you stab that guy? if something happens to them before they get the phone then you are fine, with more events like this. A note to the developer: While I know this is an indie game I did notice a few things that dont make sense, for example when you are discovered and they tell the cop as he is leaving he just gets in the car and you are fine, and on some levels you get discovered immediately with the ninja. I noticed that this is because events happen in the game as the loading screen is still there. I could move, get discovered and die in that time frame as the ninja depending on the level spawn.\nOther than that I give a 9/10 because  the game doesnt tell you all the controls\n\nIt took me roughly 10 hours for me to beat the main storyline.","January 2","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The NPC's say funny things, the animations are great, and the music is very catchy (even though it will get repetitive when trying to clear a level for 20 minutes). The graphics are a breath of fresh air in the over used 8-bit style. My only (and very small) gripe is the voice acting of the story cutscenes. It's pure trash. Which is a shame, because the animations and pictures durring cutscenses are great! I would have much rathered them leave the spoken words as text only - it's already subtitled.

Its actually a very basic stealth game with elements of Watch_Dogs, to a small point. That is, you set off traps to kill as much, hide bodies and sneak around while trying to blend in. Some funny elements like setting off cars to run people over, setting off fires to blow up a room full of people while you exit, throwing people over the boat to the sharks and such.  You avoid being seen by the crowds by picking off isolated people (or large groups via traps), discarding bodies in sewers, over the boat and trash dumpsters. The police are a factor and are called when dead bodies are seen and if you were spotted you need to run from them...RIP and get some rest.","November 13, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReginaldThered/recommended/356570/","ReginaldThered","Razi the Red (WAR)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReginaldThered/","111 products in account","Skip to the bottom for TL;DR\n\nOn paper and indeed in the desciption- this seems like a cheesey, but entertaining premise for a game.\n\nYour character is a bitter and tired individual looking to take out his rage and frustration on those keeping him awake while simultaneously not getting killed/arrested- an idea that seems very cathartic and was enough to make me want to give the game a spin.\n\nThe tutorial is a brief mission comprising of 4 or 5 individuals laid out in a way to THEORETICALLY teach you all you'll need to know throughout the game, but it only teaches you how to stab people and introduces you to the fact that environmental interactivity will be a thing in this game.\n\nThe next mission proceeds to inject you into a party of FORTY SEVEN people. Not only does that up the ante significantly, but this is our first introduction to more/different contextual environment kill options that we don't know the ramifications of screwing with.\n\nI.e; if I poison this food do people die on the spot? Do they walk around choking? Will they not know they're poisoned until they suddenly drop dead?\n\nSimultaneously; how will people react to finding dead bodies? The only level I've played thus far is laid out in a way that I can't determine this.\n\nIf the police are called on me; how do I get away? Can I resist arrest?\n\nIf I use this phone, who do I call? (I got two different results- some weird bulky guy and an exterminator team with no way of distinguishing which would show up)\n\nI've noticed from having to restart various levels that some rooms/areas in certain levels are randomized and the things within them are as well meaning that you can't bank on a certain item being in the same place if you fail at any point (this isn't necessarily bad, but it's a bit unexpected that I wasn't prepared for)\n\nIn my mind this is Party Hard's biggest failing: it gives us way too much way too soon and doesn't explain enough before letting us go crazy at bigger parties.\n\nCalling the police, fire department, weird Russian guy, etc will cause them to suddenly rush into a level, run over eight people standing out front, rush into the party to do whatever it is they're there to do, run back to their cars, book it, and run over four more.\n\nWhile it does make my job easier it creates a solid disconnect from the story of some detective guy recounting the investigation of the "Party Hard Killings" (or "Killer", can't remember off the top of my head) when his coworkers are responsible for near as many deaths in the course of my rampage.\n\nOn a final note; human life has little-to-no meaning to anyone in this game. Five dead people on the dancefloor? PANIC! CALL THE COPS! PANIC A LITTLE LONGER! Oh the bodies are in bags now? Back to dancing right on top of them!\n\nThere's no reward for being extremely cautious besides not having the cops called directly on you while simultaneously there's no risk for just leaving a body where it falls because if someone does call the police about it the cop that comes to investigate will just bag it before taking off again and leaving it there.\n\nAll this combined just ends up with Party Hard not being fun.\n\nIt attempts to make us believe there's a level of depth that just ultimately doesn't exist because once we've sabotaged the stove, burnt down the bedroom, knocked two trees through the windows, stabbed some guy at his computer, shoved a guy into a fire, poisoned six people, stabbed three in the bathrooms, and shoved four more into freezers, garbage bins, and manholes- there's still twenty more people to be killed and I'm fresh out of novelty/environmental/contextual kills. So at that point it boils down to stalking the rest of the partygoers one-by-one as they split off from the main group over the next ten minutes before decapitating the DJ and dancing my way to the next level.\n\nBottom line: Party Hard just isn't fun because it quickly becomes tedious and there's just too much going on too soon. Combined with too many options that don't do enough damage to the partygoer numbers and aren't explained well enough to understand immediately or sometimes even after repeated use.\n\nTL;DR- Party Hard is a less interesting, more confusing, and less fun stealth/Hitman game.","December 30, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is less a test of skill and more a test of patience. Enjoyable and addicting none-the-less. The complexity of each scenario is pretty well paced as I never felt overwelmed on any particular level however I did feel quite stressed through each stage. Only one wall-/collision-glitch on the Halloween Party level, but nothing game-breaking due to where it is on the map. The story and voice actors are terrible, but if you're overly into that kind of montra while playing a pixelated serial killer then you may have more... "personal" issues that should probably take priority.\n\nAll-in-all I have never played anything quite to this exact flavor and enjoyed the new experience. If you're tired of playing rusted-out "tried-and-true" genres then I highly recommend you pick this game up. As for how much, $10 is fair: any more is too much, any less is a steal.","October 31, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/recommended/356570/","muenzz","Love9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/","322 products in account","As a huge fan of Hotline Miami, i was both excited and sceptical going into this. Turned out the two games only thing both games really have in common is the theme "mass murder". You are a dude who just wants to sleep, but your neighbors are having a party and are way too loud. It's up to our anti-hero with mask and knife to not only go to the neighbours next door, but go on a complete rampage all across the US to stop 11 obnoxious loud parties. That's basically how the story goes.\n\nThe gameplay itself was pretty interesting to me. The goal of each stage is to murder every single person at the party. Doing so proves a little bit more difficult then expected, the places are crowded with people, most of the time close together, and lots of times these people don't hestitate to call the cops to investigate or worse, get you arrested. So what do you really do to kill everyone? Our beloved mass murderer isn't the fittest guy, being exhausted after a 2-3 second sprint, just enough to get out the scene or escape the cops (atleast for a short while, as the cops get more persistent). Besides sprinting, the main character is capable of killing, obviously, picking up sleeping person or corpses or setting up various traps around the stage.\n\nThe game encourages using the traps, as there are many different on each stage, each with different effects, may it be poisoning food, gumball machines which explode or a horse which kicks your victims to valhalla. But also multiple items are avaiable in the game, such as Smoke grenades, bombs or Spare clothes to escape the cops.\n\nStealth is a very important part of Party Hard aswell. You must be quick, efficient and not to  be seen while stabbing a person. Hiding bodies in trashcans or other various places is also an option to not get found out about your rampage.\n\nThe level design can be a bit frustrating at parts (especially that damn Miami Party), but overall i liked it. There are multiple 'variations' for each map, meaning that some traps are in other locations, switched with others completely, etc. Every time you start the map new (or get busted/die) you get a different variaton. I enjoyed this system quite well, as all the maps and every playthrough felt familiar, but still different. Also the music in this game is just great.\n\nOnly thing i could complain about is the price tag and the lenght. The game may be a bit difficult but can still be finished rather quickly, depending on your skill. Also the voice acting in the cutscense wasn't really my cup of tea.\n\nOtherwise i can recommend this game  alot. In the end it was pretty different to Hotline Miami. It's a way more calm killing spree, but that's what i really liked about it. I just hope there will be a second Party Hard aswell, as i think there are still much possibilities for this gameplay.","September 10, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Simple but has an interesting story, the cut scenes are especially good and I look forward to them as much as the levels. Some of the levels seem a bit harder than necessary as in at least once a map there is really no way to stealth and you will just have to kill the 2-3 other people before they can alert others elsewhere or call the cops (otherwise you better have a extra set of clothes).  Also I noticed repeating a level the same items may or may not be there, which can make things easier or harder.\n\nMusic is really enjoyable, if you enjoy edm/club music this is right up your alley. I usually find myself wanting to turn down the music provided in most games but I definitely bump this louder.\n\nI reccommend this game for people who enjoy stealth but are looking for something lighter. I find myself laughing during some of these kills with the characters acting like typical "party crowd". If you don't typically enjoy stealth you will probably still find this game entertaining but might find yourself giving up or getting annoyed since there is little room for error in the levels before starting all over again.\n\nI haven't built my own levels yet but the feature is there and very entertaining.

I am usually against those games that have violence and killing as a main thing, but this one really does this in such cartoony way, and the gameplay is so simple and engaging that you simply can't stop playing. The pixel graffics are very cool, and colorful, the narrative is simplistic and clearly does not try to take itself  seriously. Really good game, for a really good value.","December 7, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's pretty, but shallow.\n\nLong:\nGame's got a fun aesthetic, doesn't rush you, gives you a lot to take in, the music isn't awful, and is paced with the idea that you'd plot out the largest and most interesting kills each semi-random level can offer. But off paper it quickly becomes repetitive and slow, and you start just cherry-picking stray guests that happen to wander near body-hiding spots. Mass kills don't feel hugely rewarding once you've played a level once or twice already, and while there are plenty of Easter eggs, they don't detract from the shallow mechanics. Each level is ultimately the same.\n\nBut that isn't even why I can't recommend the game: it has got to have the worst scripting and voice acting of any game I've ever played. I don't  know who their writer/voice actors were, but it's wincing. I've never been embarrassed to be watching a cut-scene before, but this game managed it.","December 22, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very interesting concept. You play as a guy who's just trying to get some sleep, but your neighbors are throwing a party. Your goal is to kill everyone at the party without getting arrested or killed. While you'd think that a game with such a premise would be completely tasteless and without merit, I have to say that the simple graphics and the generally comedic tone keep you from taking things too seriously. My only real gripe is that most of the game play mechanics seem to be somewhat unnecessary, although I suppose that mastering them may allow you to proceed through the game more quickly.","December 23, 2015","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's enormous potential here, but it isn't utilized the way it could be.\n\nTraps are one-use-per-level, and rarely take out enough people to be considered effective. By the time you've used up all of your available traps, there's still 20-30 people left to kill. This means you have to wait for each of them to move to a secluded spot so you can kill them.\n\nAdditionally, being seen next to a dead body means the police will be called on you. In many cases, you have nowhere to run, and even your (extremely limited) sprint isn't fast enough to escape. If a cop grabs you, you instantly lose and have to restart the level from the beginning. For me, this meant spending an hour on one level, waiting for people to wander from the group so I could kill them, only for someone to see me and force me to start from the very beginning.\n\nThe game has a ton of potential, but it just isn't executed well at all. If there was a way to lure people towards traps or to more easily escape the police, the game would be much, much better. As it is now, it just turns into a long, tedious grind.","January 6","false","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

You use different ways to kill everyone in the map- kill directly or use the traps. It's not that hard to find traps since they're all marked at the beginning but during the game, the maps looks pretty good and you always have lots ways of killing.\n\nA detective is telling his story to link all those levels- and apparently you are the psycho he's talking about who kills everyone on site without a reason. So kill everyone and survive from the cops is your goal. I found this game not so intriguing due to:\n\n1. You cannot save during one level.\n2. Lack of principle- sometimes people see you murder NPC they call the police, sometimes they just ignore you.\n3. You can't tell who's watching you who's not. A radar for NPC to display their sight is not rare in many games but this one missed it. You can't tell which direction a NPC is looking exactly or how long one could see. It lowers the fun since you hesitate when you have a good chance.\n4. You can't lure NPC to your traps. It's all about luck how many people you kill per trap, and when you run out of traps, killing is painful.\n\nGuys, try Hotline Miami.","December 25, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It mixes stealth with awesome music!\n\nThe story is funny yet somewhat stupid, you basically are a guy who tries to sleep but at 3am you wake up to listen to your next door neighbours throwing a wild party, what do you do? You KILL them! The game does have story along the way, after completing a level, it will give you a mini cutscene with some story to fill you in\n\nBasically, the gameplay goes that you are the murderer and you have to try and kill every single party member by any means possible without getting caught by other party guests, the police or any other people. The gameplay is fun and challenging but it can get frustrating and hard  because of the unpredictability of the police and the other guests and that some guests won't do what you want, I wish that the developers would make it slightly easier for us few gamers that don't like very hard games, but, probably they won't...\n\nThe music and visuals are really nice to listen to and to look at\n\nOverall the game is fun to play and the developers constantly update the game to feature new levels and new ways to kill your party guests and there is also a twitch.tv integration in which if you broadcast to your twitch channel, the viewers can decide who crashes the party next and so on. The only flaw to Party Hard is its unpredictability and hard difficulty but overall its a fun game to KILL time!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","November 15, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

OUO You basically play as a person trying to kill everyone at a party. You only start with a knife at your disposal but there are many different traps and items that can be used to make the killing easier.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent, but I feel that there were a couple minor issues that some have run into (but I don't mind them much.) I think the game might be considered a bit unfair when you'll be close to finishing a level, only to lose because of something you weren't aware of. However, a game like Spelunky requires you to learn these elements of gameplay yourself so you don't make the same mistake twice, and I can respect it for that. The game's might be a bit hard at first, but that's the charm of Party Hard.\n\n..I don't have much else to say, except if you want a really good stealth game, Party Hard should not only meet your expectations, but skyrocket past them. :)\n","December 26, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The thing that really made this stand out vs that game was the trap system. the trap system was a very cool and good idea, but it got very "same-y" after the 2nd party.  Once you figure out the mechanics you kind of feel like a kid with a maginfiying glass over an ant hill... but not in a "good" way :0p.\n\nThe good\n-the art style\n-the trap system\n-the different types of partys\n-the in-game humor and references were cool\n\nThe bad\n\nIt felt, almost unfinished. Half the voiceover work was someone doing their best Christian Bale Batman.\nThe music was great for about 5 min, and then it got REALLY annoying\nthe plot was predictable, and not in a "run with it" campy way. it was like the big reveal at the end was legit supposed to be a big reveal.\n\n\nill sum this up by saying if this was an early release game, i would have been impressed. if a sequel came out, i would give it a shot, especialy if they could get the pacing and trap system improved (more options and variations)! the music could do with a bit more variety.\n\ngood effort.","January 5","false","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I started playing Party Hard I immediately thought of Hotline Miami where you are a slasher who has to strategically set up the moves that you are going to make to reach your end goal which is to kill everybody in a 2 mile radius. The differences between the games are that with Hotline Miami you can get frustrated and just go on a murder spree and you will win but with Party Hard they will call the cops who will then arrest you and cause you to start all over again. Some of the problems I have with Party  Hard is that since it uses a board game like view it is hard to tell where you are in between the 60 other people. Also when somebody calls the police on you it's really hard to kill them before they get to the phone because they will run to phone and you are stuck with a slow walk or a fast walk at the most. That's really all I have against it so if you like games like Hotline Miami then you will really enjoy this game.","March 22","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can do this by simply stabbing them or using the party as your killing machine. The levels are sandbox and each time you play the interactable objects in it change, which is a great feature as you experience a different gameplay every time you play.\nThere are a lot of ways to kill people, you can ran them over with a caddy, make a bomb out of a gum machine or even call Jason to cut everyone in slices. A lot of random events help keep the game different each time. You might find lesbians making out in the bathroom, or a terrorist putting a bomb in the middle of the dancefloor. You can also find usable objects such as swords, bombs and poison.\nThe game is quite funny sometimes. I found a man ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a dead body while two guys insulted each others moms. Between levels you get cutscenes of the police officer who investigated you talking to a psychologists, which are actually quite funny.\nThe graphics are pretty and you can understand what each person is doing(which is impressive for this kind of pixel art)The mechanics are tight and responsive. Also,this game features full Xbox controller compatibility.\nI wrote an email to the publishers and they replied in a record time of 1 hour and 30 minutes. The community makes a lot of adicional scenarios which increase the replayability of the game.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe game feels like if a psycho Hitman was playing RobberyBob with pixel art. The 2000`s music fits great with the game. It is well worth the 13 bucks they ask for. Easy 95/100","April 6","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a very interesting gameplay mechanic, in which you must stealthily kill all the party members without being arrested. Granted, there are ways to kill everyone blatantly, but it makes the game harder. I would recommend it because it has a unique style about it and is a good time waster. The only reason I bought it is because it was on sale. It's not worth more than $5, in my opinion. The storyline is extremely flat, and I found myself muting the music halfway through the level because it's the same 15 second loop over and over again. The voice acting is very sub-par, and almost cringy to a point.

The concept is fun, but isn't anything revolutionary. This game has the most unrealistic AI I've ever seen, which can be seen as both a good thing and a bad thing. I'd like to rename this game "You'd think at some point..." because that's what you'll be yelling at the game the entire time you're playing.\n\n"You'd think at some point they'd cancel a party after 30 people have died."\n"You'd think at some point they'd catch on to a guy awkwardly running around with a Jason mask."\n"You'd think at some point the cops would just stick around after being called for the tenth time."\n\nWhile I believe the game is worth getting, the game doesn't require as much stealth as it would have you believe. The people have pretty narrow cones of vision, and if you outrun the cops you are immune to getting arrested until they leave the scene completely. You can hide the bodies you kill so that the cops aren't called, but as long nobody saw you actually kill the person you'll never get in trouble. Just some things to keep in mind if you are looking for a good stealth game instead of a silly diversion. Worth the price, though.","December 5, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd go as far as to call it a spiritual successor to Hotline Miami- even used the same font as it! The gameplay is fun, easy to learn, and frustrating. A simple miscalculation and you've lost the entire level. The generated levels can work for or out of your favor, but each one can be won with some careful planning. And the soundtrack? is really amazing. Short list of tracks but I've had it on repeat for quite a while. Last but not least, the cutscenes- while the voice acting isn't incredibly mind blowing - are a really good accompaniment to the gameplay. The game would have been great without them, but they went the extra mile and made it something interesting. The game is a solid 9/10, a point gone for that one time a bouncer was hiding behind a door and I had 9 people left. Still miffed about it.\n\nAt least, a 9/10 until the end. The very end- 'last cutscene and the game is done ' end. I won't get into the details, but it's a very cliche and overdone trope in horror and murder games and movies. There were many other ways it could have been done and still held the same excitement, but they still took the easy way out. The end seems like a copout (excuse the pun) of an ending and feels very, very out of place with the rest of the story. I don't usually let bad ends get to me, but this one just didin't feel right with the game.\nI would still recommend it of course, but I'd also recommend ignoring the last cutscene- skipping it altogether even. It leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.","January 14","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Something to me was immensely satisfying about timing kills, hiding corpses, and setting up traps for maximum damage.  Since the enemies seem to move a bit randomly, however, it can be frustrating.  In addition, the player isn't given much information about when the cops will "give up" the chase.  Sometimes it seems to happen as soon as you depart through a trap door - other times, police seem to follow you almost indefinitely.

Where pushing people into open flames is A-Okay, but standing 5 feet away from a dead body is not. Party Hard is a unique stealth game that has you kill groups of about 50 people without alerting the cops. Although the mechanics may seem tricky at first, a bit of patience and experience makes this game very enjoyable. There are about 10 maps to the story, each lasting about 10~15 minutes (depending on luck and skill). After a few frustrating mistakes, being able to complete a difficult level is extremely satisfying. The game itself is not very long, but with the level editor, you are able to create and play on maps made by other players. Overall, I'd say this game is worth the price if you enjoy stealth games, but could probably be held off on until a sale comes by if the video and screenshots dont really catch your eye.","April 11","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sheer insanity and fun!\n\nHow it actually plays.  A slow, tedious test of patience and frustration. Most of the people you'll end up killing just from slowly walking at them and hitting E when there aren't any witnesses and then dropping their body somewhere, wash, rinse, repeat. If something goes wrong there isn't really any gameplay afterwords, which is where I'd expect a game about chaos to excel in the "what happens when unexpected things happen" but alas.\n\nIf you get spotted a police office gets a homing beacon to your position and you can escape by hopping back and forth across a barrier the cop can't cross for some reason. Then the cop gives up and calls a repairman who "fixes" the barrier so you don't do that again, you bad, bad, little murderer. There is one or maybe two other similar hopping points on the level which function largely as extra lives.\n\nThe special events for the most part don't really to be the focus of the game at all and are mostly downplayed relative to just shanking people. Many events only kill a single person and give away your location. Others like poisoning food get similarly poor results without you being spotted but do force you to wait for excessive periods of time to the results.\n\nAs a result I entered with high hopes but left with a largely unmemorable experience. I think it'd be possible to make this game good still but it would require a lot of work on the core game loop and mission design so I'm dubious we'll ever see it.\n\nDisclaimer I only played through the first level and tutorial but I watched some let's plays to make sure I wasn't missing really cool stuff later on and it continued to meet my expectations. I also checked with a friend who had beaten most of the missions and he was similarly disappointed. I would stay away.

It is very strategy based and requires patience. The story is fairly simple, you play as a guy who is just tryna' get some sleep, but of course your neighbours are having a party. You can kinda' tell what goes on from there. You can also unlock more characters with special traits as you unlock achivements, so thats a plus. The game has a very good sense of humour as well, which makes much more fun to play. Oh, how could I forget? The Soundtrack! You can not have a good game or party without good music, and boy this game has got it. It's soundtrack is honestly one of my favourite, although it may get a little repetetive sometimes. The only thing I didn't like about the game was the fact that the story is too short, although there are bonus levels after the story, it still isn't as fun as the story. Overall this game is great and I totally recommend it!","January 9","true","13.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Where pushing people into open flames is A-Okay, but standing 5 feet away from a dead body is not. Party Hard is a unique stealth game that has you kill groups of about 50 people without alerting the cops. Although the mechanics may seem tricky at first, a bit of patience and experience makes this game very enjoyable. There are about 10 maps to the story, each lasting about 10~15 minutes (depending on luck and skill). After a few frustrating mistakes, being able to complete a difficult level is extremely satisfying. The game itself is not very long, but with the level editor, you are able to create and play on maps made by other players. Overall, I'd say this game is worth the price if you enjoy stealth games, but could probably be held off on until a sale comes by if the video and screenshots dont really catch your eye.","April 11","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has just enough positives to outweigh the negatives.  Here's the plus side:\n-Great soundtrack\n-Interesting fresh concept\n-Fun somewhat polished gameplay and fairly difficult, exercises patience and cleverness.\n-Fair price, decent amount of level choices including an in depth level editor.\n-Depth in the certain combinations of interactions between characters, including cheeky cameos.\n-Certain interactables cycle after each play of some maps keeping some freshness and flexibility.\nNegatives:\n-Heavy Euro Jank(Spelling errors, poor grammer, story is messed up, voice acting cringe worthy)\n-Game Sounds are limited, repetitve and often inaccurate(everyone sounds like an old man when they die)\n-Game does not have much variety in the mission, just kill everyone.  Game gets harder but all an all not different.\n-Has mild bugs that still make the game playable but they are there.\n\nFor most people, you'll get a few hours of fun out of this game.  I've played some flash games for free that were more polished than this game.  So I suggest waiting for it fall within the 5 dollar range to be considered worth your money.","April 11","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only real complaint is that the A.I, seems like it can be a little buggy sometimes, mostly one weird thing where a cop would show up only to immediately drive away without getting out of his car. This was rare, but noticable.","May 19","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
