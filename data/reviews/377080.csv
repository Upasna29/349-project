Though you don't really need to have done the BBL route to play this.\n\nThis has a really interesting format, in that playing different sections unlocks more sections and sort of mini-bonus stories. But there's not as much choice as there was in the first game, and where you do have a choice... picking the wrong one usually just results in a game over, rather than something interesting.

We cross the glowing river. We follow the obsidian map into the world of shadows."\nFor the ones who already played Hatoful Boyfriend, enjoyed it through its genuine absurdity and mind-wrecking revelation that takes place during the BBL route, Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star is the collection of some side stories hailing from an alternative universe where BBL route never took place. The game serves to be both some ridiculous fan service and some fourth wall breaking story interaction. For the ones who are yet to play the original game: drop this supplement and play Hatoful Boyfriend immediately to avoid spoilers!\n\nIn the Holiday Star continuation, the shocking yet gruesome BBL route never occurred. All students of St. Pigeonations live happily and obliviously, approaching the end of yet another school year. Here around this time, we observe a series of short side stories from our usual heroes' daily encounters that will enrich both character backgrounds and answer some questions unanswered in the original game. Aside a handful of irrelevant comical situations Holiday Star also includes one genuine storyline which would foreshadow the events of BBL route and introduce unnerving new characters: The Day the Night Slept. Even for that story alone, you are in for a treat everybirdie!\n\nGameplay is not that different from the original. You are Hiyoko Tosaka, the young human girl who attends St. Pigeonations alongside her bird class mates and teachers who will witness casual - and not so casual - random ongoing in and about the school. This time, gameplay is fairly straight forward with little to no choice options at all. As I described before, Holiday Star is more of a supplement to the original rather than a stand-alone game. It consists of 4 storylines, 6 short chapters and a fairly interesting radio program section where Ryouta will answer fan mails.\n\nIt's cute and short - aside The Day the Night Sleeps storyline, which is heart and mind-wrecking as expected from any game coming from Hatoful universe. I sincerely recommend the experience to the fans of the series, and the ones who'd still have some questions within their minds after completing BBL route.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","February 6","true","9.0"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","0"

It has every bit of the same wit and charm as the original, and delves yet again into a surreal and tragic nightmare world that you would not initially expect was hiding beneath the veneer of silly, charming birds.  If Bad Boy's Love ruined you before, this will ruin you yet once again.  Be warned:  Once you fly towards the Holiday Star, there is no coming back from the emotional train ride that is waiting for you.\n\nI highly recommend purchasing the Collector's Edition.  You'll receive the sound track, and though most of it is duplicated from the original Hatoful Boyfriend, there are a few new tracks in there.  You'll also receive a high resolution picture library of 36 artwork from within the game, five wallpapers, the rather disturbing Holiday Star dossier, and the King's Storybook, which features a bonus story not included in the game proper.  If you do purchase the Collector's Edition, be sure to play all the way through the game before viewing the bonus content as it may spoil some things.\n\nIf you have never played Hatoful Boyfriend, be sure to play the original to its completion prior to playing this game.

However for whatever reason by removing that element, they also killed off the branching factors of story outcomes. The only options you are given is the correct command or a game over.

If not, you won‚Äôt quite understand everything, and the story will be much less impactful.I'm not sure what I was expecting coming into this. Hatoful Boyfriend had me pleasantly surprised with its profound and compelling storyline (my review). I wondered if the Christmas edition would offer something similar, or if it would be short and cheery for the holiday season. I was not disappointed when I was given a sweet story with the perfect amount of humour and darkness to keep it interesting.\n\nHatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star is divided into 4 chapters, and includes 6 short episodes and 6 radio episodes.Everything is well divided into bits, so you can have short, sweet doses of your favourite bird hubbies.\n\nThe Main StoryThe main story is straightforward and linear, rather than being a dating sim with multiple endings.\nI won‚Äôt reveal much, to avoid spoiling the plot, but I honestly do recommend this sequel. Beyond the charming hilarity of every character being a bird is a genuinely enjoyable visual novel. Had the characters not been birds, I would still recommend it, purely based on the story. It‚Äôs nothing groundbreaking, but it is worth praising.\nHatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star will give you everything you could ever want for the holidays; romance, sacrifice, mystery, and murder. It explores the weaknesses of everybirdies‚Äô hearts, and is amusingly self aware with its humour, poking fun at itself on multiple occasions.\nIf you loved the first one, don‚Äôt hesitate to buy this one. It has some mysterious notes, leaving you wanting more, but it doesn‚Äôt feel as if it‚Äôs lacking. If anything, it sets itself up for another Hatoful Boyfriend VN (HEAR THAT? WE WANT MORE).\n\nShort Episodes and RadioIn the short episodes, you get to go on dates with your birdy boys. Choose to view their bird models, or their humans models, and enjoy! Each of the dates are short and sweet.\nThe radio episodes are filled with humour, and will answer important questions for the viewers (what is everybirdies' underwear colour?????)\n\nThe badI have plenty of praise, but if I have to state some negatives, here they are:\nThe editing could use a little more care, as I picked up on a couple grammar/spelling errors. It‚Äôs nothing serious, but it‚Äôs worth noting.\nIt‚Äôs easy to get confused sometimes, considering the different routes and timelines that everything takes place in.\nAll in all, it‚Äôs good fun. Pick it up and enjoy your handsome bird boys. Make an excessive amount of bird puns when friends message you to question what you‚Äôre playing, and then force them to play it too.\nIt‚Äôs a coo‚Äô game.\n\nsorry","December 23, 2015","true","3.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It takes place in an alternate timeline from the previous game (ignoring the events of what  Hatoful  players call ‚Äúthe BBL route‚Äù), and assumes that the player already has some basic familiarity with the characters.\n\nMost notably from a gameplay perspective,  Holiday Star  abandons the dating-sim structure of  Hatoful Boyfriend  in favor of a straightforward visual-novel approach.  The player is given a few choices to make over the course of the game, but most of these either advance the plot or result in insta-death, rendering the choices essentially false.  In other words, it‚Äôs basically what fans of the genre call a ‚Äúkinetic‚Äù (i.e. choice-less) story.  This is a game for people who love the characters of  Hatoful Boyfriend  and just want to tag along with them on some silly holiday-themed adventures, rather than control the story from the driver‚Äôs seat.\n\nI use the word ‚Äúsilly‚Äù deliberately.  Although there are a few genuinely touching moments (a conversation between Ryouta and Yuuya about love and the possibility of rejection comes to mind), most of the game is taken up with deliberately absurd, even surreal humor.  For example, in one chapter the nefarious villain (a flamboyant scientist with a score to settle) tries to destroy St. PigeoNation‚Äôs Academy by blasting it with a cannon powered by female manga nerds. ("I have heard that the fantasies of fangirls surpass those of any fanboy. Observe, and be destroyed!").  There‚Äôs also plenty of fourth wall-breaking moments, including radio interludes where the characters respond to questions from real-life fans of the series about their taste in underwear, etc.   Macbeth,  this ain‚Äôt.\n\nCynics might say that the developer just wanted to milk  Hatoful Boyfriend‚Äôs  surprising success for more money, but I disagree.   Holiday Star  feels like it was made with genuine affection and inspiration.  Certain plot details might be head-scratchingly inconsistent between the two games, but it‚Äôs still an endearing and sometimes hilarious experience, and I would recommend it to  Hatoful  fans who don‚Äôt mind losing control over the story in order to spend more time with Hiyoko and friends. Nearly all of the characters get a moment in the spotlight, with extra attention paid to Anghel, Nageki, and my dude Yuuya this time around.\n\nIt‚Äôs certainly possible to play  Holiday Star  as a standalone experience, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.  It‚Äôs meant to be a character study and a cheeky gift to fans;  first-time players will miss out on the subtleties of the character interactions, and feel a definite  whoosh  as in-jokes fly over their head.\n\nAnd yes, it‚Äôs about a bunch of birds.","February 11","true","14.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game relies heavily on the character development from the first Hatoful Boyfriend so you need to play that one to understand this one.\n2. This game consists of small episodes instead of a large branching story.  In fact this game really has no branching paths at all; the few times you have to make a choice either lets the story progress or gives you a game over.\n\nThis game is good if you want to see your favorite birds from the first game get more screen time.  Just know that this is not nearly as involved as the first game was.\n\nAlso, it is not as Christmas-y as I was expecting.  Only one episode is Christmas themed. It also has some New Years focus and general winter time feel. In case that matters to you.","December 23, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A bit more linear than the first, but still a great game overall. I'll try to review this without spoiling anything.\n\nPros: Your favourite pigeons (And Hiyoko) return with more vibrant personalities than before! Especially the good doctor... Ho ho ho.[puu.sh]\nThe dialogue is just as great as the first title! Still witty and charming!\nInstead of starting a new game and playing the same scenes over and over in the first title for another route, this is more straightforward, since the stories in this game are separated by 'chapters'.\nLike the first title, this game has a good story!\nThere's alternate scenes to see the pigeons as humans (!!!)Cons: The portrait quality isn't as good as the first, there's traces of jpg on the portrait's outlines, most noticibly Ryouta (Minor problem)\nRequires you to play through the first title to know what's going on, or you might be lost.\nDidn't hit you like a truck as much like the first game did. Don't worry if you don't know what I mean by this. You'll know what I mean if you played the end of the first game.Overall, if you are a fan of the first title, you will enjoy the second title! If you are new to the series, please play the first title before getting this one! I assure you, dating pigeons are quite... satisfying and fun. Yep...~\n\nTrivia: The creator of the game, Moa, likes Undertale and sharing her playthrough with the Japanese community with subtitles!

Just do it. I've played the original Holiday Star so I know this game is amazing and I would absolutely recommend it. Even though Holiday Star is based off story and not much options or routes, it doesn't make it any less of a game and makes up for it with incredible backstories and settings.\n\nFor the steam version in particular, the new art is beautiful and really stands out, but a couple of people have pointed out the music. There were loads of really nice royalty-free music tracks (I believe by Sentive and TAM) in the original game which for some reason aren't in this version. I was really hoping a particular track (end of chapter 2) would be there but when it wasn't I was kinda sad, and I'm worried that some really emotional songs later on in the game in heart-wrenching moments are just going to be replaced by awkward silence. Music really adds a lot to a game, even if it's just pigeons talking in a dialogue box, so when there's nothing there it just makes the game feel a lot emptier. I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but I hope Moa can see these reviews and maybe try to get the same music back on becuase some of those tracks fit so beautifully to the game.\n\nBesides that, I love this game so much and the steam rework got me hyped to replay it! 10/10 would get pigeon feels all over again","December 20, 2015","true","6.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

More bizarre scenerios, more suprisingly deep lore, and more jarring juxtaposition between a lighthearted surface level and a pitch dark undertone.\nEnjoy it for what it is!\n\nAlso it's implied to be set in a universe where you're going down my personal favorite non-Shuu path and that makes me feel vindicated","December 28, 2015","true","12.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I feel like after establishing the characters and dynamics among the cast, they game is right to focus on telling interesting stories with them. And the stories in this game are all indeed fun, heartwarming, and sometimes tragic, just like in the original Hatoful Boyfriend.\n\nHowever I take issue with the Steam release of this game specifically. See the first game's Steam release had all the content from the original game and more alongside the prettier backgrounds.  This game doesn't add anything as far as I've seen so far, but that doesn't honestly bother me the increase in visuals is very noticable in some areas.  What DOES bother me is the fact that they've hacked this games soundtrack to bits.   Like 40% of scenes don't have any music in them, not for atmosphere but due to the fact that for whatever reason the Steam release lost a good chunk of the songs that filled the original version of Holiday Star.  The loss of these songs makes the game feel a lot emptier especially in moments where the music added a lot to the tone of the scene.  I hope this is a technical error of some kind because if they couldn't use some of the (royalty free) music from the original release then they should have replaced those songs with songs they still had permission to use.\n\nSo I can say this is still a good game full of interesting and hilarious stories, but it's really dissapointing that they were so lazy with this port in terms of the music.  I would reccomend the original version of Holiday Star, but that is tied to Famous Writer, which I beleive is no longer functional on fully updated Windows 10 computers, and must be patched for it to be understandable in English.","December 17, 2015","true","13.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suicidalpie9/recommended/377080/","suicidalpie9","SuicidalPie9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suicidalpie9/","73 products in account","Hatoful Boyfriend es el simulador de citas con palomas por excelencia, o mas bien el √∫nico. Tuvo tanta repercusi√≥n y √©xito por all√° en el 2011 que los desarrolladores decidieron realizar una nueva versi√≥n para las fiestas. No se trata de un DLC ni nada por el estilo, sino mas bien un juego aparte y en plena epoca navide√±a paso a coment√°rtelo.\n\n\nEl juego se divide en cuatro episodios y una serie de cap√≠tulos extra mas cortos, adem√°s de otros extras que simulan ser un programa radial conducido por las mismas palomas y est√°n referidos a la historia del juego.\n\nAl comienzo de cada episodio tenemos la posibilidad de elegir nuestro nombre y apellido, que es el que utilizar√°n el resto de los personajes para referirse a nosotros. Podemos tener diferentes nombres en cada uno de los cap√≠tulos ya que no afecta la experiencia de juego.\n\nSin spoilearte nada te cuento que le primer episodio se centra en las festividades navide√±as y nosotros, unos simples humanos, junto con otras palomas, tenemos que descubrir qui√©nes son los ladrones de la Navidad que se est√°n robando los √°rboles del vecindario y del instituto al cual aparentemente concurrimos. El segundo se aleja un poco del esp√≠ritu navide√±o y nos sit√∫a en una convenci√≥n de manga y anim√© en la cual tenemos que evitar que nuestro amigo paloma se involucre en la edici√≥n de su manga con un villano que planea destruir todo con su rayo laser *inserte gif de Monsters Inc.*. El tercer y cuarto episodio est√°n enlazados y transcurren en un sue√±o que todas las palomas tienen en conjunto.\n\n\nSi a√∫n no te diste cuenta lo bizarro que es desde el t√≠tulo, tambi√©n hay tanques de guerra, rayos laser como mencion√© anteriormente y algunos otros artefactos propios de un villano de pel√≠cula como para darle vida a la historia, la cual no es tan divertida como parece.\n\nSiendo un ‚Äújuego‚Äù estilo visual novel no est√° muy bien realizado ya que en cada uno de los cap√≠tulos tenemos solo una oportunidad en la cual elegir una opci√≥n que cambie el resto de la historia, por lo tanto se torna aburrido y pesado esperar hasta ese momento para ver si nuestra opci√≥n es la adecuada o no.\n\n\nOtro factor que juega en contra es la calidad visual de los p√°jaros. Se ven pixelados, y si bien no es un juego en donde los gr√°ficos tengan que ser excepcionales, molesta estar jugando con tu personaje en una calidad m√°s baja que la escena de fondo.\n\nA todo esto, si le vemos el lado positivo podemos rescatar la personalidad de las aves. No solo hay palomas, sino tambi√©n hay otro tipo de p√°jaros similares y no tanto, que se diferencian por sus plumajes. Son personajes bastante estereotipados pero al ser animales, resulta mucho mas divertido que en cualquier otro contexto.\n\n\nLa m√∫sica es algo que sobresale, no solo porque muchas veces no concuerda con la situaci√≥n y en este caso sobresale literalmente, sino que es muy buena. Como es una versi√≥n navide√±a, muchas de las canciones est√°n relacionadas con √©sta tem√°tica, como por ejemplo los t√≠picos villancicos o El cascanueces; pero por otro lado puede pasar a tener temas al mejor estilo instrumental de Metallica o Linkin Park que nada se relacionan con las escenas pero es una de las cosas mas disfrutables.\n\nMuchas veces se torna inc√≥modo jugar a ser un humano en d√≥nde una paloma te est√° tirando palos y te gusta, y lo peor es cuando no sab√©s ni siquiera el g√©nero de la paloma con la que est√°s hablando porque las se√±ales son muy pocas, incluso los nombres japoneses son dif√≠ciles de predecir.\n\nNo es un juego que recomiende incluso si sos muy fan de las visual novels. Las historias no son divertidas, los chistes no logran hacer reir, es muy corta y graficamente no es un buen producto. No le pidas Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star a Pap√° Noel, es mejor el carb√≥n.","December 24, 2015","false","3.5"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","13","2","15","3","0"

The Q&A radio sessions are also great, and one of my favourite parts. Answers some questions about BBL, but also adds dumb little things to canon, like Yuuya's glasses not actually being needed (or the colour of everyones human version panties,,,)\n\nAnyway yeah.

Since the previous game had wrapped up just about everybirdie's character arc, there wasn't much room for expansion in the characters. Holiday Star abandons the "pigeon dating simulator" thing for a more linear story. That's not to say it's bad, in fact it reduces the redundant dialogue from replaying the game. But with the branching story gone, it's hard not to feel something was taken.\n\nSadly, if you've already played the previous game Holiday Star doesn't give you that morbid curiousity that makes you say "this is a weird dating sim"; since the previous game perfectly elaborated the backstory. And without that sense of curiousity, Holiday Star just isn't as mind-blowing as the first game.\n\nWhile Holiday Star's writing isn't as good as the previous game's, it does make it up with the story. Since Holiday Star has almost no pretenses of being a "pigeon dating simulator", the story focuses less on the character and instead on your bizarre adventures in St. Pigeonations. What Holiday Star has a hard time doing compared to the previous game is to subvert expectations, since the first game blew it's load on that department; there wasn't much Holiday Star could do in that regard.\n\nAlso, Holiday Star has the nasty habit of giving you a choice that actually could give you a bad ending and makes you restart the game. This would be fine if Holiday Star was closer to a dating sim, but given the linearity of the game it's easy to forget to save and end up repeating an entire episode. My best advice here is to save if a choice pops up.\n\nHoliday Star is accessible without playing the previous game, but it's still highly recommended that you play the previous game first; just so you'd already be emotionally invested in the characters.\n\nHoliday Star perfectly supplements the previous game's story, but unfortunately that's as much as I can say about it. Think of Holiday Star as a doujin/fanfic that adds the story of the previous game, but without the joy of it being as new as the original.","December 30, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's ... many things. First piece of advice though: you should play the original else you'll have absolutely no context for what the hell is going on at any given point.\n\nBasically? It's a dating sim with pigeons and doves instead of humans. but Holiday Star is specifically Christmas / New Year themed. There is a branching storyline seen from different points of view (similar to the original game) but it diverts from its starting point by a pretty huge margin.\n\nHatoful is never really what you'd expect. For a game that started off as a joke idea, it does hold quite a bit of emotion in its dialogue and the characterisation is really quite good. Surprisingly, there are little trivia bits of Japanese culture to be found too.\n\nAnd I think Yuuya is the birdie for me!","January 1","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
