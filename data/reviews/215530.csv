Compared with other games like torchlight this is a bit short.\nOne variety was a tower defence part and the possibility to power up the generator for the traps. Unfortunately there were only 2 events were you have to defeat the secret lab.\nAfter I finished the game I also tried the Scneario mode which contain higher difficulties starting from 31 (current cap level for the player is 30).\nIn this mode you could gain glory points instead of xp. Normally you should find better items on this\nsingle map scenarios but compared with the items I already had the weren't better. But this depends on kind of luck you have (like in other games).\nSo I created new characters to test the other classes, but after a short time it doesn't makes fun playing the same story again.\nAt last I tried the "Neverending Story" mode which was described as "The monster will keep getting stronger while your only way to improve is to play even better. See how far you can get!".\nWell it was really hard and the main thing I did was casting my spells and run away till all was dead. For stronger monsters that means run in a circle arround them casting again and again and don't stop to drink healt potions. And the bad thing was, this tooks a lot of time and after a while it gets boring.\n\nShort game summary\n- Level cap: 30\n- Skill and ability  points could be assigned\n- Skill and ability points could be assigned to your aide (Lady Katarina)\n- Perks: by finishing quest and killing enemies you gain reputation. There are 10 levels of reputation and on each of them you could choose one perk to activate e.g Unstoppable (Immunity to all movement impedding effects)\n- Glory: after reching max level you could gain glory points in scenario mode.

A rather generic forest area with expectable enemies didn't get my hopes up too high, but after around an hour the game gained a lot in both presentation and interesting content. For around 7-8 hours afterwards you are in for a great ride with excellent graphics, music and quests. Your companion really adds to game and lifts it above most Diablo clones. Sadly at a certain point the game turns into a pure grind fest and the content runs thin, very thin. The final battle is over the top hard and while it's certainly finishable, nothing in the game prepares you for it.\n\nA lot of great ideas and lovely designed areas will keep you entertained for a few hours and if you can forgive the game a rather rushed/forced ending, I'd say it's a really good hack 'n slash RPG.\n\nPro:\n- Great design\n- Atmospheric music\n- Interesting skill system\n- Sarcastic and entertaining companion\n\nCon:\n- Too short and yet it still feels lengthy in the last 1/4 of the game\n- Crashes occasionally","July 17, 2014","true","14.6"," 72 of 77 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","72","77","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/215530/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a third person hack and slash game very similar to the Diablo / Torchlight series. If you’ve played any of those, you should be able to drop right into Van Helsing with a good idea of how to play. The game seems pretty demanding hardware wise, and it heats up my computer, which is unusual for a top down isometric game.\n\nYou play the title character Van Helsing, a monster hunter on a mission to the country of Borgovia to answer a distress letter. It seems some unspecified evil is causing trouble for the people there. In the game’s world, monsters seem pretty commonplace, and you are actually accompanied on your quest by a snarky ghost named Lady Katarina. Gameplay-wise Lady Katarina is the equivalent of the “pet” in Torchlight, or a “merc” in Diablo 2, except that she talks to you all the time as part of the story. She has her own gear/stats/skills and can go back to town to sell loot for you, just like the pet in Torchlight. In combat she can hold her own for a while, but dies pretty quickly later on in the game.\n\nThe game is broken up into 2 city hubs like Diablo 2 Acts, each with its own main town, NPC shops, and quests. The game is filled with little hidden quests that you may not find in 1 playthrough, even though the maps are not randomly generated.  I’ve finished 2 characters and the maps were exactly the same both times. There is an option in the main menu to have enemies respawn each time you leave and re-enter a game (like Diablo 2), and you can turn this on or off whenever you want. Like Diablo 2, you can’t see what level the enemies are, but if you’re having a hard time, you should probably go back and level up a little more.  This isn’t possible if the enemies don’t respawn. In my experience if you don’t grind at least a few levels, you’ll end the game around level 27 (max level is 30).\n\nThe game has an extensive loot system similar to Diablo/Torchlight with normal/rare/set/epic item types as well as “+magic find%” attributes that can be found on gear to boost your chances of getting rarer items. There is also a way to upgrade particular items with “essence” which is kind of like gems in Diablo, or ember in Torchlight. I haven’t used the system much since every time I find a better weapon I just sell the old one, and don’t bother breaking it down for all the essences that I’ve put into it.\n\nThe game’s stat system should be familiar to people who play dungeon crawler games. Body (hp / melee damage), Dexterity (dodge chance / range damage), Willpower (magic damage/ mana), and Luck (critical damage / magic find) are your four stats and you get 5 per level up to distribute as you please.  The skill system is more complicated because you don’t just choose skills (which can cost more than 1 skill point), you can also choose the “power ups” that can be used with the skills. These power ups are activated before you cast the skill, and use a “rage” meter which is separate from your mana bar.  You build rage by killing monsters while mana just regenerates by itself. So an example would be activating a damage boost power up right before casting a lightning bolt spell. The power up drains some of your rage bar and the spell drains some of your mana bar with the result being a lightning bolt with increased damage.  You can toggle an auto-activate to your power ups if you don’t want to deal with pressing the button every time.  You’ll probably run out of rage really quickly though.\n\nAnother thing to note about the skill system is that your skills are broken up into several categories, though they all take skill points to level up. There are your main Skills, Auras, and Tricks. Auras are passive boosts that you have on permanently, though you can only have 2 auras active at any time. An example would be the Rampage aura which boosts your critical hit damage. Tricks are just another set of skills and personally I don’t see why they were separated from the other skills, except that they don’t use mana. An example would be Arcane Healing, which is an area affecting heal spell. Tricks have a cool down to prevent you from constantly spamming them.\n\nPros:\n+Decent story set in a medieval fantasy world.\n+Gameplay is mostly intuitive though some things really could benefit from further explanation. For example there is no explanation of the skill system. I went about 5 – 6 levels before I put points into any skills because I was afraid I might be wasting points on weak skills. Turns out you can re-spec them later, so go wild.\n+Pretty simple multi player co-op system. I’m able to join my brother’s game pretty quickly and easily with an average ping of 80 ms. One thing I noticed is that the game’s multiplayer server browser doesn’t tell you if a person’s game has a password until you’ve tried connecting to it. That’s kind of dumb. A bunch of people constantly try connecting to my brother and my games and disconnecting because they don’t know the password.\n\nCons:\n-There is very little information online for beginners. In most games of this type, you can find a wiki or strategy website where people share their character builds. I found one site like this, but a lot of the info is outdated. In RPG games I hate feeling like I missed out on something cool.\n\nIf you got this game from the Humble Jumbo 2 bundle, you should have the “Complete Pack” which includes the Thaumaturge and Arcane Mechanic DLCs. These DLCs are 2 new character classes along with a few class specific quests. That means you can see a few areas in the game that you can’t get into unless you’re one of these 2 new classes. The Thaumaturge is a pure spell caster and is probably the most enjoyable class, but easily killed. The Arcane Mechanic is a ranged attacker who shoots slow moving grenades and can summon support units. The base class Hunter is a little bit of everything, but really best as a melee tank with some back up spells.\n\nI’ve heard people say that the game is pretty short, but personally I’m happy with a 12 hour game, especially one in the $1 tier of a humble bundle.  I'm actually glad it doesn't have an end game grind like Diablo, where you just play over and over looking for better gear after you've finished the main storyline. Van Helsing also has a hardcore mode for people who want that extra element of risk (death is permanent). I never have and probably never will create a hardcore character since I die all the time in games like this. Overall I give the game a thumbs up if you enjoy hack and slash dungeon crawlers. You’ll find the graphics comparable with Path of Exile, and the loot finding should keep you occupied for a while.\n","October 24, 2014","true","41.1"," 67 of 74 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","67","74","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/215530/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Beside the Torchlight franchise, Titan Quest and the free Path of Exile NeocoreGames' Van Helsing represents another alternative for those finding the latest Diablo entry a bit too casual. What's more is that while Van Helsing is shorter than aforementioned hack 'n' slash games it still offers a decent story and a lot of content. Due to the additional game modes (scenario and neverending story) it has a high replayability value, as well.\n\nThe game follows a quest of Van Helsing and his companion, the ghost Katharina, who try to get to Borgovia to stop a mad scientist. Along the way you encounter dozens of different enemies throughout numerous different environments. Some of these locales look stunningly beautiful: you traverse through a muddy forest fighting hideous monsters and evil spirits and also join the resistance in a town to fight the soldier-machines. These machines add the steampunk part of the game - with all the traps and contraptions you find they make the game even more diverse.\n\nOne of the things I liked about Van Helsing was its atmosphere. Sound effects and the score are excellent and I liked the sarcastic conversations between Helsing and Katharina. One-liners are common from them as well as from enemies and there are numerous references to other video games and films throughout the game. In order to find all of them it's worth hovering the cursor over all objects in every environment - Van Helsing might collect a quest item or just make a funny comment.\n\nThere are many sidemissions, of course, as it is common in this genre and there's even one that takes you throughout the game. You just need to carefully look everywhere and open all chests, containers, destroy all barrels and boxes as you might find the next piece of the puzzle. It's worth mentioning, though, that not all items are related to a quest, still, they will be part of the corresponding tab in your inventory.\n\nNormally, Van Helsing wields two swords and two pistols. You can decide which way to go from there in terms of customisation. Beside these two tabs there is also one called Tricks (active spells) and Auras (passive skills). Every level-up grants you ability points (the good-old attributes we are talking about here), skill points and occasionally reputation points, but the latter is not related to quest but more to the annihilation of strong beasts. Your reputation can then yields you perks - the list is gradually increasing and you can pick more and more of them along the way.\n\nKatharina, the ghost companion is a bit similar to the pet we have in Torchlight. She can do the shopping on behalf of us and can also pick up loot by category. Her behaviour is completely modifiable. Of course, she has many skills and also attributes - her skills either make her stronger or support Van Helsing in combat.\n\nWhile there are no other companions in the game the abovementioned customisation I described for Van Helsing is the Hunter class only. With the added DLCs you can play as a Thaumaturge or Arcane Mechanic. I hear they are pretty fun and diverse, too, so this is all the more in favour of the longevity of this game.\n\nVan Helsing is pretty cool game considering it is a relatively low-budget hack 'n' slash. It is filled with content and there's high replayability due to the 3 different classes, more difficulty levels, hardcore mode, online cooperative mode in the game. I look forward to playing with its sequel. In the meantime, if you are the fan of the genre Van Helsing should be in your library. Word of advice: buckle up as the game can be pretty challenging even on normal difficulty setting!","November 23, 2014","true","14.3"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","59","64","5","0"

There's also a endless story mode where creatures get more and more difficult at "end game" max level being 30.  There are also scenarios that can be played at level 30 that offer even more challenges with unique bosses and objectives.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imthetoad/recommended/215530/","imthetoad","TheToad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imthetoad/","996 products in account","I started playing this game because I didn't really feel like playing Diablo 3, and all in all I'm pretty happy with my choice.\n\nStory:\nI was expecting the game to be a Diablo-clone in most ways, so having the big bad be a mad human scientist instead of a demon-monster-creature was a pretty nice surprise. Fighting robots(?) in a steampunk-ish world also felt a bit fresh compared to fighting the same old demons and mythological creatures (some of which do appear in this game as well). The basic story is of course the good old "hack your way through a bunch of enemies to defeat the big bad trying to take over the world (or country?)", but there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nGameplay:\nIf you have played Diablo or any other ARPG you will probably recognize the play style right away. You use your mouse and a couple of buttons to dash out various spells while keeping an eye on your health and mana. The addition of rage, which refills when you kill a creature and can be used to power up your spells, was a nice  touch. It gives you an extra thing to do during fights, as well as more ways to personalize your skill tree, so an extra plus there.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics were fine. Not great, not bad. Some creatures looked pretty good, some looked pretty bland. The same can be said for the environment. Personally I enjoyed the city zones more than the nature zones. The (few and short) cut scenes were pretty meh, especially compared to the Diablo cut scenes, but that's acceptable.\n\nMusic:\nWhile playing the game I thought that the music fit the mood pretty well, but as soon as I stopped playing I forgot the soundtrack right away.\n\nThe voice acting in this game... At first I thought that the voice acting was just really, really bad, and almost lol'ed a couple of times during the first few hours of the game. But then I realized that that was what they were going for (probably?). Sort of cheesy, over-the-top voice acting, that when you get used to it fit the game really well, and was sometimes just really funny (in a good way!). Some of the comments from both Van Helsing and Lady Katarina were just hilarious, although by the end of the game Katarina was becoming quite annoying.\n\nOverall:\nOverall I enjoyed this game, even my second playthrough, which was a little unexpected. I don't really want to call Van Helsing a Diablo-clone, since there were a couple of things that set it apart from Diablo, so let's just call it a decent option if you like ARPGs. I recommend this game, even at full price if you don't want to wait for a sale, however I do have a couple of warnings:\n\n1. There are some bugs in the game, the most common being corpses stuck in walls or terrain that can't be looted. I also found a couple of chests that I couldn't open for whatever reason. The biggest bug I faced was a door leading to the next zone being closed, forcing me to start over with a new character. (Luckily this didn't happen with my hardcore heroic character.) There was a fix posted on the developer's forum to fix this, but that fix didn't work for me. On July 2nd 2015 they added the "Mantis Bug Tracker" to the game, which should help fix more bugs, but I wasn't able to test this out myself.\n\n2. If you care about achievements you can get most of the achievements by playing through the game twice. None of them are really that hard to get, as my first playthrough was on hardcore heroic difficulty (=perma-death), and I only died four times, so the game is fairly easy. However, there is one achievement that is just plain stupid. It requires you to get 500,000 kills, which is a lot, seeing as you only get about 10,000-15,000 kills per playthrough. Luckily there is a way to make Lady Katarina afk farm kills for you, which she is doing for me as I am typing this, but just be aware that there is this one really annoying achievement if you (like me) want to clear the game 100%.\n\nBut all in all, a really good game.","July 4, 2015","true","125.2"," 48 of 51 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","48","51","2","0"

At first sight, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing doesn't seem to offer much new or original to a well-established gaming genre: the fast-paced action rpg, played from an isometric point of view. After all, we had the Diablo and Torchlight series, which did a pretty good job at delivering extremely enjoyable games.\n\nFrom my first impressions with this game, it was clear that Neocore Games knows its classics: they stayed true to the core of this particular genre, which is the combination of the fast-paced hack 'n slash (or shoot 'n bewitch) gameplay with the development of your character and the endless craving for loot. After all, what's more rewarding than mowing down horde after horde of enemies, in order to find dozens of lootable items, among which there might be just that one special items? Or breaking hundreds of barrels, hoping to stumble upon a golden ring belonging to a named set?\n\nActually, Van Helsing goes several steps further than most other action rpg when it comes to loot, objects and what you can accomplish with them. I've played through the entire game twice (first as a gun-oriented hunter, than as a melee character), and both times I found myself busy with objects for a fair amount of time. There's not only an incredible number of weapons, armour, rings, boots, gloves, hats, capes and trophees, there's also the possibility to enchant and even enhance them with small magical pieces, "essences". The best items come with a slot for one or more essences, and it's great fun to upgrade one's armour or items in this way. The game gives you a huge amount of customization options over your character (although you can only play as Van Helsing himself, obviously) too: upon levelling up, you can spend 5 ability points (to build your character's strenghts) and 3 skill points (spent in a very extensive skill & spell tree). Part of the immense fun this game provides, lies in building a well-balanced, skilled character that's up to the task and to the items he can wield. There are "perks" too, which offer a general or more specific buff and which unlock after meeting certain requirements.\n\nBut Neocore Games went even one step further by introducing a companion to Van Helsing: a female ghost, who can help you defeating the enemies in several ways (melee, range or simply by enhancing your capabilities). Even better: Katharina also gains experience and can be upgraded, can learn skill and can be equipped with weapons, rings and armour. All of which can be upgraded and enchanted, of course. So if you like that sort of finetuning a character, Van Helsing offers a fantastic experience. And Katharina even helps to solve to everlasting problem of having too much loot but too little inventory space: you can send her off to town to sell some items for cash, or for potions.\n\nCompared to such an extensive character building & enhancing system, the actual gameplay is a little more bland, although it's still pretty solid and enjoyable. With the aid of good weaponry, skills, spells and aura's it is great fun to mow down entire legions of enemies, which the game keeps throwing at you. But towards the latter part of the game it becomes clear which skills are best suited to your style of playing, and the gameplay starts to show some repetition. The story itself is decent enough - nothing special, but it does the job of keeping the game going, and Katherina is a humorous sidekick in many situations. The user interfaces (and the extremely important inventory screens) are a marvel of lay-out and offer whatever you want at a mouse-click. This game offers the perfect example of how developers can make life easy and enjoyable, even in the most complex of situations.\n\nAnd if all of this were not enough, Van Helsing offers perfect integration with Steam through leaderboards, co-op multiplayer, and nearly one hundred achievements which offer an extra challenge and a great fun to hunt after. The three main dlc's are pretty useful too: they offer two new sets of skills & spells so that you can play either as a magic character or as an "arcane mechanic" (have to try that one out sometime). The third dlc offers a new set of skills for your female companion.\n\nHighly recommend, and an essential purchase for everyone who loves a good action rpg.","February 14","true","63.7"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","49","54","0","1"

It was pretty good, the graphics were fine (nothing great), the story was very average (the usual save the world from the bad-guy & his minions), & the gameplay was similar to Torchlight/Diablo ARPG's.\nI ended up with 73/95 Achievements, & that's ok with me. To get them all you would need to do multiple playthrough's, & i wasn't impressed enough to want to replay it, maybe in another year or so.\nAll in all, it was a good game.

It's more loot collecting & monster killing, so if you like that sort of game, you'll like this.\nEnjoy   :)\n","January 27, 2015","true","35.8"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","45","49","4","0"

Well, I loved Diablo 2...but I grew up, got as job, got responsibilities, lost all my free time and any gaming is done briefly. To put it simply - I need bang for my buck.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I'd love to be able to lose myself in Paths of Exiles skill trees, or spend ages on new builds in Torchlight but these don't matter when I have an hour to sit down and, dammit, I wanna see monsters explode and organs fly across the screen while I whirlwind across the screen.\n\nAnd that's why I recommend Van Helsing - it looks good, feels good, sounds good and doesn't require massive amounts of time and commitment - the skill trees are basic, items work well and you feel more or less done once you've played through once.\n\nPick it up in a sale (I think it's worth full price), drop 20ish hours into, reminisce about how terrified you were twenty (!) years ago the first time you heard "Ah, fresh meat!", and appreciate the fun that is Van Helsing.","June 2, 2015","true","24.2"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","40","42","4","0"

They're incredibly funny to listen to. Great dialogue, with very nice voiceovers which seem almost impossibly good for such a small game. The references to other games, books and movies are great and fit the tone, which is always one of (mostly) lighthearted fun. The game is set in a sort of dark steampunk/clockwork setting, but it always aims to amuse and not to drag you down. It doesn't take itself too seriously and that is rare in games like this.\n\nIt is a solid ARPG, and the mechanics are simple and still have depth and it's really fun and rewarding trying out different approaches. You can play your Van Helsing as a gun-toting Monsterhunter or as a sword-fighting Slayer. You can even play him as a Mage. Each class plays very different and you can also adjust your companion similarly, which is a great idea.\n\nAs I said, I got more fun out of this than Torchlight 2, for example (the story here and the graphics fit my tastes better), so it is a definitve must buy for any ARPG fan, especially if it's on sale.","December 14, 2013","true","14.1"," 48 of 57 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","48","57","0","0"

Lovely monster design, great looking levels, and an overall good atmosphere.  Character development is two fold, yourself and your companion can both be upgraded through leveling up and adding not only Ability Points for stats, but Skill points for Skills,(Spells,Attacks, Auras, Tricks, etc.), which opens up the play style for all three classes to your own interuptation quite well. Finished it in around 20hrs, with a few more discovering all the extra the game has to offer after completion, which is a scenario mode for a challenge and chance at some better drops.  Also Neverending Story, which is like a New Game+ mode, where you continue on, but this time, because you'll probably be maxed at level 30, you start to gain Glory, and each level of that, lets you further strengthen and build your character.  Overall I had a great time playing, only had a few bugs here and there, which I've read are being constantly worked on and fixed, and didn't have any trouble running the game, minus extended load times, and an occasion stutter on certain levels due to the sheer amount of plantlife and monsters I suppose.\n\nIn Closing: Worth Picking up if you love Hack N' Slash.  It's not going to be a game changer, but it's a great 20 hours+ depending on your love for the game.

Solid graphics and an extremely well designed world with a steampunk-noir feel. If you're a fan of Torchlight, PoE, Diablo (especially if you were left less than satisfied with Diablo 3) then this should be right up your alley.\n\nThe character development is pretty unique, in a very good way. Each skill offers various "powerups" which you can use during fights to better suit whatever challenge you face. This makes for a very fun combat system that I would love to see more of in the future. Besides skills, you also have the ability to use XP to purchase auras, tricks, and perks. Your companion, Katarina, has her own attributes as well as unique skills which you can select as she levels with you. This all combines to make for one of the most customizable games I've played in a while.\n\nFor this quality and the playtime which it offers this game is well worth the purchase, especially if you factor in the replay value which the DLC's bring with their addictional classes. This game seems to go on sale fairly frequently, so if you can manage to catch it during one of those times you'll be getting more than your moneys worth.","March 14, 2014","true","30.9"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeBerduk/recommended/215530/","LeBerduk","LeBerduk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeBerduk/","129 products in account","Played the game on hard mode.\nThe previous reviews pretty much summarized the good sides of this game:\n- Well designed world.\n- Some really nice background music (definitely getting game OST if there is one).\n- Attractive graphics.\n- Highly customizable settings (could play this game on my laptop).\n- Some interesting references to pop culture (really liked Baggins dude!).\n- Good voice acting.\n- Decent storyline.\n\nBut all in all I would advise you to avoid this game. Here is why:\n- If you do not buy DLCs then there is only one character class you can 'choose' from. The character can do both melee and range attacks, however, due to horrible difficulty balance I had to specialize only on one attack type. The result is there is not a lot of variation in the action.\n- Except very rare short conversations, the sidekick ghost lady is useless. She dies really fast and eats up all the health potions. I have ended up keeping her in a ghost form all the time. The result is the game would not change much if she was removed completely.\n- The game gives you impression of customization, but it actuallly punishes you for doint it. After mid point of the game, customization becomes really expensive and you can end up spending all the gold and still not getting what you want.\n- The essense system (aka gems and gem slots) is useless. Items where you can put gems are rare. If one is found then usually it does not have enough essense capacity to put useful essense. You can use an essense to increase the capacity but during my 27 hours of gameplay I had collected only 3 capacity increasing essense. Finally, there is not a lot of variation in essense types. I had collected only 20 or so different essense types during the entire game!\n- The fighting becomes really repetitive quite fast. There are many enemies that look different, but really just a skin deep difference. All off them can be categorized into melee enemies that charge in mass, melee enemies with hooks and ranged enemies. There is no interesting behavior from AI. More challenging enemies have simply 1) more HP and higher defense points, 2) just attack in bigger numbers, or 3) have more HP and defense and attack in higher numbers. It is not possible to use interesting tactics. Most of my gameplay consisted of repeating two things: have a short skirmish and then running away to use potion before having another short skirmish. Bullet spongy enemies just killed all the fun for me in this game. Most annoying are the enemies with hooks. It is not possible to predict or avoid hooks using your skills. The hook animation is instantaneous. The problem is, at least on higher difficulty, if you get hooked then you are basically dead.\n- Horrible camera angles. It is not possible to control the camera. Did I tell you about enemies with hooks? Well many times I was hooked by enemies I could not even see. I am not even talking about number of times I was shot at by enemies outside of the screen.\n- Bad character controls. There is no keyboard-based movement control. Mouse is used to click on a place where you want to move your character. Sounds good enough right? Well not. Combined with horrible camera angles and enemies swarming everywhere you will end up in many situation where you cannot find a free space to click on and move your character. I ended up more than dozen times dead because my character refused to move. The complexity of the surrounding world makes the situation even worse because it is not immediately obvious where you can and cannot click.\n\nIf you are looking for a good ARPG then go for Path of Exile. PoE is superior to this game in everyway. Plus, PoE is free, and there is no DLC nonsense.","December 23, 2013","false","53.4"," 77 of 114 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","77","114","0","9"

I've seen games that were a lot worse in the last couple of months. Van Helsing brings nothing new to the table but is enjoyable nevertheless. If you ever played Diablo or Torchlight, or any other aRPG, you know exactly what to expect. Lots of killing, upgrading, sidequests to complete and loot to collect. This game has tons of loot, by the way. Maybe not all useful, but enough to let you choose your own equipment, creating a character based on your preferences. Same goes for the skills and perks. Plenty of choice here.\n\nThe game is pretty challenging, but it's not because of its carefully placed (groups of) enemies, but because of the fact that enemies are on every corner of the road, never alone and always in groups. It feels like the developer just spammed enemies on the map, not knowing it would result in difficulty spikes. These enemies frequently get mixed up with a bunch of elites/uniques as well, making the game even harder than it probably should be.\nPlease note that I do like a challenge, as long as it's fair.\n\nGraphically it looks pretty and it runs reasonably well, despite its framerate issues.\nThe voice acting is mediocre, but I guess it gets the job done. There isn't a lot of acting anyway, so it's alright.\n\nVan Helsing doesn't do anything particularly wrong except for the enemy placement, and what's there is mostly good fun so if you'd like to have a cheap but lenghty aRPG give this one a spin.\n\n[Rating: 72/100]","June 1, 2013","true","12.8"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","26","33","0","1"

Environments and most models of the enemy creatures were designed pretty well, but sadly the characters of people felt 'just' boring.\n\nAnimations\n\nThe animated events that happened while playing were nicely done, but that can't be said for animations of your character, Katarina and other enemies, which felt too repetitious, harsh and halting, that definitely spoiled the feeling of a smoother and more efficient gameplay.\n\n\nSound & Music\n\nThe voice acting and other sounds in this game were mostly bad and disappointing, but the soundtrack was good and enjoyable.\n\nStory\n\nEven the Blizzard's Diablo, with its all magnificence in every aspect, sometimes fell short in the story, so there's not much to say about the story of Van Helsing. I completed the first chapter which seemed really short with a main story that wasn't any special (with a few side quests). Second chapter put me in exploring of a steampunk city called Borgova, which I personally found a little better. But because of bad gameplay mechanics and other repetitive elements were 13 hours spent in the game just enough for me to get an overall impression and write a review.\n\nGameplay\n\nMany players complained about the difficulty of this game, which is really hard even on normal settings! But the problem isn't just in some ridiculously 'strong' enemies, but in the hordes that attack you all at once. That's when the game of a cat and mouse begin, which really spoils the charm of your gameplay and feels totally unbalanced.\n\nIf you have ever played Dota 2 or (to be more fair and precise) Diablo III or some other quality hack'n'slash rpgs and truly experienced (mastered?) their gameplay, than you should know how far superior are their gameplay mechanics to the game like The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. It definitely tries and has some new cards in its hands, but it doesn't come really close.\n\n\nConslusion\n\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing has some new ideas and approaches in this genre and some of its parts are done pretty well, but on the other hand lacks of some vital and more polished details that would make this game a truly unique gaming experience ...\nReplay value: This game was built for it, but in my opinion: NO.\n\nRecommended: Yes, but ONLY ON SALE!\n\n\nby Garret A.M.","November 1, 2015","true","13.8"," 36 of 51 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","36","51","4","0"

Except there are a few twists that make Van Helsing worth picking up.\n\n+The story is filled with entertaining humor.\n+You get a game-long companion in the form of a ghost named katarina, similar to the companion in Torchlight. Every one of her lines are witty and help the humor and flavor of the game.\n+There is a large set of skill trees to customize your character AND katarina with. While you cannot max it out, I enjoy how it forced me to assign certain roles to myself and Katarina.\n+There is functioning co-op. Further being able to assign roles with friends and their katarinas really helped make the game fun. And there are plenty of modes you can play with your friends.\n+PLENTY OF LOOT.

The art design really helps create an atmosphere in which you can get immersed into this game.\n-There's a SINGLE broken quest in this game. They are never going to fix it. It's a side quest so it's not game-breaking. But do know you will NEVER be able to finish every quest in this game.\n+A very innovative and interesting tower-defense 'minigame' is in this.

If those don't turn you on however, then it's just an average ARPG like PoE, Diablo, and Torchlight- with nothing setting it apart other than that.\n\nI give it an 8/10.

It has some great successes, and some great failures in this goal.  After almost finishing the game, I have to say I'm not feeling as good about it as when I started.\n\nThe game follows the structure you'd expect: you run around, kill monsters, do quests, get loot.  Combat is mediocre, not having much feedback and pretty poor animations and sound, though the graphical effects are nice.  The game likes to throw massive hordes of enemies at you though so that does liven things up a bit.\n\nThe skill system is interesting an unique, though I don't think it's been balanced very well.  You have a set of skills in 2 trees encompassing melee, ranged, and magic attacks as well as a few passive skills.  Each skill unlocks powerup abilities when you put enough points in which you have to activate manually by consuming rage (which you gain from killing monsters.)  It's a nice system that keeps you focused on what you're doing, though I wish there was a bit more flexibility and variety in it.\n\nThe quests are well done for the most part.  There are a few choices to be made, and the quests that feel rather bland your ghost companion will make snarky comments about.  I feel safe saying she's the best character in the game and she does a pretty good job livening things up.\n\nThe graphics are very good, though unfortunately the loading times are very high due to this.  The engine is fairly scalable and it runs decently on older computers though not as well as I'd like.  It does its job well and is surprisingly stable considering how buggy other aspects of the game are.\n\nI've run into a lot of situations where clicking to walk up a staircase makes me run down the staircase to try to get underneath it, or trying to hit an enemy with a spell shoots it straight into the ground.  Enemy selection boxes always seem to be the wrong size, feeling extremely large when you need to move so all you can do is attack, and extremely small when you're trying to hit them so you only seem to be able to move.  I don't know why these games have so much trouble with selection boxes these days, Diablo 3 had plenty of problems with this as well.  Multiplayer has done really strange things to save games (though I believe the devs have fixed most of this,) only saving progress on the host's save and even replacing your gear with completely random items.  Somehow my character was missing an NPC in the second hub town so I didn't have a shop available for a long time due to these bugs.\n\nNow the game's greatest failing is balance.  The early game is very easy, and ramps up very suddenly later in the game.  Certain enemies do tons of damage and come in massive hordes, all but guaranteeing your death unless you play a melee tank.  In fact, melee tank seems to be the only real choice as it does the most damage as well as being the only survivable build.  What really put the nail in the coffin for me playing a magic user, however, was reaching the final boss and finding him impossible to beat.  So much for that.\n\nSo while being initially excited and quite enjoying the game, after reaching the end I have to say, wait for Grim Dawn.  Maybe it can breathe life back into this genre like no other games seem to be able to.  If you can't wait, give Marvel Heroes a try.","July 30, 2013","false","21.8"," 40 of 63 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","40","63","0","2"

It also has odd Tower Defense sequences thrown in at the end (think Sanctum, but with ARPG instead of FPS mechanics).\n\nThe itemization is solid, albeit relatively unimaginative. Apart from well balanced base rolls and selection of basic, magic, rare, set, and unique items, you can further enhance your gear by adding a stat (Enchant) to any item for cost, and some items can hold "essences" (a sort of socketing system, minus the sockets) for even more customization. There is also gambling and a limited form of crafting (item rerolls/recycling via Artifact Forge).\n\nFor those of you wondering - you can respec individual skill and stat points at (relatively low) cost (or all points at once for Katarina), so there is freedom to experiment and no need to grind out multiple characters to experience the entire skill tree.\n\nEspecially notable is your companion ghost, Lady Katarina, who serves as both a wose-cracking companion to make your single player adventure less lonely, and an able fighter in her own right, with her own equipment slots, inventory, skill trees, and behavior settings. She can also go shopping for you.\n\nThe most disappointing aspect is the prevalence of bugs, which have been getting fixed over time, but are still apparent as of writing. This includes some game breaking bugs that make it impossible or difficult (via a workaround) to progress with the main quest.\n\nThe low metacritic can largely be explained by the shortcomings of the original release, which have since been amended via updates and DLC. The updates include additional endgame content (high level "scenarios", Glory System (perks for completing scenarios), and a new game+ mode).\n\nDLC adds two character classes (previously there was just one, with a melee, ranged, and magic path), a passive skill tree for Katarina, and more endgame content (high level "scenarios", and a new game+ mode). Not having played the DLC classes yet, I can't comment on whether they are worth it. Blue Blood basically makes Katarina substantially more powerful, which is certainly eyebrow raising, but that DLC could be skipped with limited gameplay consequences.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game as an enjoyable diversion for any fan of ARPGs, especially for anyone looking for an atmospherically unusual ARPG or fans of the source material, but keep in mind that my own experience was limited to single player.","December 8, 2013","true","30.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

The atmosphere somehow reminded me of London as imagined by Conan Doyle as well as Transylvania as portrayed by Bram Stocker in "Dracula".\nThe soundtrack is great and it fits perfectly with the dark foggy streets full of strange creatures hiding in the shadows. It's really hard to tell how much it adds to the game feeling but it's obviously, once you start playing, that the game wouldn't be the same with a different soundtrack.\n\nThe game features 3 classes, The Hunter, The Thaumaturge and The Arcane Mechanic, the last 2 being sold separately as 2 DLCs.\n\nEach class has a very complex skill system, with multiple skill trees as well as many abilities that can be both, passive or active. While this can be frustrating for those who don't like to replay the game, due to the fact that it's quite impossible to complete a skill tree in a single playthrough, unless you wonder around and kill monsters just for fun, this makes more sense if you plan on playing the sequel, since you can import everything and continue from where you left.\n\nThe main character, Van Helsing, also has his own companion, Lady Katerina, the ghost of a noble lady. Just like Van Helsing, Lady Katarina has her own skill system with a few active and passive skills as well as different combat modes (melee, ranged). You can also set her to attack those who attack you, those you are attacking or anyone around or you can tell her to stay out of battle. She can be very useful when you're overwhelmed and she can also go grab loot for you and sell/buy items.\n\nVoice acting and dialog is great and you can actually see the chemistry between Van Helsing and Lady Katarina.\n\nThe game also has a lot of pop culture references to movies/games like The Witcher and Lord Of The Rings.\n\nUnfortunately, for those who are used to games like Diablo and Torchlight, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, is a hard game and sometimes it can be very frustrating and cheap.\n\nThere are moments when you will be overwhelmed by creatures 2+ levels ahead of you, in confined spaces and if their huge health given by the higher level won't be a problem for you, the huge number will eventually make it impossible for you to move so you'll just have to wait for your inevitable death and respawn.\n\nOverall, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a great game that will please many Diablo/Torchlight fans.\n\n8.5/10","June 28, 2015","true","25.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

But you get only one class with the game itself and 2 more as DLCs. You can differently build that single class, but there isn't much skills to chose from anyway.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/recommended/215530/","Brogbo","DrBrogbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/","1650 products in account","Rating - 84/100\nRecommendation - There's something for everyone. Even non-ARPG-fans.\n\nIt is a travesty how far under the radar this game has flown. Even rather diehard ARPG fans have overlooked it, which is not only a sin, but should also be a crime. This game is GREAT.\n\nAll the hallmarks of a modern ARPG are here: Hordes and hordes of enemies, quick level-ups, copious perks and skill points, gigantic boss monsters, and a minion you can outfit who levels up alongside you. There are 3 acts, waypoints, hidden quests, socketables, stashes, etc.\n\nDon't go thinking this game is just like every other ARPG, however. There are a number of ways Van Helsing differs from its siblings.\n\nThe main surprise for me was how Lady Katarina (Van Helsing's companion) feels like a fully-fledged player character. Her skills can be absurdly powerful, and you can build her to either be completely passive and only provide boosts to Van Helsing, or as a hell-raising destruction machine (with Van Helsing providing boosts to her if wanted). She has a full set of skills, mildly-programmable AI, and nearly the same amount of equipment options as Van Helsing himself. While minions in other games really feel like nothing more than pets, Katarina felt more like a full co-op partner.\n\nAnother part that surprised me was the skill system. When you level up, you earn points that you can use to unlock skills and skill upgrades. In battle, you can use your mana to unleash special attacks, and use so-called rage points (you have a rage meter that charges up as you use regular attacks) to add modifiers to your skills. For example, you can use a lightning strike that sends 3 small electric tendrils snaking out along the ground, and you can use your rage points to add additional tendrils, increase the damage, or add a stun effect. Each modifier can be stacked up to 3 times, and the effects can be devastatingly powerful. Rage charges up rather slowly, though, so it's best to save them up for any one of the brutally-difficult boss fights.\n\nSpeaking of difficulty, this game skates the same tough-but-doable line that other recent ARPGs (other than Diablo 3) have. It's also worth mentioning that playing in co-op increases the difficulty drastically. I found it much easier when I played in single player, so bring a friend who knows what they're doing.\n\nOverall, I have nothing that I can complain about with this game. The graphics are great, the voice acting is well-done and often hilarious, the multiplayer is stable, the combat is visceral and entertaining, the skill system is unique and robust, the difficulty is even and fair, the story is interesting, the game length is just right, and the whole affair is filled with the mindless slaughtering of countless enemies that you've come to know and love. There are riddles, cultural references, ethereal "rift" sections, and even a few little tower defense distractions.\n\nIf you are at all a fan of ARPGs, I honestly cannot recommend it enough. Even if you aren't a fan of the genre, this one does just enough things differently that you will likely find something to enjoy. If not, well, at least it's cheap.\n\n-DrB","July 23, 2014","true","16.3"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

Good interface and interesting monsters to slay (available in great quantities). Replayable and good for multiplayer.\n\nThis is one of the best aRPG games I've ever played.

Except D2:LoD, none managed to kept my attention - sure, I played them, finished them but always returned to good'ol.\n\nWhat I have to say it that this game for me is second to D2:LoD only - with a chances to even surpasses it, never forget that this is only one third of full game. What made me put an unfinished game over, for instance D3 or PoE? Regarding D3 - Van Helsing is what D3 should have been. Regarding PoE - it's a close match, but i prefer graphics, interface and overall feeling to a more complex and somewhat confusing skill system. Don't get me wrong, I've played fair share of both, regretting deeply what D3 could become and seeing potential in PoE.\n\nGame itself is fun to play, even repeatedly over and over. Price is fine, and you don't REALLY need paid DLCs (except 1.5EUR "Blue Blood") - the basic game brings more builds and customization of character than whole D3 - and I stand firmly behind this claim. Interface is excellent, any D2 veteran will find himself at home. So is the monster density and constant action (but with good measure!). Character progression is good, there is a 'respec' option (I don't like it personally, but it seems like a trend nowadays), but some choices are permanent, as it should be.\n\nVoice casting is excellent, and dialogues between main character and ghost sidekick (which can be customized almost as much as main character, making a deadly duo in fight, and source of fun inbetween - again, clever dialogues doesn't make it boring).\n\nI was with the game since release, and developer team knows what they are doing - many additions/changes were always for the better - I've returned to the game after few months hiatus and got surprised by amount of small, but important quality oflife improvements.

And new feeling and better endgame.\n\nPros:\n- High technical quality (graphics, sound, voice-acting)\n- Various builds for each character\n- Complex companion development, something unseen in aRPG before\n- Intriguing (and unfinished) storyline\n- A unique game settings: alternate history with slavic mythology mixed with steampunk, working PERFECTLY\n- Storytelling is very good\n- Game lore is excellent, and so are little details who mean much - names of the people, equipment etc - all very atmospheric\n- Character progression is complex, depending on several separated systems - dwarfing D3, keeping in line with PoE (on a different level, though) and succeeding D2:LoD rapidly\n\nCons:\n- Non-random maps and moster type/positions\n- Lack of random events and quest\n- Scripted story - not really a problem, but little more open game with randomization and wide range of optional quests appearing randomly - would add more replayability. There is a replayability value, don't get me wrong, but more never hurts\n- Bugs in multiplayer - once plagued the game, now mostly fixed - and this 'mostly' is why I mention this.

As of myself, I've bought several copies as a gifts to my friends. DLCs add multiplayer value - you can have dedicated melee/ranged/caster characters (and companions with different builds!) with regular game, and it's way better than parties in D3, but DLCs add more.\nIf you like D2:LoD, you'll probably like Van Helsing - it is true spiritual successor of a legendary game. If you think that D3 is what aRPG should be, you probably should try anyway - just to see a different side of a coin, how modern game functions with different mechanics.

Overall, not touching it again. TLDR on the bottom.\n\n+ Decent storytelling, somewhat involved.\n+ Comments from Lady Katarina are pretty amusing.\n+ Good pacing, good attribute system, fairly decent itemization (by comparison, MILES ahead of Diablo 3).\n- Little enemy variety, weird incoming damage at times.\n- Skill variety on the Hunter class is extremely poor. A handful of reskinned shots, didn't really feel progression or much weight from using differerent skills. Same deal goes for the melee tree.\n- BUGS. Oh the bugs. One of my hunter tricks crashed multiplayer games when I hosted, had to respec / avoid using skill to keep playing. The "slow time" skill on the Thaumaturge often bugged entire maps, lasting forever and then on a second cast engaging turbo mode. Random client crashes every 20-30 minutes.\n\nTLDR: The game is not entirely bad, but does not warrant a positive review.

This game succeeds on that front unquestionably.\n\nIdeally for 2-4 players, I actually just finished the entire game solo. Be forewarned, if you're not an ARPG guy, you're even in for a rough time on easy difficulty, which I all but mandate in your first playthrough. This game will swarm your ♥♥♥ like Starship troopers with things that do not, I repeat NOT, die in 1, 2, even 5 hits. It's rough, and it works for the setting and the game.\n\nNow at this point the average Joe has some idea of what they're in for, so maybe you ARPG die hards are now asking: "What's in it for me?" Well I'll tell you!\n\nGreat music: I had to talk about this here. It's a standard we all have with games of substance, especially a good APRG. This game delivers EXCESSIVELY. The entire score features soft harps and pianos, things you would expect to hear in this alternative dark fantasy Transylvanian tale. Hit up youtube and hear some of it for yourself. This is one of few games that I actually left on while I wrote the review because of how great an atmosphere the menu theme provided.\n\nStory: One thing I found funny about a game as goofy as Torchlight 2 is that it took its Story as seriously as Diablo did. This flip flops- very believable, gritty, down to earth graphics, sounds, and atmopshere, totally slapstick everything else. The characters engage in light heartened banter while picking up quests, interacting with objects, and more. ♥♥♥♥, there's even a message board in town at the beginning that is for nothing beyond "click for great pop culture reference." It's a true joy to experience.\n\nGameplay: Not much not already said here, You are in for a challenge, no way around that. A fun challenge with friends, but a challenge. Bring your A game, this game's "easy" is NOT TL2's.\n\nFresh and new ideas: Ever think how badass it'd be to properly have your own hideout/camp, or even gather resources and build ♥♥♥♥ in a game like an ARPG? well VH almost delivers. I can't say there's any proper crafting, but midway your township where your vendors reside can actually get attacked, and you play a metagame of tower defense to protect it. Very innovative IMHO, and successful.\n\n\nOverall, if forcibly shoehorned into rating it on a 1-10 scale, which I like to refrain from, I would call this game a 7 without question. Flawed, buggy still, but the devs care about the latter and are working on it, it's an all out riot most of the time, and most important of all- it's fricken $10 until the 2nd. Consider snagging it if you're a fan of the genre, or even a new guy looking for a semi hardcore trial by fire.","December 22, 2013","true","20.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If you call any isometric hack and slash RPG a Diablo rip-off, then yes, this is it.\nHowever, it puts its own spin on the genre and taking a lot from what Diablo did well, and added some things it maybe could have used.\nYou play as Van Helsing, of the Monster Hunter lore, as one of three classes: Hunter, Thaumaturge, and Arcane Mechanic; each with it's own set of skills and abilities. The monsters and creatures you face are the ever-familiar brand you'd find in any fantasy setting, such as Rat-men, undead zombies, giant behemoths, acid-spitting breeders, and even automatons. From what I can tell, the story is pretty straightforward and can be completed in about 15 hours, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth your time.\nThe inventory system is top-notch, taking much from Diablo where you have to arrange your items according to their size and shape in a grid fashion. You are provided with a storage that you can access through the town areas and depending on your choice of perk, you can store more than just a single page.\nYour companion through the game is Lady Katarina, a ghost of someone who knows the Van Helsing line quite well. She can be customized to be completely support (no fighting), ranged, melee, defense, attack, etc. She can even be configured to grab items from the battlefield according to their type or value. She can be sent to the store (like a town portal) to sell loot she's carrying and even buy potions if needed.\nThey kept with the waypoint system of using an "ink gate" which allows you to teleport to the various areas you've discovered, as well as use a town portal for yourself.\nThere's plenty of side-quests and the various tasks to keep you busy (as mundane as they can be sometimes), the rewards are quite worth it.\nEach character has a skill tree that can be traversed as you gain levels by investing skill points. There are class-specific skills (main attacks and passive abilities), tricks (which are like sub-skills), and auras (which are passive bonuses). There's also a perk system that allows you to choose various character bonuses as you gain reputation (how well you're known around the land -- kill lots of stuff).\nThe HUD and interface are very easy to navigate, it's very hot-key friendly, and the music/controls are top-notch.\n\nThe game also supports multiplayer as well, so you can team up with friends to take on the monsters of Borgovia.\n\nIt's not the most revolutionary game out there, but I think anyone who's a fan of the lore and liked Diablo (maybe even those who didn't) will enjoy this game.","December 31, 2013","true","19.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If you've played several ARPG's already, you'll know how they basically all share the same concept and pretty much are one in the same, perhaps the only difference would be the actual story, and even then it can become quite monotonous and you don't actually end up following it.\n\nSurprisingly, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is nothing like that! Sure it may be a hack 'n slash clickfest, but within its core lies a beautiful system unlike any other! The fast paced combat, the synergy with abilities and auras/tricks as well as the ability to craft (transmute) and enhance your items by adding and combining "essences" combined with a rather interesting story that one cannot help but follow (as there isn't many side quests to get lost on) makes for one hell of a good time in the beautiful world of Borgovia!\n\nI can however say from experience having played several ARPG's that this is by far the more challenging of the lot I've actually come across, and I mean that in a really good way. Though I did play on Hard it felt more like Hell of Diablo II right from the get go, and loot certainly wasn't overpowering (I was playing the newly released Thaumaturge class and it seems there isn't much unique loot as compared to the original Hunter class which every second unique I got was for it).\n\nThe gameplay is really well polished, and so too are the graphics, which is surprising for an Indie release! I honestly cannot find any faults with the game itself, perhaps only that it was rather short (30 odd hours exploring EVERYTHING) but it strikes the perfect balance and somehow doesn't take you on a grindfest to actually progress and unlock everything you need or want! So all in all this is definitely a game I would recommend to any ARPG fans who loved Diablo or Torchlight!","March 5, 2014","true","67.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

The questing is always about killing someone which ofc can be expected from this type of game and it might smother the enthusiast of some hard core RPG fans but aside from that it’s a very solid title.\nCrafting and enchanting provide plenty of variety; some interesting tower defence experiments were a fun idea as well.

The game’s ambience of nighttime villages and murky swamps accompanied by a greatly appropriate soundtrack will keep you playing until your index finger gets numb.\n\nCharacter class and selection is so varied the game will probably warrant more than a single playthrough to flesh out all of its possibilities. Upon seeing the blank skill tree when first starting out it’s almost mind blowing to wonder where you’re going to put all of the skills, perks and auras the game allows you to. It’s not quite the endless skill tree as Path of Exile, but it’s deep enough you’ll feel your character grow as you play. Enemies come in waves, overwhelmingly so. I played a range character and being able to kite the enemies helped somewhat. If you decide to play as a melee class I think you’ll have your work cut out for you.\n\nNeocore is a small publisher out of Hungary, and big publishers could take some lessons from these guys. I’ve never had the desire to play an RPG through more than once until I played this. Despite the trappings, however, all is not perfect. There was no game manual included in the download, and for the developers to instruct players to read online forums and watch online videos to learn simple instructions about the game bears little in the way of professionalism. Once I learned how “rage” (the energy required to do super attacks, acquired through killing NPCs) worked I was able to accomplish much more. Some creatures in the game had an attribute called Abomination. I never did find out exactly what that was. And the final boss fight involved a lot of lag for me. I died many times because I simply lagged out. Definitely not a deal breaker, but it made that final fight more difficult than it had any right to be. This may or may not be an issue affecting anybody else. I have a state of the art rig, and I was surprised the lag even occured.\n\nStill, I’m glad I found this game. I look forward to playing through it again, experimenting with another class. And then I’ll look forward to tackling Neocore’s sophomore effort, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II.\n","December 7, 2014","true","61.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

I did not purchase the DLC, as I got this game on sale at a much earlier point in time and only played it recently.  I did play the game on a normal difficulty setting, single player only.  If you are looking for a review of DLC or Multiplayer content, this is not for you.\n\nVan Helsing is filled with hand crafted art and textures, fair story writing, and the occassional surprising content.  There are quite a few references to what I imagine are their influences in game and story design.  On the flip side, I felt like the gameplay was lacking.  I also felt like the story was developing into something exciting, and quickly sputtered off like they lost the inspiration to keep going.\n\nI spent the first half of the game excited and drawn in.  The second half I felt like the gameplay had devolved into holding down the right mouse button waiting for my skills to kill ever increasing numbers of the same types of enemies.  It took me about 20 hours to finish based on my play time.  I felt like the skill trees had some fun possibilities, but nothing inspired me to branch out from what worked in the first hours of the game.\n\nIt was worth finishing the game to me, but I did feel this sense of, "Was that it?" --\n\nI don't know that I could recommend this game to everyone.  I felt like it was worth the sale price I paid for it, and the 20 hours I invested in finishing it.  If it matters to those reading this I do not feel like its worth a replay, and I am not interested in DLC for it.  If I was to attach an arbitrary number to the game in regards to a "score", I would probably say a 60%.  It doesn't fail to create a fun game to play, but it did lack some kind of wow factor.","January 5, 2014","true","20.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

However, if you're new to the genre or a fan of hack and slash loot fests, you're in luck! Van Helsing manages to provide an entertaining experience throughout its ten or so hour campaign (more so if you're an explorer like myself who likes to uncover all of the map).\n\nYou take on the role of the famous Van Helsing (well one of them, his son to be exact) as he and his companion the ghostly Lady Katarina attempt to save the day as monsters and science collide to bring about death and destruction upon Borgovia. You empower the great monster hunter and snappy ghost with a variety of skills from melee to ranged attacks and can even increase your attack power or versatility mid combat by powering up said abilities. Although an interesting attempt at creating options in combat, I will admit I hardly ever used said system myself, as I created a character who got his benefits from not using Rage, the resource that powers the stronger attacks.\n\nThe world itself is really well created with a lot of detail, creating a great mood as you hack and slash through groups of monsters. The encounters themselves are well balanced, but grow repetitive as you encounter the same groups of enemies again and again, a bit more variation in group makeup would have been welcome, but it's a slight issue rather than a deal breaker. Of course, the most important element for a game like this...the loot, is frequent and diverse. I was often switching over to newly acquired items or optimising my build.\n\nI must admit, I really enjoyed playing the game. The grim world is lightened with a sprinkling of humour, especially the witty banter between Van Helsing and Lady Katarina throughout the game, which is well acted and entertaining. The game itself is also littered with cultural references, if something is clickable, its likely Van Helsing has something to say about it that'll bring a smile to your face. I also found myself really enjoying the music, while not overly diverse, it's rather lovely and fits the world well.\n\nListed under 'Main Features' is a section on building and developing traps to defend your lair. It's worth mentioning this is more of a brief distraction and isn't very deep. Those looking for a bit of tower defence in their ARPG might be a bit disappointed, despite the developers best intentions.\n\nI really do recommend the game to fans of action roleplaying games or for someone that fancies a simple, yet entertaining story with a touch of humour and a great deal of sparkly objects bursting out of everything you touch.","September 18, 2014","true","15.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

Van Helsing combines a lot of the quality-of-life tweaks developers have been adding onto the genre ever since Diablo 2 became bigger than sliced bread. Some of these include the companion and pet system, the ability to respec your character without ever having to be afraid of gimping them, and the ability to disenchant and unsocket weapons without destroying either weapon or gem. However, the game is plagued by tons of bugs and performance issues and its multiplayer component should not even be considered playable.\n\nIssues in co-op:\n- The questline is not saved unless you are the host. Either play through the game entirely with a party or play it solo.\n- The tower defense portion and all the Secret Lair upgrades are inaccessible to anyone who is not the host.\n- Constant crashing when transitioning between areas.\n\nIf you're opting for a single player only experience, then you'll get an average game that never takes off or goes anywhere. Remember, this is part 1 of an unfinished trilogy. Van Helsing lacks replay value as well. The level cap is 30 and there is no real endgame content. While the combat is genuinely fun despite adding nothing new to the genre, the customization options are very weak due to limited skill trees.\n\nNeoCore have rushed out an average game then proceeded to sell extra content for it without fixing longstanding issues. Both extra character classes, and the 2nd skill tree for Katarina, were sold for real money which is absolutely deplorable for an action RPG. Let’s not forget that people who pre-ordered this game got an exclusive permanent boost to their magic find. If you plan on buying the 2nd game, you can probably expect the same treatment. Buy a buggy game for $15, then pay $10 for additional content. These 3 games and all their content combined will end up costing you more money than a new game in the long run.\n\nUnless you've experienced every action RPG on the market right and starving for more, then there is no way I can recommend this title.\n\nMy full video review is available at:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJZn7fde1J4","February 3, 2014","false","17.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Over-the-top monsters, decent world building and (for me) much more fun than Diablo 3. I wanted something that dealt with the supernatural and I wanted to kill a lot of monsters and this game gave me just that. I was already a big fan of the character's history and mythos (even though it's his son in this instance) I was very satisfied to step into the shoes of the world famous monster hunter. On the gameplay side of things, because I'm building strictly for ranged combat I like being able to set the behaviours of my companion Katarina and build her toward being a melee tank complimenting my own playstyle. The controls took a bit of getting used to, but they're quite cleverly implemented in that per shot you can decide which type of special round you'd like to load up into the gun. I'm still only very early into the game, but one of my favourite implementations that they've brought to the genre that I haven't seen anywhere else is that when you find a legendary item to gain it's full benefits you need to use the weapon to get kills in specific ways which unlock the item's abilities. It's one of those neat minor additions that helps keep the game interesting. Overall it has been a solid experience and I hope that this franchise can manage to keep going on strong.","October 3, 2014","true","9.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't been playing on Hard difficulty, but the lack of variation in enemy AI and length of time every enemy took to kill really wore on me.\n\nGo download some mods for Torchlight II if you want to reinvigorate your Diablo-like experience.","March 4, 2014","false","9.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I was not wrong!  Besides the initial issue I had with DirectX (had to install DirectX 9 again), I had no problems or obvious bugs so far.  The game has performed well on my i7, 12GB memory, with SSD, and a GTX670 graphics card.\n\nSome users I noticed on the Steam forum have been having problems with the game not starting.  My wife and eldest son both play the game, and both had no problems.  But be aware that this seems to be happening with some people.  There is a dev that is on the forums at least trying to help now and then.\n\nTakes a short while to figure out the Rage, powerup settings and tricks, but once that is done, the rest of the game is easy to understand and grasp.  Pretty linear, just follow the quest markers.  Keep the tutorial on so you can easily get the initialy help you likely will need to better userstand the game.  Even then, you may need to play around a bit to fully understand the rage and powerup settings.  You can reset your abilitys, so don't worry about it being set in stone forever... just costs gold.\n\nGraphics and audio is great.  The audio is enjoyable and fits the action adventure gameplay.\n\nSome pointers:\n\n1. Take note that you can only have 10 perks during your 30 levels.  Many better perks don't show up initially in the game, so you may need to hold out before selecting.  Otherwise, find a resource online somewhere that provides all the perks and wait for the ones you want once you have seen them all.  Unlike your abilities and skills, you can't reset your perks.\n\n2. There is no save option, so you will always return to the waypoint (or "ink" point) of a certain area after you exit.  There is a setting in options that allows you stop the monsters from respawning if you exit.  Respawning after death costs money.  Once you get to your lair, you will be able to return to your lair for no cost.  Then you just run back to where ever you were when you died.  In general, the run back is not long for any place, so not a problem if you are a money scrooge.\n\n3. If you play all the quests, including most side quests, there is no need to grind for loot and leveling . Once you get further into the game, you can obtain a lot of loot by repeatedly killing certain mobs, bosses or champs, though in general there is no need to do this unless you want epic loot for all pieces of armour... and even more gold.  Gold is NOT difficult to come by.\n\n4. Your ghost, Lady Katarina, can be setup to pick up items for you.  Any items like potions and gold will be picked up on YOUR behalf.  So you will auto receive the items she gets.  She just saves you the inconvenience of going to collect them at times.  If you want her to actually use healing potions herself, you must specifically give them to her, and they will go in her potion's inventory tab.  On the other hand, the armour and weapons she picks up will go into her inventory.\n\n\nOverall, the game is fun, with some humour thrown in.  Make sure you get the DLC as it will give even more replayability.","January 6, 2014","true","105.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Does everything we want from an ARPG title, and a bit more. Does have some flaw, but not a deal breaker. The first series of a trilogy. Review based on GOTY version as the based version might have other flaws as mentioned by other review.\n\nPro\nMemorable companion. The ghost companion makes me feel like I'm not just going out to kill monster randomly. I’m out for an adventure. She’s a playful character and does make all those little things interesting by her quirky remarks.\nQuest system. The main quest system doesn’t differ much from any other ARPG, but the side quest is where it gets interesting. The game doesn’t use the standard exclamation-mark-quest-here for all quest. The quest might be out there hidden in the nearby area by interactable items. Once you get the item, read what the item tells you and look for any related items in the surrounding area.\nTower defence mini game. The game manages to incorporate a tower defence game without slipping away from its main genre. You can’t fully rely on the traps provided thus you should deploy the trap tactically and let you yourself be the main defence. Unfortunately, there are not much chance to play this mini game and only playable depending on the storyline.\nThe skill systems are well made. You have lots of build choice you can make. With the skill refund, you can change your playstyle midgame. The build might not be well balanced, but it might be just me, not good at creating a build.\nCon\nArtificial difficulty. As other mention, the game uses artificial difficulty by employing a sheer number of enemies. I’m not saying the enemies design are bad, but you always need to fight with a sheer number of them, and by that I mean, a buttload of them up to the point that you can’t move due to being surrounded by them. It is not undefeatable though.\nSome skills are pure useless. The skill itself aren’t bad, but due to the artificial difficulty, some skills, especially single target skills are worthless. You’ll only use AOE skills or you won’t make it to kill each of the enemies one by one.\nThe game feels pretty short. Granted that this is only the first part of a trilogy, but it does feels a bit short. Nevertheless, it makes you want to continue with the second instalment. Probably it’s not really a con point.\nSome bug and glitches can still be seen. For example, the Mana per second for Ray of Destruction skill are listed as Skill.Common.ManaCostPerSecond.\n","March 20","true","23.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Just barely.\n\nPros\n- Great environment\n- Good music\n- Decent voice acting\n- Defending your lair against waves of enemies\n- DLC - Lady Katarina and Thaumaturge class\n- Cool monsters to interact with - rat men, werewolves, and necros\n\nCons\n- Story is a bit muddled.  Individual pieces make sense, but the overall theme gets lost.\n- Display issues.  Played on an older system with Nvidia GTX 560ti and it was almost unplayable with everything cranked down.  Upgraded to basically new everything and ran great with everything cranked to max though I would still login and have to restart my computer sometimes due to graphic bugs.\n- Level cap?!

Some of it probably has to do with a fairly uninspired loot system lacking many interesting and meaningful modifiers, and having it reduced to simply red or green numbers to tell you straight up if it was more dps or not. I'm sure the writing did its share to help out, which seemed to think that if it was somewhat self-aware about being terrible it would be less terrible. The companion system was ok, but didn't feel like it really differentiated itself from, say, Torchlight 2. The tower-defense portion was pretty interesting, but felt kind of tacked-on, and like it took up a lot of space for being so ultimately meaningless. The infusion/enchanting system also seemed to have potential, but most of the ones I found didn't seem like they were that useful so I never really bothered with it.\n\nOverall, it was a thoroughly mediocre hack-n-slass.

I've started out playing it alone, but quickly grew tired of it. There isn't much holding this title up in terms of story or novel game mechanics. This is a classic, if a little simplistic RPG through and through. In co-op, however, I had the chance to play polar opposite builds with my gaming buddy which made for a more interesting, strategy-driven experience. Without this additional challenge, I wouldn't have found the incentive to ever finish this game.\nYour ghostly companion has a very enticing voice, though.\nAll in all, I don't recommend it.","April 5, 2015","false","30.1"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","13","23","2","0"

Honestly, it was some of the most frustrating gaming I've ever experienced, and if it wasn't for the fact that not many other games of this genre exist, I would've uninstalled it ages ago.\n\nPros:\n- nice atmosphere and art\n- interesting character builds\n- decent story and voice acting\n- the game looks great and runs pretty well - no sudden slowdowns or anything like that\n\nCons:\n- frequent crashing/locking up when doing scene transitions, to the point where we were lucky to play 2h at a time\n- frequent bugs that interrupt the gameplay (ie you are dead and can't respawn, or you respawn in your home-base but are dead and need resurrecting *in the base*)\n- bugs that break missions (had en entire level bug out with no enemies spawning over multiple visits/session, broke the final boss quest 3 or 4 times)\n- ridiculous difficulty. maybe we were playing it wrong after Diablo but dying constantly on Casual difficulty was not fun\n- as a spellcaster, I had frequent lock-ups where a spell would remain stuck casting, so I couldn't cast any other spells and could not move - had to just wait to die and respawn\n\nNot sure how that stacks up in single-player since I was not interested in that aspect, so if you're never intending to play multiplayer read some other reviews.

The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing captures the return of Van Helsing junior to Eastern Europe in order to aid the people of Borgovia in their fight against evil. I didn't get really hooked by the storyline, but the action keeps you moving forward. While there is quite some decent game time before you finish the game, the plot seems rather unfinished. Guess we need to wait until the follow-up game arrives.\nBought the game during a Steam sale, which included all three content DLC. The Blue Blood DLC was particularly useful as it improves the usability of Katerina, your ghostly sidekick. Both Thaumaturge and Arcane Mechanic DLC just add two new classes to play with instead of the default Hunter class. I only played the Hunter class as there wasn't much incentive (expect the odd class side quests) to replay the game with another class. Overall, the game is warmly recommended for both new and experienced action RPG fans.\n\nScore: 7.5/10\n\nPro:\n+ character progression via skills, auras, perks, capabilities...\n+ appealing visuals\n+ Katerina your sidekick\n+ choice between melee & ranged\n+ loot, loot, loot!\n\nContra:\n- character progression doesn't really matter, just stack melee or ranged skills and sweep through the game\n- some bugs, e.g. traps not working, movies not playing (edit: fix was released after I finished the game)\n- lots of crappy loot\n- lack of replayability","March 14, 2014","true","22.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story isn't anything special, but is solid enough.  The skill tree allows you to develop some interesting character builds - swordsman, gunslinger, magic user, or anything in-between.  Mid-way through the game, you're able to re-spec your character or Katerina at will, which gives you a chance to experiment with the various skills & builds.\n\nAside from the occasional obscured camera, I didn't experience any bugs or performance issues (I'm running Win 8.0), although I have seen a few complaints from others.","March 15, 2014","true","31.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You can fight a lot of monsters and develop your skills in a way that expands your gameplay. Even though the plot and characters aren't really "the best" this is still a very good, plain hack'n'slash game. It offers a lot for the price of 3,73€. You should really try it.

Although it does have a few unique features that make it stand out in certain ways, such as a lair defense game which has you defending your secret base from waves of enemies with traps you can upgrade and strategically place about.\n\nThe story is great it kept me interested up until the end.  The AI companion is actually incredibly useful, she has a ton of useful skill points and a ton of options for adjusting her behaviour.\n\nThis game is not as complex as other Action RPG's, Path of Exile for example.

There's a lot of character advancement options, the writing is witty and fun, and the theme is pretty unique (a mixture of steampunk, gothic fiction and folklore undertones). Some slight innovations and experiments give the mechanics of this game a fresh and instantly recognizable feel.\n\nDespite many shortcomings and a general lack of polish in most places, fans of the genre should really check this one out. Keep in mind, however, that after finishing the campaign (which ends around the time you hit the level cap, which isn't too high at 30) there's not much left to do other than start a new character. A definite ending is a nice throwback to the original Diablo and personally, I enjoyed the fact that I can actually complete this game and it will acknowledge that, but I know that this may be an issue for many die-hard fans of the genre.","August 24, 2013","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have already play the Torchlight 2 and the Path of Exile , and i was kinda familiar for this game kind.. Well the game is really cool, it has a nice story , but i think it could be a bit deaper than it is now, but i guess that it will happen in The Sequel of the game that it comes..\nThe basic hero (hunder ) is ok , with some spells/skills be more powerfull than others , the melle is ok , but i prefered to play it on max range with guns... The good thing withthe game is that you can play it the way toy want it , it offers a great variety of gaming styes to chose what you really want..\n\nI replayed as thaumaturge but this clas seemed a bit morre powerfull than the hunter....\ni dont know if this is my idea or not, but i finished the quest faster than the 1st time...\nNow i chosed the neverending story to find more chalenge in the game , which seems cool to me,,\nthe ghost companion is a very good made implement in the game , and i ant to learn more about the lady..its on the high ights of thi game..\n\n\nthe thing tha i dint like a lot is that i was 25-30 lvl and non of the items that i loot was good for me... i was with the same items from lvl 23 or so i think ,, which made the looot a very stupid thing... the only good thing bou t it in high levels is that you could selll them in high prises.. this continues in Neverending story.. i m still with the same item from before enter he mode, which is kinda stupid and boring..\n\nthe replayability of the game  is pretty high and to be honnest is the first time in this kind of games tha i want to keep playing it .. also the achievments are kinda adictive i have to say, and i want to collect them alll..\nthe game ofc is not in the same level as Diablo 3 or POE but it is a great single play game that you hav to try if you are fan of those games!!

They drop loot and gold, you pick it up, and either wear it or sell it. A tried-and-true recipe with little to improve on.\nAnd yet... they managed. The ghost companion provides for rather amusing dialogue and banter, though her shopping spree quips do get old after a while. The setting is a classic, and well done, at that; the monsters are quite appropriate, and the Eastern-Slavic NPC's got at least a chuckle from me.\n\nThe Bad\nMaps are pretty much static; while loot drops are mostly random, the only thing that changes are the shrines - not their position, but only their conferred bonuses. It might not be a big deal, but a touch of variety wouldn't hurt.\n\nThe Ugly\nWithout the DLC's you only get a third of the game: one character out of three. And you still get loot drops for the characters you're missing. So if you're buying, take that into account: whatever the game price, add in the price of all the DLC's.\nThis is not how DLC's should work, much as they often do.","February 27, 2014","true","33.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

However I decided to give it a shot after reading reviews. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is a very good arpg game.\n\nThe game features standard arpg gameplay, well-adapted for using a controller. With dlc there are a few different classes, and different ways to build your character within those classes. The writing is good, with lots of clever banter between Van Helsing, his ghost companion, and sometimes the different characters you meet while adventuring. There are a few offbeat quests and amusing easter eggs to find. These touches help the game to stand out from the average hack n slash arpg. The action is top-notch. Mobs can be huge and overwhelming sometimes. The game definitely keeps you moving while in areas populated by enemies. This, combined with the large variety of monster types definitely keeps the game from getting repetitive. Monster respawn every time you leave an area. Fortunately the respawning can be turned off, and then can be turned on again if you feel you need to grind more xp before progressing further in the game.\n\nOverall I'd give the entire series an 8.5/10. This and its sequel are first class modern arpgs, just as good as Diablo III or Torchlight II.","May 19, 2015","true","52.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Van Helsing and Katarina have great chemistry and quip with eachother the entire game and there is also plenty of humor and jokes hidden throughout. There are a few issues with the game that do hurt my rating of it, though. First, for a dungeon crawler it is pretty short, but it was meant to be a trilogy. Second, the game is very, VERY unbalanced. When the game begins it's simple enough and fun to play, but once you are a couple of hours in the difficulty ramps up out of nowhere and you are constantly dieing and respawning every few minutes and this lasts the rest of the game. Enemies seem to do ungodly amounts of damage and your stats or equipment don't seem to make any difference in how much damage you take or deal. It makes for a very frustrating experience in an otherwise top-notch RPG.

If you liked Titan Quest, this feels like a spiritual successor. It's not very long, guessing around 20 hours. I got it for less than $7 though, and that's a great value. I'll probably replay it at some point as well. I'd say it's easily worth the price at full price too. It feels more engaging than your typical isometric arpg, especially playing at higher difficulties. They made most of the abilities have combinations, so you're constantly doing things. Unless you're playing the game on an easier difficulty, it shouldn't be a matter of spamming a single ability over and over (which is nice compared to a majority of these style games).\n\nThe leveling system feels nice. It's usually exciting to get a new level. There's also a reputation system, where you get to choose a new strong buff after gaining enough reputation. The reputation system felt a bit slow, though. I'm nearly at the end of the game and I've gotten around 6 levels in reputation. The loot system felt on-par with other games in this genre. I got the feeling that there weren't many "set" items, but that actually was a positive thing given the length of the game and it's focus on a single player experience. I was able to complete 2 sets in my playthrough. I usually don't like forced companions in these types of games, but I enjoyed the companion in this one. She had a lot of dialog, and actually felt helpful. She also buffs you as you level her up. There are side quests that give you unique items for the main Hunter class, but you can equip them on your companion if you're not a hunter.\n\nOverall, I had a ton of fun with this game, and I highly recommend it if it's on a sale or even if it's not. Just keep in mind isometric arpgs are not everyone's cup of tea.\n\nI did not try the multiplayer, so I cannot comment on that.","January 9, 2014","true","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This and Torchlight 2 are probably my favourites, and share a lot in common in terms of updating and streamlining the experience. TIAVH is generally a well-made game, and despite some issues with player-character pathfinding, I can't really fault the production quality. It has wonderfully schlocky voice acting, humourous dialogue, lovely visuals, a deep, deep skill tree that you'll never completely discover in one playthorough, a streamlined inventory, tonnes of enemy types, plenty of wonderful locations, and LOTS of loot. The game also rewards you regularly with achievements, which keeps you pushing forward.\n\nWith that being said, it doesn't reinvent the wheel, meaning that some of the clunkier core mechanics of the isometric RPG classics remain intact. Expect repetition, a relentless onslaught of enemies, lots of useless loot, and sharp, frustrating spikes in difficulty, particularly towards the last 25% of the game.\n\nWhile this does stick to a classic (and some might say tired) formula, the depth of the skill trees, the frequent validation by achievements, and the sheer personality of the characters and the world keep me playing onwards.\n\nEven with any gripes I have towards genre, I'd recommend this for full price, as the sheer depth of content will surely leave you feeling satisfied with your purchase.

This and Torchlight 2 are probably my favourites, and share a lot in common in terms of updating and streamlining the experience. TIAVH is generally a well-made game, and despite some issues with player-character pathfinding, I can't really fault the production quality. It has wonderfully schlocky voice acting, humourous dialogue, lovely visuals, a deep, deep skill tree that you'll never completely discover in one playthorough, a streamlined inventory, tonnes of enemy types, plenty of wonderful locations, and LOTS of loot. The game also rewards you regularly with achievements, which keeps you pushing forward.\n\nWith that being said, it doesn't reinvent the wheel, meaning that some of the clunkier core mechanics of the isometric RPG classics remain intact. Expect repetition, a relentless onslaught of enemies, lots of useless loot, and sharp, frustrating spikes in difficulty, particularly towards the last 25% of the game.\n\nWhile this does stick to a classic (and some might say tired) formula, the depth of the skill trees, the frequent validation by achievements, and the sheer personality of the characters and the world keep me playing onwards.\n\nEven with any gripes I have towards genre, I'd recommend this for full price, as the sheer depth of content will surely leave you feeling satisfied with your purchase. I hear that the sequel is even better, and I can't wait to play it!","December 12, 2014","true","12.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's worth the full asking price - and that's high praise coming from me.\n\nThe story is fantastic, drawing you in and making you want to play more just to find out what comes next. The music is soulful, and haunting; the graphics quite good.\n\nThe game itself plays like Diablo and Torchlight, so if you've played either, you shouldn't have any problems with the controls and skill trees. The references to memes, other games, and popular culture are wide spread in this game. Everything from Ghostbusters to Portal and many more are alluded to here.\n\nThe only gripe that I have about the game is that the end boss was too easy to beat. I had more difficulty beating a lower level boss than I did the final one. But then, I did play single player and on easy difficulty, which probably affected things a bit. My next play through will be multiplayer and on a higher difficulty setting, so it should be a bit more challenging the next time through.\n\nAgain, this game is highly recommended.","October 5, 2014","true","16.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Van Helsing makes no exception.\n\nIt feels like a bad gimmick made by people who don't understand the basic gameplay features of an HnS game :\n\n- stupid "skill power up" system that makes you feel like you're using the two same skills over and over.\n\n- incredibly bad balancing. I tried to continue my first game ( normal mode ) near the end of the story after not playing for months and just got killed again and again by a pack of werewolves, just outside the exit of the lair... Thought I wasn't used to the game anymore so I started a new character in casual, and the mobs are either a pice of cake and don't do any damage, or they are ultra resistants and kill me and Katarina in seconds...\n\n- fighting mechanics suck. It's either hold down the click until everyone is dead, or move, attack, move, attack, move, attack ad nauseam to avoid damage.\n\n- loot suck. Why is there blue and gold items if they are always worst than white ? Also most of the time I find items several levels over me and I can't use them, so they just clutter my inventory or I sell them, and then I'm undergeared.\n\n- we can find loot for DLC classes that we don't even have bought...\n\n- inventory is ridiculously small for a game with so much loot ( fortunately you can send Katarina to sell stuff, but having to fill her inventory every 5 min and then wait for her return is boring ).\n\n- the town portal brings you back to the city but you can't go back to where you came from... what's the point ? Those guys don't even know what a town portal is made for...\n\n- armor design is bland and barely noticeable anyway.\n\n- NOT ENOUGH RAGE ! ( due to the stupid "auto power up" option... who the hell got this idea ? )\n\n- the game randomly changes my resolution when I start.\n\n- Vsync either doesn't work or is deactivated after alt-tabbing.\n\n- the character gets stuck in invisible walls, and can't move when there are too many mobs on the screen. Thanksfully we can move with WASD, but even that sometimes doesn't help.\n\n- Katarina is completely useless even as a tank with all points in body/melee.\n\n- 99% of the mobs attack in close combat, so you get ganked if you play melee, and if you play ranged once Kat is out of combat...\n\n- the game made my PC totally freeze, had to hard reboot.\n\n- SPOILER : the final boss is lame and you don't even kill him, he just flees... all this for nothing.\n\n- and then you unlock the "neverending" mode, where mobs are big HP bags, you get one shot several times in a row by mobs that pull you toward them and stun you, you kinda don't get much XP and there is no reason to suffer through the whole game a second time anyway. Loot is still crap by the way.\n\nOn the positive side :\n\n- the character moves fast enough\n\n- graphics and music are nice ( characters are ugly though )\n\n- lots of mobs\n\n- eastern Europe folklore\n\n- i like Katarina's sassy dialogue and the duo works well, even if Van Helsing doesn't have much personality for a hero... would be totally bland without Kat.","August 18, 2015","false","26.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

But... who knows for sure? Maybe you want even more than that these days to be convinced, something new from an old genre. Let's see...\n\nWell...\n\n- How about a good - and we mean GOOD - soundtrack, that perfectly - and we mean PERFECTLY - matches with that said unique atmosphere? Yes?\nCheck.\n\n- How about some really nice voice acting (most of the time, at least), with European accent and all? Ok? You know van Helsing's environment is Europe, right? You remember Bram Stocker? Without google, that is. I hope so.\nOk, then, check.\n\n- How about some little puzzles with ancient, sacred pagan objects in the middle of some frightening bog, infested with demonic beasts trying to tear your hat - and your head inside it - mercilessly apart? How about fighting some blood-thirsty, hellish fiends that jump over you out of the blue, cause you're trying to retrieve some legendary, holy, long hidden relic? How about answering some riddles - yes, we said riddles - from enigmatic NPC's, to which a wrong answer could mean a quick, but no less painful death?\nCheck those.\n\n- How about some funny moments that will put a smile on your foolish face: funny references to famous games, books, movies, and characters every now and then?\nCheck this too.\n\nYou want all that, don't you? Man, then this game is definitely for you! Just grab it now, cause it have it all, you fool!\n\n"Then it is perfect?" you could ask. You know, no game is perfect.\n\n"So what's wrong with this one?" Well... hum... let's see... Ah, yes! Some skills, mainly the melee ones, aren't flashy enough. Yes. That's it. They could be more flashy. Why not? Well, they are useful, they enhance your survivability, and they are fun to use and kill stuff with, but... not enough colourful lights onto the melee skills. The ranged skills are somewhat flashy, but the melee, not so much...\n\nWell...\n\nIf that's not enough to keep you away from the game, then...\n\nBut, to be fair, there's actually one more issue. Some people who played on easy or normal difficulty and rushed the main quest complained that the game is too short. They say 15 hours or so is too short. But... what game on easy or normal is not too short nowadays. After all, one one-shots almost anything stupid enough to cross one's way on those "difficulties". Our answer: stop playing on normal, you brainless cowards, and play games as they are supposed to be played! Your idiotic utterances do nothing but spread misinformation over the world of gaming!\n\nJust play The Incredible Adventures of van Helsing in no other difficulty than Heroic, which is the highest one, and you're on for a fantastic and rewarding adventure that will keep you busy for a good while.\n\nOne more thing. Incredibly, this is an indie game, developed by some little known, small Hungarian group, and it's supposed to be the first part of a trilogy. So, give them your support for their making of this brilliant gem, if you like the game, and show them your interest in the subsequent ones.","June 6, 2013","true","48.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoyed the first third particularly as the side quests and various other things to find in the world kept the entertainment levels high.  The 2nd and 3rd chapters were less inspiring and the end boss was rather ordinary\n\nPositives - the banter between Katrina and Van Helsing was worthwhile and entertaining.  There were lots of monsters to kill and the setting had atmosphere\nNegatives - the skill trees were a little lack luster and I lost patience with the loot.  I also found the combat to be hectic and not really engaging\n\nWorth a few dollars but I doubt whether I'd be playing through the game a second time.

You play as the son of Van Helsing and, like your father, you have a variety of spells, ranged weapons, and blade weapons at your disposal. The story isn’t great, but it’s also no worse than the stories in other arpgs. Van Helsing, the ghostly companion, and a few other notable characters have decent voice work, but the rest of the cast is plagued by lines likely composed by the programmers themselves. Most of the locations are graphically pleasing, but some appear slightly blurry (idk why???). The-game play is smooth and responsive; the enemies vary in aesthetics and behavior; and the progression system is elaborate and rewarding. Overall, the game at its core is great, but bugs, glitches, and oversights (see comment section) compound to drastically ravage the overall experience.\n\nThe Incredible Adventures Of Van Helsing: 7.5 / 10.0","May 27, 2013","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

You can extend your game experience by playing single scenarious or start neverending story mode (something like NG+).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/215530/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing Complete Pack is a beautiful, isometric action-rpg that provides a challenging experience which has a sense of humor, an interesting companion system, satisfying combat, very buggy controller support, and some noteworthy differences from the base version.\n\nThere's a lot of quirky referential humor in the game that I do not want to spoil here. Just make sure to explore everywhere and talk to everyone and... everything, especially in the first town. The world is not grim dark; it has a joke or two up its sleeve.\n\nKatarina, Van Helsing's companion, is very helpful and has very interesting ways to alter her behavior to fit your play style. She will level up with you and has her own set of skills, two with the DLC. You can also choose three different states for her which include ghost (peaceful), melee, and ranged. You can alter how aggressive she is with enemies. She can also pick up different items of varying rarities automatically according to player desires. I had her pick up all the gold, ignore the white items, pick up the magic items, and fight enemies in melee form. It is a neat feature that is greatly appreciated and should be present in more games with companions/followers.\n\nThe combat requires you to pay attention and engage its systems if success interests you. The game has a combo system that alters how a skill can be used. For example, Earthquake, a spell that deals damage in a line, has three different power-ups that can be used in a combo: Brutal Stomp which adds 1.5 meters to the skill's width, Intense Shockwave which adds 30% more damage, and Scorching Fumes which burns everything hit for 10% of Van Helsing's Spellpower. You can spend skill points on the ones you want and organize them in whatever order. You stack up to three combos with the a, s, and d keys resulting in a very powerful skill waiting to be used. I went with 90% additional damage for Earthquake with a high critical chance build to great effect. I could have gone with 1.5 meters to width and 60% additional damage. Other skills have different power-ups available for experimentation. You will be working with Katarina to dispose of monsters while using tricks to change the flow of battle. I often used the one that freezes time to give myself a chance to observe the situation and line up Earthquake perfectly, especially when fighting extremely large groups.\n\nThis game will test the average player's abilities, but the systems it has in place makes it forgiving and approachable. Despite dying a good dozen or so times during my time with the game, I only had to pay a bit of gold to resurrect and continue the battle against evil. There are also special npcs in towns that can refund skill points for both the player and Katarina should you want to try a different build or made a mistake in your allocations.\n\nDo not use a controller with this game. Playing this game with a controller resulted in a frustrating battle with the user interface. Looking at the skill power-ups wouldn't work for skills at the bottom of the page and laying down certain traps did not turn out very well. The combat experience works well enough, but the UI problems are severe enough to just stick with mouse and keyboard. The UI for mouse and keyboard results in faster interactions for everything and lets you properly look at all the information available. I spent fifteen hours with this game using the controller until I finally decided to stop torturing myself. The last four hours were blissful.\n\nFinally, the complete pack comes with three different pieces of DLC which includes an additional skill tree for Katarina known as Blue Blood and two more classes, Thaumaturge and Arcane Mechanic. The Blue Blood tree has some really powerful abilities that drastically change Katarina's performance. She could rival me in power and I do not know what I would have done without her. Blue Blood allows for major damage, health, and defense increases. It also gives her different passive spells that she can activate based on chance or even death for one of them (big explosion). It even adds an often used Trick called Ghostly Mirage which allows for two Katarina illusions that can deal damage. The two extra classes, basically a mage and a scientist/engineer, have one main skill tree and a heavily modified Tricks tree allowing for a different experience from the Hunter who wields swords and/or pistols with some magic. If the classes do not interest you, I still heavily recommend Blue Blood unless you want an extra challenging experience.\n\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a good action-rpg that should entertain those familiar with the genre. Again, I am heavily recommending to not use a controller with this game.","December 29, 2014","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Van Helsing excels at the boss fights and companion configuration.  Simply the best boss fights and most configurable/usable companion to be found.

I purchased this game when it was on sale, so I don't have much to regret even if i didn't like it. The enemies are interesting, but eventually recolors. The lack of true screen control makes it hard to see enemies before you just run into them if you are headed south. The powers can be annoying to switch between, but a few interesting functionalities of 'set combos' and Rages save it; even though i never used either i can recognize its usefulness. All in all, i recommend this game for solo and multiplay for those who like top-down hack n' slash.

Not in this game, because you end up fighting hordes and hordes of enemies, so while you're OP against most enemies individually, you still get a good challenge to stay alive when fighting 50+ monsters clustering around you. The story is lacking some depth to it, the creators really focused on the dialogue between your main character and your companion, thus neglecting the story and creating something with more substance.

There is even somewhat of a pet system. It is similar to Torchlight's, except your pet is your female busty-sidekick-follower. She has skills and stat points that you can upgrade, as well as limited gear allocation.\n\nThere are only 3 Acts, which took me a total of 26 hours to complete on the hardest difficulty. And DAMN was it challenging at times. I experimented with various builds (its easy to respec your character stats AND skills) until I found the right one to deal with huge hoards of mobs. You are going to be dealing with a screen full of enemies for most of this game, and they're going to want to kill you. Combat ended up being me running in to nuke a hoard of enemies, using potions, and kiting back until potion cooldowns were up. Rinse and repeat. It sounds bad, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. IT was only this difficult because I was playing on the hardest difficulty. I prefer games of this genre to be challenging as hell.\n\nThe story isn't anything spectacular, but the dialogue between the main character and his follower always made me smile. There is plenty humor in their banter, as well as the occaisional referential humor with quests.\n\nI didn't try the multiplayer because I heard it was buggy. The graphics are ok and the music suits the game's style.\n\nTLDR: Great game. I recommend it to every fan of the Diablo genre.","September 7, 2013","true","25.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","10"

It has that strange authentic feel between fantasy and history, which in my opinion make it somewhat more likable. I have heard and read, that the multiplayer sucks, but that isn' t that important for me. I think it gives a nice experience when you play singleplayer.\n\nI found some parts that were pretty challenging. For instance, when there is this huge group of monsters charging at you. Now THAT is scary! (and hard to deal with)\n\nThe graphics are not the best, but they surely are nice. The lighting effects are really nice and give you a good feeling when you are in the wilderness.\n\nOverall i give this game a 8/10.

It's an action rpg with surprisingly good character chemsitry and voice acting.  The interactions between the protagonist and his ghostly companion are well acted and entertaining.  The companion helps in combat, either through a ranged form, melee form, or passive form that grants you 10% damage resistance.\n\nThe skill system (for the primary Hunter character) is divided into 4 parts.  Melee, Ranged, Tricks, and Auras.  Melee and Ranged are self-explanatory.  Tricks give you spells that don't require mana but have a timer, that range from healing, to cloning your ghost, to ramming through your enemies.  Auras grant you passive improvements to your character.  One aspect I really enjoy of the skill system is the ability to upgrade your ghostly companion.  You can spec her to have skills that passively benefit you (such as increased magic find or defense) or enhance her damage and survivabilty.\n\nCombat is a bit diferent in that you can enhance your skills with adrenaline.  Each skill offers 3 different side-grades that you can enhance your attack with all at once (e.g., +30% damage, +10% damage resistance, +10% length) or dump all of your adrenaline into one for maximum effect (e.g, +90% damage).  The combinations are interesting and even the early skills remain viable throughout the game.  Combat can be irratating because you are constantly being swarmed by gangs of monsters, so the focus tends to be more on crowd control than anything else.  As you progress through the story, some monsters are downright brutal and can kill you very quickly if you are not careful.\n\nThe story is on par for the genre and the setting, while appropriately grim, isn't anything spectacular.  There are a few bugs here and there, so be forewarned.  At times, the game will hang, which can be really annoying.  Generally it clears up but I have had to force-quit on at least one occassion.\n\nWith the vanilla pack, there is only the Hunter class.  While you can spec Van Helsing with all sorts of skills, if you want a pure magic based or technology based character, you will have to pay for them in separate DLC.\n\nBottom line:  If you like action RPGS, you will like The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.  It's not perfect, but I think it has enough charm to help it stand out in the crowd.","December 2, 2013","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love dark-themed RPGs and when i saw that its style is similar to Diablo II I was thrilled. So i bought it.\nGameplay: It's pretty simple. You have your melee weapon, a ranged one and spells. Each of these elements is affected by its own skill tree so you can customise your playstyle. Katarina is a useful companion with stances that are similar to the ones i said before and you can determine hers to your liking. The mobs have a variety of styles when it comes to appearance and aggresion and that is really good. Besides that, all is pretty much similar to the Diablo series: point n click, quests, looting and a camera that resembles Diablo's. The item variety is also huge and will allow you to customise your Hellsing anyway you want.\nSound: The music is extraordinary and it really taps you in the dark atmosphere the game has. The voice actors are awesome as well, I really couldn't think of someone better to voice Van Hellsing. Also, the small banters between Hellsing and Katarina sound natural and really funny.\nGraphics: I couldn't find much about the game's engine only that it's custom made. Nevertheless, it doesn't have any particular requirements it's pretty light to play.\nOn the downside, after 30 hours of slaying mobs you might feel a bit bored and tired. After you get used to it, the game tends to become a bit repetitive where you have to go there, do that, talk to that guy, kill mobs and the circle begins anew. What left me dissapointed was the multiplayer though. It has some PVE elements but the basic idea is that you play the story from the beginning with 2 or 3 more guys in it helping you. The mobs are slightly tougher to beat but pretty much that is all. Oh, and the objectives of each mission in the storyline are for everyone not each Hellsing individually.\n\nTL:DR: a really nice game waking Diablo II memories, it might get a bit repetitive after a while and the multiplayer could use some more work. Worth trying it.","December 15, 2013","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Truly excellent item system offering just the right amount of loot to keep you playing just a little bit longer, if the Diablo III loot 2.0 is a bit like this, everybody will have a blast.\n- The graphics itself are rather decent, but the spell effects are not that impressive. Some games in the genre offer nearly endless replay value, in Van Helsing that is less the case. After 1 playtrough you have the feeling you have seen it all. The only reason to keep playing is the loot.","January 5, 2014","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/215530/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing Complete Pack is a beautiful, isometric action-rpg that provides a challenging experience which has a sense of humor, an interesting companion system, satisfying combat, very buggy controller support, and some noteworthy differences from the base version.\n\nThere's a lot of quirky referential humor in the game that I do not want to spoil here. Just make sure to explore everywhere and talk to everyone and... everything, especially in the first town. The world is not grim dark; it has a joke or two up its sleeve.\n\nKatarina, Van Helsing's companion, is very helpful and has very interesting ways to alter her behavior to fit your play style. She will level up with you and has her own set of skills, two with the DLC. You can also choose three different states for her which include ghost (peaceful), melee, and ranged. You can alter how aggressive she is with enemies. She can also pick up different items of varying rarities automatically according to player desires. I had her pick up all the gold, ignore the white items, pick up the magic items, and fight enemies in melee form. It is a neat feature that is greatly appreciated and should be present in more games with companions/followers.\n\nThe combat requires you to pay attention and engage its systems if success interests you. The game has a combo system that alters how a skill can be used. For example, Earthquake, a spell that deals damage in a line, has three different power-ups that can be used in a combo: Brutal Stomp which adds 1.5 meters to the skill's width, Intense Shockwave which adds 30% more damage, and Scorching Fumes which burns everything hit for 10% of Van Helsing's Spellpower. You can spend skill points on the ones you want and organize them in whatever order. You stack up to three combos with the a, s, and d keys resulting in a very powerful skill waiting to be used. I went with 90% additional damage for Earthquake with a high critical chance build to great effect. I could have gone with 1.5 meters to width and 60% additional damage. Other skills have different power-ups available for experimentation. You will be working with Katarina to dispose of monsters while using tricks to change the flow of battle. I often used the one that freezes time to give myself a chance to observe the situation and line up Earthquake perfectly, especially when fighting extremely large groups.\n\nThis game will test the average player's abilities, but the systems it has in place makes it forgiving and approachable. Despite dying a good dozen or so times during my time with the game, I only had to pay a bit of gold to resurrect and continue the battle against evil. There are also special npcs in towns that can refund skill points for both the player and Katarina should you want to try a different build or made a mistake in your allocations.\n\nDo not use a controller with this game. Playing this game with a controller resulted in a frustrating battle with the user interface. Looking at the skill power-ups wouldn't work for skills at the bottom of the page and laying down certain traps did not turn out very well. The combat experience works well enough, but the UI problems are severe enough to just stick with mouse and keyboard. The UI for mouse and keyboard results in faster interactions for everything and lets you properly look at all the information available. I spent fifteen hours with this game using the controller until I finally decided to stop torturing myself. The last four hours were blissful.\n\nFinally, the complete pack comes with three different pieces of DLC which includes an additional skill tree for Katarina known as Blue Blood and two more classes, Thaumaturge and Arcane Mechanic. The Blue Blood tree has some really powerful abilities that drastically change Katarina's performance. She could rival me in power and I do not know what I would have done without her. Blue Blood allows for major damage, health, and defense increases. It also gives her different passive spells that she can activate based on chance or even death for one of them (big explosion). It even adds an often used Trick called Ghostly Mirage which allows for two Katarina illusions that can deal damage. The two extra classes, basically a mage and a scientist/engineer, have one main skill tree and a heavily modified Tricks tree allowing for a different experience from the Hunter who wields swords and/or pistols with some magic. If the classes do not interest you, I still heavily recommend Blue Blood unless you want an extra challenging experience.\n\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a good action-rpg that should entertain those familiar with the genre. Again, I am heavily recommending to not use a controller with this game.","December 29, 2014","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Time logged? 28 hours - roughly 2 days of nonstop gaming. Compared to TL2/D3/Titan Quest, I would probably rank this behind TQ and quite far from TL2 or D3. I spent most of the time doing a few things. Reading the scripts, listening to the music, kiting, checking loot and constantly reading online to understand more on the game. The kiting part annoyingly reminds me of my D3 monk before I quit D3 entirely.\n\nPros:\n*Script lines that are worth reading from time to time (Katarina and Helsing Jr. was fun to listen to)\n*Tower/castle defense game was fun and rather cool albeit short (it could be better but oh well)\n*Music by itself is enchanting and very well matched with the game theme (it comes with the game, I know cause I just copied them out)\n*Rage points/factor makes the gameplay more interesting\n\nCons:\n*Creeps are not respawned (limiting the farming/looting activities which is very funny considering the game is supposedly about loot and if you really must farm, the developer said that you need to either join a MP game and then go offline or play scenario mode instead)\n*Lack of explanation on some portion of the game that forces you to Google it instead (e.g. WTF is scenario mode, or what differences does it make if I go online/offline???)\n*Not much to replay again unless you want to farm achievements or try out the different skill build (which is rather bland/limited if not thanks to the rage usage)\n*I hate the abrupt ending (developer said that there are future incoming chapters to the game, I say "You should have told me earlier and you could at least end this chapter on better note")\n\nSummary:\nWorth the $15 (even better when discounted) but don't expect a TL2 quality type of game, it isn't. A bit glitchy/laggy and I got a random creep stuck halfway in the dungeon = unable to proceed with quest until I went back to kill it. Personal advice, play more on melee too (it will be painful but at least the crowd control is better and you will have more fun).","November 6, 2013","true","35.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As you can expect, you plan as Van Helsing while also having with your ghost friend and companion Lady Katarina. The world from the game is a mix of wilderness in forests, swamps and secret lairs with a combination of cities inspired by the gothic architecture that blends perfectly with the theme of Van Helsing.\n\nThe Story is easy to follow and it is told in a very casual manner without taking itself too seriously by adding one little joke here and there. As you advance in your main story you will be asked to do another tasks, which, while entirely optional they are highly recommended to do since it will show you different enemies and different worlds. The best part of doing these side quests was that, not once I felt overwhelmed with a ridiculous amount of tasks to do, it’s just about the right amount of content if you just want to play a 20 hour long game without the need to grind by keep killing the same old monsters or soldiers over and over again.\n\nWith the option to choose between a more ranged or melee approach to kill your enemies, the variety in the customization is also a pleasant surprise. Depending on the style you choose how you want to engage your enemies you can engage them from far or close and personal so it’s really up to you how to tackle them. There’s also a decent selection of Auras, Skills and other powers and abilities for you to explore and learn as you level up. Lady Katarina, your companion, is also customizable and you can even order her on how to approach your enemies as well what to you want her to do. She can attack from close or long range, focus on the weakest enemies or on those harming you not to mention you can ask her to go sell your unwanted loot or even to buy some health and mana potions, saving plenty of time to explore a bit while she’s shopping for you.\n\nIt’s a very easy-to-follow game and fairly enjoyable. I never felt frustrated or bored and the game did not felt repetitive, something that may be common in these types of games. I had an enjoyable experience from start to finish while listening the pleasant soundtrack and the funny sayings from lady Katarina from time to time.\n","January 2","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As you can expect, you plan as Van Helsing while also having with your ghost friend and companion Lady Katarina. The world from the game is a mix of wilderness in forests, swamps and secret lairs with a combination of cities inspired by the gothic architecture that blends perfectly with the theme of Van Helsing.\n\nThe Story is easy to follow and it is told in a very casual manner without taking itself too seriously by adding one little joke here and there. As you advance in your main story you will be asked to do another tasks, which, while entirely optional they are highly recommended to do since it will show you different enemies and different worlds. The best part of doing these side quests was that, not once I felt overwhelmed with a ridiculous amount of tasks to do, it’s just about the right amount of content if you just want to play a 20 hour long game without the need to grind by keep killing the same old monsters or soldiers over and over again.\n\nWith the option to choose between a more ranged or melee approach to kill your enemies, the variety in the customization is also a pleasant surprise. Depending on the style you choose how you want to engage your enemies you can engage them from far or close and personal so it’s really up to you how to tackle them. There’s also a decent selection of Auras, Skills and other powers and abilities for you to explore and learn as you level up. Lady Katarina, your companion, is also customizable and you can even order her on how to approach your enemies as well what to you want her to do. She can attack from close or long range, focus on the weakest enemies or on those harming you not to mention you can ask her to go sell your unwanted loot or even to buy some health and mana potions, saving plenty of time to explore a bit while she’s shopping for you.\n\nIt’s a very easy-to-follow game and fairly enjoyable. I never felt frustrated or bored and the game did not felt repetitive, something that may be common in these types of games. I had an enjoyable experience from start to finish while listening the pleasant soundtrack and the funny sayings from lady Katarina from time to time.\n","January 2","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The horror/supernatural/early modern setting is also a bit different.

It's well executed for what it is, but it feels a bit like someone took Diablo and slapped a steampunk skin on it. Since I've never actually been a fan of Diablo-style RPGs, it's not my cup of tea. Of course, since Diablo isn't my thing, either, this may well be a better execution of that style, I just don't know. Since it's not my taste, I don't think it's fair to give it a negative review.  It's very pretty, and the monsters and worldbuilding are very good, I just can't get into it.\n\nEdit 5/27/2015:\nI went and tried it out again, hoping that some time and different perspective would change my opinion. It didn't. I just can't get into it. A whole lot of it feels grimdark for the sake of grimdark, and there seems to be very little story other than "genocide as many monsters as you can."\nOverall, I'm just not impressed. Story is too shallow, too one-sided, and too focused on grimdark. It could stand to be a lot better. The mythology of Transylvania, the Carpathians, and the Caucasus is a lot deeper setting than this, and deserves a more thorough plot than "kill everything that moves."\n\nAlso, why isn't there a female character option? Surely the progeny of the original Van Helsing could be either male or female and still kick plenty of monster butt.\n\nAlso, I'm probably drunk while writing this edit. I feel that's just making me not pull any punches, but your mileage may vary.","October 30, 2014","false","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first in a trilogy of games, Van Helsing's Hack and Slash adventure offers some surprisingly diverse game play, witty banter, teeth grinding moments, and an overall good experience in one package.\n\nThe game allows for easy switching between ranged and melee attacks. You're ghostly companion is also useful, as well as buffs you. The game itself is well done, with a pletora of items, stats, askills, and abilities to tweak to your hearts content. It also gives you the ability to adjust your stats and skills (for a price) so you don't have to worry about making a mistake in your build. The story is also interesting, with some good humour written into it.\n\nThe game itself is a little buggy. Music tends to dissapear at times, and the melee skill habitually dissapeared, very annoying during a fight. Even on normal, enemy density is quite large in some areas, resulting in the veritable zerg rush that can quickly get you killed if your not ready for it. While it does force you to put some thoughts into tactics, it can also be quite annoying at times (waaaaaay too much zerg on the last boss).\n\nThe other potential issue, is that the other two classes, and the ability to manually level your companion, have to be acquired via dlc.\n\nOverall however, this was an excellent and enjoyable game that is worth trying if you are into diablo-esque games (though you may want to try and pick it up on sale so you can get the all the dlc at a good price). Looking forward to playing th next two parts in the series to see how the plot will thicken.","October 4, 2015","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a very good, entertaining ARPG. I've had plenty of fun with the game, especially once the online was fixed and I picked up the Thaumaturge. The DLC classes are a bit pricey, especially since they add a bit of much-needed diversity to the game, but the base content is by no means bad. Just a bit limited in your character options, especially for more than 2-3 people.\n\nThe atmosphere and tone of the game is dark, but at the same time it's not. The dialouge is surprisingly entertaining, but not all that great. The back and forth with Katarina and the hunter is especially amusing. There are a few other humorous characters (like the priest in the village), but no one really THAT memorable.\n\nThe combat is pretty standard fare for the genre, but it's not bad, or even bland. I'm not a Diablo 2 veteran or anything, so I can't really say for sure how "done-to-death" this whole system is, but I enjoyed it.\n\nIT"S a good game.

Having a lovely companion also made me enjoy this game really much and the way you could spend her skill points in whatever way you want was a good idea - you can build her so she will be a real support for the way you will be playing, not some kind of obstacle.\nMaybe because I was focused on hand-to-hand combat, sometimes I really had hard times - every new area ended for me the same way, with more deads than I could count. Not that I hated it, maybe it was also my fault, but I enjoyed it. This way I had more fun than just running and killing everyone with 1 hit. Also, the boss fights are great.\nGraphics looks nice, music fits really well. I could only complaing about how game ends, and while the story isn't the best but not that it really matter, at least I look for something different in hack and slash games. If you are fan of those, if you look for something interesting in this genre - you should try The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. Maybe it's no use comparing it to other games like that but for sure it's worth playing.

It is an episodic A-rpg which I find really really lame. basically a good game if your just dipping your feet in action-rpg's but ultimately there are better choices in the genre. action-rpgs aren't games that you should complete then want to drop forever. If you want to play through the whole thing then your going to start shelling out tons of cash for something that should have been ONE complete game.\n\noverall, if your thinking about buying this. i would just do yourself a favor and pick up Grim Dawn or Torchlight 2 instead. even Diablo 3, which i don't like to support, would be a better choice.","February 15","false","19.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The further you go into the game the larger the mob of enemies it constantly throws at you becomes, you can't even pick them off from a distance because chances are that the entire mob is going to react and come after you, and another thing to note is that your ranged attacks do not go over enemies which means all those high damage ranged enemies are safe behind the giant wall in your face. And on top of that some of them can heal other enemies, so you HAVE to kill them first.\n\nThere is a perk that makes you atheral when your health runs out, you're going to find yourself getting a lot of useage out of that one. Along with that you're going to find yourself needing to heal constantly, so cooldown reduction is an absolute must so you can use heal often.\nI cannot even fathom playing the game class due the fact that there are enemies who drain your mana beyond faster than you can regenerate it even with mana potions, and this doesn't stop being a pain if with other classes, because all of your skills cost mana to use except your default skills.","August 8, 2015","true","35.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's basically an indie Diablo clone, but focusing much more on story and banter between the main character and his ghostly companion than is typical for the genre. To some degree, it ended up reminding me more of Dragon Age than a normal action RPG.\n\nI really enjoyed my playthrough with Umbaglo and would highly recommend this to anyone who likes action RPGs and is willing to put up with its slightly wonky design and the mass of hilarious bugs it suffers from. It's not super long (15-20 hours) and not as focused on playing through the same content 3+ times as many action RPGs, as well, so it's also not a huge expenditure of time to play through, while still being a satisfying length.","March 30, 2014","true","37.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While the title's price would suggest it might be a bargain bin title, the actual truth is far different as the game contains an extensive amount of content that is polished and entertaining. While the game's scope might not be as large as other titles in the genre, the content easily consumes hours upon hours of time as gaining new loot and slaying monsters of all sorts is an addictive experience.\nThe game's narrative has players partaking on a journey as the son of famous monster slayer Van Helsing along with a ghost companion named Lady Katarina.  Together you will explore  various locales in the gothic and magic-infused kingdom of Borgovia. Settings range from forests crawling with werewolves to dark city streets controlled by mechanized armies of soldiers. Each chapter provides the player with a hub base or town to buy and sell supplies as well as plenty of quests that require the aid of a monster slayer. While some quests incorporate puzzles and even tower defense elements, the majority of objectives have players slaying endless amounts of monsters.\nMuch of the narrative's enjoyment can be contributed to the great dialogue exchanges between Helsing and Lady Katarina. One-liners and an assortment of sarcastic comments from each make both of them lovable characters throughout the game's narrative. It's not often in action role-playing games such as Diablo or Torchlight that the player's character has much of a personality other than their style in battle. It's a refreshing change that not just the main characters have great personalities in the game, but also much of the characters that players meet in the game's world.\nVeterans of the genre will immediately feel at home as standard mechanics for the genre are all in place. As you would expect players earn experience from slaying enemies and completing quests for use in upgrading their character's assortment of skills. The skill system is split into melee combat, ranged combat, and magical abilities, each of which contain both active and passive skills that can be leveled. Lady Katarina also contains her own assortment of skills that not only strengthen her combat and defense, but also abilities that aid Helsing both inside and outside of battles.\nAside from completing a near endless amount of quests, players can spend their time crafting better weapons and equipment as well as upgrading their base's defenses in the game's later stages. As Helsing's role is a monster slayer, he is skilled in both melee and ranged combat enabling him to switch instantly between a sword and rifle or pistols.\nAs with most action role-playing games, the major draw of battling enemies and completing quests is the drive to acquire more loot. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing delivers up to a degree as the game contains a wide assortment of weapons and gear to loot from fallen monsters. The one lacking area with the loot system is limited customization of the protagonist's appearance as most armor and clothing items differ only slightly from each other.\nThe game doesn't disappoint with its visuals as all of the elements ranging from environments to monsters are both highly-detailed and polished. The variety of monsters remain satisfying through the narrative's course with players confronting enemies from werewolves to magical-based, mechanized soldiers.\nWhile the sound effects from exploding enemies to the howls of werewolves aren't anything special, the game's soundtrack sets the tone perfectly with an assortment of memorable tracks. The soundtrack works especially well with various environments in the game's world, which results in the perfect atmosphere for slaying monsters and collecting loot.\nIt's not often that games are released containing such an extensive amount of content in addition to being highly-polished for such a low price. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing offers players both a satisfying and addictive experience over the course of its lengthy adventure. . The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a must-buy for fans of slaying monsters and acquiring masses of loot.","December 30, 2013","true","28.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So when the game on sale I quickly clicked 'buy' and began my quest as a Van Helsing. So, what did I think (and still do as I have by no means completed it)?\n\nI FREAKING LOVE this game! The theme and back-drop to the game is spot on as you wade through hordes of all varieties of mythical monstrosities.  Graphically, the game delivers well and is pleasing to the eye. The voice acting for Van Helsing and Katarina (DLC) is superb. Really well done! The banter between them adds depth to their characters and is a real treat to hear. The musical score/sound effects are brilliant too and again adds to the immersion.\nCharacter customisation is varied and gives much choice to the three classes to choose from. Each gives a different way of combating the horrors that await.\nLoot... oh the loot. Much is to be gathered and acquired as one would expect from a game such as this. The game is fun to play, even more so with friends (or my dad in my case) but beware, the game (for me) can get addictive. I always feel I need to keep playing just to get that next item that will boost my DPS or to see what new enemies are lurking around the corner.\n\nFor all its pros there are unfortunately some cons. Certain shrines cannot be activated, instead once clicked causes your character to wander trying to find it even though it's right in front of them, denying you an XP/DMG boost. With the Arcane Mechanic class (which I play and love burning monsters with) when I click over an enemy to attack, he wonders off, not knowing where it is. A pathing issue with this and the shrines I'm thinking.\nThe worst issue (for me) is no matter how long I play for, be it five minutes or five hours, upon exiting the game my PC shows a CPU temperature warning. My PC is not old and boasts some high-end hardware so I was quite surprised when the message popped up. Never before have I seen such a message other than playing Skyrim (with mods and graphical enhancements) for almost an entire day straight, which is justified. These issues I have are not enough for me to stop playing, but it would be nice if they were resolved.\n\n9/10","July 5, 2015","true","50.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Katarina, your constant ghostly companion, is a witty follower you'll be glad to have at your side. She functions very much like Torchlight's pets, and she and Van Helsing engage in frequent, humourous banter. There's a large world to explore which sports a rather steampunk flair, and it overflows with an equally large roster of enemies which take cues from popular fantasy villains, all with a mechanical overlay. (Electric werewolves, anyone?)\n\nOne of my favorite features that made late gameplay much easier was the ability to reset skill and ability points for both yourself and Katarina. This allows you to readjust your stats for how you've developed your play style. Because I never focused on ranged combat, removing nearly all my points in that ability and pumping up my melee attack made what had become frustrating game time a pleasure again.\n\nUnfortunately, most equipment largely looks the same, so your character never appears visually as epic as Torchlight characters. A few times gameplay feels unessessarily stretched with a similar mission repeated or a mandatory replay of an already-cleared area.\n\nThese litle grieveances aside, Van Helsing is a surprisingly great game. Fans of Diablo and Torchlight need look no further for their next fix.","September 15, 2013","true","29.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","5"

The first negative impression came on the first location after the town. My friend couldn’t load. After several changes of lobby leader and re-launching the game, the problem was solved. Ok, sh*t happens, nevermind. After a few hours one of  the characters reached 12 lvl and 99% and then stopped gaining any experience. After re-launching the game its level was 12 and 50%. Okaaay, let’s go forward. We all were 13 lvl, killed a boss on the quest location and…a miracle! Two characters stayed lvl 13 and the third one became lvl 5! He got 21 skill point and was unable to put on any clothes above his 5th lvl.

Classes are still rather plain being the melee, magic and ranged stereotypes. The skills the classes feature are mostly unique, with a small selection of them being repeats of skills other classes have.\nThe perk system is fun and adds a unique feel to your character. Katarina the ghost WAS a ♥♥♥♥-poor addition. With all the patches and full dlc I feel she is actually worth putting into combat now. Having her tank damage and aggro for me has been rather effective, rather than before when she was dying in 5 hits while being built tanky. Loot drop rate is still really high, but the loot is much better and I find myself playing just to find the next drop. I've not used the glory system yet but it looks like a decent way to keep higher levels interested in their build.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nMultiplayer community is tiny. You will rarely see more than 25 games during peak time, and as little as none during others. Rarely will the games be hosted in the US region. What this means is basically if you're in the US, you need friends to play this game with. Relying on random people from the internet is merely not enough. If you can get past the glaring lag, there's still many more issues that need to be addressed. As such, I can only recommend that if you pickup IAVH for the multiplayer, get your friends to do so as well, or don't get it at all. There are also technical problems with the graphical engine. Running IAVH on full settings produces BSOD extremely often. Although entirely capable of running the game maxed, I can't because of blue screens. Games released both before and after have no problem being maxed without technical problems. This is something that can be fixed, but there's no guarantee that it will be.\n\nUltimately, I enjoy the game and I think you would too. If you must have multiplayer, but do not have any PC gaming buddies to play with, I'd pass over this one, random internet denizens will just not be enough.","November 29, 2013","true","40.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Stop feeding me this pig grub and making me spend money on trash titles that only waste my time.\n\nVan Helsing is basically a shovelware title made only to generate income for the least possible costs possible. It's your standard, soulless, mediocre-but-annoyingly-bad-at-the-end hack'n'slash. Everything in this game screams with lack of creativity, the lack of any ultimate point of this title being even made besides "people will buy anything at steam sales" logic.\nYeah, let's take an interesting theme and turn it into another uninspired shovelware.\n\nI fiddled around a little with characters, progressed a little into the story but the fundamentals of the gameplay, controls and the balance (that ranged class was a total afterthought, it's so underpowered and limited compared to the hunter) turned out to be terribly implemented and got me ultimately bored on hard difficulty. There's literally nothing of interest in this game, everything was done before and better.\nBut the worst part is that killing enemies is fiddly (targeting is a chore, especially with the ranged character) and absolutely unrewarding, which means it's unsatysfying. Even putting down boss enemies turns into running in circles taking that HP bloat down for some crappy loot worse than anything you get from a vendor.\n\nOh, yeah, how about tying difficulty level with number of enemies? That can't go wrong, can it? Yeah, it can and it did, because the only thing it changes is forcing the player into doing more circles kiting enemies until they all go down.\nHow about ♥♥♥♥ voice actors on the top of that? Apparently some people liked them generic characters with terrible va - and terrible dialogue lines in this game are being described as "humorous". What? Straightforward terrible references and unfunny lines are "humorous" now? Seriously?\n\nHard to see a good h'n's lately. Just get Torchlight 2 which is better in everything from Van Helsing. Even if it has arguably worse esthetics.","August 1, 2015","false","3.0"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","13","25","2","0"

Before I go into what i didn't like and the final anwser i'll talk about all the positive things. They added variety to the game with the multiple classes and the extendtion for your companions skills, the areas look detailed and urges you to explore. You can build your character in multiple ways because of the way the skill tree is, so You have a melee section, ranged section, tricks and auras as you move further down the techtree it costs more to level the abilities which means you cant just get everything. You have to plan out what kind of character you want to make allowing you to be different from other players characters. This also adds to the replayability to try new combos.\n\nAfter you beat the game you can play 2 other modes that extend the lifespan of a single character, trying to make them the perfect hunter, by playing these gamemodes you get to find better loot and get points to further increase their stats. The max level is 30, I use to think this was bad but as I played it fit perfectly for the content available and with the glory point system in the other game modes you can still make them better.\n\nThe puzzles and side quests are also a lot of fun since it keeps things interesting.\nThe powerup abilities for your skills also adds depth to how you use your abilities.\n\nNow for some negetive points, once in awhile buildings got in my way from seeing what was happening (they wouldn't go transparent) though this was only in a few places it still should happen. Some of the enemy champions (elites) have unfair abilities, the wall is fine since you can shoot it, the drain is fine since you can run away from it, most of them are fine except for 2, grapple is annoying and unfair, it grabs you from so far away, cant be dodged (haven't seen it miss), it stuns you as it pulls you to them, they can all cast it sametime increasing the stun effect. It has gotten me killed on multiple accounts. the other is the skeleton hand that cages you, you have to attack the hand to break free however you cant move and it works the same way as the grapple, it doesn't miss (haven't seen it miss) but these are from my experience there might be a way.\n\nThe lack of map variety, to what I see the maps are static, not randomized each time.\n\nThe game has some strange difficulty spikes, one moment its simple and easy, next moment you are running spamming pots cause the mobs are no joke anymore but overall it doesn't happen often.\n\nIf you accidently forget to complete a quest, the journal doesn't tell you which area the quest is for, so you have to do quite a bit of backtracking to find out which can be a pain.\n\nLoading screens, it's not that bad but it would be nice if it was faster, it intrupts the flow of the game.\n\nThe music is good and the sound effects are pleasing. The graphics are great and the game runs very smooth. The variety of loot, enchanting, using essences, the dialogue, voice acting are all good. the game was lots of fun to play and got my monies worth.\n\nI give the game a 8.5/10 for being what its suppose to be, to offer some unique features and have a good pace. But for the lack of replayability because of repeating exactly what you did before and the loading screens with not that great backtracking method, no randomized maps and some inconsistency. It's worth buying and offers enough and some for what you pay for.","June 14, 2014","true","19.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Охотник за нечистью очень приятно и литературно выражается, идеально сохраняя образ; его подруга каждые 15 минут выдает остроты; окружающие персонажи продуманы и прописаны настолько, чтобы каждая из отведенных им фраз звучала свежо и интересно. В этом смысле игру хочется сравнить, наверное, с Magicka — все не настолько абсурдно, но настолько же талантливо.\n\nОтличные диалоги накладываются на постоянное обновление места действия — каждые пару часов стиль игры радикально преображается. Просторные полянки сменяются многоуровневыми улочками, классические злые вороны вытесняются изощренными франкенштейнами, а сопровождается это обновлением цветовой гаммы и музыкальной темы. Саундтрек вообще хочется выделить отдельно — очень уж он приятен для малобюджетного проекта.","November 29, 2014","true","65.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The lack of meaningful character customization is off-set by the tightly focused story-driven nature of the game.  The static maps kill replayability a bit, but also allow for better designed set pieces.\n\nThe skill system is a shallow ocean- giving the illusion of depth but in order to be viable you really need to pick a set of a couple skills and pour all your points into them. I can't speak for the ranged tree as I primarily played melee, your choices are somewhat limited given the crazy mob density that this game throws at you- which, don't get me wrong, was definately a positive- but it means that you need abilities that will kill a lot of guys at once in order to keep from being overwhelmed or whittling guys down at a choke point one at a time for hours on end. Then, while you're doing that you realize you could just be Earthquaking all the guys in a row and be done 10 times quicker.\n\nIn short, Van Helsing is worth the price of admission, especially if you can catch it on sale.  It's a fun, short romp that does what it advertises, just don't expect a Diablo/Torchlight/Path of Exile killer.","November 26, 2013","true","29.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm going to list pros and cons and then expand upon them down below. I'm not really going to touch upon the story all that much.\n\nPros:\n\nStory is alright (nothing special, but it's better than most of what you'll find these days)\nNice level design\nGame provides a challenge (both a pro and a con, see below)\nKatarina is a pretty cool character\nVaried enemies\n\nCons:\n\nFramerate tanks to below 30 in some areas if you can believe that\nAI partner is useless\nGame provides a challenge (both a pro and a con, see below)\nVery lame skilltree as a mage\nVoice acting is pretty lame (Van Helsing isn't too bad, Katarina is hit or miss and the rest of the NPC's are pretty bad)\nCombat is boring\n\nTo start off, you play as Van Helsing's son (yea, THE Van Helsing). Something is wrong in this city that your father cleared out years ago and you must save the day. You are accompanied by Katarina, a ghost who is bound to serve your family. She is your partner in combat and can either be a melee or ranged specialist. She also levels up and has her own skill tree.\n\nThis game does a few things right. Level design is something you will notice upon loading up a new area. The areas you prod around in are generally large and look pretty good. So far I've been through a small village, forested areas, a mine, a sewer, secret laboratories, The Ink (kind of a take on The Fade from Dragon Age) and a big city. Each location has impressed me thus far. Also a plus is Katarina herself. Trudging around the game by yourself would get pretty boring. Her presence, combined with the banter she has with Van Helsing is decent enough to where the game doesn't feel so grindy. Also a plus are the various types of enemies with different abilities. The game groups up different enemies constantly, and some of the battles can be very tough.\n\nUnfortunately, for every thing this game does right, there's two things it does wrong. Firstly, the game tanks to below 30 FPS in certain areas. This is on a 4770k with 2x 7870 Myst Editions. It's happened in two areas so far. It's not in one little spot on the map, either. The framerate keeps tanking throughout the whole area. If I leave the area, I start getting great frames again. As soon as I go back in, it tanks again. I guess those areas were just very poorly optimized. Next, combat is weak at best. I am playing as a mage, and combat doesn't feel good at all. None of the spells you can unlock feel good/forceful, and some of them require you to keep clicking your mouse button to charge up a spell, draw a line on the screen for a wall of fire, etc. This wouldn't be such a problem if you weren't fighting 20+ enemies at a time, and if your AI partner was competent. Katarina is utterly useless. I thought setting her up as a melee specialist would let her tank damage and draw enemy aggro as I hit them from range with my spells. Not quite. Enemies run right by her as if she's not even there and book it straight at me. This leads to every battle turning into a StraCraft-esque kite-fest, which gets old, fast. To make matters worse, you cannot command Katarina to attack a target. You can setup behaviors for her where she'll attack your target, the weakest target, the most vulnerable target, or the target that is attacking you (which is all of them), but you can't click on a target for her to attack. This means you have to aggro the enemies yourself. Not a problem if you're playing a sword-wielding badass, but as a mage it's terrible.\n\nAs I mentioned the game provides a challenge. Some of that is due to good enemy design, but most of it is artificial. Katarina being terrible and enemies running straight for you are the two biggest culprits of that artificial difficulty. Also contributing to this are some of the enemy groups you will run into. For instance, there is a part in a laboratory where you run into 6-7 Champion versions (the enemies have different tiers, Champion being the toughest) of this one enemy that has the ability to raise undead, trap you temporarily, form a temporary barrier, lay down an AOE poison spell, and an AOE spell that just drains your health as soon as you step into it. The fight went something like this. Step into area, trigger aggro on the 6-7 enemies, they cast raise undead to the 50+ rat-like corpses on the ground, use barrier so I can't go anywhere, use trap to hold me in place, cast poison or the other AOE spell on me while the rat things beat on me and I'm dead in seconds. I died 10+ times in that one place, due solely to how cheap the enemies were. This type of nonsense happens every now and again.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, I can't recommend this game. If only the combat matched the pretty visuals...","September 10, 2014","false","14.1"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","1"

Hotter than even a huge multiplayer game in BF4. And it's a GTX680, so that should never happen. I chalk it up to poor programming and it is no surprise since this game is very obviously not a AAA game.\n\nIt is a very fun game, but only in short bursts. It gets very, very repetative quickly.

The behavioral settings on Lady Katarina are interesting and helpful, the loot system is ok, the music and environment are great, and the voice acting is one of the best in Indie gaming history. The Drawback, however, is in the actual "Hack 'n Slash" part. This games Combat is HORRIBLE. and the reasons are that, one, you hold still and sit there everytime you attack which is annoying for ranged players and downright punishing for melee players. The other problem with combat is the fact that the game attacks your targets for you, meaning I, a ranged player, cannot chose which guy I'm gunna shoot at. Instead the game is gunna make me shoot the wolf instead of the wolf handler, or the boss. So I don't get to chose my targets which hurt melee players even more, because, unless they are lucky, can't Dps the highest damage monster and are forced to sit there and take hits from all the guys while they are stuck hit that Fricking wolf that deals no damage whatsoever. So those are the problems with combat. Other problems include the lack of tutorial on how the inventory and level ups and as well as specail attacks work. It wasn't a glaring problem since I am a Dark Souls player and don't need my hand held, but it took me a frustrating 10 Mins to figure out how to equip better gear. My final qualm is this. Why do I need to set what percentage of health Katarina needs to be at before she is allowed to drink a health potion? Just... why? At first I didn't know what it was so I set it to the max and then gave Katarina some health potions. We get into a fight and she downed all five health potions like they were tick-tacks. She then was complaining about her lack of Health potions and i replied "Sweetheart, you drank those last five health potions at the speed of light. I'm not gunna give you anymore."\nSo that sums up why a am not going to recommend this game. As much is I like it and had fun, the glaringly painful combat ruined what could have been a really great tribute to Steampunk Hack 'n Slashes.","March 21","false","1.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","5","10","3","0"

Having a companion who is always cracking jokes, usually at your expense is also entertaining, I thought the voice acting was done quite well.\n\nAs an ARPG though, this game is a disapointment. The main campain is rather short, you can easily finish it in 10 hours. Unlike other ARPG's, there is no grinding for better items or skills since there are no areas where enemies respawn and you will have visited almost every part of every area once you finish the game the first time. There is no reason to revisit it since there is no new game+ either.\n\nThe one aspect of the game that really interested me was the tower defense element. Unfortunately this is also a disappointment as it does not fit into the story well and seems more tacked on, not only that but there are only two short tower defense parts in the whole game and no way to do any optional missions at all.\n\nMultiplayer doesn't work well, I've read many reports of people experiencing bugs and I also had a couple of problems when I tried it, quests getting stuck and similar problems. Another problem is that when a person in your party starts a bug you are forced to join after 5 seconds, even if you are in a dialogue with an NPC.","November 28, 2013","false","28.8"," 29 of 59 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","29","59","0","3"

I wish I had more to say here.\n\nOVERALL - 4.5 / 10\n\nPROS\n+ art is actually pretty good\n\nCONS\n- extremely clunky movement / combat\n- ability point buy / upgrade system is extremely boring and lackluster\n- story and dialogue are cringe-worthy\n- lots of loading\n- $4 DLC single talent trees\n\nDETAILS\nWhile I really wanted to like this game, overall it just falls flat in all regards. From the beginning, Van Helsing has been fraught with bugs and a lack of anything going right. To start, multiplayer was completely inaccessible for the first 6-7 months after release, and many quests were bugged such that they could not be completed. Releasing an extremely buggy game: strike #1.\n\nSupposedly a lot of bugs have been fixed in the past 6 months, but this game was purchased specifically to play multiplayer at release and months went by with other (seemingly less important) bugs being fixed, and multiplayer is still not one of them. I have seen multiple instances of it being marked "fixed" in patch notes, only to find it is still as buggy as ever. Even without multiplayer, there are still a LOT of bugs that are easily found that stick out like sore thumbs. On top of this fact, DLC was apparently being worked on for the game starting after it was released, using vital manpower that should have been used to fix bugs to instead leave people that bought the game out in the cold. Focusing on future profits instead of fixing buggy products for current customers: strike #2.\n\nTurns out that all of the DLC (at this writing) just adds single talent trees to Van Helsing or the companion, Katarina, for a "measly" price of $4. Not only that, but items in the game drop that require the DLC, WITHOUT HAVING PURCHASED THE DLC. Thinking your customers are chumps with bags of money lying around: strike #3.\n\nRanting aside, I can get past my personal issues with the motives of developers if the game is good, but I have to rack my brain for a while to just think of something nice to say. For a Diablo clone, it has about 1/10th of the content and customization of other games: there are no classes to choose from, the default talent trees (all 2 of them, one is a melee tree, the other is a ranged tree) are not viable to split putting points into unless you're playing on Easy difficulty, and each talent tree only has 8 abilities, of which you'll actually only use 3 or 4. There is no real diversity in any of the trees, either, especially since most of the abilities and upgrades are just terrible. The overall impression is that someone put way too much time and effort into making sure no single ability was powerful, even with upgrades, causing the entire combat experience to be extremely diluded. Given that Diablo clones are all about fun combat mechanics and getting loot, that should be enough to stay far away from this game. If that's your thing, though, feel free to keep reading.\n\nThe gameplay of fighting enemies is in itself a chore: any ability that has any real power to it has a long cooldown, meaning that you'll spend most of your time using a basic attack that has no real flair to it. Combine that with the fact that Van Helsing's movements cause him to spend way too much time standing still when actually fighting and you have a game reminiscent of the time when ATARI made consoles and not just games. What's worse is that the clunkiness could potentially be overlooked if the abilities the player used actually looked good when fighting, but for the most part combat VFX are almost non-existent. Player abilities don’t really stand out from the rest of the world, and are so short lived that the player might wonder if they cast an ability at all. There are very few noticeable VFX from enemies, as well, and if they didn't actually have physical attack animations then I wouldn't even be sure they were attacking. A lot of times the player just seems to take damage when enemies are around, but because you fight almost everything in the game you just know to expect it.\n\nAlthough gameplay isn't everything, Van Helsing doesn't have much more to stand on. The dialogue between Van Helsing and his companion Katarina are terribly hokey and feels forced at all points. The art in the game is actually pretty good, but for the most part it’s all just static environments and doesn’t really engage the player at all, making it loses a lot of the potential it had at really being a “wow” moment. Because of this, some of the environments are actually very distracting and can be annoying to try and find things in, especially if there are quest-related objectives. Sound is never really my thing in games, and Van Helsing does nothing to change that. It is mostly just… there, although the constant dialogue / noises from friends and foes alike detract from whatever potential it had.\n\nI think that covers everything, hopefully it gives people a good look at what this game is actually all about. I, for one, will hopefully not be making the same mistake twice with this company, the lackluster game and their focus on money over content has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.","December 2, 2013","false","44.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

Achievement hunters will take varying amounts of time depending on what difficulty they choose at the start and whether or not they select hardcore mode, but should be aware that several achievements involve a great deal of grinding.  I took around 30 hours to get all of the achievements besides those related to hardcore mode and difficulty and those involving the greatest amount of grinding.\n\nSCORE:\n5 out of 10\n\nI happened to start playing this after an update that broke a few aspects of the game.  It took too long for the developers to address these issues and, even when they did, some remained.  For example, the Thaumaturge's blizzard skill is supposed to do a certain amount of damage in a small visible area on the screen, but instead causes massive (fatal) damage to all enemies within 2 screens of the player.  This can easily be abused to make every area and boss a joke.  I also found myself unable to complete a main quest because of a bug that prevents a quest item spawn, yet the only fix available is to actually type a command into the game.  The game has been out since May 2013 and the developers have gone on to make Van Helsing II, Van Helsing III, and a spin-off of the tower defense element of the game.  At this point, there is no excuse for persistent bugs and lazy fixes.\n\nStill, if these bugs were my only problem with the game, I would recommend it.  The trouble is that it's not particularly fun.\n\nGameplay consists of running from one mob of enemies to the next, using the same two or three skills again and again.  The game does feature a unique mechanic called Fury, which is gained by attacking enemies and spent to give skills unique buffs if the player has spent skill points on those buffs.  For example:  if the player uses skill points to unlock the flamethrower skill and additional skill points to unlock one of its 3-5 buffs, flamethrower might do 50% more damage or cause persistent fire damage to enemies if the buff is invoked.  However, the buff is also spent upon activation, meaning fury must be used to ready it again for any subsequent attack.  I found the system rather awkward to use because of all of the key presses involved, but others might enjoy it, so I list it neither as a pro nor a con.  In any case, it didn't change the nature or feel of the gameplay for me.\n\nThe three unique bosses (one for the end of each act) offer something different, but only because the player has to first run around activating towers, completing a tower defense section, or destroying spawners first to have a good chance of killing them.  The developers apparently thought that the tower defense section of the second act was good enough to turn into a stand-alone game (Death Trap), but to me it seemed to drag on for too long.  It is like Orcs Must Die! (one of my favorite games) in the sense that the player places traps on tiles and is free to assist his traps in killing enemies, who can also target him.  However, the player must gather materials to place traps and also has a limit on how many can be placed.  The trap variety is decent, at least for what amounts to a mini-game, but in the interest of achievement hunting, I followed others' advice and used just one kind of trap:  the werewolf cage.  Perhaps the experience would have been more enjoyable if I had been more adventurous, but I doubt it.  The length of this section and the constant micromanagement with the player character, which I enjoyed in Orcs Must Die! but disliked here, just sapped any fun out of it.  And then I had to do it again for another quest.\n\nThe story is arguably the biggest disappointment, as it merely amounts to a hunt for a one-dimensional villain who is out to hurt people.  There is no depth, minimal world-building, and no incentive to play apart from an interest in getting better weapons and putting points into skills, neither of which conveyed much of a sense of progression.  The player only gets enough points to max out a handful of skills, most of which both look and feel unimpressive, and the weapons all handle about the same way, with minimal boosts to damage as the player progresses.\n\nThe cooperative aspect of the game was the biggest draw for me since I have a wife who occasionally likes to play.  Our first problem was getting the game to work:  even though her computer surpasses the minimum requirements and mine surpasses the recommended, we both got stuck on an endless initial loading screen.  Eventually I got it working, but it wasn't long before the next problem.  When we reached the second large map (Gallowsbog), the game lagged too much even on the lowest settings for her to be able to do anything at all.  I was forced to play the rest of the game on my own, without company to distract me from the game's other failures.\n\nAfter finishing the game, I had little interest in buying the next in the series.  After reading some of the reviews and glitch reports for both sequels, I lost what little interest I had left.\n\nFor the tedious gameplay, poor optimization, unimpressive skills, and bugs that remain unfixed to this day, I give this game a 5 out of 10.","May 21, 2015","false","37.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Maybe it's the actual existence of a somewhat interesting story, maybe the tons of achievements.\nThe character customization is interesting, too, though.\nYou can choose whether to have respawning mobs or not for single player story.\nThere are weapons that grow more powerful with use and stuff is sharable between your chars.\nThere is some interesting variety in gameplay to shake up the relatively dull hack&shoot a bit.\nI play it on easy and it's still enjoyable.\n\nI got the game in a bundle though, not because I deliberately wanted to have it. Since Valve doesn't allow neutral reviews and I'm focusing on a certain downside that might be of interest to some people, I'll give this a negative one. (Really can't decide.)\n\nThe amount of loot that drops in this game borders on trolling. There's too damn much loot, and the stats compare is a pain, not only because you have to do it for two characters, but because it's confusing and unreliable. A lot of the gametime tends to be about sorting out items.\n\nI think I'm only managing to keep playing it because of the achievements.\n\n(The game has a demo, so the rest you can derive from that.)\n\n\n- Terrain scrolling is far from being smooth. Considering the visual quality and my system, it's a bit sad. Fog even causes extreme framerate drops. This engine seems unoptimized.\n\n- Fakenook, Twitter and Youtube links on the main screen, hurting immersion. This is about as annoying as Youtubers saying "like, comment, favorite and subscribe" all the time.\n\n- And now the big issue right at the beginning:\nRarely does a game bombard a personal firewall as much as this. It tries to connect to api.parse.com and amazonaws.com and oftentimes every half a second to mail.neocoregames.com (even after startup - it basically bombards your firewall permanently) and if you don't allow this stuff, then the game will freeze for several minutes before you even see the main menu.\nThis is with a set block rule, mind you. And turning off my network is not an option since it's a Steam game. Unless you are willing to not care about the motivational factor of achievements. (Not sure whether they register in offline mode though. The game does have its own achievement UI.)\nFirst time it didn't switch to the resolution I selected, and since it can't switch it in-game, I had to wait yet another couple of minutes. I thought that would fix the ugly text, but it seems the game uses a web font without hinting, so even in native resolution text in the menus still looked ugly.\nOh and if I alt-tab out of the game while it pauses with futile connection attempts, it might default to 640x480, requiring me to launch it yet again.\n\nAnd don't say "Just let it connect.". I pay attention to what the software on my PC tries to do, since it's necessary these days.\nMost games with internet connectivity get the message and don't spam firewall logs like that and stop doing anything. Especially since I already have set a block rule.\n(Another game that has this kind of issue (even worse) is Super Meat Boy, although there the problem might have resolved itself somehow.)\n\n\nP.S.: The game is a real space waster. Its videos (intro, cutscene, outro) are present in ten different languages, and the difference is really just the audio track and the subtitles. Extremely clumsy way to do that. 149 MB English videos and 912 MB other-language versions. They could have used that space to provide lossless sounds instead of OGG for example.\nAnd the map files are present as separate huge versions for low, medium and high detail. Model files too. And both sometimes are of exactly the same size. (Otherwise it would probably be necessary data.)\nThen again, since this game has all files separately, if you need the space and only play on high detail, you can delete 6.42 GB of terrain data alone. This plus the video thing taken care of and the game has now 11.8 GB instead of 19.1 GB.","June 26, 2015","false","23.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I learned about it existence only four days ago. Read some preview and wasn't impressed. But i've learened to never trust someones opinion before trying something myself.\nProbably because i didn't expect much i really like the game now. I was surprised with the price on it. The game seemed like a solid project and they aren't usually cost as much :D\n\nI like visual style of the game. I'm pretty tired of "childish" colors in other games. Probably i'm not creating an uber build, but i like the fact that the game always keeps me focused otherwise it'll take only a few seconds to die. And one thing i like the most about the game is the story. I have no idea how it was intended to be told, but sometimes i just can't stop laughing. And that's i guess the main thing among many more that pushes me to go ahead, I can't wait for Van Helsing and Katarina to start talking with each other or someone else again.\n\nSo far i gained from Van Helsing more fun that from Titan Quest, D3 and TL2 all together. I can't remember a single sentence said by anyone in those games, but i'm sure some phrases from Van Helsing will stay with me forever.","May 23, 2013","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's always nice to see little dev teams making games.\n-The starting price of $15 doesn't leave a bad taste in your mouth.\n-Clever take on Van Helsing, with some cool concepts.\n-I was expecting a pure text based game, with no voicework, yet I found the voicework to be better than some AAA games being released these days.\n-It's short and doesn't overstay it's welcome.\n-Decent replayability\n\nNegative:\n-The loading times are awful, they might be the worst loading times I've ever experienced in a game. There's also no loading indicator until 10 seconds prior to the next area loads up. So you're stuck looking at a boring map for 1-2 minutes, wondering if the game crashed.\n-This games default settings are ridiculous and slow down the game (newsflash the majority of PC gamers don't have crossfire video cards).\n-I found a few work arounds to speed up the load times to about 35-45 seconds but even then this game felt poorly optimized.\n-I have a pretty decent rig that can still play Far Cry 3, Skyrim, and Deus EX on high, with my frame rate rarely dropping below 35-45 fps. So why the hell can this game barely stutter by at 5 fps?? I haven't seen a game stutter and drop the framerate this much since my '07 gateway when I played WoW.\n-Oddly enough, I did find the frame rate to improve if I turned certain specs up not down (seriously).\n-The enviroments are generic, the same old muddy sewers/forest/foggy forest/cave, you've seen a million times in generic RPGs.\n-This game takes little to no strategy, I rarely died. When I did die, it was usually do to the screen stuttering and having my character jump across  the scene do to lag or a screen freeze.\n-The character models are pretty dull, you fight the same spiders/rats/zombies from every RPG. Although they do have some cool looking revolutionary robot soldiers and Van Helsing himself looks alright, even if he is a walking cliché.\n-Also for some reason the audio cuts in and out.\n-Gameplay is weird, they try to be so different from Diablo/Torchlight, that they remap certain keys and get rid of others altogether. All I wanted was another hack'n'slash diabloesque RPG, yet this game tries to reinvent the wheel and ends up making a square tire.\n\nBottomline: This game is only worth picking up if it's part of some Humble Bundle or under $2. The forgettable story, boring graphics, frame rate issues, and loading screens will have you uninstalling this monster in less time then it takes to watch a trailer for that lame Van Helsing movie starring Wolverine.\n\n1/5","June 2, 2014","false","9.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It may be due to the fact that i am not a very big fan of this type of game, but i did not find this game very satisfying. Even buying it when it was 70% off still leaves me wishing i had my six dollars back. Upon entry into the game i instantly began comparing it to Diablo III because i absolutely enjoyed that game to the fullest, and upon a dissappointing few first moments, i decided to give it a try none the less. After playing for a couple of hours, gaining quite a few levels, it became unbearable. Again, taking into account I don't usually play this type of game, it was just bland. Yes it offered lots of hack and slash action but it seems like too much of a rip off of Diablo, except with less depth. The game offers very little customization, and seemingly similar talents, which in the end, just leaves you with a boring grind for gear to defeat the final boss... not very impressed. 3/10 in my eyes","January 8, 2015","false","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Other than that though, this game is a very average diablo style role playing game. The combat and graphics show their age and mid to late game there is a boost in difficulty that I feel is very un-necessary. Like in Diablo 3 I understand that on Hell Difficulty it would be really hard, but here in this game mid way through enemies just start taking chunks out of you even though you have decent equipment. All in all a very average game that might not get recommended before some other games in the genre (For Example Titan Quest or Torchlight).","March 26","false","9.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Not a lot I can say about it. You play as Van Helsing and have a female ghost AI companion; each level up in different ways. The story is unremarkable but well voiced. Enemies repeat VERY quickly and the latter half of the game is extremely drab looking. It's a mixed bag, but a passable title if you're looking for the Diablo formula.","March 24, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Forums show many others having the same problem, and turning off Steam Saves did help significantly reducing the CTDs from every single time you made an area transition to once every 3 or 4 times, but that's still far too many CTDs that prevent you from enjoying an otherwise fun game. There were many other bugs that are unfixed in the game as well, but most of those have workarounds to resolve them in the Community Forums. I had decided to try to finish this game before buying the sequel, but never could finish because of the frequent CTDs, which honestly will keep me from buying the sequel. Truly sad because it was rather growing on me despite all the other bugs.","June 8, 2014","false","20.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I say indie, because if this had been released from a well known publisher it would have been treated as garbage and been on every 80% off sale it could find. Why do I say that? Well first let me just say that I wholly recommend this game! It's very fun and engaging. It presents a decent reward system. The graphics and sounds go along well with the pace of the action. So why call it garbage?\n\nI didn't, I said it would have been treated as garbage had it been released from a big company. Van Helsing has bugs... Game breaking bugs wherein you can not complete main/storyline quests. Multiplayer bugs where games will just crash randomly or lag for no apparent reason or even spawn you into places where you are not supposed to reach thereby making you have to quit and return to the game. No tutorial for advanced features. Want to know how to upgrade (socket) items? So do I, go look for a youtube video, because this game honestly never tells you. The sounds, while going along well are somewhat repetative or campy. Also, the graphics, while they look well, enemies have a tendency to blend into the scene making it hard to know if you've killed everyone. It sports a strange control scheme and has no option to evade combat. If you're ranged and you get swarmed you can't run away because clicking in any direction means you're going to auto-attack. Also, if you have a controller plugged in, the game will not allow you to use a mouse and keyboard. You must exit, disconnect the controller, and restart the game.\n\nWooo... That was a long list of dislikes! I'm sorry, but I want you to know what you're getting into if you decide to purchase this title. Van Helsing has issues, BUT the game is fun! There is good dialogue and a story that makes sense. How many aRPG's have a story... and that makes sense!? The action is paced very well and never gets boring. There are quite a few quests to complete and I never had an issue figuring out where to go to complete them. Even though there are bugs the development team is working hard to correct them. Yes there are some instances where quests can't be completed, but until that's fixed, they've released a patch where you can bring up a console and complete the quest you're stuck on. The DLC classes provide more options. I like the Thaumaturge class. I'm very squishy, but I can take down the largest of monsters with ease.\n\nSo here's my final recommendation: If you like aRPG's and are looking for something to fill the gap between releases from big companies then I say grab this title. You will not be dissapointed. If aRPG's are not in your cup of tea, this game will not change your mind. If you are on the fence, just look over my comments about the bads and the goods. If you can live with the bads I think you'll find a lot of fun to be had here!","November 21, 2013","true","14.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It also has an interesting steampunk/fantasy setting. But other than that, it doesn't really stand out much.\n\nPeople had a few complaints about this game. I'll address them here:\n\nBugs\nThe release was buggy, but with the December patch things are running more smoothly. I've tried both singleplayer and co-op and it works fine.\n\nOnly 1 Class\nThe game features only 1 class: the hunter. Very meager, but the DLCs adds 2 more interesting classes.

The play mechanics are excellent, the maps are huge, the quests are fun, and, for a lower budget game, the voice acting is quite nice.

There is a LOT of loot, a nice skill tree for your main character plus your ghost companion - she is a blast BTW with her snide and condescending remarks to Van Helsing. But, unlike the annoying companion in Legend: Hand of God, THIS companion is also a potentially gruesome, merciless killing machine. The DLC offers more replayability, but, even without it, you can play through the game again and specialize in different kinds of attacks - the same goes for your companion.\n\nThis game LOVES to swarm you and enemies will attack in all directions - it's absolutely glorious and at times, loot drops can be almost as crazy as Torchlight II.\n\nI hope that Neocore will consider making a sequel. The game would easily compete with the best triple A ARPGs out there. A random map function would really round the game out.\n\nProps to the devs who have been VERY responsive and have kept this jewel up to date.

Beautiful animations, a compelling setting, an interesting AI companion, and an adequate story already set this game apart from its competitors in the ARPG market - and that's to say nothing of character development and the combat mechanics system.\n\nA lot of criticisms of this game target the lack of build diversity, since the vanilla version only has one character "class" with two build paths, melee and ranged. However, these concerns are ameliorated by the DLC classes, a mage and a trap-setting ranged fighter, which are worth getting if you like the base game.\n\nI love the setting, which is somewhere between Mary Shelley / Bram Stoker Gothic and Stephen Hunt steampunk. Katarina, the ghost companion of the player, is well-written and feels useful in combat (but not TOO useful, so van Helsing still feels like the star.)\n\nCombat is simple enough to be accessible, but complex enough to reward careful character building. 4 primary stats - essentially Melee, Ranged, Magic, and Critical - govern around 10 secondary stats, all of which are easy to understand. The skill tree is fairly simple but has enough depth that the same class could be built effectively in a few different ways. There is a neat mechanic about managing a resource called Rage, used to enhance attacks with sub-skills called Powerups; so far these seem interesting, but not necessary to play the game if you don't want to worry about them.\n\nI got this game on sale for $7, and at that price it's a no-brainer. At the full price ($15 + $5 DLC) it's still worthwhile, but there are better titles on Steam at that price point if you're not an action-RPG fan. In comparison to Torchlight 2, it is a bit less accessible to genre newcomers, but with a more interesting setting and a darker, more visceral tone.\n\nTOTAL 8.5/10\n\n+ Art style and setting\n+ Animations and voice acting\n+ Combat system (Power-ups/rage, balance of skills, diversity of skills and gear)\n+ Endgame play modes (Scenario and Neverending Story allow players to continue after finishing the game)\n- Feels limited by production cost (Short story, only a few monster models and terrain palettes)\n- Some technical problems (occasional, minor bugs that do not crash the game, but get irritating)","November 28, 2013","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You're instantly given a permanent pet, and the ability to do both melee and ranged attacks. Meaning that you're basically every class at once. From there you just choose to specialize, better pets, better melee, better ranged, more magical, more physical. Depending on how you specialize is how the game unfolds.\n\nIt also has a sense of humor which I find refreshing and the voice acting is pretty decent.

A unique story with a follower that levels alongside you, and many of the modern streamlining conveniences similar to Torchlight 2 that have their own added intricacies. Having only one class with others behind DLC is a bit bothersome, but the standard class is versatile on its own and the campaign is a good length. Postgame goes beyond the standard new game+ and adds especially hard challenge missions to the mix.  Overall, a must for the aRPG fan.","November 30, 2013","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Like Diabo II, you'll fight a defining boss like mob at the end of each chapter which will then transition you to the next act, but not only is the campaign much shorter, the combat is much less fulfilling. In Diablo II, you play as the nameless hero conquering the demons, the fact that you remain nameless is what allows the player to fill in the void with their own imagination and make the experience their own; in TIOAVH, the main character is a decendant of Van Helsing, attempting to rid the town of Borgovia of a mad scientist. The player is just a Van Helsing Jr trying to make his own. Even though the story of TIOAVH has no fatal flaw, personally, Diablo II's story is much better.\n\nClass wise, TIOAVH only have 1 (3 with expansion) character to choose from, unlike the 5 (7 with expansion) character available in Diabo II. On top of that, the additional two character, arguably, has very similar style, elemental long range attack, so personally, I'd consider them the same addition but with a slight variation. Point Diablo II.\n\nMap wise TIOAVH doesn't have a lot to offer, in fact, most of the ink map are just mix and mash of the regular map, and one map you even visited twice; Diabo II on the otherhand offers a complete change of scenary, from grass field to desert to a swamp. Point Diablo II.\n\nAI/combat wise, TIOAVH suffers a blow back. Mob will either try to shoot you or rush you until they drop, which often result in the tactic commonly know as the "run you ♥♥♥ off, till the enemy dies", which could get faily repetitive fairly fast. Diablo on the other hand have enemy which fleeing, and even at one point, friendly NPC. Point Diablo II.\n\nTo sum it up, if you're haven't play Diablo II, and you're interested in these type of action RPG, then you should definitely skip and give Diablo II a shot; if however, you're addicted to action RPG game and can't find any other action RPG out there, then suppose TIOVAH could tie you over until your next fix.","March 16, 2014","false","55.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The terrain is buggy on certain place, you're running but not moving. The environment looks nice and fresh however.\n\nExploring the map once was interesting but it isn't worth revisiting after. The two game modes after completing the game are mostly grinding.\n\nThe combat is definitely the weakest part of this game.\n\nIf it's on sales and you like RPG get it, play once then forget about it.\nOtherwise, games like TL2, PoE and D3 are far more superior.","January 25, 2015","false","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When it was first released I was not at all interested, it looked cheap, generic, dull and just another fan fiction game with no substance. Damn, was I wrong. The base version only comes with one playable class(?) but with the DLC you can then choose from two more, the Thaumaturge which is basically your mage and the Arcane Mechanic wich is an engineer with cool gadgets.\n\nVery different from most birds eye view RPG's I've played, different gearing and gemming mechanics and styles but it does not lack what only some can offer: a fun, changing, new, challenging, mass killing, awesome adventure.\n\nThe skill system works the same as most other games like this would, as you level up (killing monsteres, completeing quests, etc.) you gain skill poins, later on though you gain more per level but in turn your higher level abilities require more and one skill point (1, 2 and some 3). You have your main ability skills, (mostly activated and damaging abilities, some passive) Your Tricks ability page (special abilities that change or enhance game play [Thaumaturge can slow time for every thing around him, Arcane Mechanic can summon turrets, and other fun abilities]). And last are your Aura skills, you can have 2 auras on at a time that increase mana regen, critical damage boost, elemental damage increase, etc.\n\nThe game play, design, UI lay out and the game mechanics are very user friendly. One thing that most games lack is undoing skill point allocation. In this game you can remove points from skills one point at a time (for a fee, of course) so you don't totally throw you build out the window, you can instead make samll tweaks to it, which I love. You can do the same for you Ability points: Body(STR equiv) Dexterity(AGI euiv) Willpower (INT equiv) and Luck (magic item find, crit chance, dodge change modifier).\n\nYour follower, Katarina, is a sassy spectre that helps out in battle but also adds a sense of humor to a seemingly bleak dark world. She has her own seperate Skillys and Abilities and you can change how she attacks and behave (Melee, Ranged, Passive while adding boosts to you). You can have her pick up items, and gold if you want, send her to town to do your shopping and she will back talk you the entire time. Different and weird at first, but she is a valuable asset to your goal of evil eradication.\n\nThere's a lot to say about this game, but you will just have to play it for your self to experience the fun and actually quite enjoyable graphics. There are some zones that feel laggy and I did have to tweak my video settings for it to be a little less glitchy at times (Running with two GTX 670 vid cards, i7 3.4Ghz, 16Gb RAM, 1 TB HD with a 240Gb SSD) my computer is more than capable of running any game at max graphics setting but I still experienced lag at times. Like any game, there are glitches and bugs that can some times even progression imparing, check the forums, the game has a built in repair function if a quest stops working or something similar, nothing major but it can be frustrating at times.\n\nMy over all verdict 8/10. Worth buying? Yes. Better with friends? Yes. I'ts a fun game and I have thoroughly enjoyed playing it.","November 28, 2013","true","46.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

On the one hand they do a lot of right things and on the other a lot of wrong things. The graphics are very nice and the sounds are good. The music is awful and I had to mute it. The music loops and its not very good.  The lore behind the game is original and the quests are fun for the most part.  The things I didnt like is the game is a lot harder then it should be. On Normal your going to be running for your life a lot of the time or least I was. I would say on normal for this game would be like hard or higher on Diablo 3. Mostly its because of the lack of regen on the armor stuff.\n\nThe casual mode is ok but a little to easy. I wouldnt mind something in between. The skill tree is still in my opinion is all over the place and messy to look at. I would like something like torchlight 2 or Diablo 3 more streamlined. You have auros, tricks, skill sets for melee or shooting and then you have subset skills  whithin the skills that you can activate via rage by fighting things. If that sounds confusing well it is. A lot more then it should. The Co Op seems to work fine for the person hosting more so then the joiner. I had a gambler inside my base the person who joined couldnt talk to him. A fun game but can be frusterating in a lot of small ways.  After playing this for a while I would give it a 7/10 some good ideas hampered by small issues. Just beat the game in Co-Op its a little buggy and there was some lag,  even on a lan? Go Figure.","April 22, 2014","true","19.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The common root is Diablo, but The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing *is* Torchlight 2, to the extent that it feels like a rather underdone mod rather than a game in its own right.\n\nThat's fine, of course - inbreeding and cheeky rip-offs have always been rampant in the games industry.  It doesn't matter if a game resembles another, what matters is what it brings to the table.  Van Helsing comes up very short, sadly, and the best that can be said about it is that it'll remind you of better games from time to time.\n\nFunctionally it has everything you'd want from a game of this type, although it is a little buggy and nowhere near as configurable as it should be, but it feels like the work of people who got their game engine roughly working without any passion for the game they'd make with it.   It kind of pulls the right moves, but nothing really clicks.  Enemies are never exciting challenges, they're just pests who are either overpowered or underpowered, and combat is a constant annoyance.  A *constant* annoyance, as it never lets up - outside of safe town areas, fresh waves of enemies will always flood at you, which means that attempting to navigate the unnecessarily fussy character sheets, or even your inventory, will often result in death.\n\nYou will die often, but it'll rarely be the result of something you have or haven't done.  Sometimes it will be down to the nice but confusing art style that makes your character impossible to find on the screen, but generally it's down to this game having absolutely nothing to do at any turn other than a weak sigh and 'eh, throw more enemies in there?'\n\nIt's porridge floating in bathwater.  It's a game designed by people who don't understand games.  It's like eating a roll of wallpaper.  It is - and I don't say this lightly - perhaps the most tedious game I've ever played.  I go back to the Spectrum era, so I've seen some stinkers.  There's nothing here for anyone other than boredom.\n\n","September 28, 2014","false","4.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

Sure I've spent hundreds if not thousands of hours on titles like Diablo 2 and its ilk, but I couldn't tell you a dang thing about any of them. Go ahead and ask me about Diablo 2, all I recall is Tristram run after Blood run after Baal run after run after run after...bleah. I fried my brain on the genre years ago so I have just a little understanding for "strategy", "proper-builds", and the inner-workings and mechanics of what makes this genre function. I still play them though because they're addictive as hell.\n\nNow then, what can I say about Van Helsing? Well, for starters the characters are a bit more amusing than most. This is one of the benefits of having a game where the main-characters stay the same no matter the class. Despite his appearance, Helsing is a good-humored dude, and isn't always deadly serious about his job. His ghostly partner Katarina always has a cutting remark ready for the vampire hunter. As a duo they're far more memorable than most loot-clicker casts. I went with ranged-build, mostly relying on the spread-shot for crowd-control. Kat was built to violently explode upon "death" for great damage. It worked out well enough I suppose. I played on hard difficulty and didn't run into many problems (didn't beat the game, more on that later).\n\nVan Helsing plays out much the same as any other loot-clicker. You have your equipment, your rares, your skills, and your build. Either through happenstance or a guide you find your build, you choose the right skills for it, allocate the appropriate stats, then just kill stuff for appropriate weapon upgrades. For some gamers, that's compelling enough on its own, but it's preferable to hunt for something more.\n\nWhere Van Helsing falters is mostly in the map-design. Each area is largely uninteresting. Some areas (like the ink realm) are visually inventive, but that's about it. The maps in this game are largely just a lot of space filled with packs of enemies. Nothing really changes as you progress. In the forest you'll run into packs of wolves, somewhere else there will be packs of soldiers, or packs of demons, and so on. When monsters are grouped together like that the game becomes stagnant. After you've found your build you're not likely to use more than the same or 2 or 3 skills at all times. Variety isn't just fighting different monsters, it's fighting monsters that approach in different ways. Some should ambush, others call for help, hell maybe they're just wandering around. In this game, they just wait around in organized groups for a vampire hunter to come fight them. One particular area is also aggravating because it is split into two sections, which leads to several minutes (slight exaggeration) of wandering back to square one if you go the wrong way. I will give credit to one area in that portions of it are separated by chasms, so enemies can take pot-shots at you as you try to cross. Sure it's headache-inducing, but at least it's inducing a feeling of something more and not just "oh look. All these monsters are standing around for the thousandeth time" mediocrity.\n\n...But I didn't quit the game yet.\n\nA real frustrating aspect of this game involves the hit mechanics. More precisely, when enemies attack, what constitutes a hit? When I see an enemy wind-up to attack -- pull their fist back, hold an axe over their head, etc. -- I should be able to move out of the way to dodge it. Loot-Clickers..no...Action-RPGs in general have dozens of stats, even a dodge rating. All the same, there should be an incentive for players to avoid attacks through direct-input, not just their number > the enemy's number. Van Helsing flicks a toothpick at that idea, and it is a consistent source of annoyance for me. Even when I'm clear out of the way of an attack I'll still take damage.\n\nBut that's not why I quit the game.\n\nAfter a certain point Van Helsing is given control of a resistance base, and he can outfit it as he sees fit. This is basically the tower defense portion of the game and THANKFULLY it's largely optional. I put the emphasis on THANKFULLY because I hated it that much. I'm going to change subjects ever so slightly and talk about a PS2 game called Shining Force Exa. In this game there is a fortress that is regularly attacked. While one character is questing, the other holds down the fort (so to speak). When you strip enough elements away from tower-defense you're left with nothing but "protect this thing". However if the core of the game is entertaining enough, that doesn't really matter. I actually enjoyed these battles in Exa because they focused on the core. A lot of monsters were thrown at the player and that was the extent of it. Van Helsing has this whole set-up where you can buy traps and place them all over this corridor-abundant dungeon. The waves of enemies are too frequent, come from too many angles, and due to the way the dungeon is constructed you'll never reach them in time. You have to approach these battles almost entirely with a tower-defense mindset. This isn't what I signed up for when I started playing Van Helsing. To be fair, tower-defense was a hardly a thing when Exa came out, but really who wants to play that crap when they pick up an action-RPG?\n\n...But I didn't quit the game at that point. After all the tower-defense stuff is largely optional.\n\nNo I didn't actually quit Van Helsing until I was maybe one or two dungeons away from the final boss. When Katarina had reached her level-cap, and Helsing was maybe one or two levels away from his, I quit. Yes, of all the things to quit a game over it's due to hitting a level-cap. Or maybe the real reason is because it dawned on me that this is only part one of Van Helsing's incredible adventures. I'm sure if I picked up the second game I'd get to continue leveling, to continue fighting in seemingly endless repetitive encounters, using the same skills I mastered hours ago, dealing with the crappy mechanics, and there'd probably be even more tower-defense garbage. I didn't think myself capable of stomaching another 15-20 hours of a sequel to this game, so I quit.\n\nI'll give credit where it's due, Van Helsing managed just enough in getting the basics down to keep me playing. I'm an exceptional case though, I play a lot of loot-clickers regardless of quality, so maybe my judgment isn't always sound. If I see yellows, purples, and golds dropping at a decent enough rate there's no telling what games I could be tricked into playing. It's only when the end of the road is in sight do I realize that maybe this game isn't for me and move on. This is where Van Helsing lies. It's not particularly bad, but it gave me reason enough to quit as soon as I shook out of its icy grip.","October 5, 2014","false","12.7"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","1"

I will compare it to Diablo 3 throughout this review to give you a gadge since you have most probably played Diablo 3.\n\nOnly really one character to choose from with a different skin and different item & skill sets\nIn Diablo 3 there are about 5 or 6 charactors to choose from\n\nThe graphics are no where near as good as Diablo 3.\n\nThe game gets boring a lot quicker the Diablo 3 did. As you can see I only have 1.7 hours on record.. That is because I  really could'nt be bothered playing any further Because its not a good game.\n\nEven if I try to justify it not being at the same level as Diablo 3  By saying this game only cost $14.95 and diablo 3 is $90, there are still better free options like path of exile and much better options at simular prices like Torch light 2..\n\nI took a chance on this game because I got it for a $1 from HumbleBundle.com in one of their weekly sales so I dont feel bad about buying this game. But I would feel a but annoyed if I had paid $14.95\n\nTherefore I can not recomend this game.\n\nIf you really want to try it even after reading this review maybe buy it if it pops\nup again in one of the charity bundles or goes on sale at the steam store for 80-90% off or something.\nBut don't pay full price for this or you will be disapointed\n","October 8, 2014","false","1.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

And you really cannot do anything about it. I had a lot of body as a ranged character, which increases your HP, but all the Health and Dodge Chance did not help with it. At some point the game just gives it to you up the butt.\n\nIf you are used to Diablo or Torchlight, the combat also seems kind of bland. There is not a lot of feedback of you are out of mana or rage, the combat itself is not really visceral or meaty.\n\nIt is still worth a playthrough if you are into Van Helsing though and their support is outstanding actually.","October 14, 2014","true","18.5"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

This is a classic hack and slash style game with different skill trees to improve your character in different ways. Unfortunately there is only one base class which is Hunter, and to get other classes you need to buy the DLCs which is a pain. Yet this doesn't take away the level of fun because there are different ways to play this one class. You want to go range? Upgrade your gunslinging skills and fire away. Melee? Upgrade your blades and hack and slash your way through the game.\n\nThere is a down-side, you will die A LOT and it costs A LOT to revive. Maybe its because I'm a noob, but I advise you that you will be swarmed with enemies. So really your going through the entire game shooting explosive rounds until they die. Your ghost partner in the game isnt all that useful. You will find yourself walking along then suddenly Katarina attacks something and you get swarmed with bad guys.\n\nYet this game is great, I love and I just can't get enough of it. I advise you to buy the other classes because they come with different skill trees and weapons. The other classes consit of the Thaumaturge which is basicly a mage and Acane Mechanic, which gives you big ♥♥♥ guns that shoot electricity.\n\n","May 27, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat is solid, but at least for me it didn't matter what settings the game runs at it looked the same. Framerate is capped by default to 30fps but this can be turned off (thankfully).

Enjoyed the first 2 acts of the game very much. Then Act 3 started, Old Town map and that kinda ruined it for me tbh... The grindfest is just too much on that map. It is way too large and too many enemies packed together, so repetitive... Other than that the game was decent enough for a good hack and slash.","December 26, 2014","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Period.\n\nAnd Games with limited Storage like this, will get an automatically "Not Recommended" by me, from now one. Period.\n\nAlso there is another Thing that made it even more boring, there was a Sort of Badass-Points Thing like in Borderlands, where you was able to spend Points in and those Buffs would then be for all Characters - a Thing that would mean some Replayvalue after all, but, but ... but they removed it in an older Update, so it doesn't worked anymore by the Time i got the Game, and so there is also no Replayvalue anymore. Period.\n\nAlso there are Bugs, it says full Controller Support, but this isn't true!\n\nSome Skills, Auras and Stuff can only be set with Mouse and this means you have to unplug the Controller and restart the Game to set the Skills, Auras and Stuff and then plug back the Controller and restart the Game again - soooo Boring!!!\n\nIt should really be called: The Incredible Boring Adventures of Van Helsing\n\nAnd because i also got both of them in a Pack, i have to finish the other too, hope it's less Boring to finish it else it's the last Game from Neocore i bought for sure.","December 21, 2014","false","177.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And sadly, it doesn't exactly. Combats don't feel very exciting, and so far it's pretty much the typical RPG grindfest for gold (well what was I expecting?). The existence of decent equipment from shops  and the exorbitant prices isn't a very nice design touch, as it creates shallow treadmill goals that encourage mindless grinding.\n\nAn upside though is that with that price this game is quite a steal. Not as good as I expected, but I don't regret the purchase. I will most definitely explore the game some more. If you're a newcomer of the genre and looking for a great WRPG/ARPG experience to get your feet wet then I think this game isn't really for you. But if you've hard into the genre then this game is quite a decent one and worth trying for the price it's asking for.","June 17, 2014","true","23.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
