A nuclear fog has made street level uninhabitable. Now hundreds of years later Echo Tokyo lives on, by building bridges and platforms between the skyscrapers to create a new city in the sky. This cyber punk city somehow manages to function without government or law, where the companies rule and order is what people make it for themselves.\n\nThe storyShizume Misaki – Origin\nThe first graphic novel story introduces Shizume Misaki, in this fully voiced interactive graphic novel, telling her tale as she begins working as a Fixer within Echo Tokyo.\nIt is said that a fixer will take any job as long as the price is right. Though many act mainly as private investigators, many others will do any job to pay the rent.\nWhat will become of Shizume on one of her first big jobs as she visits into the most dangerous area of the city… The Slums.\n\nKeiji Light – Origin\nThe second graphic novel story introduces Keiji Light, in this fully voiced Kinetic graphic novel we learn of the origins and trials Keiji went through as a child in the slums. As well as how he was groomed and abused after being abducted and experimented on, leaving him where he is now.\n\nVisual elements and audio elementsVisual elements – The character designs have “western art” screaming all over them which I am alright with it and would welcome it warmly. But what really bugs me here is 1 of their particular CG which stands out the best among all of them, it looks so good compared to the others it is like for that particular CG they spent $10 on it while the others $5. It was inconsistent in terms of art. As seen in the above examples it is quite obvious on the artstyle consistency. Overall it just looks acceptable but lazy at the same time. What I think it should do is just do a single style of art and  not try to mix them up because instead of making it looks good overall it looks out of place completely.\n\nAudio elements – Pretty sure not many people have realized this but there is only 1 soundtrack used in it, it sound nice but just having 1 in a visual novel is not going to look good at all, it left a bad impression on me for sure.\n\nTechnical aspects something I rarely talk about in a VN– Extremely limited settings to do in this VN. Like for example in the options area there is only 2 things you could do.. Going windowed mode or full screen mode and that is pretty much it.\n\n– The text appears word by word there is no way to change its settings for it. I have always read visual novels with words appearing instantly and for this I cannot change that I am being forced to read and double click to do the same effect off reading it with the words appearing instantly, which has lead to reading this particular visual novel a quite uncomfortable.\n\n– You cannot turn off voice acting. I personally did like the voice acting but it I just did not like it and it did get in the way of reading combine with the fact that it cannot be turned off its another factor to be added into the negative.\n\n– You cannot save during choices. I think this is really serious issue this is a visual novel and a short one that is. I do not understand why there is no way to save during choices. Not having the ability to save during choices a lazy aspect of this visual novel, what are they trying to do with this one not being able to save during choices are they trying to be a “dark souls” version in the visual novel market? Oh wait even dark souls have checkpoints at the very least.\n\n– Not having the ability to have multiple save slots, this is stupid in my opinion especially since this is not a kinetic novel. The fact that the reader could only use\n\nTo sum upDo I recommend this visual novel? Simple answer no not at all, despite it being an “intro” the story still fell too short all it does in the story is “set up” basically it sets up its theme as a whole and that it. Onto the settings that you can do it is extremely limited it is quite annoying when I went into this I checked for its option and was shocked and my reaction was “That’s it?”. Yes that was my raw reaction to its functions. Overall giving this a miss will not hurt much.\n\nClick here for the review with images to make things "clearer"[azusantiara.com]","February 11","false","0.5"," 55 of 65 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","55","65","4","3"

In Shizume's story you play as a 'fixer' (private detective) who infiltrates the slums to find a missing girl. Of course it's not as straightforward as that.\nThe game is set in a very visually appealing setting of a post-disaster Tokyo, where everyone lives far above the clouds. The story is told through static images, a lot of them, which are very skillfully drawn and it's all set to soothing music.\nEvery line of text is voiced by the voice actress, sounding very professional. My one criticism there would be that she seems to be holding back a bit in scenes where more emotion would be required.\n\nEcho Tokyo: Intro is a visual novel I can definitely recommend. It's one of the best on Steam currently, making up for its current short length with its low price -- and more content to come soon in the form of a second chapter.\n\n//Edit: Chapter two is out now as a free update.\nIt does not feature any choices, but does provide another half hour of story. It is much darker in tone than the first one. Like the first chapter, it is fully voiced and told through static images -- all new art -- set to music.","February 1","true","1.4"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","25","34","0","1"

Both offerings are fully voiced, well drawn and pretty entertaining overall. I definitely enjoyed the male portion better; the story was more compelling and the actor’s voice was much less annoying.\n\nThis is truly just the introductions into the world of Echo: Tokyo; if more content c0mes along this could really be a solid visual novel. As things stand right now this title is very middle of the road based on content and length. This would be an excellent candidate for an episodic series; alas there is no indication or future content. Consider that some of the negative reviews didn't even play as much as I did; so the review may have been justified but now out-of-date!\n\nDLC is dumb. Instead of trying to make money with crappy wallpapers and PDF downloads consider making more content for the actual game.\n\nWorth the $3; assuming you know this is not a complete production.

Some of the art is good but the art involving characters is obviously less quality than the background images. The backgrounds are very nice and detailed but the characters look as though they were drawn using MS Paint while being rushed. The quality of audio for the voices is very good but the dialog isn't.\n\nThere are really only 4 different options you can select with the game in its current state (and that's if you make it far enough to get those options but you can always start a new game). That is the entire graphic novel, there is nothing else to it. You click one of two options for each time the opportunity presents itself and repeat that process at most 3 times. I spent about 24 minutes interacting with it and was able to unlock all of the achievements and complete the novel. That is too short in my opinion.\n\nThere is one good feature I like about it though, there is a skip button that will allow you to skip past dialog you've already experienced and go directly to selecting one of the two choices you are able to pick. So if you've already experienced the story with one option, you can start a new game and skip the the point where you wanted to chose a different option and hope it changes the story. There is also a quick save option but one round of the story is so short it doesn't have any real use from my perspective.\n\nI bought this game on sale for $2.24 and I'm not upset about the money I spent but if I knew how short it was, the iffy story and art, and how little interaction I would have with it, I would have passed. Maybe the additional content that will get added later will help but as the game is now, I would not recommend buying it.","January 31","false","0.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

Voices are both great. Nice to sit back and relax and have a story told to you, rather than read it yourself for a change.\n\n+ Art style is pretty decent.\n\n+ Very nice and extensive gallery.\n\n+Easy achievements.\n\n+Setting is nice (by "setting", I mean the futuristic space thing).\n\n[Negatives]\n- The male's story is much more interesting but doesn't have any choices involved whereas you can play the female's story for multiple branches. Seems a little unfair.\n\n- The choices in the female's story are very minimal and sort of always ending up going one of two ways. Not a lot of player activity that I was hoping for.\n\n- No menu options, such as changing the screen resolution, adjusting the sound, etc. But, save, load and skip work fine.. so I guess I can let this slide.\n\n- The gore, violence and nudity is a little TOO overdone. The female character only wears clothing for a few minutes before she's running down the streets naked after a sexual assault attempt. The man's story is chocked full of gore and violence from the minute it starts right up until it finishes. There's just not a good balance where they've toned it down a little bit.\n\n- No trading cards. Boo.\n\n-No adult filter (if that's what you're into), everything is censored.\n\nOverall, 7/10.","May 31","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

But as the last games from AJTilley/Dharker Studio had very varying quality (IMO) ranging from very enjoyable to bad, I was reluctant to buy it immediately.\n\nBut today this game appeared in a bundle (sorry, no link as I probably would get banned temporarily again for posting it) with 12 other games so I gave it a try, as for the money spent you can't do anything wrong.\n\nAfter less than 1 1/2 hours I finished the game with all 6 achievements unlocked.\n\nMy résumé for this game:\n\n* The Good\n\n- nice story leaving you with that feeling wanting to read more about this interesting story\n- nice non intrusive music\n- decent art for the main characters\n- all lines have voice over\n\n\n* The Bad\n\n- too short\n- quality of voice over varies for each charcter where the VO for Shizume is the worst as I got the impression it doesn't fit the character properly and the speaker rushed the job as it is very unemotional.\n- sound glitches (sound looping untill you scroll back or click mousebutton) / sound files omit last part of the sentence in some cases (Keiji route)\n- only one track playing throughout the game\n- artwork could have been better elaborated as it appears to be very simplistic\n\nConclusion:\nWould I recommend the game?\nYes, I do as the story seems to be interesting and for once not taking place in a 'pony world' but in a more mature cyberpunk ambience, charcter art is decent and even in spite of the flaws the game is priced reasonably.\nAnd if you can get it on a sale or in a bundle it is well worth the price.","February 19","true","1.3"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","1"

There are only a handful of choices in the first story and none at all in the second.\n\nGraphicsThe presentation of Echo Tokyo is generally very good. The game has a number of great landscapes and areas and a good art style, drawing heavily from science fiction anime.\n\nThere are a couple of re-used images with minor modifications in the first story (Shizume) that would have been better re-done for the second showing, and I did notice some images that didn't quite seem to fit the story. (Does any woman actually sleep in suspenders and stockings!?)\n\nSoundThere are no sound effects in the game and only one music track, which plays throughout (albeit with mostly appropriate increases or decreases in volume in certain places). I didn't find the music annoying or anything even after almost two hours of listening to it.\n\nBoth stories are fully voiced, although the voice acting is a bit variable. The female voiceover in the first story (Shizume) was excellent -- perhaps not quite as good as Khari Wahlgreen as Elika in Prince of Persia, but close! I hope to hear more from the woman who voiced this story. The male voice acting for Keiji in the second story, however, was nowhere near as professional, sounding somewhat mumbly and with a few lines that really should have had another take.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay is minimal, even for a visual novel, with only a very small number of either-or choices in Shizume's story, and none at all in Keiji's. Just turn off your screen saver, press the auto-forward button, and watch, listen, and enjoy.\n\nPROS AND CONSPros:\n+ Truly excellent voice acting for Shizume, let down a little by the voice acting for Keiji\n+ Great setting, with interesting stories and ideas, let down a little by the quality of the writing\n+ Achievements -- an easy 100% for anyone into that sort of thing\n\nCons:\n- The writing is okay, but not great. It really could have done with a pass or two by a professional editor, not only to fix the moderate number of grammar errors, but also to give some advice on re-working some of the more awkward sentences.\n- More choices would have been nice\n- Auto-forward is a tiny bit slow for the speech, particularly in Shizume's story\n- Too short: I want more! :)\n\nCONCLUSIONEcho Tokyo: Intro introduces us to a very interesting science fiction anime world that I want to see more of, and has some of the best voice acting I've heard in a while. It's let down by some not-quite-so-good voice acting, and could do with a bit more focus on the quality of the writing.\n\nI'm really looking forward to reading/watching/listening to more.\n\n7/10","March 10","true","1.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Comprised of two stories, Shizume's novel plays out similar to a choose your own adventure providing roughly 6 choices that lead to various endings. Keiji's story is a kinetic novel (linear - non-interactive novel) with one true ending.\n\nI definitely enjoyed the voiced narration. Although the chosen actors could probably have been better, their story telling compelled me to continue through the novels. What differs from this game to most other (cheap) VN's is the fact that the story actually shows a progression in graphical assets (scenery, characters etc.), exactly like a graphical novel. Most (cheap) VN's tend to re-use a handful of backdrops to progress the story. The artwork isn't anything praiseworthy, just sufficient in getting the point across. A few environments were really well illustrated however.\n\nI definitely would have enjoyed the game more if there were more game options for personal tweaking. The only game options provided are Fullscreen options. No text speed, font size, menu opacity or dedicated saves/loads (only qs/ql) options.\n\n==== Score ====I enjoyed my playthrough of both stories (~30 min total) and feel like it could have been much worse. There aren't that many VN's on Steam anyways, so this is definitely worth a shot.\n\nGood\n- 7/10","May 4","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just because it’s an intro, it doesn’t have to be all secrets or whatever; I felt lost most of the time. The voice acting wasn’t good. Seriously, the VA’s were just… reading the script. You can’t feel their emotions, you can’t “connect” to the characters at all. There’s also only one background song and no sound effects. It felt… Empty, I guess?\nThere should be an option to turn off the voices… The good point (I guess) is that there are a lot of CGs.\n\nI’m being really honest. I also got the graphic novel and I plan to get the new DLC too. I hope that the next chapter will be better and more clear about the story.\n\n3/10. I suggest getting it on sale or on a bundle for a quick experience. Due to the lack of logic during the story, I cannot recommend this game. The problem isn’t how interactive it is, the problem is that you can’t relate to the characters/get interested on them since everything’s so quick and you simply don’t understand what’s happening.

The voiced narration is well done and the art is better than a lot of the other low effort visual novels you'll find on Steam. There are a few branching path choices that'll give you different endings, but you can see all there is to see within a couple of hours (at least until more content is added). That's not that bad for the low price tag. From Shizume's origin story you can already get the sense that there's a lot of potential for this world/story and it does make you want to find out what happens next. Definitely worth checking out if the description/art intrigues you.\n\nBe warned, there's some rapey-type content in it, so if that makes you uncomfortable then you may want to stay away. On the other hand, if you're in it for revealing imagery of anime girls there's plenty of that.","January 27","true","0.6"," 12 of 31 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","12","31","2","0"

Where no matter how many comic books you purchased in a series\n\nThe story never ended\n\nAlthough there is no  actual cliff hanger as would be in the old  serial films\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_film   .\n\n\nThe two short  storys are  like super hero origin storys .   So my warning when buying this product  Is it is quite clear to me that the two  storys are ment to set up for futher  purchases of the storys of the two characters .  Hence Intro in the title   It tells you how the two characters got there "special powers" and that is it.\n\nSo my sugestion olny purchase this if your ok  with  storys that end at the point where you find out how  fictional super heros get their powers .\n\nOr are willing to invest in  the other visual novels that a shure to  come from this author .\n\nNudity\nAs far as the nudity  yes there are  2 scenes of    what might be considerd female nudity  They are not very  detailed   you see the basic shape of her bust. But she does not have any nipples  and   for her genitals it is just a v shaped line .\n\nBut at the price I  bought it for it was not a bad purchase  decent graphics and decent voice acting .\n\nThe unfortunate thing from the authors point of veiw  is  That there are  several  websights where you can download this work for free.\nas well as some you tube playthroughs  of this work .\nnone of which are mine I hate stealing   but given that I would sugest that   the author take advantage of  free comic book day that is comeing up on may the 3rd  and see if  they could get   printed comic books distributed in comic book stores to promote this work just a thought\n\n","May 1","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not sure if that will ever come to fruition but lets take a look at what we've got here. You have two separate stories to play through,one a purely kinetic novel with no choices, and the other a choice-based story with mulitple bad endings, and one true ending. There's about 30 minutes to an hour of gameplay here.\n\nBoth are pretty decent, and although I'm not a huge fan of all the western art style used, some of the characters and action scenes were handled really well. The voice acting is okay, I found it a little cringe-worthy at first, but quickly adjusted to it.\n\nWhen you play Shizume's story, she feels a bit unprepared and not very capable of protecting herself from the dangers of the slums. I'm thinking that this is something that they will address in the full story, based on the ending, but it feels like you are mostly running away and wondering why she was foolish enough to get into this mess.\n\nKeiji's story is almost completely out of his control from the beginning, and is a bit more compelling and horrifying.\n\nThis VN retails for about $3 and I wouldn't really recommend it for that price, not just because of the length, but because it doesn't tell a full story. This would be a fine demo for the full game, but demos are typically free. I've seen this in bundles before though, so you can keep an eye out for that.","May 15","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tablis/recommended/345700/","tablis","Tablis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tablis/","741 products in account","Echo Tokyo is the name of a city located high in the sky, at and around the tops of skyscrapers and various towers, and presumably above the site of "old" Tokyo. Below a certain height, radioactive fog blankets the Earth, a result of wars that devastated the world and made the surface uninhabitable. As far as its citizens can tell, Echo Tokyo might be the last remaining gathering of humanity. Regrettably, government and justice have become functions of money in a manner typical of cyberpunk.\n\nThe game consists of two completely separate short stories. It is my understanding that it initially only contained the Shizume route. And that Keiji's route was added at a later time, not even as a "free DLC" but as an integral patch to the main game, in an effort to expand the content available. A justifiable notion, considering that the whole thing can still be read in under an hour easily. This is also probably why Keiji's route is of noticeably lower quality than Shizume's in just about every aspect.\n\nThe writing is average at best. It's correct, but uninspired. It tries to hide this lacking of substance behind flowery flourishes that had me raise an eyebrow more than once (...I wonder if the same could be said of this review). It tries to be noir at times but doesn't do a good job of it. I appreciated and enjoyed the darker themes present in this title, where the majority of VNs tend to be more "sunshine and rainbows". But then, the protagonists' insistence on not killing becomes even more absurd, doubly so if you consider their backgrounds. There are more mundane issues with the writing, too - Shizume's name is sometimes spelled Shizumi for no reason, and Keiji's route has a lot of typos.\n\nThe art starts off decent, pretty good even (in the Shizume route, at least) but it's calibre quickly worsens, to the point where I had a hard time acknowledging it as a commercial product. It was almost as if the first few shots were commissioned to an outside, better artist. Or there was a single artist who suddenly understood how much time would be needed to fully illustrate the whole story at that initial level and ended up winging it for the sake of budget and/or time. At least in Shizume's route all of the pictures are of the correct resolution, in the sense that they use up the whole available screen space. In Keiji's route the images are sometimes squares of various sizes, leaving black space around the edges and indicating a scarcity of graphical assets. In one case, such a square is actually a part of the previous image cut out and zoomed in, pixels and all...\n\nI imagine the creators were aware of the inadequacy of the visual side of things, and thought they can balance that out with above-average audio. This would explain why "full professional voice acting for every line" was considered important enough to go in the game's intro blurb. And while the music is indeed good, I can't say the same for the voice acting.\n\nKeiji's diction is poor, he's slurring a lot; doesn't sound very "professional" to me unless they wanted to accentuate his "street urchin" upbringing in this way (and I doubt they'd have the acumen to come up with this). Shizume is okay on this front, but...\nwhen it comes to expressing emotion (revulsion, fear, shock etc.) both are pretty bad. They're acceptable when reading narration and calm dialogue, but I remembered the exclamations as being cringy.\nvoicing the narration just generally seems like a lousy idea. Why would you do that? To stand out? I don't like it one bit, it was actually worsening my immersion rather than improving it. Just voice the dialogue, thank you; I don't do audiobooks.\nthere is even a technical problem with the voice acting as well - occasionally the last word of what is being said will be cut off in the audio, as if the recording ending prematurely. It's a repeatable issue with particular lines of text. It doesn't happen often, but often enough to notice.\nEcho Tokyo: Intro is supposed to be the first part of a series, but it's a bit of a false-start; let's hope the overall quality improves in subsequent installments. The asking price of 3 EUR is not too terrible at first glance. But then, if you compare that to the likes of Written in the Sky, which is free, only marginally shorter and with better art... that's where the picture turns sour.","May 30","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
