In this review i will go through the pros and cons\nof purchasing this game. I am trying to come from a perspective of someone who\nhas played this game since 2008, I have purchased this game 4 times, for Xbox\n360, PS3, Retail Box and Steam. Over the 4 versions of the game I would say that\nI have played a good 1000 hours. Yet I keep coming back for some reason. Cod4 is\none of the games that I play each and every day. I mostly play Promod, but I dip\ninto Non-modded every now and then.\n\nPros:\nMod Support, many, many mods for this game. There is a whole separate game of\njust mods. To name a few there is Prop Hunt, Promod, One in the chamber and a\nmultitude of others. Smooth uninterrupted game play, I wish more games had this these days. From the ground up this game was made to be as smooth as possible.\n\nDeveloper Console, this is a biggy in my books. Not enough games these days have this. This is the command line that you can use to edit any settings that you would like, you can load maps, change\nSensitivity aswell as other settings such as FOV and maxfps. With commands like cg_fov 80 and\ncom_maxfps 250.\n\nCons:\nThere are very few cons for this game. Some of the biggest and most prevalent are\nthe aim botters and silent aim users. If anything this is what will send you over\nthe edge. Another thing is that most of the servers are unpopulated. Don’t get me wrong,\nthere is still a huge player base in CoD4. Its just that I wish there were more.\n\nThank you for reading this review and I hope that it will influence your purchase\nin a good way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/James060394/recommended/7940/","James060394","TheMadPolarBear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/James060394/","101 products in account","One of the best games of the franchise, the highly acclaimed Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a must have for a fan of the Call of Duty games. The games single player experience is phenomonal. From the beginning raid on the Russian tanker, to the cataclysmic end to the U.S campaign, to the brilliant All Ghillied Up mission, the game will keep you hooked, followed by a story that is believable, but not over the top compared to the future releases in the franchise.\n\nThe Multiplayer is where Call of Duty shines however, and Cod 4 is a thoroughly enjoyable experience but not without flaws due to a variety of reasons at this point in time. When Cod 4 was released, the game included many new features not seen in previous Call of Duty games, such as the now standard Create a Class, Killstreaks etc, all of which feel balanced and nothing too overpowered (except maybe the P90). Where the PC version differs to the console versions is the player count. Cod 4 supports up to 48 players per server and sometimes it's absolute madness, just like the old Call of Duty days. Make no mistake, it's still a really enjoyable experience but console players may find it somewhat jarring coming from console to PC but you can always join a server with less players. There is no Prestige, with ranks taking longer to achieve in its place, and dedicated servers are there which mean less lag compared to the console version.\n\nBUT unfortunately, as 2013, Cod 4's server browser and online experience is somewhat annoying. A LOT of servers which turn up in the browser have this annoying redirect mod, which you have to install. This means what may show up as Backlot, standard, TDM, 40 players may redirect you to a Hardcore, S&D, 3 player game. It's frustrating at times to find a decent game.\n\nAll in all, the game is highly recommended and along with the original Cod, UO and Cod 2. Probably the last GREAT Cod, with future games removing much of the standard PC features and instead being a console port. Buy it.","November 25, 2013","true","3.8"," 246 of 275 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","246","275","0","6"

The gameplay is great and there are now servers with some of our favourite gamemodes like DeathRun, Prop Hunt etc, alongside the classic Call Of Duty maps. Although this game isn't the same price as it's console versions, it's a different, better game entirely.

I think many will agree with me on that. i have less than 100 hours simply since i have nobody to play online with,and that i played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it on ps3 and nintendo wii. and then spent even more hours making montages i would fail at.\n\nOne of the best single players mode out there,with a neat arcade mode and cheats to use. so it has a lot more replayablity compared most other cods(espeically more recent ones).\n\nBut the mutiplayer is what really makes this game and thankfully there is plently of servers still online on PC(including fun mod ones). so the game may be dead on consoles,but on PC its worth playing. Also joining a match is pretty quick, almost instant so if you want instant action,well there you go.The gameplay style is more simple,but with enough perks and attachments to keep it from being boring,and i think it all comes down to weapon balance and pretty much every weapon in this game is useful. you can do well with almost any weapon.\n\nSo yeah the only negative is the price,its pretty fixed at 20 bucks and sales are extrememly rare,and thats coming from someone who spent hundreds of hours on. just be aware the community is much smaller and finding a decent server will take some trial and error.\n9/10 its like skyrim but with modern warfare","February 18, 2015","true","182.9"," 87 of 92 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","87","92","7","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pheabus2005/recommended/7940/","pheabus2005","Pheabus2K9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pheabus2005/","219 products in account","Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the series at its Finest Hour.\nBack in 2007, it was a big year for video games, on PC we got Orange Box, Crysis, Bioshock,etc, console players had Halo 3, AC and Mass Effect, even among those big titles, Call of Duty 4 stood out. Its predecessors, namely Call of Duty and CoD2, were already highly successful, but CoD4 was simply beyond most gamers' expectation. I still remember playing this on my roommate's PC and got totally blown away by the "One shot, one kill" mission.\n\nSingleplayer Story: 9/10\nThe story is straight forward, it is not a role-playing game where you made choices, or a Hollywood movie with lots of twists, you simply move with your squad, and shoot bad guys. However, the developer still manages to put the action pieces together with a nice story, it is not perfect, but can still give you the good old "Saving Private Ryan" feeling (like it was in MOHAA). In comparsion, MW2's story tries to give you "WOW" moments, like a Michael Bay movie with lots of cool actions, but fails to deliver the glorious feel.\n\nPresentation: 9.5/10\nThe presentation is top notch in 2007, some moments are still amazing to this day, like the mission "All Ghillied Up" is an instant classic, where you crawled through emeny fields in a ghillied suit, with heavy tanks and patrols moving by, it is one of the most thrilling experiences in FPS history. The graphics are surely out-dated, but they aged elegantly. The gun models, animations and battlefield atomsphere are impeccable even in today's standards, which create great immersion. The pacing of shooting scene/intermission is perfect. There are also lots of explosions, but none feels out of place.\n\nMusic: 9/10\nThe in-game music composed by Harry Gregson-Williams suits the pace and atomsphere perfectly, whether it is the middle-eastern showdown, or the desolate pripyat city, or the ICBM lauch field, the music always bring the scene to life. It may not surpass the later MW2's music by Hans Zimmer Team, but still excellent game soundtrack.\n\nMultiplayer: 9.5/10\nThe MP mechanics was a revolution back in 2007, very fun and addictive even to this day. Most MP maps (aside from a few tiny maps) are well crafted to hold as much as 40-50 players, while still very fun to play with low player counts(8-16), also keep in mind that In later CoD (MW2 above) the player count is capped at 18, which, in my opinion, completely lost the epic battlefield feeling. This game also came before the crappy IWNet ever existed thus supports dedicated server, you can easily find a populated server with playable ping, without the worries about host-migration or host abuse, etc.\nThe weapons are balanced and diversified, not only feel great but actually have recoil(unlike those "laser guns" in later CoDs). The good old 3-5-7 killstreaks are simple and effective, as well as satisfying, you won't get ridiculous powerful killstreak (like nuke or AC-130 in later CoDs) but the result is still very rewarding.\n\nEnd of the line\nCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the prime CoD experience on PC. With so many blockbuster shooters flooding the market today, you may want to pay this old game a revisit, and see what we gamers have missed all those past years.\n\nEdit: My steam profile suggests less than 1 hour CoD4 gameplay, which is not true. My in-game stats shows I played online for more than 500 hrs, coupled with another 300-400 hrs spent playing on mods, my total play time is nearly 1000 hrs.

It is by far the best Modern Warfare game of the series.\n\nSingleplayer starts the whole MW storyline, you play as "Soap", a soldier that just joined the SAS, and Jackson, an U.S. Marine.\nYou never see their faces neither they talk during the campaign, which makes it much more easy to take the role of these characters. Gampeplay in SP is rather linear, as such I'm not a very big fan of it. However, from a storyline standpoint I really like it, and in my opinion it should have ended with CoD4.\n\nMultiplayer is the core of this game. It is by far the best multiplayer experience the whole series has to offer. Gameplay is much more balanced than in the other MW games, Mod support included, great weapon choices.\n\nCall of Duty died for me after this game.","March 19, 2014","true","10.8"," 86 of 98 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","86","98","0","4"

Simple UAV, Air(fail)strike and Attack copter\n+10-40+ player servers\n+Mods\n+Atmospheric and interesting campaign.\n\n-No co-op.\n\nSo, 7 years after release, i decided to buy the game again. This time on Steam...obviously.\nAnd guess what ? It still stands its ground. People saying that it's the best CoD game in the franchise are not full of shait or blinded by nostalgia.\n\nI first started up the singleplayer campaign. Finished the boat mission and when the text, "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare", appeared after the end of the first mission, i got chills. Really. It felt just like the first time i ever played the game.\nAnd it isn't the nostalgia talking. It was like a new experience...only re-lived.\nThe music, the atmosphere...everything in here is so well done.\nAtmosphere...a little sense of realism and characteristics...these are something that are missing in the latest CoD games.\nSince Black Ops 1 it has been just about explosions and over-the-top action.\nI love explosions...and i love the silly, uber-soldier action...but CoD went too far with it. You don't feel close to the characters anymore. You don't get sucked into the stories or into the world...no. It's just nonesense action. The characters in Blops games or Ghosts, they don't feel like soldiers anymore. Hell, they are not soldiers. They are superheroes.\nWhen i play a CoD game i want a game with soldiers, not a Marvel movie directed by Michael Bay...it's like Marvel Transformers...ugghhh...\n\nThe campaigns in CoD4 and MW2 are the only good campaigns in the new era of CoD. Old era (CoD 1-3) is ofc good aswell, but the gameplay in the latest CoDs is just way better.\nEDIT: OK, WaW campaign is quite decent aswell and i did enjoy Blops2 campaign 'cus it tried to be fresh and innovative but the story and characters were still just "MEH!".\n\nNow the multiplayer. This is where CoD4 shines. This is where the roosters at! It still holds up.\nI expected a dated character movement and gunplay but i was dead wrong. The gunplay is amazing! The gunplay is, in fact, better than in Blops or MW3.\nSure, the character movement is a bit smoother in, say...Blops2. But everything else is better in here.\n\nYes, the multiplayer is still alive! Hundreds, if not thousands, of servers full of people! There are 8vs8 servers, 12vs12, 16vs16, 20vs20 even!\nLatest CoDs only have 8vs8 and that's about it...maybe 12vs12 max but not more.\nCoD4 is the only CoD where you see 40 people in one server.\nIt also has one of the best multiplayer maps. MW2 had some really cool maps too and Blops2 had couple of decent maps (Nuketown and Hijacked) but CoD4 takes the cake! Pretty much every map is a masterpiece in here!\n\n\nCoD4: Modern Warfare is a must have for every FPS fan!","September 26, 2014","true","171.9"," 82 of 93 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","82","93","6","11"

The graphics from when the game was made is indeed playable, graphics isn't an issue in this game as the mechanics and engine run so smooth.\n\nI'd suggest getting this on PC due to cheat protection software, punkbuster. The servers are also player hosted and you get a server-list so that you can choose whether or not you want to play with mods and interfere with annoying hackers.

It almost single handedly paved the way towards modern military shooters becoming a trend. Gone were the days of countless World War 2, Vietnam and space shooters. Now was the relatively untapped potential of modern day shooters.\n\nPrior to Modern Warfare, modern military shooters were usually akin to sims. Games like Rainbow Six or Full Spectrum Warrior are good examples. Very tactically complex games with little run and gun action. Modern Warfare replaces run and gun with stop and pop. You use cover to your advantage and duck out with iron sights. Call of Duty 4 is the game I see as popularizing iron sights and probably utilized them the best compared to other games at the time. Moving and firing from the hip is wildly inaccurate but holding your sights down would increase your accuracy dramatically but slow your movement and narrow your field of view. It's an extremely immersive mechanic and one that was designed to compensate for the limited accuracy of analog sticks.\n\nThat's not all that Modern Warfare gave us either. Modern Warfare also paved the way for progression based multiplayer. Contrary to arena shooters, Modern Warfare instead focuses on letting you customize your arsenal with sights, scopes, underbarrel grenade launchers and even color schemes. And you unlock all of this gradually the more you play. It feels akin to an RPG where the more you play, the cooler your guns become and the more efficient you are at taking other players down. This is still the dominant system in first person shooters and even more popular franchises like Halo and Doom started to use it.\n\nAnd lastly the singleplayer in Modern Warfare is fairly good. It is a mostly scripted and linear shooter with plenty of good set pieces and moments. Along with prior staples of the series like having multiple protagonists and viewpoints across the story.\n\nOne other thing to note is how much of a PC game Modern Warfare 1 was compared to it's sequels. It has a console, a full SDK and map editor, dedicated servers and so much more. It allowed for things like bots to be added. And even close to 10 years after release you can still find enough people who want to play this game to fill a server. As derivative as later titles in this series got, you have to admire a charismatic and influential game like Modern Warfare. Very few first person shooters have such a lasting legacy that stands the test of time.","April 17","true","7.9"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","43","47","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/7940/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Call of Duty series has long been set in the theatre of World War II. The fourth instalment seeks to change this and alter the formula by taking place in modern times, where the good and bad guys are harder to define, the weapons are more powerful, and the plot is more complicated than just pushing back the Third Reich. The result is a game that is fun to play, whether alone or with others, and that sets a new benchmark for FPS games.\n\nThe game is neatly divided into two parts: single player, and multiplayer, with more than just human opponents differentiating the two modes. The single player charts the progress of the United States Marine Corps and the Special Air Services, the British equivalent, via a combatant in each. The story is short, and at a comfortable difficulty level, should take no more than half a dozen hours or so. But that's not to say it's lacking in content - on the contrary, the single player experience is intense and filled with memorable sequences and scenes. It's definitely worth playing through at least once.\n\nThe AI in the single player game is done quite well, for both the enemies and your teammates. Your teammates will stay behind cover, poking their head out to fire at the enemies, toss grenades, follow behind you when you proceed, and in general do a good job of being teammates. A little bit more fire from them would've been appreciated, though. The enemy does the same thing, hiding from your shots and tossing grenades, but they do it a little too well.\n\nThe enemy's AI, especially on the higher difficulties, borders on the ludicrous side of unfair, as they'll be able to do amazing tasks that even the best sniper couldn't. Throwing grenades a hundred feet with perfect accuracy, taking you out with three shots from an AK-47 while completely out of your view (even with a sniper rifle's scope), and even firing on you the instant you turn corners, as if they already knew you were coming. At some points, it's possible to be aiming at a doorway with a raised rifle for the enemy to appear, only to have them come through, raise their weapon, fire a couple shots, and kill you immediately, all before you could even fire once. There's a difference between a fair difficulty and a frustrating one, and COD4 definitely tends to the latter.\n\nBuying this game for the single player experience alone, however, would mean you were missing out on the bulk of the content. The multiplayer of Call of Duty 4 holds an inordinate amount of fun in it, introducing new elements and ideas that make it fresh, fun, and worth replaying again and again.\n\nThe multiplayer has a variety of modes for you to play through. There's the standard deathmatch and team deathmatch, where in the PC version, entering a game with nearly fifty players can mean staying alive for half a dozen seconds before someone finds you and shoots you. Other modes include Headquarters, where two opposing teams must capture a single point on the map (the HQ) and hold it for as long as they can to rack up points. In Sabotage, your team must find a bomb and use it to blow apart a target. On their own, the multiplayer modes are pretty fun, but they're nothing really new.\n\nThe Class system of COD4 is the first thing that adds some variety into the mix. Initially, you get to select one of a few pre-made classes, each with a specific primary weapon, secondary weapon, attachments and delightful little enhancements called 'perks'. These perks further flesh out your character by allowing him to do such things as hold extra grenades, take more damage, and sprint for longer distances. At first, there's not a whole lot unlocked: the weapons are mediocre, the perks average at best, and there isn't too much variety. But that's not all…\n\nWhere the game really gets interesting is the ability to earn experience points as you complete objectives and defeat other players. Earn enough experience and you'll move up in rank, which means unlocking features, weapons, attachments, classes, perks, and challenges. The real point of interest is unlocking the Create-a-Class feature, which allows you to invent your own class with its own weapons, perks, and so forth. As more perks and better weapons get unlocked, you'll find yourself not so helpless anymore, as your jerky, one-shot sniper rifle is replaced by a semi-automatic, your dusty handgun is replaced by a desert eagle, and your perks include such interesting abilities as the chance to take out your handgun as you lay dying and fire a few final shots at your killer, or dropping a live grenade when you die.\n\nChallenges add yet another reason to play multiplayer. As your increase your rank, you'll unlock challenges for each weapon that, upon completion, grant you attachments and extras for that particular weapon. Additionally, there are challenges that don't involve specific tools, such as leaping and falling to your death, killing a certain number of enemies while crouching/prone, or shooting down a helicopter.\n\nOverall, the multiplayer experience of Call of Duty 4 is astounding, and probably worth the price of the game by itself, as long as you don't mind playing with others. A big issue with it, however, seems to be that once you reach level 55 on the PC version, you can't proceed any further and that somewhat tempers the experience as a whole. Other than this, however, the multiplayer portion as a whole is very well done.\n\nCall of Duty 4 is an excellent game, there's really no doubt about it. Top-notch presentation combined with tight gameplay and impressive graphics make it fun to play on the single-player, but it's in the multiplayer aspect of the game that the experience is the best. As far as first-person shooters go, this is one of the best on the market, and is something anyone that's sure to interest anyone who has dabbled in the genre.","December 28, 2015","true","268.5"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","37","41","4","1"

No dubstep and autism here. This was when companies were trying to make the most out of the new technology they were given. Call of Duty still had that goosebump inducing storyline, it was practically the only campaign worth replaying. This game in particular gives you a single player experience that you will remember forever. If you haven't played it, stop reading and go play it NOW, you're no good to humanity alive.\n\nThe excitment didn't just stop at the single player of course. You can NEVER leave out the multiplayer that set the standard for first person shooters for years to come. Though the multiplayer has been long outvalued by the current Call of Duty games, this is where it started. For those of you just joining the franchise, it's comments like "this game sucks", "the graphics are terrible", "mechanics are clunky" that make you look like a fool. For those of us that have been playing Call of Duty from the very start, this game was the best on the market for us. It's insulting when people like you come around and try to criticize it. You can't and won't understand how great of a game this was for us.\n\nIf you play the single player, this game holds it's value at 20 dollars. Don't expect much from multiplayer these days though.\n\n","November 21, 2014","true","7.2"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","87","39","45","9","0"

The story is pretty interesting and takes place all over the world while playing as a British SAS Soap or US Marine Jackson. Personally I preferred the SAS missions because of the great characters, the professional team and more interesting missions. The US Marine missions are about war only where you are one of many and witness massive destruction around you. The most breathtaking missions include SPOILER the unforgetabble All ghillied up mission in Pripyat, UA where you play as a sniper with a task of assassination and the mission in the Middle East where you witness the Atomic bomb explosion from very close. END OF SPOILER\nAll in all, the modern graphics, action gameplay and breathtaking moments accompanied by dramatic music make this the best CoD game ever. The negative thing about it is the fact that it's multiplayer oriented and the singleplayer campaign, though totally awesome takes only 6 hours to finish, which is pretty embarassing.\n9/10","April 1, 2015","true","5.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

It is definitely worth the $20 price tag and is actually playable compared to the console versions of the game (same for WaW) When I was originally going to get this game for PC, I was skeptical whether or not MP would be dead, plagued with hackers, or no vanilla esc servers. Boy was I wrong. There are plenty of servers that are populated (20+ ppl per server) that use their own Anti-Cheat, so hackers are rare. If there is a hacker, they usually get banned from the server within 10 minutes by an admin. If you are also weary about not finding any Vanilla COD 4 servers don't worry either. There are several servers that run the game in its original state without mods installed. Don't get me wrong, mods are fun and almost always make games a much better experience, but its fun to go back and play the barebones version of the game.\n\nBut seriously, if you have never played COD 4 before, BUY IT AND PLAY IT!","April 6, 2015","true","14.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

You could say that it's only running and shooting at pixels, but there's just something about it that makes it feel so much more than that. I think it's a campaign you really should play through, whether you like or hate Call of Duty - even if only because it's cool to hate on Call of Duty.\n\nAnd the multiplayer? Revolutionary. Levelling up, killstreak rewards and unlocking new weapons and perks. Even though some people disliked the changes, claiming there's little to no skill involved anymore, I personally think it made the multiplayer feel much better while still staying balanced most of the time. And the levels did introduce some motivation to keep you playing and getting those levels up.\n\nAmong first-person shooters, I personally find Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare to be the best of all time.

The game which revolutionized the franchise, adding excellent and unforgettable multiplayer maps, killstreaks, guns, etc. But first, let's talk about the campaign, is not a secret that it is kinda short, but it is one of the best campaigns in the story of FPS. Excellent dialogues, great escenarios, great characters and memorable soundtrack, this and more makes this game a well done shooter.\nNow, the multiplayer, which one is incredible fun, brings new things to the CoD franchise which ones totally change the way we used to see those games. Now we are in the modern warfare, so new weapons and technology. As I said at the beginning of this review, it has enjoyable maps, we have a selection of small and some "big" maps, all well done, the killstreaks are just great for this game. I can say more and more good things about this game.\nI used to play this game a lot a few years ago in the 360. Nowadays, the multiplayer maybe is not that great as it used to be. But don't worry, you can always find a lot of servers with people, there are still a lot of mods, etc.\nBut yeah, my final words: If you for some reason don't have this game yet and you want to buy it, go and buy it, totally worth it.","December 19, 2014","true","15.2"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","2"

I can now see why so many of my friends and other people around the world say how amazing Call of Duty 4 is. It's truly a masterpiece. Even though this is the only good game Infinity Ward has made, I still enjoy it a lot!\n\nThe simplicity of the game, the classic killstreaks, the maps, the gun balance, the gamemodes, the dedicated servers, and the mods is what makes this game amazing. When people think of "Classic CoD" they immediately think of Call of Duty 4. While most Call of Duty's nowadays are full of broken game mechanics and poor PC optimization, CoD 4 is a nice breath of fresh air. Even though I didn't play this game back in it's prime in 2007, people are still playing and I can see why. Even haters of Call of Duty even admit that this is "the only good CoD game" and that's saying something to me!\n\nEven though this game lacks a friends list, co-op, and has somewhat of a low playercount, I can't recommend Call of Duty 4 enough. It's a fantastic game and definitely worth the twenty bucks.\n\nMy rating 9/10","May 11, 2015","true","30.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

This is beneficial to newcomers due to the recent Call of Duty installments being far too overcomplicated and unecessarily confusing to say the least.\n\nWith a memorable campaign, a fun exciting multplayer mode and with many community made maps and servers to choose from, Modern Warfare is a gaming experience that has the ability to live on in the PC community for many years to come.","February 24","true","4.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It allows you to play campaign and multiplayer mode. It is the first modern style Call of Duty so campaing is really nice and fun. Multiplayer is just fantastic and simple. You can play on ranked and unranked servers. Unranked servers allows you to play mods like sniper only, paintball, promod and zombies. Multiplayer also have normal ammount of levels so you will play game pretty long to reach max level/prestige. Is has the best guns and maps in my opinion.\n\nGame is totally worth of money! I reccommend this game to everyone who is FPS and Call of Duty fan. You will not get bored even if you're playing alone. If you want to continue campaing you will need to buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.\n10/10","February 18, 2014","true","4.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

While I appreciated the WWII settings, I was less at ease with a nervous gameplay: bombing, shooting, running.... well, in other words, it was perhaps too fast for me.\n\nWhen I finally indulged myself in CoD Modern Warfare, I would have never though that the modern setting would be something that would make remake in my head the story. You're Soap, a new guy in Price's unit and you're going to be involded in the Russian Civil War and later, in a special team to stop the ultranationalist leader, an ex-weapon dealer. You're also Paul Jackson, a sergeant in the US Army, sent to an unknown country as part of an operation for freeing it from the rule of the new leader. You're even going to be Price but years ago...\n\nYou're playing people that are in the same moment at opposite directions and your role is to survive. The gameplay isn't only shoot, load, shoot... it's also keeping your cover, destroy tanks, be silent when you need to be silent, snipe....\n\nThe game is offering enough challenges to hook you up.\n\nYet the nervous gameplay isn't still something I like. That's probably because I'm more used to Doom or Half-Life pace.\n\nThe graphics are also quite good, though it's mainly revolving around a Middle East town or Russian forests. The only time you can enjoy something different is when you're in a plane above Price's team, clearing the path for them.\n\nCharacters are people you're getting attached to, whether you're playing them or they're NPC. Yeah, true, it's Call of Duty, which means unexpected death. In the end, Soap is alive, though badly injured, as you're him during the end of the game. Price? You don't know, though CoD Modern Warfare 2 is featuring him. Jackson? Well, he's still somewhere in that unknown country. As for the others that were with you (Griggs, Nikolai, Vasquez, McMillan or Gaz), their fate is sealed in the game. It's up to you to follow the story to find about them.\n\nAnd the game is ranking high in my "love soundtrack" meter. Really appreciated these. Really fitting.\n\nThe commands were probably the harder thing I had to master. Probably because of the cover I have to take when you're used to games without having none. And it's not always easy to fight your way through, even in the easy difficulty.\n\nAnyway, CoD Modern Warfare is really a very good game. Too bad the price is still high after all this year but hey, when there is a discount, go for it.","February 18, 2012","true","21.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However EvenBalance's PunkBuster is no longer supported for CoD4 so you may have to disable it for both CoD4 client and server as PB is not recommended if it will kick you or your players if PB was enabled in CoD4 server. Using the PBSetup.exe won't help you to get the latest PB Client for CoD4 anymore.\n\nActivision appears to lost too much support for CoD4 - such as Punkbuster, Master server and possibly more. I've found out the best way is to install CoD 4X v1.8 patch to wipe out those bugs and server connection problems at once! I won't explain in too much detail but this appears to be the best method to resolve those CoD4 Client issues for our CoD4 players.

It was the very first game i played online when i was a kid, and it brought me into online gaming. Because of this game I became addicted to first person shooters. In my opinion this game will always be the best out of the entire series, and the only downside to this game is that the connection isn't as strong as it is in newer call of duty titles. Since this game is so old, there doesn't appear to be any servers in the multiplayer section. You need to find a website with all of the server IP's and pick a server from there. There are plenty of forrums that discuss this. Unfortunately, since this game is and isn't supported by gamebuster(a hacker detector) It can be difficult to join any servers if you don't have gamebuster installed. There are also forums to fix this.\nAll in all, I will always love this game because it was the root of my childhood gaming, and I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who can handle playing a game that's slightly outdated.","January 6, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was SO good I could not leave my computer screen for 5 entire hours (which rarely happens to me!) Why pay $90 for Ghosts when you can pay $20 for this!

The only legitimate complaints I have are as follows:\n-The movement system is a tad clunky compared to BO3. This is to be expected of a game as old as MW.\n-No controller support. It would be nice to pretend it's 2008 and I'm playing on my Xbox 360.\n\nOther than that, the community is still active and the game is still fun, but unfortuneatly everyone on PC seems to think hardcore (which is pretty much one-shot-one-kill) is better and I even had one guy tell me it was more realistic (lol - this is CoD). The dynamics of each weapon are squandered in hardcore and the game moves way too fast. You usually get spawnkilled for a few minutes each game. This is a community complaint though. The game is fine.\n\nThe campaign is great, the MP is great, the community is mostly great, the music is great, the aesthetic is great, the gameplay is great, and that's why this game gets a 1337/420.","May 25","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unlocking new guns and attachments.\n\nI do not believe the Multiplayer is as good as it is in Black ops 2, but Cod4 Definitely is worth it's $20. It's a nice casual Call of Duty so you can just sit in a 24/7 server and play for as long as you like (you'll have to play the long ♥♥♥ games though if you're playing them)\n\nCod4 is a great starting Call of Duty for new players and will keep having tonnes of player for years to come.

I was having so much fun with my stealth class (Ak silencer, Usp Silenced, 3x Special Perk UAV jammer and Deep penatration Frag and Stun) I could get Quad- Five Feeds absolutely amazing game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RustyOnPC/recommended/7940/","RustyOnPC","#Insync.RuSty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RustyOnPC/","411 products in account","The single player campaign is an intense, incredible experience, but it is short. To enhance the game's replay, Infinity Ward has included hidden Intel pieces in the game that, when found, unlock in-game single player cheats such as the ability to slow down the game temporarily, turn the game's colors black and white, or get infinite ammo. After finishing the game, the player also has access to an arcade mode, in which you try to get through the game or a single level with a limited amount of lives for the chance to get the high score. Call of Duty 4 comes with innovative and incredibly fun multiplayer.\n\nAnd now onto the multiplayer; the dedicated servers makes it lag free, which is one of the most vital things in multiplayer. The drip feed method of leveling up and unlocking guns as you progress is done at the right pace. The multiplayer consists of sixteen different maps with modes that include the traditional deathmatch, team deathmatch, and free-for-all. Other game modes include Domination, in which players fight to secure objective points, Sabotage, in which players must plant bombs by an enemy objective, and Search and Destroy, in which one team defends an objective while the other team attacks. The multiplayer is set up for fast, frenzied gameplay, with wide open maps that have multiple methods of ingress for most areas. There aren't a lot of places in any of the maps that are conducive to camping, which forces most players to stay on the run to survive. Also, whenever you are killed, you are shown your death from the enemy's point of view. This is a cool feature, which lets you know who killed you and how, but it also reveals hiding spots and other player's strategies. The savvy player will watch the killcam replay and seek out their killer's hiding spot, which is a point of controversy, although the killcam can be turned off in private matches. Ultimately, the best strategy in multiplayer is to keep moving at all times and keep a pair of eyes in the back of your head. Customization of the guns make everyone's play style possible, and it also keeps you wanting to play to unlock more things for each gun. Everyone has a unique character, you can be a stealthy sniper, fast shot-gunner, etc. It keeps it fresh and unique. The weapons are fun to use realistic, and are balanced too. The sniper rifles are awesome.\n\nOverall, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is an intense gaming experience from start to finish. The story is conveyed much better than the average FPS, the gameplay is varied enough to stay fresh, the graphics and sound both deliver, and the multiplayer is addictive. If Call of Duty 4 can attract enough fanboys away from Halo 3 to experience it, we may have a new contender for FPS of the year. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare proves that you don't have to have Spartan superwarriors, wrenches, portals, or sci-fi to create a great shooter game.\n\nIt is worth purchasing. Buy it!\nMy Rating - "Phenomenal"\nTraditional Rating - 10/10.","August 3, 2014","true","784.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

And what a much-needed reboot it was. The mounting ennui with the WWII setting for shooters at the time that CoD4 was announced meant it came along at just the right time to win over both old fans of the series, as well as new players coming off of other series which were winding down.\n\nYou would think that being over four years old would leave it looking quite dated, however  the movement and graphical fidelty hold up well enough to make playing through the single player campaign an enjoyable experience to this day. Which is a good thing because  the multiplayer community is probably near non-existant at this point since there have been more Call of Duty games release since this one than there were before it.","December 27, 2011","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The hitboxes are more accurate, the GUI is extremely simple and easy to grasp. Each gun has their own unique feel which really grasps the player into the game. The graphics from when the game was made is indeed playable, graphics isn't an issue in this game as the mechanics and engine run so smooth.\n\nI'd suggest getting this on PC due to cheat protection software, punkbuster. The servers are also player hosted and you get a server-list so that you can choose whether or not you want to play with mods and interfere with annoying hackers. Consoles do not offer this.\n\nAnd the campaign has a amazing story so I have no review on that for the time being because you need to enjoy it for yourself.","June 20, 2014","true","33.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was before Call of duty got muddled up  and full of useless excess. Like the maps in this game are unique but you still know where your going. It seems in the new Cods the maps make no sense and the Create a Classes are just overloaded.  See the beauty of it is that they could have made this game as complex as the call of duties nowadays but they knew it didn't need it.... and it was before Activision got greedy. Just good maps a few guns, attachments, game modes and addictive gameplay and BAM!!! Cod4. As a player who has put countless hours on this game across many platforms, the fact that I still enjoy playing it should speak for itself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaceory/recommended/7940/","zaceory","Zack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaceory/","1005 products in account","COD4 has the best multiplayer and singleplayer component of any COD to date that I've played. The campaign's missions are all creative and fun to play. All Ghillied Up, No Fighting in the War Room and Mile High Club are among the best missions in any COD. Finishing Mile High Club on Veteran was one of the most rewarding achievements I've ever recieved. Such an amazing campaign...except for that ending of One Shot, One Kill where you have to wait on the helicopter. That was horrible on veteran.\n\nMultiplayer is obviously why COD makes the billions and COD4 is arguably the peak of the franchise. Struck the perfect formula of leveling and unlocking in a competitve FPS. Subsequent CODs simply added more killstreaks, maps, guns, modes etc to keep things fresh, but they are all building off of the success that COD4 created. Amazing game.","March 24, 2014","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
