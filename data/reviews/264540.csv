Look no further. With elements of Steamworld Dig (randomised mines, collect minerals of ever-increasing value the deeper you go, locate portals for quick returns in trickier parts of the map) this offers plenty of replayability, even though the shooting and platforming elements start to get a little repetitive over what seems to be a single enormous level. Similar to the level creation in Cargo Commander, you give your new level a name and the game randomises it based on that name...somehow.\n\nThe deeper you go into the mines, the more chance you have of scoring better guns, although the loot system is a little disappointing. There aren't randomised gun effects, only % stats (higher damage, firing rate, etc) and there are precious few different hats you can wear to give you extra stuff, like 2 additional jumps (yes, you can jump 5, 6 or even 7 times in the air).\n\nJumping feels a little floaty, and your gun has the annoying tendancy to point upwards when you're jumping up to a higher platform, meaning you inadvertently fire vertically rather than horizontally like you were expecting. However once you get used to how your character moves, you'll be zipping around levels in no time (an XBox 360 controller is recommended).\n\nYour character can only see a limited distance around him/her, and when you get damaged this cone of vision starts to shrink, meaning you can get into some really nasty spots with extremely limited vision - you may find this a welcome addition or an annoyance.\n\nStill, those quibbles aside, Platformines offers a ton of platforming content and that addictive, often elusive "just one more play until I get to the next portal/find a better gun/grab that sparkly bit of ore over there" feel. Here's hoping the developers add more randomised loot and abilities in a future patch. There's certainly no reason to try the demo first and see if you like it.","March 28, 2014","true","9.7"," 116 of 141 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","116","141","0","0"

Basically, if you like platformers, rogue-likes (minus permadeath) and exploration, you just can't regret purchasing this jewel.\n\nIt's both hard and easy to describe it: you're locked in a kind of transe, quite unable to say "okay, I'm done for today". You're never really done because the game makes it very hard to stop playing: everything is smooth and lightning-fast (no loading times, no complicated GUI; you can warp back to your base, sell your loot and be back exploring the mines within a 10 second time window), so you never really find a down time that allows you to exit the game.\n\nIn Normal mode, death is not overly punitive (haven't played higher difficulty modes yet, took time to post recommendation :p), but just enough to make you wish you weren't dead, so you just basically dive back into it to get your loot back and farm some more. It has this strange "Metroid meets Rogue" feeling that will make you play over and over.\n\nThe Metroid feeling is present both in the visuals and the tight platforming controls (which are excellent by the way, it's pretty scarce to see a dev get it right, and it's especially important in this game where basically everything wants you dead), and this strange loneliness/suffocating feeling when you're exploring the mines and can't find a portal to warp back to your  base and get some heal.\n\nKudos for the 5-jumps feature, which I was skeptical about at first, but I gotta admit, mastering it gives an incredible feeling, again, quite similar to Metroid's Space Jump.","March 30, 2014","true","7.0"," 40 of 52 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","40","52","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/264540/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Gamers love exploring caves. From scripted spelunking in the likes of Super Metroid, to randomly generated environments like Terraria, the process of slowly moving through untouched caverns is a traditional thrill within the video game medium that never seems to get old.\nPlatformines is a title that attempts to fuse the ideas of the random and the scripted. Every run of Platformines takies place in a uniquely-generated labyrinth filled with key collectibles you need to grab to escape. This is then topped off with collectible gear and guns that appear, at least aesthetically, to bear more than a passing resemblance to the Borderlands titles.\nIt’s an admirable concept to be sure and, initially, it presents something rather compelling. The games art style and reliance on midi versions of classical music gives it an early 90’s PC vibe, while the mix of rigid platforming and shooting is simple but alluring.\nSo the idea of Platformines is that you move around the maze following an objective arrow to find colour guns with which to re-build your ship to escape the mine. As you move around the mine you can grab precious minerals to sell for money, and money can be used to buy equipment such as guns and headgear, as well as big buffs to your pocket capacity and health. The maze is also filled with checkpoints. Hitting one of these allows you to instantly warp back to base camp to refill your health and do all the bartering and escape vessel construction.\nPlatformines is a game full of great ideas. For example, your health dictates the size of your field of view, giving you an incentive to keep health high and think before you leap. It’s tense to find yourself low on health, barely able to see five fingers in front of yourself, when you’ve a backpack full of precious material you wish to sell. Go back the way you came or try and reach the next checkpoint?\nIt’s a shame, really, that the execution is what lets Platformines down. The most glaring example is that death is pretty pointless, on the lowest difficulty anyway. Checkpoints aren’t too infrequent, and it’s super easy to retrace your steps. The game is cruel, frequently, but on your initial run this cruelty just aggravates due to the minimal punishment. Death is only a truly worrying factor on higher, unlockable difficulties.\nWhy? Because the combat is all too basic. Titles like Spelunky are simple, but they augment their fighting through a host of items and elements. Platformines’ combat is frightfully ridged. You have access to four weapons – pistol, shotgun, machine gun and bazooka – but they all largely serve the same purpose; shoot forward. Well, forward, up or down, there’s no twin stick or free aim here. This makes the combat feel very clunky, and it pretty much stays like this regardless of the game’s presentation evoking Borderlands.\nPlatforming, too, is mostly unsatisfying. From the off it’s possible to jump five times from an initial hop. One, two, three, four, five. It gives the actual jumping a loose, careless feel. It’s likely a safety net for the random level design, but it comes across as lazy and unsatisfying in play.\nNow, all of this isn’t to condemn Platformines as a bad game. It’s actually quite a serviceable time waster, but it’s impossible to avoid the notion that the designers’ desire to have random environments has led to undernourished gameplay. The reason a game like Metroid or Steamworld Dig work is because they’re games designed around abilities and worlds working in harmony, full of interesting, key moments that genuinly reward the exploration. Progress in Platformines just gives you more clunky combat in different coloured environments.\nPlatformines isn’t a bad game, it’s just a largely unpolished one. The mechanics feel either loose or under-developed, leading to a game that’s entertaining but never spectacular or truly engaging. If you’re a Spelunky addict and need another fix then Platformines may give you a few hours of enjoyment, but those who prefer a bit more order and polish to their game design would do well to be cautious.\n\n","August 6, 2015","true","14.1"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","32","39","0","0"

The Robodig is destroyed and you must fix it! Or something! So let's just shoot the story and go for a little platforming and shooting and loot collecting... in a mine!\n\nPlatformines is a nice package indeed, combining features from several genres to create a fun game that does nothing really new but still feels fresh.\n\nYou start by creating a male or female character from a couple of visual options, and are then brought into a randomly generated mine (where your ship, the Robodog, totally crashed). Your job is to explore the mine and relocate several building blocks to restore the ship- and to do so you need to fight masses of enemies, collect coins and loot, upgrade your equipment and be an all-round badass.\n\nYou also get to listen to a chiptune rendition of "Hall of the Mountain King."\n\nPlatforming is nice and precise even with a keyboard, though a pad is clearly better. From the get-go you have quintuple jumps, and there is almost no momentum, so you'll quickly put Mario to shame by staying airborne and shooting things easily. Vanity items you collect can give you even more jumps and also change armour rating, weapon damage, and other attributes.\n\nShooting feels old-school and satisfying. You can equip up to four weapons (pistol, shotgun, machine gun and launcher) and just like the Borderlands games every weapon is procedurally generated, so you'll often find something surprising. There's no ammo limit either; while weapons have magazines and reload times you always have "infinite bullets".\n\nAnd there's more equipment, most notably energy belts that increase the amount of damage you can take but also larger backpacks: You'll collect gems on your way to sell in your homebase OR, and this is interesting, to replenish your shield belts. Do you dare to try and secure that teleporter over there and chash in on the gems, or would you rather play it save and spend them to make it further down the mine?\n\nAll in all, this really feels like an over the top "roguelike" without permadeath. Your home base is a safe haven where you can store loot, shop a little, and save your progess. The mine is constantly repopulated with enemies so if you need to grind for money you'll soon have some "easy places" to get some cash. It's NOT a metroidvania game- from the get-go you're able to explore as you see fit, only limited by your firepower and skill.\n\nAnd is it fun? That's the most important question after all! And yes, it is. It's a fun little platform shooter with charming retro graphics and a lot of replayability. It's not OUTSTANDING and it doesn't really do anything new, but it's a nice mix of genres that'll keep fans of simple arcade games entertained for a good while!","March 29, 2014","true","3.0"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","35","50","0","0"

Launching in late March without much, or really close to any fanfare, I decided to install it one rainy Saturday afternoon and it was like finding a box of brightly colored toys in a dusty, spidery attic. A lot of the gameplay elements here are very familiar -- precision platforming, gobs of randomized loot, a never-ending cycle of weapon upgrades -- but it feels fresh, these elements were never combined in quite this way before.\n\nIt reminds me most of the lauded roguelike platformer Spelunky, except where Spelunky is all about survival, Platformines is more about exploration and aggression. There is a very large overworld to explore, and the further you move away from your base in the middle(ish) of the map in any direction, the more difficult the enemies are, enemies you can eliminate with one of four different types of gun. After finishing the game on the default difficultly level (5-6 hours) I uncovered about 25% of the map, so there's a lot of map here to explore if you're willing. There's also a fun, punk-pixel sense of style from outlandish costumes and hair-dos to five-eyed blob monsters to platforms filled with whirring blades of bloody death.\n\nOn the downside, the game is a tad on the short side, but for the price and the type of game, I'm really not sure a 10-20 hour epic would have worked. I would have liked to have seen more enemy and area variety, plus a better reward for finishing the game rather than "the same thing, only harder," but I certainly don't feel cheated in any way. This was a great little game from out of left field, and I'm going to be keeping an eye on Magiko to see what they come up with in the future.","April 18, 2014","true","7.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","2"

Enemies get progressively tougher, but you compensate by buying better weapons. Unfortunately, the endgame spoils most of the fun. When you have to collect the final item, you'll have to face enemies that you can no longer kill in one shot (or even two or three), there are way more obstacles to deal with, and you'll die in a flash. The spawnpoints are pretty annoying, because frequently there will be some trap or a bunch of enemies, forcing you to basically teleport back and forth to recover until everthing in the immediate vicinity is dead. While I don't mind games where you die a lot, it shouldn't be for the frustrating reasons you'll die in this game. By the end, the only reason you'll finish is because the entire game takes you less than five hours (unless you want to collect all chests) and with about twenty to thirty minutes of perseverance, you'll get the final item. But where in a game like VVVVV, you feel like you've accomplished something, with Platformines you'll just be happy that it's over.","April 25, 2015","false","4.6"," 36 of 57 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","36","57","0","0"

In this world, you start as a named character derived from the clothing with which you’ve equipped your character. You explore the world with the hope of reviving your spaceship and escaping the planet. Unlike old games, the spaceship is made entirely of blocks and your mission is to find all the block-cannons that allow you to repair your ship by filling in the missing blocks. Thankfully there's a map, waypoint, and numerous portals which make this considerably easier. Unlike Binding of Issac, death doesn't remove you from the map which is both good and bad.\n\nGameplay\n\nAs with any rogue, you explore the world and get stronger as you go deeper (or in this case closer to the surface of the planet). The game differentiates the difficulty with colors, starting with a yellow core and moving outside into eventually red and some light yellow at the edge of the map.  As you get closer to the edge, the map gets harder to traverse (a lot more dead-ends in addition to more annoying bazooka enemies).\n\nIn addition, there are what I call dead spots on the map which are small, empty pockets that are impossible to enter since they don't connect to any main road. It can be bad if one of the required block-cannon pieces are in this. The map isn't completely random as there are common structures that appear throughout it.\n\nThere are random grey and red chests that contain guns, gems and gear.  The grey ones are unmarked and their loot is mediocre. Grey chest loot is useful but not rare. For example, a hat that gives you the double jump ability.  Red ones usually have better loot, are marked and usually placed in one of the few predefined "dungeons" which are small. The dungeon itself is rarely hard, but given how everything around it is randomly generated, it may require some effort to find the 'correct" entrance. Even then, not all enemies that are supposed to be inside are generated correctly.\n\nLittered around the whole area are portals which allow one to easily jump back to base to sell their loot or deposit it in a safe. Upon death, you lose 5% of your current money and also keep, from experiments, the 20 most expensive items on you (not counting what you have equipped). The respawn is quick and the loot isn't too hard to retrieve as it is dropped where you died. I, however, did get a few gems stuck in blocks. In one case, I lost them as they landed on a spiked block moving left and right and the gems got stuck in the block above the spike. In other cases, it's possible for you to spawn into an enemy or group and take damage when you get out of a portal. I'd say this is a huge bug as you can't usually react quickly enough to kill everyone, leading to your death. More importantly, you lose 5% of your money and possibly gems, depending on what's below.\n\nThere's no true concept of levels or experience which is both good and bad. The RPG elements come down to you buying better gear(larger energy belt/back pack) and guns. Guns are dropped randomly from humans as well as robots… I guess all those machines have robot hands to fire them. However, the game does have a concept of unlocking guns as the first few "layers" usually only have pistol drops. You later unlock machine guns, shot guns and bazookas, although not necessarily in that order. Weapons are also randomly generated, like Borderlands, so there rarely are dupes.\n\nCombat usually involves you shooting in one of four directions at enemies. It’s simple but there are a few notes to keep in mind. Ammo is infinite but reload time might not be trivial. The main character is powered by an energy bar which can be recharged by gems that can picked up. These gems come in different varieties and each instance is unique. Each item heals slightly more or less but items within the same bracket don’t deviate much. Your item cap is annoying early on and usually always is through all upgrades..\n\nAs I mentioned with layers above, each "layer" has a certain set of enemies, environmental hazards and loot. However, most all of the enemies are the same ones you've seen before but with different colors, different guns and more damage.  The patterns, once you get past a few layers, are mostly the same but their numbers and damage increase a lot once you get to the edge. Guns, in a similar fashion, drop based on their layer (in terms of damage) and so they "fit" with the layer. That being said, if you want the best weapons to use and sell early on, just keep going to the edge.\n\nI leave enemies near the end of the review since there's not much to say. Most are generic and you'll see the same set of enemies, just with different colors which implies that they do more damage, depending on the layer. The only frustrating part is that you don't have an invulnerability window. If 10 enemies shoot at you and they connect, you will take damage from all of them. Other times, enemies spawn in a “dead-end” place and are unable to move or fight back. That being said, fall damage and crush damage is meaningless late game as it does <1% of your energy bar...\n\nOverall, I like the old gameplay style and the new twist on it. That being said, there is a decent amount of grinding to get to the edge of the map by getting better guns. But compared to other games, it's not too bad.  However, it can get repetitive if you're not a huge fan of exploring or rogue.  Combat is ok and what I expected so nothing fancy. There are annoyances like being unable to get to the bottom of your inventory quickly so I'd say it's good but isn't polished. Because of this, I'd rate it at 7/10.\n\nGraphics\n\nGiven the title and art, one shouldn't expect great things. The art is bland and in some places recycled with highlights for the layering. This mainly applies to some enemies, particularly the cannon ones but some later one as well. Mostly everything in the background environment (walls/floor), is a block or platform. This makes enemies and drops stand out a lot. I'd give it a 6/10 there.  If you're into old graphics, it's not a problem but could be for those who want something more.\n\nMusic\n\nProbably the blandest section here, most of all the music is randomly selected and is mainly classical music (Mozart, Beethoven and the like) with highlights and modifications.  Its ok, but I'd recommend listening to your own music if you plan to replay it again in hard mode or related. 4/10\n\nReplayability\n\nThis depends on the person. If you're ok with grinding/rogue then this has a lot of it, as maps and weapons are randomly generated. Otherwise, this might be a one-shot game. While there are a lot of places to explore and chests to open, the one thing I kind of hate is that the loot isn't scaled in chests, especially when you revisit to get all the red chests for example. I can see enemy loot not being scaled since their difficulty is defined by their layer and should be the same for a run. However, chests are random drops and since they usually require some effort to get to them, should have better loot. 6/10\n\nOverall I'd say this game is made to scratch a certain itch. Like Binding of Issac it is generated from scratch and you're on it until you finish. The gameplay is dead simple and repetitive but there are those who might like it. I can't see myself going for the harder difficulty levels at the moment, but I might do it sometime later.\n\n23/40 ~ 57.5%.\n","August 11, 2015","true","11.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The soundtrack in this game is so awesome to play to, most of it being crunchy chip tune remixes of classical music. It's a little random but I feel like it's perfect. The graphic style is also really well done. Sadly there isn't any crafting element in this game really. You would think with the blocky environments and "biomes" that it would be a building game but it isn't\n\nThe main focus of the game is to explore procedurally generated mines for the tools needed to repair the Robodig and return to the surface. Depending on what seed you choose, you will have a different result from another player, or you can share a seed and have the same mine. The main base hub is always the same, and the mines expand radially from the that. The further you venture the more difficult it gets. Enemies and traps do more damage. The "tiers" or rings of mine are color coded to show which difficulty level you're in.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty straightforward and fast paced for me, venture out a bit, defy gravity with quad jumps, collect gems and metals, find a teleport to return to base and sell them, and repeat. You'll take a ton of damage in later mine tiers but I found the Knight hat helped with damage reduction, and there's always a teleport nearby which will bring you back to base and recharge your shields. You can customize your character a tad in the beginning, and also find hats/wigs/weapons that add stats to your characer throughout.\n\nI'm not sure how much replay value I can say this game has after completing a map and exploring all the times. The story is minimal and barely present, but I really do enjoy the gameplay and presentation so far. Hoping to see bigger and better things from this dev in the future.","May 3, 2014","true","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Later you can decide how difficult you want your run to be, either stay in teh easy areas and get loot or challenge yourself by going deeper into the dungeon. Highly recommend this to anyone who likes these type of games. The controller is setup a little differently but you will get used to it really quickly. I am an old time gamer and I was comfortable with the controls shortly after starting the game.","June 15, 2014","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only nitpicks I had with the game is I wish it was more borderlands 2 and it offered more guns and more hats and items to use. I kind of wish they would pick funny names for weapons to make them more memorable instead of the generic Pistol achren k200 series.\n\nHowever I still enjoyed the game and what it offered.

Not to say the game is bad but it isn't great, and at times it's just flat out not fun. The main idea of the game is to go and get these launchers, in a very large, randomly generated mine, that place these missing pieces onto your robot drill in order to escape. It seems a simple task untill you realize how crazy difficult some sections of the mines can be in order to reach your destination. Through out the mines you'll find nuggets of treasure all over the place that range in value and increase in rarity as you stretch out deeper into the mines, which are used to transform into currency back at the base so you can buy storage and health increase upgrades as well as weapons. The collector kind of player will certainly feel at home with this feature of the game as there are pleanty of different treasures to collect. Alternatively you can use the treasures for health. Most of the best weapons you'll come across by killing off other enemies or found in a chest. Weapons come with increasing stats as you venture further into the mine so that you can stand against the tougher badies as you progress, almost in Borderlands style. Sometimes spike traps, or electrical platforms will be inconviniently in your way of teleporters that act as checkpoints, which would eat away at your life, hindering you're ability to progress smoothly. Or you might be faced off with an enemy whose just too mighty for you and will kill you in seconds, even with quick reflexes. This doesn't become a huge problem till the end game. Platforming in the game is solid and pricise thankfully. This game can offer a nice sum of game time of about 5 hours on anyones first run, but the game doesn't give you much reason to do it all again in the higher difficulties.

After a two runs through the game, I can't say there's much customisation. Most likely, you'll change your hat/wig three or four times per run, because there aren't many different hats, and some of them are way better than others, meaning once you've found them, you won't change anymore.\n\nThe gameplay itself was good (I really liked the "must get to next portal" feeling, adds a bit of tension), but if you're searching for a game in which you FEEL yourself improving, I wouldn't recommend it. You have 4 gun types, only the stats change (maning you won't get "the cool weapon that shoots firebeams", which would be really nice though), hats don't change your play style that much (2 more jumps, a bit of armor maybe, nothing game breaking).\n\nSpeaking of the gameplay, you have to get 9 items to repair your robot and finish the game. Actually, most of the time, you'll be rushing straight to those items, while searching for portals along the way, which you'll be using as "checkpoints", or to sell your items. Two possibilities : the key item is in an area with high-damage ennemies, in which case you'll get some money (by killing ennemies and finding gems, metals and chests) to upgrade your health bar and just tank through it, or it'll be in a "low-level area", in which case you'll tank through it right away.\n\nEnnemy variety was also meh, I counted 7 diffent ennemies (little flying monster, big flying monster, small splitting flying monster, big splitting flying monster, turret, human with randomized gear, flying worm), with some color or model changes (for exemple, bats and "eyes" are actually the same).\n\nIf you're a leaderboard fan, and if you like playing the same game (with a mildly-randomized map) to improve your time, or your number of death, I'd say it's a great game.\nIf, like me, you're a rogue-like/adventure fan, you'll play it once, maybe twice, and that's it.

Reply value could be increased in the future if the dev decides to add coop game play much like risk of rain and adds a bit more variety in mosters / objects.\n\nall in all I would give its a 5/10 but would hightly suggest waiting till its 75% off at least if you are interested in it.","June 20, 2014","false","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Maybe if it cost £1 I would recommend it. The game is not unfixable but nothing is being done with it and just to clarify I don't mind a challenge but the way the game works is the more energy your shield (energy is just HP in this game) has the more you see around you so you basically can't see your surroundings when your shield drops below 30% or so and in the late game that will be happening very often as you take heavy damage.\n\nPeople calling this a 2D borderland are being very generous.\n\n\nEdit: The game is also NOT a rouge-like as stated on store page tags. It has a Iron man mode but you have to beat normal then hard to unlock and even then it is simply perma death, nothing more.\n\n2nd Edit: I also forgot to mention the terrible soundtrack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAwd9wn9slI\n\nCompare that do something like Risk of Rain's (also the same price) sountrack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgCmmax-unE","August 25, 2015","false","5.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

That's right, you can occupy the same space as an enemy and die almost instantly because they harm you by just being next to you.

I'm quite a fan and really like seeing new twists on the genre with things like Nom Nom Galaxy. I was looking forward to Platformines on a recent indie bundle, and I was unfortunately disappointed.\n\nAt its core, Platformines is a good start. Running and gunning, collecting gems and minerals and defeating baddies, then using collected shinies to buy upgrades. That's all fine and dandy, and it runs great to boot, but the actual presentation was less than perfect. The aiming mechanic, at least with the  recommended  controller, is abysmal, leading me to wonder why exactly I was shooting down when I was pointing up. The levels seem to be quite randomly rather than procedurally generated, with quick-access portals located right above giant drops (plus really easy-to-get fall damage).\n\nThe text and general UI, while maybe more of a technical thing, seems really unfinished, since there are occasional grammar issues and oddly scaled text. Plus single digit pop-ups always come across as two-digit like +$05 or -07, which seems a bit unnecessary. The store interface in particular seems really sketchy because of its UI, and that's not counting the distressing lack of a "sell all" button in a game that requires collecting and selling large quantities of resources.\n\nSo I'm not recommending this game mainly because it seems really unfinished. If you want a really simple pixely game with decidedly non-pixely music (classical is not retro!), then you may in fact like this game. However, anyone going for an in-depth, solidly built game had best look elsewhere.","August 12, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/losian/recommended/264540/","losian","Losian Rooke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/losian/","285 products in account","At first glance, looks cute, about an hour in poking around.. It was a pain to setup the controller because, for whatever reason, "controller support" just means xbox. (have already beaten normal mode in < 3 hours, see edit towards end.)\n\nIf you have a non xbox controller, then dig  your xpadder/joy2key or whatever else and fight with it.\n\nFor heaven's sake, devs.. Why do you keep making controller supported games that DO NOT support simple basic Windows-recognized controller keymapping? Come on. :/\n\nAfter playing a bit, well.. You'll be disappointed by weapon variety. There's four, that's it. They're randomized, sure,  but unless you find the difference of 10 damage from one pistol to another to be "unique" and "fun" then you won't be amazed by that. There's also some gear, but all I've found so far are hats and wigs, which occupy the same 'slot,' and seem to only be slightly randomized. Most of this gear also seems to be stuff available at character creation, as well. You pick a hat/hair/etc., and I haven't really seen anything separate from what was available at creation, so there's no real excitement to loot or progression, except the randomized slow increase on weapon stats. Not at all interesting or fun.\n\nThe AI on enemies also seems very basic.. They can see you through walls and will just shoot randomly while pacing back and forth. You also start to see repeats in the world organization pretty quickly, I'm already starting to recognize configurations of rooms and such. :(\n\nIt's a cute game, but there's just not a heck of a lot of bulk to it, especially for $10 compared to others in that same range. Needs many more weapons, more effects and random properties, etc.\n\nAs best I can tell there's a big randomized map, the game randomizes the location of some 'block guns' into locations that arbitrarily harder. There's no real metroidvania progression or anything to get from one to another, just pure stats - you'll be one shotted if you don't get better weapons and farm money for higher energy. You collect the guns, shoot some blocks near where you start, win; rinse repeat on higher difficulties. It has a good look overall, I just feel like this game needs more depth.. More varities and variations on weapons, not just four with slightly different attacks. Contra had more weapons!  The 'equipment' also seems pretty slim. Unless you really wanna pound out each difficulty for the arbitrary increase in difficulty you probably won't get but a handful of hours from it, and it rings in steep at $10 for other games with much mor depth and playtime.\n\nEdit: Well.. Less than three hours and I beat normal mode. No real incentive to play the harder difficulties, I imagine it's just the same but arbitrarily harder. :(\n\nI also understand the nature of input types and dealing with it, it's just frustrating to have to fiddle 3rd party programs just because my controller (which is all but a clone of an xbox contrller anyway, just nicer and with better battery life/bluetooth) doesn't jive with how they set it up. PC games are ideal for their flexibility- you don't have to have a specific keyboard or mouse or peripheral, and particularly considering it's fully recognized, buttons and axes and all, in Windows itself, a little support would be great from more games.\n\nAs for PLatformines, well, if you have a total hard-on for leaderboards and intensely repetitive gameplay then more power to ya. It's a cute game - the music is all kinda cute but also just chip-tune-y remixes of well known songs (sugar plum fairies, stuff like that.) As I said above: There's four weapons, they do not get in any way more interesting, there's no randomness or random abilities or special effects except for their damage/reload times; they remain largely the same, just higher damage and some variation reload time and such. The only reason to even bother to kill enemies is to upgrade your belt (health) and perhaps get a better helmet (knight is good since you don't have to kill anything, just get the defense and run.) It's a cute game all in all, but it just feels beyond flat. Sorry devs, good effort, but I definitely feel like I just wasted $10 for a mere couple hours of fun.","March 28, 2014","false","2.5"," 73 of 160 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","73","160","0","10"

If your bagback(?) is full you return to your base (teleport gate), sell your stuff and go back, thats pretty much it. Of course there is a main quest: You must collect "Block cannons" to repair your *NO I DONT SPOILER HERE!* but anyhow that only gives you an "direction" where you COULD go next and nothing more...\n\n-I somehow miss a multiplayermode in this game, its really pretty (f*ckin) lonely in a random cave shooting random people and what not, srs.\n\n-Also, Who ever said "its Borderlands in 2D" never played Borderlands i guess: Platformines has not really any skillsystem (no skilltree or LVL up) also you dont collect EXP or like. the only thing which COULD come close to Borderlands is that it gives a lot of weapons...but anyhow, in this 2d Game, you dont really noice the differance of the guns in the same typ (it gives 4 types: Pistol, SMG, Shotgun, Rocket launcher)\n\nAfter so much "bad things" i can say really only some good things about...\n\n+The grafic fits to the style of the game\n\n+Its pretty easy to "jump into the action", means, its easy to play.\n\n+You play a VERY f*ckin big random cave and srs, it IS huge!\n\n\n\nSo to be fair and fact: Platformines shows more as it really has, it could get pretty fast boring coz its everytime kinda the same: run into the cave - loot - back to base - sell - run into the cave. Also coz that the cave IS SUCH HUGE AND RANDOM i miss really someone on my side who helps me out or i could share the fun...It plays just "unfinish"...it really feels like the creators missed something, srs.\n\nSo for my opinion, BEST try FIRST the DEMO and make your OWN Fact about but i -CANT- say its a bad OR a good game.\nSo i would give it a 3 out of 5 star voting.","March 28, 2014","false","2.0"," 16 of 48 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","16","48","0","0"

I just think it could really use an update where you can buy more upgrades and possibly have a better selection of hats that provide a greater variety of gameplay style options.","February 16, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each level or world is randomly generated and in order to progress you must find 4 items. The graphics is crisp with an unique art style. The controls are responsive and there is a 5-6 multi-jump function, which can be VERY helpful! Unfortunately, this game also has a weird shooting mechanism, where your WASD movement keys are also used to control the direction of your aim. You can't use the mouse to aim. This can feel a little awkward and can get very annoying when you're trying to jump and shoot at the same time. The enemies are rather limited in terms of variety, and include humans, flying bats, floating blocks, and winged demon-things. Luckily, there is a ton of traps populating each world, which makes the platforming both chaotic and fun.\n\nThis game also has a currency system where you gain money from looting fallen enemies, opening treasure chests, or by selling items. You can then use that money to buy upgrades. There is also alot of items in the game and can be categorized into four groups: gems, hats, guns, and health. The gems are found throughout each world and can be sold for money or used to restore health. The hats and guns are found by looting dead enemies, opening chests, or buying from merchants. The health  upgrade items can only be bought from merchants, and will permanently increase your health.\n\nIn terms of weapons, there are only 4 types of guns, but with MANY variations in level of damage. This game also has  upgrades in terms of MANY collectable hats (that either increases the weapon damage and armor, or decreases weapon reload time). They are definitely useful and also look great!\n\nFinally, this game has one very innovative feature that I haven't seen in other similar games. There is a fog-of-war effect where your visibility is limited when exploring a new area and it is also connected to how much health you have. So, the lower your health, the smaller your field of view!\n\nIn summary:\n\nPROS:\nInteresting fog of war feature\nRandomly generated worlds\nGood balance with alot of traps, difficult enemies, but also upgradeable perks\nMany different types of collectable hats and guns\nTight controls\nNice graphics\nDecent music and sound effects\n\n\n\nCONS:\nWeird aiming mech using WASD keys.\nLimited variety of enemies (bats, humans with guns, not much more...)\nLimited types of weapons (only pistol, shotgun, machinegun, rocket launcher)\nLimited item perks (increase damage, increase armor, increase health, or shorten weapon reload time)\n\n\nA fun, addictive game but lacks enough depth in terms of weapons variety (4 types of guns) and item selection (only hats, guns, gems, and a few health upgrades), and also has an awkward aiming system. If it had more variety in these areas with free mouse aiming, then I would definitely give it "10/10", "A must buy!", and "Has a ton of replay value". However, right now I would give it 8/10 and still recommend it to anyone who likes an affordably-priced platforming or side-scroller game.","June 14, 2015","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stylistically it feels like an old British Amiga 500 game somehow. It's not very challenging (at least on the normal difficulty).  I beat it on the same day I started playing it.  You don't lose much when you die, so the cash penalty seems kind of pointless.  The mine is always just a maze of concentric rings of increasing difficulty moving out from the center where you're located, so I can't imagine the random seed that generates the levels changing the game enough to warrant multiple playthroughs.  You just steadily find new weapons that are slightly better than the last ones as you kind of mindlessly keep searching farther and farther from the starting point until you find all the stuff you need, and then you're done.  It was enjoyable enough, but definitely the most casual roguelike I've ever played.","January 8","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
