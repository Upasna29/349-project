I find the controls aren't too intuitive but you get used to them; likewise the menu system is a bit confusing. NBA2K13 can be difficult to master but the AI is scalable to your skill level and there is a career mode which adds some variety to gameplay letting you work up the ranks. Looks great on a big screen!\n\n\n... oh & my favorite basketball game (incase you're wondering) remains the legendary NBA Jam TE! :p\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","September 26, 2013","true","3.9"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","2"

I seem to be the only person in the universe who doesn't care about playing a sports game online, so I can't say anything about the online aspect. What I can say is that it is one of the best sports games ever made, up in the tier of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 for the PS2, and Madden 09 for the PS2. The graphics are good enough, the gameplay is great and intuitive, there's a wide selection of ways to play the game, and the commentary is actually good. Seriously, barely anyone talks about the commentary but it's one of the best parts compared to other sports games. Also has complete controller support, which is a must, because playing with keyboard feels like piloting a submarine you know nothing about. The game also is very easy to mod, but don't expect anything crazy, you can only make the game look better. Overall great sports game, would recommend to any sports game or basketball fan.

Compared to the console versions, the PC version doesn't boast as many features, and one of the most notable issues many people have with this game is regarding the inablitly to easily play with your friends online. MyPlayer mode is great and will provide you with hours of entertainment, you can really have a fun time customising your player and helping him rise through the ranks of the NBA. I would not say that this game is enjoyable for all, but if you are a basketball fan, it is a must have. Basically with this game, you are getting what you pay for and nothing extra, but it is still fun nontheless.\nI would give it a solid 8/10 overall.","January 12, 2014","true","111.7"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","2"

Ones that you end up playing long after the newer yearly versions come out. For me it's like Tiger Woods 2005, MVP 2005, or NHL 2002 - NBA2K13 is a game that will be played for a long time. Personally, buying 2K14 is a waste of money. More about the content, this is the best basketball game I've played since the NBA Jam/HangTime/ShowTime series. With great visuals and excellent controls, that are easy to learn but hard to master, the game leaves you enjoying the moments. Plus all games are fully customizable and there is every mode you could want. I always love doing the create-a-player mode, where you follow the career, and here it delivers.

One where the ball somehow ended up on the Opposing teams head and wouldn't fall off till 5-10 seconds later and the second glitch was when the opposing team had to throw in the ball and it just seemed like both teams went into limbo(easily fixable with the save and quit,return feature) Yes i would recommend this 2k experience but before buying anyone must know that all the 2k servers for this game is down,meaning if you want to play online then you're best buying 2k15. Yes it is still playable and very enjoyable but this to me is a huge downfall. Plus it just makes 2k look even more money hungry. Which i understand they want us to buy and play the newer games over this version. Sometimes the commentary and music gets redundent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlycerX/recommended/219600/","SlycerX","SlycerX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlycerX/","276 products in account","This game is solid for what it is. It is well produced and well made, and it can lead to some very fun moments where you feel like a badass on the court. But as you keep playing, you'll eventually start to get frustrated and even angry at times. This is because of it's design even though it was well executed, like performing every step perfectly in a bad plan. I have 100 hours in this game so you can take this however you want.\n\nSo what's bad about the design? Everything feels sluggish. In the attempt to simulate real life, they gave every action you can make an unavoidable movement animation. A lot of times you just want your character to jump and block a shot, but instead he takes a second to recover from taking one step to the right and THEN jump after which the ball has already fell through your basket. This happens for everything from stealing to juking. The crucial split second window you need to achieve is sometimes unattainable just because your character takes way too long to react to your button presses.\n\nEvery action is also probability based. I understand if the shot risky, then it should give you a probability chance of getting the points or not, but it also extends to simple dribbling without pressure. Losing a ton of grade rating (the game's mechanism for telling you how well you are doing) because of a series bad random number generations is just so rage inducing, especially when it's something you expect to succeed.\n\nI guess these are my two biggest gripes about the game but there are a lot more I won't bother to go into detail for:\n- team grading punishes you hard for any mistake\n- punishes for bad call for passes when you just want to press A to skip the cutscene (A is call for a pass)\n- your character is sometimes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (when you attempt to steal he swipes in the OPPOSITE direction of the ball)\n- some movement animations take a couple seconds which is way too long\n- your character sometimes trips over for NO reason (total probability based ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t)\n- simulated games have 20min quarter while played games have 5min quarters. This inconsistency is bad because when it comes to awards which is determined by stats, you have players on other teams average 28 points, when it's pretty much impossible to score anywhere near that many points in your 5min quarter games\n- the indicator that tells you who to guard changes a lot, and the team grading system will still punish you even when the indicator randomly changes last second to a player who just scored, saying "Allowed man to score".\n\nThere are plenty more where that came from but I don't want to make it too long. I'll say again that the game IS well-produced, but there is just too much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that happens (every single game). This game commits one of the biggest sins of video gaming, do not ♥♥♥♥ off your players. And trust me, once you get more experienced and understand more about how this game works, you'll start rage quitting every second game.","August 22, 2014","false","106.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jadziatuvok/recommended/219600/","jadziatuvok","Nicholas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jadziatuvok/","763 products in account","Once again, this is a "negative positive" review since Valve don't give a neutral option.\n\nIt's a shame gameplay wasn't considered as important as Jay Z (perhaps I'm not in the target audience; I turned the music off after an hour), because this game takes backward steps in several areas.\n\nIn particular, the ever-popular My Player mode has poorly-considered and useless changes, such as:\n- Tedious, unskippable press conferences.\n- Hilariously bad pre-game "pep talks" (thankfully skippable).\n- The removal of set goals at the start of the game to earn points (dynamic goals appear, but are often ludicrously unachievable especially when you only play limited minutes or when they bear no relation to your player's role).\n- The coach now provides "feedback", which can include telling you repeatedly that he'll take you off at the next break without doing so.\n- Broken player minutes with some quarter time settings, resulting in your rookie spending the whole second half on the court, with literally no stamina for much of it.\n- In-game recaps of your performance which are nonsensical - a 6-point, 15-assist game results in commentators talking about you being a machine at the free-throw line , while your totally unremarkable game has them praising you as a dominant force.\n- Weaker rewards for training, which makes it even more tedious.\n- A lack of pre-set dunking animations, meaning that if you don't manually set dunking animations for your player, you can't dunk (baffling countless players who couldn't work out why their player refused to dunk)\n\nThere are plenty of problems in general, including:\n- Features are inexplicably missing from the PC version, including game modes, graphical features, custom soundtracks and a currency system. There is no apparent reason for this. Amusingly, you can earn some of the currency which isn't implemented in the game.\n- GM trading AI is broken. Cleveland signing Chris Paul and giving Paul and Irving 22 minutes a game each is ridiculous - even more so when my player was getting 8 assists a game from small forward. It got worse in the third season when they signed Ginobili and reduced Irving to 15 minutes a game for a few years\n- Some of the new animations of players gliding to the hoop look awfully scripted.\n- The Hoopcast mode inexplicably now only shows three players instead of the five on the court, making it extremely inconvenient to track your players' performance and stamina.\n- Historical teams are already unlocked, removing the enjoyable challenge of playing historical games to unlock them.\n- Watching Michael Jordan (or any graceful star) lose the ball during a spin due to the slightest touch with an opponent is rather depressing.\n\nDespite all this, it's not a bad game. The presentation is outstanding (aside from the music, but that's a matter of taste), with engaging commentary (though it loses a bit after the first season when the individualised comments dry up) and solid graphics. The new dribble control works reasonably well once you adjust. Gameplay is generally good, and a few of the more annoying AI issues have been fixed.\n\nHowever, there's more negatives than positives if you already have its predecessor.","May 4, 2014","true","106.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oh but how wrong you are. I actually don't watch basketball at all. But I was bored one day and decided to pick this game up. I had read many endearing things about it and thought why not? It was defenitely worth it.\n\nI mainly play the "MyCareer" mode, which is where you play as your own character and develop him through out the years you play. I definitely liked the development part, being a fan of RPG games.  You basically get points after each game which you can allocate to different skills on your character. These points can also be spent on perks and stuff to give them special abilities too (for example, all teamates get +2 abilites). I don't think that's anything new. What was nice about it though was that it didn't take 20 games to increase a stat (*cough *cough NHL *cough). You can usually increase one stat per game so you always feel like your character is getting better.\n\nThe gameplay was also good and the announcers actually comment on what's happening in game. It was a pleasant surprise, as I was used to Fifa and NHL. If you've ever played either, you know the commentary repeates pretty much every game. I'm not saying this games commentary doesn't repeat itself, it definitely does. It's just less noticable than those other games because there seems to be more than 5 lines  and it matches better to what's going on.\n\nThe one downside I did find was that you can't make another "MyCarrer" player. If you make anther character, it changes your original characters look to the new characters. Very annoying if you want to play as a different position and person. There's also the obvious downside in that it is a sports game and it gets repetitive after a while.\n\nEither way, if you are a fan of sports games and are bored of the awfulness that is FIFA 14 (seriously that's why I got this originally), then I recommend this game.","June 20, 2014","true","107.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With that said, I have to say that there's no excuse for it not to be a GREAT game. I like the gameplay itself, and I think you can't find better basketball simulation than that. But the gameplay, with good graphics is not enough for me, for a game like this.\nI can't enjoy playing the association mode with AI making just such illogical moves - whether it's trades or lineups, inability to sign free agents due to their asking price, too basic chemistry algorithms and so on. That show's me that K2 are not interested in making this game really better, they're just making the profit publishing the new version every year. Damn, if they would let me, I'd make improvements myself.

Career mode was the reason I purchased this game. I had heard alot of good things about it and decided to give it a try. I did like the personalization of your character and the style of gameplay. Unfortunately there were alot of other things the game did that were not as appealing. You could not access any other teams roster to see what other players around the league were rated. The movement on the court itself was quite frustrating as well, very choppy and jerky. If any actual basketball player moved like this in real life they would have him checked for parkinsons disease. I also do not like the fact the steal button is also the shoot button. I cannot tell you how many times I would come away with a steal only to heave the ball from the opposite end of the floor and have the coach yell at me for being a dumb ♥♥♥. Plus the GM on your team is always super idiotic with the moves he makes to create your team. This is something you have no control over and that will continuously aggravate you to no end. Things like signing Chris Paul in the off season when you already have Kyrie Irving when you really needed a Forward, small or power. It is little things like this that ruin good games. It is too bad, i did like this game at first, but as i kept on using NBA2K13, it just got more and more annoying until i no longer got enjoyment from playing it.","March 31","false","403.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I just do not know. I have no idea what the developers focused on to stand out, but this game blows in every aspect possible. This game for me is just plain unplayable. Worst 2k game ever. holding shift to spring makes my character stop moving and then start running again. The opposing players just walk right past me like I'm not even there while holding the tight defence button. My character makes no attempt to guard even when i use wsad to try to move him. My character responds extremely slow to keyboard inputs, it's 1 of the biggest problems. When i tip the ball out of someone's hands, I hold the movement keys in the direction of the ball, but my character just stands there until the opposing player just picks it back up again. The passes are painfully ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I could be standing at the top of the key and have a teamate standing in the corner. I could move towards him a little bit and press the pass button, and with no one in between us, and us standing maybe 15 feet apart, my character manages to pass it 20 feet above the teamate causing the ball to go into the bleachers and forcing a turnover. Fastbreaks after turnovers are impossible to do as pg. When the ball is passed to me, and I am the first person charging towards the basket, I press shift to sprint towards the basket, and get an easy dunk. My player then stops moving, then sets off again, allowing the defence to catch up to me and prevent me from scoring. If I don't sprint, then the defence also catches me. Dribble moves are beyond broken. Everytime I try to do a spin move on the defender, my character just drops the ball and lets the defender pick it up. I bought this game because I really liked those years of the nba, and this game had great reviews. This game is one of the worst games I have ever played.","February 15","false","61.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Its not the BEST but its good for the price. This game has everything you would expect form a NBA game. My only complaint is the online becuase barly anyone plays it and it takes a while to kind a game. A small thing i noticed with this game is the graphics, i expected them to be much better but the crowd in-game looks like trash, its easy to get used to though. So overall i would say if you want to play online with many people getting the newest NBA2k would be the best choise but if you want something cheap, fun and playable online excpet with a lack of players NBA2k13 is good enough.

I maxed the stats out on my first character, a point guard.\n\nPros\n- character development can be engaging\n- some people complain about the button controls but I find the flexibility to be interesting and compelling\n\nCons\n- I know 2k tries to make the game realistic and I am sure they have experts but they are missing some fundamental dynamics that really hurt the game. For goodness sakes they dont even know the difference between a screen and a pick.\n- While I dont mind the button controls, the actual player movement in the game is a disaster and I cant find a way to fix it. You have mangetic players that stick to one another. What I mean by that is even if you are trying to run in a certain direction the game forces you to face in directions you dont want to face and these crappy animations end up controlling more movement that you do with the controller. Response time is awful. There is a huge delay between when you press a button and when the action occurs. There have been times I tried to lunge sideways to block a pass and the ball is already at half court before my player moves, who was under the basket.\n- player AI is aweful. Why on earth would a guard on defense stand at the corner of the key when the offensive player is at the three point line? The number of open 3's in the game is ridiculous and when the guard stands at the corner of the key he obstructs trying to guard the post player.\n- 3 second defensive rule is rubbish in the NBA and it is rubbish in this game. If the offensive player is standing at the edge of the paint then you should still be able to stand between him and the basket without getting a penalty called on defense.\n- The game is too stats driven. All that matters is what your stat is in a particular area. Success should have more focus on position both for defense and offense. A 7 foot offensive player should not miss a dunk with a 6 foot point guard on him. He misses because the guard has a defense rating of 95 - in that situation size is more important.\n- Coaching management is aweful. Why on earth does my 6 foot point guard enter the game at center, power forward or even small forward? Why does my center enter the game at small forward? It makes no sense and there is no coach in the NBA that would be so stupid.\n\nIn addition to those issues, the game needs more dynamic interaction. Why cant I yell at that stupid scoring guard during the game who keeps jacking up 3's while guarded and without defenders back to try and rebound? Why cant I yell at that point guard who dances around the half court line and then mysteriously tries to pass across court to a guarded player on the base line? Why cant I hell at the point guard who goes fastbreak up the court when all the defenders are back and tries to drive into 3 defenders?\n\nThese comments are based on my career mode and not online play. Online play is a waste of time when people find ways to mod characters - like COD - I will never understand why people still put out money for that crap.\n\nFrom the reviews I read, neither of the later NBA2k games are any better. They are producing the exact same product with a few minor features with updated rosters and player stats. Dont be a robot fanboy and pay attention to what you pay for.","May 21","false","765.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Of course, they don't care if you cannot play for a week and your saves get all messed up.\n\nThey certainly won't reset the VC you purchased even though their glitches set you back 6 weeks earlier into the season and everything you've done before then is gone.  No, they act like VC is real money and it will cost them something to give it back to you.\n\nAnyway, the game could be fun and the graphics were decent but, Take 2's policies ruined the experience for me (They did the same thing in 2k14 and I didn't give them another chance).","November 14, 2014","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

For that price, amazing deal. This game has moderately nice graphics, a decently accurate player recreation (The game players look like the ones in real life), and is pretty exciting .\n\nCONS:\nThe game almost forces outcomes of a game. For example, you could be up by 20 and in the 4th quarter the other team scores 24 and your team scores 7. +You're team doesn't get open looks and hits shots. It feels like 2K purposely does this to make the game more exciting, (tie game with 45 seconds left after leading for so long) but it's just ridiculous","July 17, 2013","true","197.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

If you love Basketball as much as I do; I think you'd love this game as much as I do.  I've been playing with a wired Xbox 360 Controller and it performs smoothly.  I will venture a guess that playing with a keyboard is not going to be fun.  As this is my first NBA 2K I bought myself game since 2K was on the Dreamcast, I feel this is pretty fresh to me.  If you've bought 2K12 or are planning to get 2K14 (or beyond) you can easily skip this one.  Like all sports games, there hasn't been much to add since the Jordan installment.\n\nThe only competitor is NBA Live by EA Sports.  If you want a simple comparison, there is none.  2K is smoother, flows better, is more fine tuned and less glitchy overall.  I wish 2K would rip off the "Ultimate Team" mode from the EA Sports series, but thats my only minor gripe.\n\nIn the end, I'd give it a thumbs up if you're an NBA fan.","December 29, 2013","true","62.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite my lack of interest in real life basketball I found a lot of enjoyment and entertainment playing this game. My first experience with the NBA 2k series was with NBA 2K10 (thanks to a 2K publisher) which I played but never really enjoyed. 2K11 offered a better experience but nothing that was really sold on me. 2K12 and 2K13 I've really enjoyed but was disappointed by the lack of content on the PC versions of the game. I'm not really sure why so much content is cut from the PC version and frankly I don't really care about dressing up my virtual player but modes like My Team, which was cut completely, and Blacktop which has the star players cut from the roster would have been great.\n\nRegardless you can still find some enjoyment with this game though I've encountered an absurd amount of unpatched bugs. After this release I won't purchase another NBA 2K installment, no support from the developer and half the game being cut is not worth another thirty dollars.","January 13, 2014","true","215.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
