Seeing as there's quite a big difference between them I just wanted to clarify this before writing my review, the store tags and other reviews are a tad bit misleading regarding this.\n\nThe Weaponographist is a rogue-lite action RPG dungeon crawler developed by Puuba. In The Weaponographist you play as Doug McGrave, a famous demon hunter for hire. After refusing to save a demon infested town McGrave is cursed and forced to fight his way through a dungeon, clearing out enemies and getting rid of the demons. The Weaponographist has a similar style to Binding of Isaac with a few minor changes among which are the reasons this is a rogue-lite and not a rogue-like.\n\n+Nice cartoony art-style\n+Well designed characters\n+Nice weapon variety, not so much in early stages but later on\n+Good enemy variety, new enemies get introduced every few rooms\n+Simple controls\n+You can upgrade your character and upgrades stay with you even when you die (one of the things that prevents it from being a rogue-like)\n+You fight with what enemies drop (another rogue-lite element) when you kill them so you have to adapt a lot which mixes things up a bit\n+Good combo system\n+Some humourous lines\n+Nice soundtrack\n\n+/-When entering a new room the enemies spawn over time rather than all at once, makes it slightly easier but also slows down the pace quite a lot\n+/-Combat pretty much comes down to button mashing\n+/-Has checkpoints, I imagine most people will like this but I feel like it takes away from the difficulty a little too much especially as I prefer rogue-likes\n\n-The game's simple combat leads to rather repetitive gameplay especially early on in a run\n-You can't choose what room to enter next, nothing major but still something I didn't like\n-Almost no variation of rooms, weapons and enemies for different run throughs, e.g. the first room pretty much always looks the same and has the same lineup of enemies\n-No graphical options other than toggling fullscreen, not an issue for me but it might put off people on low-end PCs and laptops who wouldn't be able to run it on the game's default settings\n\nVerdict:\n7\n\nA good rogue-lite ARPG with a nice art-style, well designed characters, nice weapon variety and a good number of enemies. If you like rogue-lites chances are you'll like this.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 7, 2015","true","5.1"," 53 of 68 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","53","68","0","4"

To lift your curse, now you have to exterminate the demons haunting a small town (like four buildings?).\n\nThe town has a dungeon right there, (Why would you build a town there?) Anyway, every time you enter that dungeon, a room is generated, then you fight monsters with your fist, and loot their weapons to keep killing them until you're the only one standing. Unlike other dungeon crawlers, because of your curse, you can't have a 'favorite' weapon, all you can do is take those your enemies leave and improvise on the go.\n\nIt's interesting how movement and attacks are in separate controls, giving you a little more of freedom while playing. However, because of the fast paced nature of the game, and the fact that rooms where you can save are very far from each other, it can get exhausting over time. I’d recommend playing it in short runs.\n\nIn contrast to similar rougelike games, every time you die, you get back to the town, and you’re able to purchase upgrades to get further, the next time you try. But it can get repetitive over time, since the rooms, enemies and weapon variations, aren't enough to justify exploring the place over and over again.\n\n★★★ ☆☆ | It was OK","May 1, 2015","true","1.5"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","1"

But it uses it with a twist - you always start only with your fists and the only way to get new weapons is to get them from dead enemies.\nBut be sure to look a couple of steps ahead because getting a weapon doesn't mean you'll be using it forever - weapon durability will degrade and it will fall apart. And you'd better make sure you don't lose your shiny weapon in the middle of combat.\nThe game starts quite easy, but don't let the first stages fool you - it gets progressively harder (it took me about ~1h to get to level 2, but I'm generally terrible at games).\nThe town you will respawn in has a set of vendors that will sell you various upgrades and unlocks to help you beat those levels - from basic weapon, magic and health upgrades, to runes that might drop in the middle of dungeon and buff you. For some reason the vendors want goop that monsters drop, not money.\nEach level has a new variety of enemies and a new boss at the end. As someone who sucks and games like this, I really enjoyed the fact that you get a checkpoint right before the boss. You can save there and then re-start from it after death 3 time for 90% of your goop.\nOne slightly strange thing is that the control scheme is not what you'd expect from a twin-stick shooter - attacks by default are bound to buttons, not second stick. And attacks are triggered individually. I guess that's done to allow for different attack patterns on weapons (e.g. some weapons have 3-combo attack, while others allow you to attack as fast as you can mash a button), but that does feels a bit strange (at least in the beginning).\nOther than this - it's a pretty nifty little game with some cool mechanics. If you like rogue-lites, definitely have a look at it!\n\nSome gameplay and a bit more discussion in the video below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmYthvFSGoE","May 1, 2015","true","3.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

The game has some rouge-like (or rouge-lite) qualities along with some other aspects (unlocks and power-ups) that are saved from one gaming session to the next. So even though your character, the cursed Doug McGrave, basically always enters the dungeon back at Level-1, you make and save progress as you play, allowing you to obtain more powerful weapons and abilities.\n\nThe premise here is you gotta stay on the move and on the offense because your weapons are always deteriorating and your experience points constantly degrading. Instead of collecting the many weapons dropped by your fallen foes, you can only pick up one at a time, and then you have to keep switching from one to the next as they wear down and break. And to level up (or to just maintain your current level) you must continue to chain up large combos of kills.\n\nAs you kill foes and clear rooms you collect this slimy green goo that acts as in-game currency, which you can spend on improving the effectiveness of your weapons and spells or other aspects of your character. I find this part particularly rewarding as I play, because like I mentioned, these improvements are permanent, leaving your better prepared to face the challenges ahead. And because of the large variety of weapons and powers in the game, this system provides some degree of customization to your play style as you prioritize what to spend your goo on to improve.\n\nAll together the oddball weapons, crazy monsters, and fun challenges keep me wanting to press deeper into The Weaponographist's dungeons and find out what bizarre thing lurks in the next room.\n\nSo if the video looks like something you might enjoy and you have $10 to spend on a fun silly game, I recommend this one.","April 16","true","7.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Do you like Rogue-like games like The Binding of Isaac and such? Well have I got a game for you! From the creators of Concursion comes The Weaponographist, a game that begins with an arrogant hero receiving a well deserved curse. Let's go down into this dungeon and see where it takes us.\n\n\n\nGameplay: 88/100 B+\n\nThe Weaponographist (How do you say that anyways?) is a nice blend of rogue-like, hack and slash, as well as dungeon crawlers, and for the most part does a nice job of taking the best parts of each of those genres and applying it to the game play. Keeping things straightforward and simple helps as well, as nothing is really too over complicated with too many parts to juggle as you play through the game, keeps you focused on the tasks at hand, mainly staying alive, because you will die...a lot. But don't worry, practice makes perfect. There is a nice mechanic in the game that I thought would be more of an annoyance which turns out to be the main driving force in keeping the pace of the game going: weapon degradation. More on that later. Overall, the game is addicting and once you get used to the controls, it becomes an easy game to handle. Of course I was using a keyboard instead of a gamepad as suggested, so that could be part of my issue. I would imagine using two thumb sticks would be far easier than a combo of the WASD to move and Arrow Keys to attack.\n\n\nAudio: 74/100 C-\n\nThe music is the highlight of the audio as the soundtrack isn't the standard dungeon crawler music ala Diablo, but rather more industrial and electronic like Doom. Unlike the music, the sound effects aren't exactly anything to cheer over.They're not bad, just expected, even normal. The voice acting is solid as well, but again, nothing to call home and brag about. If the acting did have a highlight, it's that what there is, is colorful.\n\n\nVisuals: 89/100 B+\n\nCartoony graphics is the calling card for most indie titles, for one, it is easy on the eyes and usually appealing to most audiences, and it has even seeped into larger publishers. Team Fortress 2 is notorious for this all the way to Blizzard's titles, most notably Hearthstone. Now, The Weaponographist is more akin to Hearthstone in style and it's not bad at all. Characters are designed nicely and there is a variety of enemies which range from the expected to the WTF and that's all fine and dandy, the downfall, for me, was the lack of other animation, especially during combat. I felt like the motions were too static and stiff, and would definitely have benefited from a few more frames of animation. Overall, not a bad thing to look at over long periods, despite the repetition of this kind of game.\n\n\nContent: 83/100 B-\n\nFrom what I've played, there is a fair amount of content from upgrades, weapons, and spells, as well as enemies to face with different ways of approaching them, collecting the goop which they drop and using it to purchase your upgrades, helping you inch ever forward into redemption - wherever that may be.\n\n\nStory: 70/100 C-\n\nYou start off exploring when a witch approaches you begging for your help, which you ignore because they have no gold to pay to. Witch casts a curse and basically blackmails your into helping the town. And then the witch is not to be heard from again. At least at the distance I've traveled, maybe I haven't gone far enough. Outside of the introductions and tutorials from the various vendors, there isn't much else of a narrative.\n\n\nDesign: 96/100 A+\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the weapon degradation mechanic is one of the main driving forces in the game instead of a hindrance. You see, your weapons, no matter what they are, only last for a period of time and you are consistently being forced to replace them(because of your curse), thus you are constantly on the look out for weapons, not just to defend yourself with, but to find an appropriate one for your enemies, your strategy is in a state of flux so there is never ever a "build" that always works. On top of this, your strength and experience is built upon your combo meter, which is always dropping at a constant rate (again, because of your curse), so in order to level up, you have to keep killing, doesn't matter how big the combo, as long as something is dying. For this alone, the game is brilliant.\n\n\nPerformance: 100/100\n\nSmooth like butter, what else can I say? It's a low spec game that looks sharp and sounds sharp, despite the short comings in specific areas, and it doesn't take up too much space, so there's that.\n\n\nVerdict: 85/100 B\n\nThe Weaponographist (man, that is a mouthful to say) is a solid game all things considered and does enough to make it standout from the crowd, but it doesn't over inflate itself either. It takes a calculated risk on things it knows it can do well, and keeps things fun enough to merit a recommendation.","June 7, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Some weapons break more with each use than others, but so far the durability of the half dozen weapons I've used last long enough to kill a handful of enemies and there always seems to be more weapons on the ground, dropped by killed enemies, if you're not wasting them.\n\nThis game has what is the standard for "rogue likes/lite" games where you build up some resource and upgrade your character a bit between each run. There's two people who upgrade the weapons & magic. Another who sends mimic chests into the dungeon carrying upgrades. What you pay for here is permanently that he will send the chests with certain upgrades on certain depths for you to find, and once found the upgrade benefits will only last until you die or as long as it says it lasts if shorter. Finally there's a guy who "lessens your curse" which is harder to describe, but for starters he can make weapons not break as fast.\n\nOne mechanic of the game other than weapon durability is "levels" which is a combo meter of sorts. You kill enemies and the bar in the lower right fills a bit, and I think if it fills you level up, but it drains constantly and if it goes down all the way you start to lose xp & levels. The guy who can lessen your curse can make it drain slower  for instance among other things I'm sure I haven't unlocked yet.\n\nThe gamplay: It feels good. Unlike many games I've felt all my deaths so far were due to poor play. All the weapons feel different and if you position correctly and use them properly you should be able to avoid being damaged. This game so far is what what I'd call "fair" in that respect because it is skill based (with some improvements via town upgrades) unlike many other games which might just be death for you if you don't have the proper upgrades.\n\nSo far I only have have some very minor gripes about on screen info. First is that enemy health bars only show up when you're hitting them and for a short time after. I'd like an option to have any damaged enemy's HP always shown. Second is that when an enemy is in the upper-right-most of the room your Goop counter can block view of their top part including their HP. Lastly I wouldn't mind being able to move my hearts to a different spot and/or resizing the element. Not that there's anything wrong with it being in the upper left per-se.\n\nI just made it past the first boss at about an hour of play time, which was about 5 runs.\nIf this game seems like it would be something you'd enjoy it probably will be since it controls well. Basically a twin stick shooter in the control input, though you use melee weapons too. I used a controller to play this game.\nBetter than I expected.","January 3","true","4.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

The Weaponographist is a weird game but good kind of weird. Mishmashing hack and slash games with a bit of roguelike. What makes the game interesting is the weapons. From tuba's that shoot beams of energy to a Human/Lion tamer's whip. Constantly evolving your tactics and making you learn to play the game in new ways. While the combat is fun and easy to get the hang of. There are sometimes where I felt cheated that I got hit. Especially when it comes from an angle. Sadly our hero can only aim up/down/left/right. Making angles very difficult.\nWith several bosses thrown into the mix. The game keeps the action rolling. Pretty much all the time. Especially if you want to keep your combo meter high. It's a frantic fast paced battle to get to the next room. Which I think is technically smart. Cause the rooms and areas themselves don't have much to offer. They have little destructible decorations and don't really feel any different from each other. Also while The Weaponographist is a roguelike in certain regards. It kinda barely makes the genre by the skin of its teeth. With power ups and several forms of progression. Permadeath hardly matters when you can just hit the continue button. However that continue is a great idea because repeating earlier stages can get tedious. This lets you bypass that and get to what is fun and challenging. Leaving the option for a full run for extra loot. If you enjoyed Smash TV and mindless amounts of killing. With a little bit of Roguelike elements. Then you will love The Weaponographist.\n\nI did a Let's Play/First impressions on this game!

But when I do, it's abundantly clear that I REALLY enjoy the game.\n\nThis game is a prime example of this. In fact, I'm even willing to say that this is a real contender for MY GOTY 2015.\n\nDeveloped by Puuba (I shall henceforth refer to the developers as Puubas because it's such an awesome thing to type, really), this is the second game from the studio, following Concursion. While Concursion was more of a revolutionary concept (a multi-genre mashup, but that's a topic for its own review), this one is more evolutionary - inspired by games like The Binding of Isaac (BOI) and Smash TV, but with its own unique mechanics to call its own.\n\nYou play as Doug McGrave, who is cursed and forced to help clear a dungeon full of demons. Due to the curse, Doug cannot use his OP weapons and is instead forced to use the weapons that the demons drop (and they drop a lot). There are all kinds of various weapons, ranging from the ubiquitous sword, to a...hang on IS THAT A FREAKING POGO STICK!?\n\nThere are also secondary weapons (called Magics) that are incredibly powerful, far more so than normal weapons but have a VERY limited number of uses. I particularly like the laser tuba, which is a prime example of all the fun and crazy design ideas the Puubas have squeezed into the game. Another example, incidentally, is of the demons themselves - headless swordsmen, flail-wielding Valkyries, even Tommy Gun-wielding Mafioso. The artwork for these mobs and weapons is quite humourous and well-done too.\n\nOther side effects of the story's curse include a weapon degradation mechanic. Your weapons only last a limited amount of time (or usage, rather) before they shatter, leaving you with nothing but fists, and a raging need to pick up another weapon quickly. The curse also makes your level decrease if you aren't killing monsters - you have to keep your level, and combo meter, up, by killing demons faster. This immediately puts a significantly larger emphasis on good pathing, weapon choice, and aggressiveness.\n\nAlthough this is a rogue-like in the sense where runs are always randomly generated, there are actually checkpoints where you can save your progress, so you can resume from there. The currency in this game is called goop, which you accumulate by killing demons and then picking it up - you can then spend it at the shops in order to upgrade Doug, the weapons, the spells, etc. The upgrades are paramount as, after every first kill of a new boss, the dungeons ramp up in difficulty, so you need to upgrade to keep up.\n\nUnlike BOI, your path from room to room is fixed. I don't mind this honestly, it means you have less to worry about, and require zero backtracking.\n\nOnce you're done with Normal mode, you can buy and unlock Hardcore mode, which gives you access to 3 things:\nThe original Hardcore mode, where all monsters have significantly more health, spawn faster, and you have to collect the goop to help maintain your combo meter\nSurvival mode, implemented a month after the game's release, where you're stuck with a fixed amount of health and have to survive as long as you can, with Hardcore-difficulty enemies. As you complete more rooms in Survival, you collect more Grimoire pages, which enables you to unlock:\nJinxes - gameplay modifiers. Some are beneficial, some are detrimental, and they can be applied to any game mode for added challenge.\nAll of these are quite fun as they add extra challenge to the game, should you find it getting too easy.\n\nOne of the key advantages, in my opinion, that this game has over BOI, is the integrated Steam and in-game leaderboards. Since the game times your runs for you, there's no need to download an external program to do so. The integrated leaderboards also makes it easy to compare your times with other people. In completely unrelated news, I'm world number two in terms of run times...But seriously, with all the leaderboards this game really facilitates speedrunning, and live speedrun races (see the Postscript below).\n\nAlas, as much as I'd love to say this game is perfect...it's not. However, the quibbles I have with this are, in my opinion, relatively minor. Once in a blue moon, there's an occasional display glitch - a ghostly slime mob that you can walk through and not interact with, or a ghost chest that comes into the depth and immediately leaves, and you can't destroy it - but these are incredibly rare and minor.\n\nThe other nitpick I'd have are some of the weapon types. Actually, that's not really my nitpick - that's other peoples'. Some weapons require the player to rapidly mash the button in order to attack faster - and the faster the button mashing, the faster the weapon. This could potentially cause hand strain. I must say though that I personally don't really have a large problem with it - I'm an incredibly rapid button masher and can kill enemies fast with the pine cone or the whip - my only problem really is the fatigue from a hard mashing session, especially during Hardcore.\n\nMinor nitpicks aside - this game really scratched my BOI itch stupendously well. I envision myself playing it more in the coming months, if only to maintain my consistency and speedrun records - it has that great a staying power for me, and will forever be a game I cherish and adore. Thank you, Puubas.\n\nWhen to buy: Try out the demo - it contains 2 levels. If you think you like it, feel free to get it at full price!\n\n9.5/10\n\nLike indie games? Want to see how some games play before deciding whether to buy them? Like game giveaways? Come check out the Who's Gaming Now?! Twitch Channel[www.twitch.tv]!\n\nPOSTSCRIPT:A large part of my game playtime was spent speedrun-racing with other people as part of a tournament - the best speedrunners of this game in the world. I had a lot of fun interacting with the Puubas (who are incredibly friendly and wittily humorous, by the way!) as well as my fellow competitors. We livestreamed our gameplay to Twitch - the resultant tournament videos are all uploaded in their entirety on Youtube.\n\nAlso, I'm better than a wife.","September 4, 2015","true","132.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

A $1 an hour, and it’s still fun.  9/10.\n\nWow!  I was expecting something new and revolutionary after enjoying Puuba’s first game, but was disappointed to find what looked like Super Smash T.V. had been sent back in time via the Necronomicon and combined with Army of Darkness.  That being said, I was not disappointed with the game.\n\nI loved Super Smash T.V. so I dove into The Weapongraphist .  It started out pretty similar to these top down type of games, including Binding of Issac, but it has some interesting twists to keep it interesting.  I hated having to switch weapons and keep using new ones that I was not familiar with, but eventually that became the exact reason I kept playing, because they used this mechanic as a tool to ramp up the difficulty on top of the regular standby of “more enemies!”\n\nI definitely have some issues with the difficulty of the game, because of the ability to purchase or “train” stronger weapons along with the other buffs  the game’s difficulty reaches a tipping point just around the time you start Hardcore mode.\n\nBut hell, that’s the problem with games these day, especially when I start off comparing it to the childhood horror of difficulty that the original Super Smash T.V. presented to me.  They’re all too easy!  At least this one was fun, and the first full run through took me about seven hours.\n\nAdditionally, I really enjoyed the music and the aesthetics to the game, it really makes the experience.  Like many other games that can get a little repetitive because of repeated deaths it –really– helps to have good music and sound along with fun art to get yourself sucked into the game, you restart in frustration before having time to abandon all hope.\n\nFinally, there are some fun twists and tweaks you can make to the game after romping through Endless mode and I will definitely want to test myself a little more.\n\nOverall, this was a good game, which was definitely worth the price of admission.   It was not a revolution in game-craft, but it is a solid, fun game.","May 5, 2015","true","18.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is as far as the story goes, and it's essentially pointless. The few lines of dialogue spoken by the town's people are funny. There's nothing more.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game isn't particularly stylish. The animated look suits the tone of the game, but the animations aren't all that polished and the different dungeons have small variations from one another. However, there is a good variety of enemies, some more detailed than others.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game is very similar to The Binding of Isaac, but it doesn't have as much depth. You move with the WASD keys and you attack with the arrow keys. Your objective is to kill all the enemies in each room, to then move to the next one until you arrive to the end-level boss.\nYou start out with your fists, and you can pick up the weapons and magic that your enemies drop. They have small durability, and their attack power depends on how much high your combo meter and level is. Every time that you die, you will spawn back at the village, and you can buy upgrades for your character, the weapons and the magic that you found while playing. You can either choose to start from the first level, or load a checkpoint that is usually found in the room before the boss.\nThere are many weapons to pick up and use, each with different pros and cons, as well as some magic spells that you should only use when facing a boss.\n\nCHALLENGEMost of the time you won't find yourself in much trouble: the enemies have predictable patterns that are easy to understand, and the higher your combo is, the stronger your attacks are. The bosses at the end of each dungeon are the most challenging part, but the possibility to reload the checkpoint that is usually before their room makes it less frustrating than it should be.\n\nSOUNDNothing stands out here: the techno-music feels really repetitive and might get on your nerves, and the sound effects aren't varied.\n\nREPLAYABILITYAs with many rogue-like games, the replayability is the strongest point: trying to defeat the same boss over and over, and levelling up your character and becoming a force of nature make this an addicting experience that will last for a long time. There are also 19 Steam achievements and multiple upgrades that are worth unlocking.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a time waster and you like games like The Binding of Isaac but aren't looking for something as complex, The Weaponographist is a must-buy for you. If you aren't into this kind of games, you will most likely hate it.\n\nStory: 5.5\nGraphics: 6.5\nGameplay: 7.5\nChallenge: 7\nSound: 6\nReplayability: 8\n\nENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 4\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","April 29, 2015","true","2.3"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

The main character Doug McGrave has been cursed with ever breaking weapons and decreasing strength.\n\nMassacring enemies keeps your combo meter up, which in turn allows you to hit harder, but each weapon you pick up has a finite lifespan, forcing you to swap out and adapt on the fly. Dying doesn’t impede your progress, merely depositing you back in town to upgrade your skills with any money (which is, apparently, goo!) and dive straight back into the dungeon!\n\nWhile The Weaponographist may on the surface appear to owe a large debt to The Binding of Isaac, it actually plays in a very different way. The variations between weapons force a different play style every minute or so, and keeping your combo up means getting all up in enemy faces to finish them as quickly as possible. The game is perfect for a burst of 20-30 minutes (although later dungeon runs will take longer) and a bit of light stress relief!\n\nFirst reviewed here: http://www.goplaythat.com/2015/05/20/goplaythese-dating/","May 23, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Either people reviewing it haven't played other games, ever, or they just really like running in circles mashing one button for about 20 minutes.\n\nWhile this game looks like a poor man's Binding of Isaac, it plays even worse. The game puts you in sequential rooms that spawn ~3 different types of enemies per room, with the goal being to kill all enemies in order to repeat the same process again. Each enemy has one attack (save for the few bosses in the game) and drop one type of weapon (e.g. the skeleton drops a sword).  You'll spend a minute or two clearing out the slowly spawning enemies, which when finished will open a door on one side of the room (although seeing as how each level is entirely linear, this serves no purpose except to change your starting point for the next room).\n\nWhile fighting, players increase xp and a combo meter when they kill enemies. The purposes of these mechanics seem to be a good idea at first, except for the fact that losing the combo meter leads to draining xp from the player (eventually de-leveling them), which then causes enemies to die even slower than they did before. The higher level the player is, the faster the combo meter decays (and thus, eventually, their level), and even when a player is ahead of the curve and as maxed out as they can be with upgrades, enemies at best are still frustratingly alive with a sliver of health after a set of attacks. At worst the player has to follow an enemy for several boring seconds holding the attack button until it begrudgingly decided to die.\n\nIf a player gets behind the power curve, it becomes increasingly difficult to catch back up and ends up being a painfully slow demise. Normally this is not a problem (and the player loses all their HP before this happens), however when a bosses is defeated for the first time it essentially resets the players progress as enemies have more hp that seems to magically even out once the player upgrades their weapons again. While normally I find progression systems fun, this one just ends up feeling like someone constantly struggling to reach the surface level of water with an increasing amount of baggage instead of say, acquiring a jet ski and then a speedboat.\n\nEvery once in a while a room will contain a "buff" for enemies (which consisted of more / less monster hp. faster movement / attack, or perpetually spawning slime enemies that were killed in one hit) or a chest will spawn with a heart and potentially a ~30s player buff. This is probably the biggest excitement you will have all game, unless you really enjoy killing enemies progressively slower.\n\nIn essence, the game ends up forcing the player to quit / die after beating every boss unless they want to spend 30 minutes clearing a single room in a floor. This, combined with the already mediocre-at-best combat and repetitive nature of rooms, makes this game not worth playing, even with a refund. What little story there is doesn't even remotely make up for the lackluster and repetitive (have I mentioned this game is repetitive?) nature of the game.","December 28, 2015","false","10.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Well, it would be if your weapons didn't keep breaking. The Weaponographist, a game developed by Puuba and published by Mastertronic, is an isometric dungeon crawler hack and slash RPG that uses a cartoonish sense of humor. And you're going to need to laugh because you're going to die a lot throughout this adventure. It'll remind you of classic flash games from way back when Newgrounds was a place where quality flash games existed. This doesn't always work in the games favor, and ends up falling short of what could've been an amusing game with a chuckle-worthy story.\n\nThe story itself is simple: an overconfident demon hunter named Doug McGrave,drawn lovingly in the style of classic cartoons, refuses to help a demon infested town and is then cursed. All of his wealth and his weapons are gone! He's now forced to protect the town he wanted nothing to do with and conquer the dungeon in order to undo the curse. The curse itself is a key part of the gameplay because no matter what weapon you use, it'll eventually break, leaving Doug to fight hordes of elven archers, mafia men, lions with whips and octopi with lasers with his bare hands. From there, you have to kill your enemies in order to get their weapons to give you an edge in battle. It's nearly impossible to do with fists alone, so don't even try to avoid grabbing weapons. There's a reason the title is The Weaponographist.\n\nThe weapons themselves vary as much as the monsters do; slingshots, spears, laser spouting tubas and so much more. It gives a variety to the game, which is good, because otherwise it would have been a bit of a slog to get through if it only had the most basic of weapons. This does lead to one of the games vexing problems; weapons don't have much of an impact. There's no feedback when you hit something, it's just mindless button mashing. The variety gives it flavor, but the game fails at making it actually seem like your character knows how to use all these weapons. It just seems like he's picking tools up and doing whatever with them. The animations are very basic and at times it's like Doug is just flailing around with this stuff rather than actually using it. It makes it seem like Silent Hill: Origins but the difference is that in that game your character doesn't know anything about how to fight. He's just some truck driver guy, rather than a famous Demon Hunter like Doug.\n\nFull Review[www.noobfeed.com]","May 15, 2015","false","3.4"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","1"

Movements are poorly animated and the gamepad/keyboard controls terrible.\n\nGames like this seriously have me wondering if the developers tried playing their game at all, before releasing it? It also makes me wonder about the people who have given it positive reviews, have they never played a good twin-stick hack & slash game?","December 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

BoI features a randomly-generated dungeon that you explore, where traps and terrain play a large role in how you fight or even just get across an otherwise empty room. Weaponographist is just a straight gauntlet of meaningless smash-TV style twin stick shooting in identical empty spaces.\n\nBoI also features cool loot that changes your character and how you play, stats, choices to make, meaningful death, etc, none of which this game features. This is a lazy cash-grab and attempt to rip off the success of a much better game.
