But I purchased anyhow. Then the controls were wonky and the loading was a little slow. I got crashed frequently, I was instantly killed by enemies easily. My keystroke for 'W' was moving the heli backward instead of forward. I rage quit, I got frustrated and then just clicked on steam refund for this game and wrote a negative review. But I still didnt want to give up. I loaded up the game again and somehow managed to move past my base after a lot of trial and error. I am not sure how I went pass the weird control issues that I was having and from time to time it would resurface. But this time, I was not afraid. I was willing to grind. 20 Minutes into the game , I was flying really well. Along the way, through group chat, I learnt the meaning of a few statistics that showed up, frag, capture and something else. Soon I became immersed in the game. It was already an hour and time flew. I still didnt register a single kill and I died already 20 times. But it didnt bother, because I was already having the best time playing any game in my life. It was freaking awesome. This game is a beast when it comes to fun. Just buy it. 10 $ is nothing for this game. It is way underpriced for its potential. And I almost forgot to mention. I cancelled my steam refund and deleted my negative review, once my wife woke me up from my trance playtime.","February 19","true","30.3"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","43","49","12","7"

This game, and everything it stands for, still has potential. Actually, it has a HELI-load of potential [pun-intended]! I'm now adding a few more items I've noticed that may need work, that's it!)\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game. As an early access game, it's really fleshed out, better than most. There's some pros and cons however that I'd like to mention, and I've updated them since my last review.\n\nPro:\nGreat Physics\nGreat Concept\nSomewhat active community\nExcellent replayability *new*\nGood classes to choose from *new*\nNice loadouts *new*\nVery fleshed out weapons firing systems *new*\nDevelopers are active in the game! *new*\n\nCons:\nTeam balance doesn't work (i.e. can have a 1 v 9 match and that's hilarious, let me tell you)\nHit mechanics are questionable\nIn Multiplayer matches, a timer would be nice, as matches can go on FOREVER *new*\nThere's a glitch where if you die on a helipad, and spawn again, you'll keep dying over and over. It's hilarious *new*\nTeamkilling is not penalized *new*\n\nThat's about it. I noticed when I quit the first time my internet was unusable for a bit. Don't know if this was the game itself, or not. Anyway, the game itself is pretty well fleshed out in this early stage.\n\nBasically, you fly a helicopter and it has roles. Some helicopters carry Anti-Air Personnel you can drop anywhere by landing and pressing the "E" key, and in those heli's you usually have a troop compliment that can only be released when on or near control points. Overall, it's pretty fun.\n\nIT REALLY IS FUN! FOR THE PRICE, BUY IT! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!","February 19","true","9.8"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","24","26","3","6"

You need to shoot down enemy team players and take over said bases with your transported soldier guys. Occasionally you will need to destroy boat/car convoys.\nSo far game dos not have many servers or maps and with no real progression it can get boring. But it features quiet a lot of different helicopters from Mi-8 up to Apache.\nDev team is very communicative and listen to player feedback - game is worth investing if you like some casual helicopter fun.

This game is clearly unfinished, but those are my opinions about it.\nPROS\n+An already vast choice of helos to choose from, and all of them are different between the others.\n+Very distinct and separated roles, that heavily encourage cooperation between your teammates. Ah, don't try to shoot down an attack helicopter with that Blackhawk, ok?\n+Weapons are already simulated pretty well: bullets have their speeds, and no, it's not a hit detection fault that you can't hit anything, it's just that you have to LEAD your enemies. Unguided Rockets are simulated very well for an alpha.\n+Friendly devs, open to critics and suggestions. I also became a friend with one of them, so you can guess it yourself.\n+Very good balancing between helos of different teams.\n+Requires SKILL, and not just LUCK.\n+Graphics and effects are nice for such an alpha state.\n+Vietnam and Afghanistan.\n+Intuitive and easy controls\n+Flying is realistic to an extent, but not too much to become a simulator, flight mechanics are simple but most realistic maneuvers can still be used. Physics aren't bad.\n+Devs are litterally machinegunning us with updates, Never seen a dev team that fast.\n+Perfectly balanced pricetag\n\nLike any game in this universe, Heliborne has it's\nCONS\n-Team Balance is a bit awkward. Sure, you can win alon vs 2 players if you're good, but it's annoying.\n-It still has a young and scarce community, not so much people playing.\n-Sounds aren't as good as the graphics\n-Some helos are bit overused, even if it's not a developing issue\n-Minor bugs.\n-No AH64 | Asiimov Factory New (Joking)\n________________________________________\nVerdict\n\nSo, Heliborne is still young and has it's problems. Considering it's current status, it's almost impressive to see such an already fun and enjoyable Alpha. I'm sure all the CONS i've stated will be fixed or worked on, since our devs are really working hard to make this game become a good indie.\nIn my opinion, those are 10 bucks well spent. But don't get here and write a negative review because you bought it without being interested in rotary wing aircrafts.\nScore: Considering it's current state, i give Heliborne 9.2/10","May 4","true","8.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I used to be the guy to ferry troops in from the spawn. Reminds me a lot of that.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVvzA5X6O9w\n\nRemember to:\n- Destroy all 'boxes' or enemies at a base, including tanks to neutralize it\n- Land at the base if you're carrying men to capture it\n- Deploy AA men on surrounding mountain tops\n- Do NOT deploy them next to eachother, easy target for enemies\n- Return to base to reload, land on the ammo pad, you can't repair\n\nStuff they need to add:\n- Team chat (right now it's just global)\n- Voice chat\n- Auto-Balancing\n- More of everything\n- Better hit detection\n- More maps (but what's there is good for now)\n- Some way to repair your chopper\n\nStuff they need to change:\n- Reload pad should not be a spawn pad\n- Various small glitches, such a base not neutralizing when all enemies have been killed\n- Enemies to Red, Friendlies to Blue (they're revered in the game and it's annoying)\n\nCheck out this video.

I was very skeptical on the mouse and keyboard controls for flying but it works! Extremely well. I was expecting to break out my joystick or controller. Didn't have to. There's a nice selection of choppers to pick and era locked on one of the 3 maps you can pick. Right now there is no competitive modes or unlocks or loadouts which I do kinda of liek the fact that the choppers are preset. In a way this game kind of reminds of Fractured Space. It's sorta of MOBAish. Right now there's only one game mode where your team takes over or establish the bases and reienforces them.

No realisitc balistics, no screwing around with the trim and fuel levels. You go out, and blast russians in Vietnam (or Iraq) with Fortunate Son (or Flight of the Valkerys, your taste may vary) booming in your headset. The maps include rice paddies and marshes, even craggy mountains where you can land and deploy infantry to suprise enemies and lanidng at bases to capture them. (Dropping AA infantry on the top of a mountain is being a really big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to them since they will probably never leave that mountain top)\nAll in all the game is fun, the only downside being the audio at some points sounding like you just slammed a car door when you crash or a really bad car crash when a missile hits you.\nHit detection errors for me are chalked down to not leading the target enough and just plain old bad flying on my part.\nWith a wealth of helicopters to pick from and currently three maps, two in the vietnam era and one in the 2000's, there is almost an endless ammount of derpy, pure arcade fun to be had. With the first Vietnam era map being early helicopter, like the incrediably tasteless older cousin of the Chinook to the predicessor to the little bird and it's skeleton tail.\nThe ditail given to the models is quite awesome, but one thing that bothers me is that the door gunners of the Huey don't shoot at the moment, I was expecting pulling off some Apocalypse now type stuff and straffing the bases with my rocket spam (Russian rocket spam is best spam by the way.... just saying) and then having my door gunners open up on the AA guns and garrison that I can no longer shoot.\nP.s. Devs please add this!\n\nNow onto the pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n-Fun flight mechanics (Responsive and arcadey, which is what I want in a game like this, oppinions may vary!)\n-Wide range of helicopters for both the Americans and the Rocket spam....*Cough* I mean russians\n-Supplyline system between bases and a battlefield that feels "Alive"\n-Awesome troop transport system which makes you feel like you're actually doing something to hel your team\n-Three classes of Helicopters (Transport, Assault, and scout... I think...)\n-Fortunate Son ready\n-Sneaky Little Bird tactics aka placing a AA infantry in the swamps and then running away as he annoys the crud out of hostile helicopters\n-Russian rocket spam....not bad since the rockets that can be spammed are such low caliber that they end up almost tickling a cobra in the Vietnam era\n\nCons:\n-Audio.... a little lack luster and missing some audio files. I'm actually tempted to edit the audio files and replace them with something more punchy.... sorry devs :(\n-Team balance, sure it allows for some interesting matches, but a majority of players i've talked to want a tighter auto balance\n-Additionalysomething that people may find "aweful" is that (Which in my oppinion there are very few of) there will be some times where you disconnect from a game for no reason of the server has a siezure for no reason, but hey, doesn't ruin it for me!\n-Also the change of Hotile markers to Blue and Friendly Markers to Orange... it was confusing at first but I soon figured it out however I think other people would like a setting to change this\n-Limited options menu in general, seperate audio sliders... Maybe?\n\nWhen all is said and done I would give it a 8 out of 10 with it only improving as time goes on. I hope the devs consider these reviews we have been giving.\n\nBecasue if they flush the game out, it can become a true gem of a arcade realm that in rarely traversed! I am shocked that someone has never truely (In this day and age) made a helicopter arcade combat game... and this has the potential to be the best one out there with a little hard work and thought with what the community has to say!\n\nOh and also, more players would make this game even more amazing!","February 20","true","5.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","14","17","4","1"

This game has A LOT of potential. It's just not there. The selection of helicopters is impressive, the gameplay is fun, and the graphics are acceptable. The controls are a bit clunky at first, but once you get them down it's pretty easy.\n\nIn it's current form, this game doesn't have any kind of progression, unlocks, or reward system. This is all fine and dandy, but there's not much in the game to hold my attention and dedication. I'm not saying this game needs to be a grindfest, but I feel there needs to be a goal to put effort towards (other than simply having fun).\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the UI is extremely confusing. Friendlies have red/orange icons... This would be ok if there wasn't Friendly Fire, but there is, and I get shot in the back all the time.\n\nI have very high hopes for this game. The arcade style controls and gameplay are fairly easy to grasp and there's enough diversity within to allow many types of play. At present, it just feels hollow. I'm going to give this game my recommendation for the time being, as I'm banking that the added funding will help spur development.","February 15","true","1.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

It is one of those games you pick-up and don't want to stop playing. I think that sentence should be enough to tell you how fun it is. But just in case, currently, there are 3 maps covering Early Vietnam war, Late Vietnam war, and Modern Age, yes that includes Huey's, Mi24's, Havoc, Apache, Blackhawk, Chinook, and many others! The system of capturing FOB with deploying troops, and reinforcements to help in FOB is one of the best ideas I've ever seen too.

With it being early in development I'm not hating on the little bugs here and there, even so the devs fix many of these issues as soon as they can. The game itself gives a good feel to it, imagine your one of the pilots in the helo assault in Apocalypse Now, its great...but add in the other teams helo's trying to kill you while you assault ground forces, its glorious.\n\nAs of the time of posting, these are the pros n cons.\nPros:\nGreat variety of aircraft\nfairly balanced aircraft (ruskies n Muricans)\nhistoricly accurate aircraft (you can't fly an Apache in early Vietnam, but you can in Afghanistan)\nAir combat is a skill...not a easy thing.\nFlying physics are very nice.\nCons:\nAll the first person cameras are the same cockpit...no matter what aircraft you use...\nTrees don't make you explode...\nChaff/flares don't work for ♥♥♥♥ half of the time...\nDoor gunners don't shoot, I was really hoping I could hover around an area in a Huey and have m60 gunners firing...naa\n\n\nOver all I love this game, its more then likely going to get tons better. Suggestions: Make door gunners work, more variable dismount's (when you land at firebases/villages, you dismount soldiers to take the position, along with Stinger missile teams. Maybe offer anti tank teams). More gamemodes.\nFor later, maybe offer some fixed wing craft like the A-1 Sky Raiders or A-6 intruders...russian equiv like the Frogfoot or such. All sub sonic aircraft...\n\nThats my input, so far I'm loving the game, I'd suggest buying it.\n","April 3","true","22.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The day that I bought it I played 5 hours straight because I enjoyed it so much. The core mechanics are solid and it is worth the 10$ in my opinion.

Although it’s alpha, it looks like a beta version. It uses a simplified flying system that adds fun to the game. All battles are open and multiplayer. Once you login, you can start your own battle or join another. There is no AI to play against, so if you start your own battle and no one else joins, you’ll have a flight simulator experience. There is built in chat that works very well.\nI didn’t experience multiplayer issues (like lags that would make it difficult to play).\nLarge and small helicopters have the compatible inertia and sound effects.\nOverall great game.

In my original review I expressed my (and many others) issues with hit detection, after playing a few matches on the recent update I haven't noticed much issue with it. However, team balance is still being looked into, and I'm excited to see what the devs do!\n\nNot very many people are fond of Early Access titles because of money grabs (most recently H1Z1), I'm a little wary myself, but I also think it's a great platform for new devs to create their vision to get out there quickly and let the gamers shape it into something everyone can enjoy! (Kerbal Space Program)\n\nThis game feels like so many great games combined into one tiny package:\n-The simple controls and HUD feel like Battlefields helicopters but easier\n-The tactics and "micro" size of the game feels like the Wargame series\n-As well as the "capture" system that feels so fresh and different\n\nA lot of people I have talked to about Heliborne express how they love heliopters but are not really "pilots" and don't like flying because they always crash, if that's you, i urge you to get this game!\nThe controls are this simple:\n\nW- Forward\nA- Left\nS- Back\nD- Right\nSpace- Up\nShift- Down\nQ- Flares (only on certain helicopters)\n\nAnd that's how you fly, this isn't Arma, it's an Arcade game with simulation aspects sprinkled here and there...\n\nPros:\n- $10 Arcade game that will only continue to grow\n- Easy controls so everyone can get the hang of it\n- Authentic helicopters spanning from the 1950's to 2000\n- A lot of helicopters, 31 to be exact and most of them have 2-3 loadouts\n- AI is actually pretty deadly and accurate\n- Using real helicopter tactics can be beneficial\n\nCons:\n- Rocket Simulator 2016, everyone just spams rockets as of right now, no serious dogfights\n- Bugs, with any Early Access title you're bound to have quite a few\n- No team balance, it can become very one-sided very quick\n- Community can be a hit or miss, sometimes you'll get teamkillers and spawncampers unfortunately\n- Small communtiy as well, late at night on weekdays it can be somewhat empty (will only grow though)\n\nBottom line...get it you're on the fence, refund if it's not to you're taste.

The involvement of both Crew and Ground Troops really gives a great sense of immersion throughout the gameplay. The rapid pace of deployment and general tempo of a battle really suits the nature of Helicopter combat situations and balances really well with the Arcade style of the game.  A real sense of progression can be felt when moving through the Vietnam era Helicopters such as the UH-1D through to the more modern combatants such as the ACH-47 Chinook which is exceptionally fun to fly. Equally the Mi-24V and AH-64 D where also two standout vehicles that were great to take out into battle, with both offering very aggressive and offensive styles of play. Of the 3 main classifications, (Attack, Assault and Recon) Recon seemed to be the weakest (From a balance and fun perspective) and least played class. Currently they have very little impact or function within a battle while the Assault and Attack where much closer in terms of general fun and effectiveness in combat.\n\nThe maps are good in terms of design and spacing with the overall graphics being very respectable at this early stage. Lots of lighting effects and visual detail really made many aspects stand out. Whilst the graphics are far from perfect at such an early stage, they do not deduct from the gameplay or fun elements of the game.\n\nThe prospect of customization, unlocks and progression throughout the game does present an interesting array of concepts and ideas that can really benefit the game once in a more solid state. The range of weaponry and arms available as well as the variants of Helicopters currently in game set the stage for some really interesting outcomes down the line.\n\nIn terms of development, I think the main focal point really needs to be the UI and interface in general. Lots of the HUD elements feel clunky and deduct from the gameplay due to their somewhat outdated feel. Key components such as the map feel underused and irrelevant, whilst the chat is very pertrusive and often clashes in front of the Helicopter whilst in combat. Team leaderboards and some of the menus in particular feel very\n\nAdditionally, the Ground Targets found at hostile bases are very unpredictable in a sense of comprehending how to effectively attack and combat them. Some seem to instantly down an attacking Helicopter whilst others seem to do very little. More complexity and diverse situations will obviously come over time, however attention is needed in terms of Air-to-Ground combat as this is a key factor of any battle engagement.\n\nOverall the game is fantastic fun to play and has a very interesting gameplay style that suits the pace of Helicopter warfare perfectly.","February 18","true","1.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

You have two sides (Russian/American) spanning the 1960s to now. As of this review (the day after release) there's only 3 maps. Two Vietnam era and one Russian Afghan era.\n\nThe helicopters feel like they should. My personal favorite is the Mi-24 Hind from the Afghan level. That thing will take a beating before it goes down.\n\nSo what you do to capture a base is land your heli and deploy the troops you have carrying with you. Some helicopters carry a whole lot of troops, some carry none. The helicopter you pick depends on the role you want to play.\n\nThere are definitely things that need to be worked on, like sound glitches, the spawns inside buildings glitch and some other issues, but that's what you get for alpha level. On the whole, this is a very playable game and absolutely worth the $10 to play it, knowing it will get better with time.\n\nAlso, for you flight enthusiats, this game is very much arcade-y in feel, not sim level. You can get away with flying like a pro with a mouse+keyboard. And that's okay. I'm happy with a fun game, not a flight sim.\n\nIf you like WoT type games, check this out.

Only 3 maps at the moment (two Vietnam Jungle and one Afghan Canyons). A few minor funky things like spawning on top of your teammates occasionally which will hopefully be patched out soon. Many of the choppers can drop troops/MANPADs. Each chopper also has primary (mg) and secondary (Rockets/ATGMs) armaments and multiple load outs. Gameplay revolves around landing on helipads to deliver troops to fortified positions scattered throughout each map. Only Mouse and Keyboard at the moment. The fight model is relatively arcade but is fun and fairly easy to pick up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Canadiansyrup/recommended/433530/","Canadiansyrup","CanadianSyrup","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Canadiansyrup/","172 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI heard about Heliborne back in late fall from a youtuber named, "The Might Jingles." It showed Air to Air helicopter combat, interesting game mechanics where you drop off troops to capture areas around the map and a variety of helicopters. I was very excited when Heliborne released for early access, but was weary because it was early access. I took to the forums to see feedback and the developers had a Q&A available on the steam forums so I decided to ask them some direct questions and here's what they said:\n\n"Question: My first question is: With Early Access games being a hit and miss among gamers due to either lack of communication from developers, projects being abandoned, or updates taking an extreme amount of time, what are you planning to do to with heliborne in order to have it recieved well and supported in the near and distant future?"\n\nAnswer : Yep, we're aware of such situations and that's why we want to build very transparent and open relationship with our community. We have public roadmap&bugtracker and also always happy to have discussions with players and open for their suggestions. You can always see what's being in development right now, and what's going to be in next update (our goal is to have regular updates every 1-2 weeks).\n\n"Question: My second question is: With the initial price tag being lower at $10.00 as answered previously, do you intend to increase this price as early access goes on?"\n\nAnswer: We want to show our appreciation to everybody who supports us during Early Access, that's why the price will be increased only after we will go for a full release after it.\n\n"Question: My third question segues into this one: Do you have plans for DLC during early access or after release?"\n\nAnswer: Definitely no DLC's during Early Access. We have a lot of content and features planned for a full release so that's our main priority right now.\n\nI don't like Early access, but if someone is selling their game for $10 and gives those kinds of answers, I'm sold.\n\nBut how's the actual game you ask? Well for an early access there isn't a lot. You have 3 maps, two vietnam era and one modern era. roughly 31 helicopters and two game modes. But for $10 It has been a lot of fun. Yeah there's bugs, but this is a game being developed by a small crew who seem to really care and they care enough that at the time of this post they're releasing a patch within a couple of days to address many of the issues people have listed on their bug tracker. They're constantly communicating with the community and taking our feedback so seriously, that the community manager spent 2 hours talking with 8 of us who were playing the game earlier in their discord that they setup to see what they thought.\n\nI've seen so many people get burned by early access games and developers who take the money and run, but these guys care and for $10 you can't go wrong for a game filled with intense air to air combat, escorting friendlies to capturing territory and an accessable roadmap with many features down the road that you can see their progress on instead of "Promises" Like most developers do. These guys and this game gets my recommendation.","February 15","true","5.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Hovering over water, firing shots at different terrain, it all has different effects.\nMost importantly, it's fun.

Their are a few things that could done be better, some tweaks for realism and other different aspects that need improvement, its still a pretty amazing game for the state its in.","April 29","true","3.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Helicopters...with missles and mini-guns! Quite a wide selection I might add. Super easy to pick up and play. Vehicles offer differing loadouts to get the job done. Speaking of jobs. You and your team will face off against others to capture FOBs on any given map. These bases are armed with AA emplacements that can make your Copter scrap metal in seconds. Land your Chinook after laying waste to the bases defenses and let your infantry take the base for your team. Each helicopter fills a role, from air-assault, attack or multi-role.

This game is very addictive\n\nI love how matches last for a long time\nI love the majority of the helicopers in this game.\nI love almost EVERYTHING about this game!!!\n\nThe issues for me is that there is not many maps at the moment (3 of them). However they are awesome maps with a lot of detail and effort put in them.\n\nAlso the frame rate does get pretty low on all maps for some reason, not so low that it's unplayable, I get around 30fps when I usually get 60+ fps in most games. Hopefully they will fix that soon :)\n\nJust keep in mind this is a pretty new game and do expect a few bugs here and there if you decide to buy it.\n\nI rate 9/10. It's 100% worth the money. Great value. Can't wait to see what other things they add in this game.","March 5","true","4.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The problem about the game, and guys I know it's still in Beta, but this is advice for the Devs for future updates, so my first problem is that the Audio sounds very very... icky, like with the MI-28, it sounds like a broken drum, and for the minigun can stay in it's original position. The second problem is that you should change the deployable troops in the Afganistan to like Modern Day, because 1960's Vietnam G.I. soldiers in the middle of Afganistan does not make any sense at all. So for my final verdict, I will give this game a 8/10 because it's an absoulute blasting game, but this game is still in like Beta mode which I understand and stuff is getting taken care of.","May 22","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

WAIT!\n\nThis game is a great idea which is why I put money down on it. However, you can tell clearly in the first 20 minutes of playing it yourself that the game truly is pre-alpha.\n\nTextures and models are still very basic, which is suprising considering the performance of this game.\n\nNot very active multiplayer. Obviously the game just came out, but the servers are created by the players (not certain if it opens a dedicated server or if it runs client side), they chose the map and will be the first to chose team and heli. Team balance was non-existent when I played, you could have 8vs1 match if you want but it is no fun. My entire first hour was spent getting into quick matches where players would stack one side.\n\nBad control design. This is coming from a heavy-sim pilot though so if you like arcade flight models (like in War Thunder Arcade), this is probably okay for you to ignore. I feel like if they make it a bit more fluid and challenging, it will become a more attractive game but that is just my two cents.\n\nThe weapon armament comes in presets. That's great for balancing purposes but I was slightly disappointed as I would have loved to put 12 Vikhr AGMs and then stupid rockets for the Ka50 like I do in DCS.\n\nOh and one critical piece of info, the hit detection is really shady right now. This is what caused me to just say, "screw it. I'll refund and hold off on this game for a couple months".\n\nSo yea, the idea is great and there is a nice selection of birds at every era (across 3 maps) but the game is just not really ready for an early access release. It might be better in a few days, weeks, or months, but that is never garunteed when you buy Early Access titles which this being a brand new developer team, it is really hard to garuntee they will get the funding and expertise to make this game have a solid quality to it. That said, I hope they can make it far better soon. I did enjoy the game, but I have more fun at the moment just flying 10 meters off the ground in a DCS helicopter in Nevada.","February 22","false","1.4"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","4"

Right now WSAD are used for horizontal movement, sort of like a tank, while shift and space are used to control altitude. At the current state, it is more inclined to a CoD kill streak style control.\n\n- Limited map count. I only found servers for three maps. Maybe there are more? I don't know.\n\n- Graphics are not great.\n\n======\nI realize that Dev read comment, so here are some more of my thoughts:\n\n- Doing troop transport is too hard. You are just such a big target for them while you unload. Maybe drop soldiers a little bit away and let them march in?\n\n- Hit registration is not consistent.\n\n- Overall environment is a bit dark and brown-ish. Would like more sunshine lol\n\n- There are nice loadouts, but a more in-depth customization system would be great, where you choose what to attach to your heli individually. Maybe a point system where you choose how to spend your points on rockets and gun pods etc. (Take a look at that in Insurgency)\n\n- Nagging some more about control, do you think the control is too casual for hardcore sim fans, and the game is too hardcore to casual players?","February 16","false","0.3"," 19 of 41 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","19","41","2","3"

There are not enough people playing it, i counted 1 server in the US with 14 people on and 1 server in EU with 4 people on.\n\nYep thats right, 1 server for the entire EU continent with only 4 people in total playing, the US server was laggy and randomly closed after 10 minutes of playtime (host probably left the game, more on that later).\n\nThe gfx and sfx are quite poor too, there are only 3 maps, games can take forever, and that is before we even start with the controls. They are terrible. Nothing feels fluid and it doesnt feel like any helicopter i have ever flown in any game, ever, it just feels clunky and weird. Real helicopters do not have a forward or reverse control, to go forward you tilt the nose down, to slow or reverse you tilt the nose up. Simple. So why do we have an accelerator and a brake in this game? It doesnt make sense.\n\nThe gameplay (when i finally found a server with enough people for a match) feels boring, the combat is seriously lacking and for me it just doesnt feel fun at all. You can clearly see people being killed frequently, but when you look at the scoreboard, you realise that the AI gets 95% of the kills in this game. Usually the seriously OP AA missiles. Kinda defeats the object of a multiplayer team game doesnt it?\n\nDid i mention all the servers are run by the players? There are no dedicated servers at all, meaning the players have to create the games, which in return means any game you manage to join can close down at any time. Neither is there any team balance. It seems to be normal to be in 6v3 or 7v3 matches. This, and never knowing if you are even going to get to finish a match let alone win, becomes old very quickly\n\nThen there is the hit detection, which is quite broken. You can shoot at players and can clearly see the impact of the munitions, but nothing happens. Then the sound will disappear for no reason...\n\nRequested a refund, will check back later this year and see if anything has changed and improved. I feel there is quite a lot of work to do yet.\n\nEdit: I keep hearing how there are loads of people playing this game with multiple full servers and i am just talking nonsense, but here are the facts.\n\nThe peak player count yesterday was 38, that is over the EU, US and Asia servers combined, and the player numbers have been steadily dropping since the games release which is worrying.\n\nhttps://steamdb.info/app/433530/graphs/\n\nI am not trying to bash the game, im just saying that the people saying 'there are tons of full servers' are full of BS, there is literally nobody to play with.\n\nIt might be a very good game in the future, but for me its just a little bit too early access yet. Keep watching youtube videos, keep up to date with updates etc, but if you have a limited budget to buy a game i would suggest you buy something else, if you have money to spend and really want to support the development, then by all means go ahead and buy it.","March 8","false","0.7"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","3"

It really could, even for it's alpha state. Sams are OP as ♥♥♥♥ and alot of helicopters early vietnam and late vietnam don't get flares, and it's frustrating when the enemy just spams hinds or helicopters that get 4 sams. I have flown my huey into enemy territory to strafe a base, and taken 15 sams from the surrounding area. They were nerfed but in the completely wrong way; the fix would have been to give more helos flares and making certain aircraft *cough cough* hind *cough cough* not have them available. The game is just as frustrating as it was before the patches, and it doesn't feel like it's gotten any better at all. I'm not sure the experience the dev team has, but if they have any it's really doesn't seem to show.

My problem is with one simple issue with the game, the hit detection if awful, and I know the devs are hard at work trying to fix it, but I have simple standard for even EA games that should be filled for me to actually recommend a game. Let me give a more detail explaination to just how bad my one issue with the game translates into a horride time playing.\n\nFirst off, almost everything else in the game is great for its current state of development is great, love the detail of the helicopters, like the options to change a weapons loadout, the roles of different helicopters, seperation of the helicopters by different eras, all good.\n\nIts more of major flaw in the primary game mechanic that kills it, and i mean absolutely kills it. The game seems to only favor rockets for A2A or miniguns on select few US helicopters. The rockets are a spam and pray for a hit, while the miniguns only seem to be effective due to the rate of fire. Try playing with 12.7mm "machine guns" and you will wonder if you are shooting blanks. The matter even gets worse the more you play and notice it.\n\nI have shot duel  machine guns, or even duel 30mm cannons at hovering helicopters while in level flight and nothing happens to the target. I wonder still if I was doing something wrong til others mentioned the same issues in game chat. Once I saw a helicopter slowly line up to land troops, and im mean SLOWLY. I spun around above to loose speed and come to a hover above him and started to fire 40mm gernades from the turret at him, but to my shock, every round showed a direct hit, but no damage taken. I tried the same thing with the vast majority of weapons in game, and in its current state, its simply broken.\n\nSeeing how combat is THE feature of this game, and its not working as intended, then I would avoid this game, but only until the matter is fixed. Once they fix hit detection and if you are a fan of helicopters in any way, then it would practically be a crime not to play this game.\n\n","February 21","false","4.1"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

It is not even bad. It's just purely non-existent. With a bit of luck you'll be hitting AI positions or players standing still, but you can forget any kind of dogfighting or shooting at moving targets. It simply does not work the absolute majority of the time. And not even point blank. You're gonna see your shots hitting, but they just won't register. Sucks the fun right out pretty quickly.\n\nFor those wondering I was playing with a stable ping of 30ms and no apparent packet loss. The issue lies with the games servers that appear to be some of the worst I have ever encountered. Or in the worse case in the game's netcode which in this state will be one hell of a long haul to fix.\n\nI realize it is early access and i have closed both eyes, but from a PvP arena shooter which this game basically is, this state of things is just unacceptable.\n\nTL;DR: Core mechanics (namely hit register) broken to pieces atm, I reccomend you save your money.\n\nEDIT: As per the developers response I suppose waiting a couple days is the least I can do. However my opinion remains unchanged. In it's current state I cannot reccomend the game. And let's just put the emphasis on the word "current".\n\nEDIT 2: It is now after the first batch of patches and the hit detection issue still prevails. But there has certainly been an improvement and the devs are at work. It is still far from a state where I would call it reliable and reccomend the game. But I now have hopes it might get there some day. On that day I'll start reccomending the game, but right now I still can't do that.","February 15","false","2.4"," 13 of 33 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","13","33","0","4"

This is nothing more than a proof of concept helicopter game with three maps.\n\nFurthermore, it's not like you can select "any" helicopter to take on a given map. It's JUST a multiplayer game with maps that have fixed aircraft you can take. In it's current state, it's just a generic helicopter shooter with the ability to capture points on a map.\n\nLastly, there isn't really much customization to the helicopters either. You get two, toggleable, loadouts per helcicopter. That's pretty much the limit of customization from what I could tell.\n\nOverall, can't really recommend this game at his point. Put in a refund request for now. Hopefully it improves with time.\n\nEDIT: In response to the developer... sure, I'll give it a shot down the road. It's just not the type of game I was hoping it would be at this moment.","February 15","false","0.2"," 12 of 42 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","12","42","0","3"

Then you will love this.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that has anything remotely close to flight control inputs.   BF2 or even BF3, then its a maybe at best or depending on the Devs, it could be never.\n\nNo joystick, No collective,  You can remap a few keys to get close but that's pretty limited.\n\nAt this point I don't think "fight characteristics" high on the "TO DO LIST"  Just WASD and a mouse.\n\nIts especially important to this game because a very big part of this game is landing and taking off.\nTake off deliver troops, come back rearm and reload deliver some more troops.\nIf you crash at the target site or when you get back you start over.\n\nTry to be REALLY careful when you are delivering the troops so you don't crash...... And while you do that, the attack helos who DON'T have to land eat you for lunch.\n\nNot sure which way the devs plan to go, but if it flys like a car.   They should just call it hovercar and then everyone will be happy.    Because no one expects it to fly like a Helo.\n","February 15","false","39.6"," 3 of 22 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","3","22","0","0"
