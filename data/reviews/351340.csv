"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Celgaming/recommended/351340/","Celgaming","Celgaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Celgaming/","941 products in account","In short:\n\nIf you're a fan of old school click and play (point and click) titles you might find Belladonna to be disappointing. Not because it deviates from norms set by the classics but because it doesn't even try. If you've read the other reviews stating the shortness to be a good thing, well then imagine a game that's not even an hour long, has a very corny story, disappointing abrupt end and has no puzzles to be solved at all.\nIn long:\nThat's right. There are no puzzles left for the player to solve. The only ones you encounter are either so simple or outright explained and solved by the protagonist herself as she speaks to herself, leaving you no room to experiment or even ponder what you ought to be doing. I've never played an adventure game this easy in my life unless you count games targeted to toddlers with similar game mechanics. I would argue those games to be even more cerebral experiences than Belladonna.\n\nThe staple, the hallmark of a good adventure game to me has always been that they force the player to think outside of the box. A constant effort must be made by the player to figure out what to do. Careful and most importantly thoughtful game design is needed to keep the player entertained in these type of games. That combined with a vivid and interesting story, a deep mystery, or simply a protagonist that is interesting / quirky and full of character are also very important in a genre that only uses the left mouse click to play it. Belladonna has none of that. There is a mystery there but it's not meant to be solved. The game simply makes you read journal pages that explain it and that's it. The only difficulty in the game is finding an item (if you even missed it -- they are very easy to find) or trying to read the journal pages as the font is set to be so small it makes your eyes bleed.\n\nThe only positive I can give to the game is the art design. It's hard to explain just how little is in this game though. In the store page there are 7 backgrounds shown. The game only has about 12 of them, so it basically shows you over 50% of the game's scenery right there. There are also no cutscenes. Sometimes the game just fades to black and we get to hear sounds as if they couldn't finish the game or the artist couldn't bother drawing vital scenes in the game. I mean the entire ending has no cutscene at all. It just fades to black, we hear a few corny lines and then we get to see someone's doodle with the words "The End" on it.\n\nThe music is good. The very little there is. I mean I can't complain about it so my only memory of it is that it didn't bother me. It sets a tone and keeps it there. The voice acting is ok. You won't be moved by the characters at all since they are devoid of any. I can't blame the voice actors at all as the writing seems very corny. The game sets a good atmosphere at first in the beginning, but immediately breaks it by having joke descriptions when you inspect objects more than once (a staple in adventure games yes -- but very out of place in the games milieu). If you establish that the main character is a "tabula rasa" an empty slate, but then she makes quirky Monkey Island esque remarks, you just destroyed all the character you worked so hard to establish right of the bat.\n\nFinal thoughts (and story spoilers):\n\nBelladonna is a game that falls flat I'm afraid, unless all you're after is a short novel length story that's only twist is the protagonist discovering a note that tells her she was a lesbian when she was alive and the lover of the only other character in the game and that's it. That's it! No character arc, no nothing. It's disappointing because it's established early on that she has no memories, no personality and possibly no emotions at all and is basically an empty slate. Yet she reads a note left by her living self and instantly she's now the person she used to be I guess.\n\nIt would've been so much more interesting if the game actually played with these concepts rather than just introduce them and then take the short route out. The game could've made strong statements about sexuality and the human persona, what it is to be a human and to exist. But it doesn't. It just says "o-oh... I'm a lesbian? L-lewd!" and then gives you an ending drawing out of a b-movie with the main character in a slave esque pose under another woman like she just accepted it no problems at all. The game begins "tabula rasa" and ends "tabula rasa".\n\nThe most disappointing fact is that the game teases with a lot of good philosophical questions and hints at many possible interesting side effects of what it might be like to be a reanimated human being. But then it doesn't even explore them. It's like there's two lines of the main character pondering about possibly being a sociopath after killing a cat and then talking about it with another character and then this is entirely forgotten. The ending of the game is also insanely cheesy and left me even more disappointed.\n\nI can't recommend this game to anyone. Sorry.\n\nTwitter @ Celgaming\nTwitch / Celgaming","January 14","false","0.8"," 77 of 95 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","77","95","0","4"

Few titles dare to look at the issues of domestic abuse or a protagonist in a same-sex romance. But it didn't succeed in its execution. The characters don't leave any lasting impressions (the central characters, despite being in a relationship, show no real emotion towards one another), too much of the story is told through journal entries rather than having revelations occur naturally, and the conclusion is very lackluster. Some impressive concepts were brought up, esp. the concern of whether or not those brought back lacked souls/humanity, but this question was just abandoned without any further discussion. Additionally, the puzzles are too simplistic, with no real challenge or sense of achievement. Belladonna would have worked better as a short animation than as an interactive story.","March 16, 2015","false","1.0"," 52 of 61 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","52","61","2","0"

(At the end of the review I've added a note of what has been fixed).\n\nOverviewI have mixed views on Belladonna. On one hand the story is dark and intriguing and has pretty solid voice acting, but on the other it does not explore these themes in enough depth to make a lasting impression. I think this game is worth trying if you already got it on sale or in a bundle. My completion time was 1.5 hours, and the remaining time on my counter was for trading card drops.\n\nThoughts, story wiseBelladonna explores some dark and mature themes, including life, death, murder and other moral issues. The game follows an animated corpse as she tries to find out about her past life and how she came to be in this state between being alive and dead. The dark and macabre nature of the story was interesting to me, and will interest those who are also fans of this type of story. I did enjoy unraveling the mysteries behind Belladonna as the story progresses, and some of the twisted revelations throughout the game I did find satisfying.\n\nThere are several shortcomings to this game, however, that prevented me from enjoying it as much as I felt I would. The story simply is too short and doesn't explore enough of the dark themes, and felt like a wasted potential. Play time isn't always the most important thing if there is enough emotional impact, but Belladonna felt very rushed at times, for example as some other reviews have mentioned, notably so near the ending.\n\nThoughts, game play wiseBelladonna is certainly a point and click adventure game, but within this genre people do have different expectations. I would describe Belladonna as more as a story-exploration game with adventure game elements, that is the focus is more on the story while the puzzles are not very difficult, and do not take up much time. I personally do not mind this as there are other games I could play if I wanted a challenge, so as long you're not expecting some super difficult brain teasers you shouldn't be disappointed in this aspect.\n\nConclusionI enjoyed the story of Belladonna, but felt there could have been much more to the game. If you enjoy dark, macabre stories and don't mind easy point and click puzzles, I think this game is worth picking up on sale or in a bundle, but no need to go out of your way to do so.\n\n* Edited out previous inability to take Steam screenshots and broken save system. These two issues have since been fixed. There may or may not be achievements added, but the dev hasn't really 100% promised anything.","August 1, 2015","true","5.5"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","43","48","4","6"

You explore various parts of the mansion you awoke in, uncovering details of the experiments to reanimate the dead, as well as learning of your own fate and how you came to be. It is a fun mystery puzzle game, though the puzzles are very easy, with the main focus being on the story. As you collect journal entries from around the mansion, you learn more of the story. The game in total took me less than an hour to complete, which was sad, because I wanted more; However, the story was interesting and I liked how the story ultimately turned out.\n\nVisually, Belladonna is a very simple and basic game, similar to other puzzle games. I was sad the story wasn't longer and more drawn out, but as a game it was fun to play. Just be prepared for a short game if you are thinking of purchasing this title.","October 25, 2015","true","5.1"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","37","44","2","0"

It took me a little bit more than 1 hour to finish it and I even did get stuck at point. But it's short gameplay time is the game's only fault.\n\nBelladonna can best be described as a true classic gothic horror story. Most modern day horror games usually rely on jump scares and horrific images to create their "atmospheric" gameplay. Belladonna in contrast is using a completely different approach. By relying on a story progression similar to a detective story, the horrible truth of what dark deeds had been done, will be gradually presented to the player. This way the game manages to create it's dark and brooding atmosphere and keep the player interested in what has been happening.\n\nGameplay itself is your standard point-and-click adventure style, without pixel-hunting. Interactable objects will always be indentified as those (maybe except for one occasion where I got stuck XD).\n\nOverall. Belladonna is definitely worth playing. Just keep in mind that it is quite short, so maybe wait for a sale to pick it up!","March 2","true","5.3"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

Other games of the genre can be too hard (with puzzles), too long or too crazy (with their story), but "Belladonna" is very well written, it has a few logical puzzles, pretty characters and backgrounds. So it's perfect for a taste of what is an adventure game.\n\nOn the other hand, for adventure games veterans this game might seem too short (only an hour or so) and like a missed opportunity to make more environments, implement more puzzles, characters and dialogues. But after all this game was made by one person - Niklas Hallin. So that explains the game's length.\n\nDespite the fact that this game is short and a little too easy for those who eat adventure games for breakfast, "Belladonna" has a very unique style, it looks pretty and it's easy to get attached to the main character - she's nor good nor evil and that adds some depth to the overall feeling.\n\nAh, and one other thing - the developer himself wrote somewhere on his website that his work is highly influenced not only by other video games, but also by literature. I can say that it really feels, especially while reading the pages torn from "Belladonna's" characters diaries.\n\nAll in all, i can highly recommend this game for people who value atmosphere, characters and story in each game. And those, who like only long and/or hard puzzle adventures might as well look elsewhere.","February 27, 2015","true","1.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

This game, named after both, carries that strange duality: it is beautiful, but it is a game about death.\n\nDeath and reanimation, death and unlife, death and what could be considered unnatural even by the less religious people too. In short, Belladonna is a game that starts with a re-enactment of Mary Shelley’s ‘Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus’– or, more precisely, the underlying theme of brining the dead back to life.\nAfter this ghoulish start, the game follows the steps of the newly-resurrected girl who slowly discovers the reasons and events that led to her current state: a story about a marriage gone sour and a man getting obsessed with his work about creating life. A story which also has a few small twists in it, even if most are telegraphed in very obvious ways long before their big reveal.\n\nAlthough this game is a point ‘n’ click adventure in theory, in practise few things will ever stand in the player’s way to discover the story it wants to tell. Only a handful of objects are used and most of the time the game tells how to accomplish the required objective, so the roughly one-hour game time– the only obviously sore spot about Belladonna– is spent by fully immersing ourselves in this weird, somewhat bittersweet, and maybe mildly disturbing tale.","April 25","true","5.7"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynarayan/recommended/351340/","ladynarayan","Narayan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynarayan/","393 products in account","Belladonna is a point & click adventure game, featuring subtle horror/ Frankenstein-esque atmosphere, beautifully painted backdrops and a sweet, likable protagonist. She wakes up in a laboratory, not knowing who she is or what she is, but exhibits joy of discovery & curiosity rather than fear. Her character traits quickly emerge, like the urge to name things (suit of armor? must be Roland the Poet:) making her the more fleshed out.\n\nThe story is quite simple, but still graceful & interesting. We learn most of it by reading torn out journal pages, which are well written & well paced out. Some additional information comes from interacting with objects or looking at things. Her commentaries about the surroundings are quite enjoyable, even if they have nothing to do with the plot itself.\n\nI liked it myself, hence the thumbs up, but it has one major flaw - length. This is very short game. If you read everything carefully and listen to the protagonist's every comment on every subject, you still will finish it under an hour. It's is also quite easy, especially if you pay attention to what is said (the main character will often hint herself as what to do next), so you basically breeze through it, which just intensifies the length problem.\nAlso personal & really minor gripe - card settings. I basically finished game 3 times when I hit 2 hour mark and first card dropped, and then I left it idle, but cards seem to be set do drop every half an hour or more, so I had to idle over 5 hour mark to obtain them all, in a game that takes under 1 hour to complete (and that's only if you try hard to prolong the experience).\n\nOverall I liked the atmosphere, the story and the characters. Belladonna is an enjoyable and definitely memorable, albeit short game :)","October 10, 2015","true","5.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

This is a short point and click adventure game about a woman who wakes up reanimated in a dungeon and has to figure out what happened to her. Most of the story is told in journal entries that your character finds throughout the castle. The story in these is interesting (if pretty scary and tragic) and told well, but the fonts chosen for each character are quite small and can be hard to read. It's a bit of a weakness that the player character has amnesia, since her relationship to the other characters is difficult to flesh out because she doesn't remember them. There's one particularly disturbing story thread that kind of ends up going nowhere for this reason.\n\nThe puzzles are simple and logical for the most part. The only time I had slight difficulty progressing was when I couldn't find an object at the edge of a scene. Veteran adventure gamers will likely find the puzzles too easy, but for people just starting out in adventure games they'll work well. The art is simple but clean for the most part. In some places it's a bit difficult to figure out which objects can be interacted with. The voice acting is decent, and it was nice to hear so many object descriptions.\n\nI liked most of the time that I spent with this game, but it's just too short and its themes, while interesting, are left too unresolved to be able to recommend it.","August 3, 2015","false","0.9"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

The setting is well done, a nice old castle with big rooms, and the artwork is pretty good.  The small amounts of music included are decent as well, although the semi-jump scare reveal music tends to play over the other sounds, lessening it's impact. But the game has too many flaws and issues to recommend at full price.\n\nFirst of all, it's incredibly short. I beat the entire thing in less than an hour and a half, and didn't push myself to go quickly. The extra time is from me letting it run overnight to get trading cards. The primary voice actor for your character is pretty good, but her voice doesn't match the creepy gothic environment. She sounds like a modern, 21st century female, not a recently brought back from the dead monstrosity. But that's not the worst of it. The second voice actor is atrocious, with a faux British accent that is poorly done and not consistently performed. Some of the sound effects are ridiculous. One of them is literally the AIM log on sound for a door opening. The environments feel fairly sterile; except for a few of the more elaborate rooms, most are barren and uninteresting, despite being well rendered.\n\nThe story isn't too complicated, and it's revealed mostly through journal pages you find scattered throughout the house you're exploring. There is a bit of mystery, but no major twist or huge intrigue once you figure out who the major players in the story are. It does weirdly go past what would be the natural conclusion, then turns around and ends much too abruptly. And the puzzles are all quite easy, with the protagonist often explaining what needs to be done through her commentary. It's annoying when you think "I knew that!" but don't get the full satisfaction of having figured it out.\n\nBelladona isn't terrible, but it's not all that good. Still, it's frequently in bundles or hugely discounted, and it's worth a look if you can get it for a buck or less, as I did.","January 27","false","8.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is a STORY; heard through the poignant remarks and observational thoughts of the lead character and (OMG the horror) READ through journal notes.  There are 18 notes total, 9 by Dr. Wolfram von Trauerschloss (Trauerschloss means Mourning Castle in German) 5 before and 4 after the reanimation of his wife, 4 by his wife, Belladonna while she was alive, 4 by Belladonna after she is reanimated, and 1 by her faithful servant, Klara Seiber.  Part point and click, part visual novel, part walking simulator, part horror, part mystery, part commentary and ALL ABOUT THE STORY BEING TOLD from different perspectives and points of view.  That is tough to do in only 18 journal pages and those 18 pages get the job done, and done very well.\n\nMost reviewers state that this is a short game and it is.  I finished in 119 minutes (and I am slow) but was quite satisfied by the story told.  It was like reading a short story or novella.  The end was a bit truncated I thought and not seemingly appropriate until thought about.  Yet how else could it have ended but the way it did.  The epilogue is a single screenshot the credits play over, and picture shows everything that needs to be stated.\n\nReviewers complain about having to READ.  Really? Seriously?  18 handwritten journal pages are too much??  And 1 has only a few words on it.  Plus the questions/dialogue near the end that explains so much motivationally, ethically, and morally. That was too much to read??? (Sighs in disbelief and shakes head).\n\nThere are no puzzles.  (Really there are none despite other reviewers saying there are.)  It is a straight linear STORY with little inventory that reveals itself and characters as the game progresses.  It is not even an adventure but it had to be put is some category other then horror, I suppose.\n\nWorth the READ because this game is more of a STORY than anything else.","November 2, 2015","true","3.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/curseyourichards/recommended/351340/","curseyourichards","curseyourichards","http://steamcommunity.com/id/curseyourichards/","347 products in account","I try to buy indie games at or close to full price, particularly from first time developers who do something that looks cool or interesting. Sure, I've taken a bath on a couple of games that weren't as good as I'd hoped, but it's never been too punishing.\n\nUntil now.\n\nBelladonna is the first game that I truly, sorely regret buying. Even if I had a time machine and could go back and buy it dirt cheap, knowing what I know now, I still wouldn't. As I write this review, it's currently on sale for sixty-nine cents and my brain is still going, "NOPE." Listen to my brain. It knows what it's talking about. Don't make the same mistakes I did. By all means, laugh at my pain, but save yourselves.\n\nOstensibly, Belladonna is a point and click adventure game consisting of exploration, a mystery narrative and puzzles. That assessment is...generous, at the very least.\n\nIn a game that takes place in what's supposed to be a castle, there are about a dozen locations, including hallways. Most contain one item--two if you're extremely lucky!--and maybe two or three short bits of flavor text so bland I hesitate to call it flavor text at all. If light vegan mayonnaise were flavor text, it's what you'll find here. I guess if you've never had anything else, it might seem robust, but I can't imagine anyone with half a dozen decent-to-good adventure games under their belts finding it anything but dull.\n\nThe narrative isn't much better than the flavor(less) text. The plot hinges on a mystery so transparent it's easily solvable after the first clue or two if you've got a couple of spare braincells lying around to rub together. Halfway through the story, you're likely to get fed up with how it's belaboring the point you've already figured out. “I know something you don't know!” the narrative teases, “Such a mysterious mystery! Oooh!” while you start drinking heavily and praying for the sweet release of death.\n\nThe prose is written in a style that I can only adequately describe as “olden time-y,” superficially reminiscent of Gothic literature if you tossed any old novel in a blender and diluted it with heavy doses of pretentious goth kid who swallowed a thesaurus but neglected to get enough dictionary in his diet.  This might not be so bad if the story and characters were stylish or over the top enough to carry the awkwardness—Hammer or Universal horror films are hardly historically accurate, but are cool enough you don't care—but Belladonna has the panache of a worn out shoe.\n\nThe story is told primarily through diary entries written by three different characters: the scientist, his socialite wife and the maid. They all sound virtually the same. The only discernible difference between them is that our Frankenstein writes in a slightly more ornate style and throws a few scientific terms around. I repeat: a socialite and a scientist both write the same way a maid does. In the Georgian/Victorian era. (Which is it? Who knows!)\n\nThe diary entries also contain only explicitly plot related bits with nothing else to really round out the characters. They're basically props to be moved around at the whim of the developer like little cardboard cutouts. This is not the way to tell a story with any hope of emotional potency. The villain gets what feels like three times as much “screen time” through the diaries as the two main characters we're supposed to care about—and he's dead before the story even starts!\n\nBecause the whole thing is written as telling rather than showing, in spite of the fact it's all plot, the relationships between the characters are barely touched on in any meaningful way. The main romance is written about in detail—as in, what actually happened between them during the course of their months long affair—in one entry; it's given no development beyond that.\n\nCharacter motives are thin on the ground. The writer tries to convey that the characters are driven by grief, but does so poorly that I'm not sure they've ever met and interacted with a real live human being. Since the story picks up after both characters in question are through grieving, their motivations appear for all intents and purposes to consist of such compelling reasons as, “Because science! I guess?” and “Because boredom! I guess?”\n\nThe puzzles would be insultingly easy to even the most casual of gamers over the age of nine. And though I may have blocked out the more excruciating aspects of the experience, as far as I can recall with the exception of the final one, they all have the same basic end goal: open a door/container. That's it. Kill a cat to open a door. Rifle through a dead body's pockets to open a box. Get a screwdriver to open a clock. Necessary items for solving these “puzzles” are often just left lying around in plain sight, require no extra steps to acquire them and no critical thinking to make them function. Can you put two and two together and not come up with “cheese”? Congratulations, you too can finish Belladonna!\n\nWorst of all, nothing happens. Nothing. Because everything has already happened. This narrative device can work in games (Analogue: A Hate Story managed to pull this off pretty handily) but the writing is so lousy that even the attempt is torture. After forty-five minutes of opening doors, it finally looks like something will happen!...and then the story cuts to black. The end!\n\nIf for some reason—masochism, morbid curiosity, a large iron spike in your head tickling the 'lack of common sense' centers of your brain—you're still considering shelling out dough to buy this, let me at least mention that the less story-based aspects suffer too in hopes I might dissuade you from such folly.\n\nFirst, the voice acting is dismal and one actor portrays both speaking characters: the first in a plain American speaking voice, the second with electronic distortion and a high school play English accent. Never mind that this apparently takes place in Eastern Europe or...Germany? (Much like the time period, who the ♥♥♥♥ knows for sure??)\n\nThe diary entries are all written in fonts that border on unreadable to various degrees. They're either too flowery, too tiny, or joy of joys both.\n\nIt's bare bones in the extreme. There are no extras. No behind the scenes character art or similar unlockables. No achievements. No save button. Now that's commitment to minimalism!\n\nReplayability is nonexistent.\n\nIf after all this you still want the game, well...Godspeed, you beautiful, romantic fool. I envy your optimism, naivete and by the way would you like to buy a bridge in Brooklyn?\n\nIn closing, I will say: if Belladonna were updated in the future and whole swaths of it were rewritten, expanded and for the love of all that's holy edited, it might be something special, or at least an interesting if noble failure. Currently it is anything but. My playtime will be just long enough to collect all the cards and not a second longer.\n\n2/10","February 9","false","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bilbo3072/recommended/351340/","Bilbo3072","Bilbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bilbo3072/","392 products in account","One thing I'll mention at the start is that there is a spoiler at the end of this review, I wouldn't usually but I'm pointing out a massive flaw in the story, so it's somewhat unavoidable.\n\nUltimately, the game is cheap, and as I got it in a bundle it cost me pennies, so I can't really hate it. For the price, it's probably about what I'd expect. It's a nice way to kill time for an hour, and once you start playing, you'll want to finish purely to confirm that your guess is correct regarding what happened. That doesn't mean it deserves a recommendation though.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with the game was the length. You can probably complete this in an hour, or 2 if you're like me and a) can't see for toffee and continually walk past one of the items tens of time, and b) spend half of it looking for secrets, of which there are none. The story progresses very quickly, and although it's interesting, it loses points for it's inability to keep you in anticipation of the ending. Not even half way in, and you can guess easily enough what happened.\n\nIt also isn't difficult. I didn't read anything about the game when I started, so I wasn't too sure what I was getting myself into, but I expected jump scares and hiding from a murderer or something along those lines, but there's none of that. There are technically puzzles in it, but they are so obvious that they require no thought. The items are easy to find, (though there was one that I just couldn't notice for a while), so most of them you're likely to have picked up on your way through already, so there isn't a lot of back tracking like you would expect for a game like this. The entire area you can explore is very small as well.\n\nAnother big one for me was the voice acting. The voices didn't match the characters, and they truly sounded staged. I don't know who did the voices, but it sounded like they picked someone random from the street, or perhaps the game makers used their own voices. It was off putting.\n\nThe ending was also rushed. You'll have everything already once you get the final objective, with the exception of one item which is already explained to you how to get, so you don't even need to work for it. You get them, do the thing, and it's suddenly over. The ending truly was not satisfying at all.\n\nOne thing I did like was the artwork, it suited the story quite a lot, though it could have been animated a lot better.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the ending wasn't really set up for a continuation, at the length it is it'd be better if it was just one chapter of a larger story. This game would be vastly improved if they increased the playing time, added a lot more exploration, added some difficult puzzles, and perhaps a mad murderer you had to avoid to keep you on your toes.\n\n\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\n\n\n\nThere was one thing that bugged me in this. You get a key from the dead body of the husband. The key unlocks a box containing another key. That key is used to wind up the wife. The wife says the reason she couldn't wind herself up is because the key on her back is placed out of her reach, so only someone else can wind her up. This suggests that she had access to the key. Then why did she lock it up and put the smaller key on the husbands body, whome she hated? It makes no sense. It'd perhaps make more sense if she just changed the line to: "I couldn't wind myself up because I didn't have access to the key", but if she had time to do the experiment, wouldn't she at least have time to look for the key on the corpse?\n\nAnd since I'm spoiling anyway, there's another annoying thing about the story. The maid wrote a note suggesting she was falling out of love with the wife, but if you try to mention it to the wife, she decides against telling it in the end. If you put something like that in, you should at least expand on it, otherwise it feels completely pointless. Even just a simple alternative ending, like a good ending if she stays quiet, and a bad ending if she doesn't. With the ending being just one still image, all that needs to be done would have one more image as an alternative, and it'd tie up a lot nicer than it currently does.\n\nAnyway, that's my review of the game, I'll won't be recommending it, but honestly if it's on offer for a quid or part of a bundle or something, they I'd at least consider it.","November 7, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The actors really do give it their all, but the acting did not fit the gothic setting.\n\nThe game is very short, which isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as that's the amount of time the game needs to say and achieve what it wants to. Belladonna, though interesting enough to hang on through minimal puzzle-solving/ item finding, only begins to come alive (pun intended) at its very end, which is a shame.\n\nDespite all of this, I truly hope the developers continue to make games,  Belladonna is not a bad game, in fact, if it was, then I simply would have dismissed it entirely and not bothered writing this review.\n\nWhat makes Belladonna so frustrating is that is has so much potential- interesting subject matter, good artwork, ethical issues, etc- but doesn't fully execute on those elements and ends before it truly begins.

It was simple, but don't fix what ain't broke.\n\nThere is an atmosphere of dread that is captured very well with the music, art, and voice acting. The story, while somewhat predictable after a few diary pages, was still chilling enough that I found myself cringing and being disgusted with every action I took. My character's questioning of her own actions and morals gave me a nice feeling of just how much this was inspired by Mary Shelley's work.\n\nIt was an appropriate love letter to Frankenstein. It really was.\n\nYet there are some things I should add that are huge, glaring downfalls in this game. The big reveal cutscene after dealing with the cat (UH. THANKS FOR THAT, BY THE WAY!) seems a bit awkward. The one character no longer seems to fit in with the artstyle of Belladonna and just looks out of place. We have all of this lovely art and...what? Yet this is easily overlooked. It's not very long and you'll get back to PRETTY! 2D! soon enough.\n\nThe largest concern is this game is ENTIRELY TOO SHORT. You will get to the end, not realize it, and reach the THE END screen and start bemoaning how this game deserved much longer. You're expecting the next phase of the game to begin, especially since your character seems to be wanting to voice her concerns, but...nothing! The puzzles, being simple enough as they are, make it feel as if this game needed much more time devoted to it.\n\nThose are my gripes. Was it worth the $6.99 I paid? Probably not. Was it a good experience? Enough to write some cheesy fanfiction because you ripped my heart out.\n\n...Well that's very appropriate given we're reanimating corpses here, huh?","April 4, 2015","true","0.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

But get it on sale, I don't think you will be happy buying it on a full price. And that's why.\n\nThe game is very short, I've done it in less than 1.5 hours reading all the letters and staring on every scene to enjoy it's beauty. The drawings are great in this game and strangely it seems like different scenes are drawn by different artists, at least 2-3 of them. Dut despite all these beauty it's only like 10 or so scenes in this game which is not much. As for the gameplay it's more like a story-driven waling simulator in a form of an adventure game. Yes it has more than just walking around but believe me it's barely 15-20 usable items in the game so it doesn't make any difference. Also the use of items is very logical which is a plus of course but the minus is you use it immediately very often, few pixels away from the place you found them.\n\nOverall the story is interesting though not very original, game is well-made, art-style is great, diary pages are entertaining ro read but the game is very easy, short and lacks actual gameplay and also the game almost has no ending and looks like devs wanted to make more but decided to just cut the game to the The End screen at some point.","September 26, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also some minor spoilers.)\n\nBelladonna is a game that revolves around 3 characters:\n- The Scientist (I can't remember his name, so I'll call him Scientist Dude)\n- Belladonna (The Scientist's wife)\n- Klara (Belladonna's maid)\nThe introduction is that Scientist Dude and his wife Belladonna live in this big mansion place, the wife has a son (Lucas) that dies soon after birth. Scientist Dude and his wife start becoming distant, with Scientist Dude always in the basement and his wife always upstairs staring out a window. The mansion starts falling apart, with many of the servants quitting, until only one is left, Klara. Klara and Belladonna have a thing for each other. Scientist Dude has learned the secrets of reanimation (Frankenstein stuff).\n\nWhat I enjoyed about this game:\n- the art style\n- the music\n- the chilling/spooky parts (even though you can always tell when one of these is about to happen because normally the screen shifts automatically while you move but these parts it doesn't until you get close to the edge and the area obviously has more to it that it isn't showing immediately)\n- the idea in the story of same-sex romance (which is rarely featured in games)\n- the idea in the story of clockwork reanimated people\n- The attention to detail in some parts, (Spoiler here!) after you collect all the parts for reanimating the dead scientist, the stairs leading to the basement get a bloodstain on them, suggesting Belladonna dragged the body down the steps.\n- How you have to figure out the story for yourself, as not much is revealed to you without collecting the journal pages. I also liked how the end of the story is revealed first, then everything leading up to that point.\n\nWhat I didn't enjoy about this game:\n- The majority of the voice acting. It seems forced, usually without emotions. (especially the very first lines. They are really weak and made me want to stop playing in the first 30 seconds). Occasionally there is obvious cuts that don't sound too good.\n- The attention to detail in some other parts. (Spoiler here, again!) when i was told to collect the things to reanimate the scientist, I didn't ask any questions at first because I THOUGHT I knew where everything was. After collecting the brain, your character says something about having all the parts, even though I had not found all of them yet.\n- The shortness of the game. I could see why someone who bought this game for full value might be a bit frustrated.\n- With the shortness mentioned, I hated the ending. It was abrupt, and I felt like alot more could be said. There is a difference between a suspensful cliffhanger that keeps you guessing but still satisfies (think Inception) and an ending that is so sudden that it literally gives you a picture of what ends up happening, which is what this game did. The last thing happens, and the 'The End' screen shows a single picture that defines the future, no making up stuff allowed!\n\nIn the end, I have to say I did enjoy this game, although it should have been longer and not had such a rushed, sudden, and unimaginative ending. The highest I could give this is a 6/10, but I feel like most would settle for less, especially paying full price.","August 28, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The difficulty is easy, as most of the puzzles are very straight-forward and require just a minimum of logical thinking. So the game felt more like an interactive storybook to me than a classical point&click adventure, a fact that I liked. The voice acting was great, too, as it suited the main character especially well. The plot is transported through various notes scattered around the game environment, while being perfectly fine to me, some players might prefer the story to be shown to them...\nWhat I also noticed is, that the spelling of some characters' names is not consistent,\nmeaning that the same person is sometimes called 'Franziska', another\ntime it's 'Franzeska'.

I liked the artwork and the atmosphere, i just wish that the last scene went at least a few scenes further. It just ends and that's it.\n\nThe voice acting of the main character is lovely but the other main roles voice acting was really irritating for me. Thankfully that character doesn't say much in the game or it possibly could have ruined the game for me.\n\nIf you can get this for 90% off like I did, then its a fun short point and click just to read a bit of storyline. There isn't much in the way of puzzles. They are all very easy to figure out. I wanted this game to be more, but for a short story it's not SO bad.\n\nIf I had to rate it out of 10 I would give it a 6.5 out of 10. It has all the right elements. Good sound design, ok soundtrack. Nice animation. I think what must have happened is it started out full steam and was going to be longer and had to wrap up sooner than planned. At least that's the vibe I got out of it.\n\nI am still going to thumbs up this game because I enjoyed myself up until the end. The game should make it clear that it is a SHORT story. They should put that in their user-defined tags.\n\nIn the end this game only cost me abouy 70 cents so I feel it was worth it to support an indie developer, but I hope that they flesh out their next point and click (if they decide to continue). The artwork was really lovely and I could see a more fleshed out game like this to do really well.\n\nIt wasn't bad, it wasn't great... it was a good time killer.\n\nMy final words on it really: Too short. Abrupt... but still somehow charming enough for me to forgive that.\nI would have felt a lot different if I had paid the full price for this game so I wouldn't have. It was great to run through on sale.\n\nThe end.","January 30","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This isnt looking like a complete game. The whole game can be played under less than a couple hours with no speeding WHATSOEVER. It really is made with little content at all!\n\nI would have wanted to start with the pro's, rather than con's, but...there are very little pro's to it:\n\n- the concept: it is sort of interesting, sadly it remained what it was, a concept;\n- SOME, and i mean SOME of the visuals are truly keeping up with the graphic style entirely;\n- voice acting: Klara is rather nicely acted, a nice voice to listen to actually;\n\nCON'S\n\n- game content and inherently its length: are you kidding me??? The game is made out of maybe not even 10 rooms! And some of them are only used as passage from an area to the other, while other contains just a note and nothing else!\n- story: the plot is almost entirely unfold through handwritten notes over and over AND over again. If that wasnt enough, they're just an image and therefore the font can't even scale up to proportion, and stays awfully small.\n- puzzles: all of the puzzles are just a joke. They take seriously no time at all to figure out, and often you're even told plainly what to do. They're not even puzzles!\n- some drawings: i chuckled as i saw Doctor's Wolf body. It has so many issues...and Belladonna isnt truly well drawn either.\n- animations: oh my freaking god. Klara literally fluctuates and has no interaction whatsoever with the surroundings.\n- overall lack of polish and care: room transitions carrying the description "exit" or "to the next room", truly short soundtrack looping over and over, lack of basic interaction.\n- the ABRUPT ending. There's not even a cinematic at the end. Just a colorful screen with an "END" sign so you get it, at least....\n\nIn conclusion: this game was either not completely taken care of or maybe it was completed in a rush. As the story stands, it's pretty much uncompleted and feels more of a demo rather than a complete game.","May 5","false","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And not unlike the protagonist of Belladonna, they didn’t stay dead forever. In a sea of modern adventures that eschew traditional puzzles in favor of character development and moral choices, I was interested in tackling a traditional point-and-click adventure game. Especially one with a horror aesthetic.\n\nBelladonna’s influences become obvious very early on. We start our game on a slab in a laboratory, suffering from amnesia, of course. We are a reanimated corpse and our goal is to piece together the events that lead to our initial demise. So you can see how Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein plays a key role in the creation of this game, even before the game clumsily makes a reference to her within the first five minutes.\n\nThe laboratory we’re in happens to be housed inside the dungeon of a castle, occupied by Dr. Wolfram von Trauerschloss. Now if that name doesn’t sound silly to you, it’s probably because you don’t speak German, because “Trauerschloss” literally translates to “Mourning Castle”. So you can see why this was one of the early warning signs about this title, for me at least. The good doctor, true to his inspiration, tinkers with the elements of life to bring back recently deceased organisms.\n\nUnfortunately, we don’t really see him do that. You see, Belladonna is more of an investigative story than one we’re directly involved with. We’re here to run around the castle, looking for clues and objects to solve puzzles and uncover what actually happened. That means, we’ll be collecting a handful of journal entries that explain to us the events and character motivations. It’s a rather clumsy attempt at delivering a story, mostly relying on exposition instead of actual story development. The problem with this however is, besides being a rather weak writing tool, that a lot of what we’re reading easily foreshadows upcoming revelations. This makes the story seem to be a paint-by-numbers affair, which it actually is, and does little to engage the player.\n\nThis is only further exacerbated by the fact that almost every interaction with this world seems to yield a “funny” response from our main character. The game obviously follows the example made by the old LucasArts games, but unfortunately it undermines the gothic horror atmosphere the rest of the game wants to invoke. And the reason I put “funny” in quotation marks is because the humor constantly falls flat. Besides, this isn’t a funny story, none of the elements are amusing at all. This is a story about personal loss, about tragedy, interpersonal relationships, envy and madness. Disconnected, sarcastic humor doesn’t really fit well when contrasted with the serious nature of its themes.\n\nThis wouldn’t be a problem in most other games where gameplay is king, but unfortunately, adventure games rarely contain any gameplay outside of inventory management. If I’ve counted correctly, there are maybe 4 or 5 puzzles you have to solve, most of which have solutions that are immediately obvious to anyone playing. Inventory management is very basic, you can combine two objects in order to solve puzzles with the resulting combinations. And if that weren’t enough, the constant vocalizations of our protagonist makes the solutions even more obvious. We’re rarely required to get creative or think outside the box.\n\nThe only aspect that registered positively with me was the visual presentation. We find ourselves in a lovingly designed, very detailed environment that manages to give the game some semblance of a gothic horror atmosphere. And the music helps to underline that. But unfortunately, this is largely undone by the aforementioned tonal discrepancies between the world we’re in and the theoretical gravitas of the story, and the lighthearted nature of the simplistically written dialogue.\n\nNow some of you might be perplexed by the low number of puzzles presented to us and ask how long this journey through Belladonna actually takes. And to be perfectly blunt, it takes less than an hour and 30 minutes. It’s a very short affair with no secrets, and the fact that the story is entirely linear also means that there’s literally no replay value.\n\nSo at this point, the only thing I can say is that, in spite of its beautiful visuals and nice soundtrack, the game unfortunately doesn’t manage to capture the charm of popular point-and-click adventure games. The story would’ve had potential if it would’ve focused more on the more polarizing and grotesque elements in there, but in this state, you’re probably better off watching the Universal version of Frankenstein. Or if you like a bit more humor in your horror, why not go for Re-Animator instead? Because in the end, you’re about as passive in Belladonna as you are while watching a movie.","August 5, 2015","false","1.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","2"

The poor dear takes on the role of the monster in this point & click spin on the tale of Frankenstein, and her sunny outlook isn't the only twist in store. Venturing through the castle, you collect notes from the doctor and his wife, revealing a morbid little story between them. There are a handful of inventory items to scrounge up to solve a smaller handful of puzzles, as well as some awkwardly-voiced dialogue to enjoy.\n\n...And that's it. The game is 30 minutes long. I struggled a bit with whether I thought it was worth it, and in the end I decided it was. The animation is not much past Flash level but the art is clean and the look of the castle is a stark modern gothic that I haven't really seen elsewhere. The twists are interesting, and I like where the story ends up, though the conclusion itself is extremely abrupt. You wouldn't lose much watching a let's play of Belladonna, but it's a fine little adventure game to keep you busy between meatier offerings.","October 20, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/351340/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2517 products in account","Belladonna is a strange game, although at about an hour of play time one should really call it a 'short'. It assumes the guise of a typical point-and-click adventure game, but the puzzles are much too easy and I spent as much time reading the in-game 'letters' (journal pages) as I did playing the game. I guess it's best described as a cross between a visual novella and a short adventure game. Regardless of how one might best categorise it, I found it somewhat lacking at the end, and it left me thinking, "Now what?"\n\nThe plot is interesting, very much like Frankenstein, as you will already have gathered from the Steam game page's description, but isn't followed through to a satisfying resolution. It's almost as if the developers ran out of time and finished it before they'd really got into their stride. Certainly in the short timeframe in which you'll play the game -- it took me 67 minutes to complete the game; the rest of my Steam-reported game time is idling for the remainder of the trading cards -- there's no opportunity for in-depth character development or anything but the most obvious plotline.\n\nThe graphics are good: cartoony, with an attractive visual style reminiscent of many point-and-click adventure games. The main character is reasonably well animated and the title screen is particularly attractive. The few still images present in the game are well done as well.\n\nSound is so-so. Music is good and sets the mood for the game. Voices are not so good. Or rather, they're okay, but don't fit the characters at all well. The main character sounds like a well-spoken, but somewhat pretentious American teen, whereas the other voice (yes, there are only two in the game) is a bit mumbly and not so well spoken. Given the roles they are meant to represent, the voices really don't fit.\n\nSo, overall, I was disappointed by Belladonna.

Yet, after only a few minutes of play, I got hooked by the backstory, explained by notes scattered here and there in an obvious way, which makes them easy to spot, which is a good thing so you don't miss any and can discover the intrigue unfloding in the right order, with the intended tension.\nIn the end, I completed the game in one session, delaying my sleep for as long as possible, wanting to know what the next note would reveal about the characters. The puzzles are fairly easy, and that's not a bad thing in my opinion, you are not stuck in one place for too long and you can enjoy the story without being frustrated.\nNo achievements sadly, but the game comes with trading cards.\nI highly recommend that title, especially for this price.

Well, alright, it's more fair to say that the acting is completely out of place for this setting, and the same goes for the script itself.  "This oil looks expensive.  Let's waste it!"  No.\nThe music is... fine, until it decides something dramatic happened.\nThe story itself is fairly good until you reach the climax, after which it's all downhill.\nI can say that the background art is good.  The gothic style is very well done, but unfortunately there is pixel hunting to be done for some of the necessary items, which is never fun.\nThe game is short, only 70 minutes for me without stopping, even when I clicked everything I could find, as I always do for P&C games.\n\nI hate writing bad reviews.

Things should have ended at a particular cut-scene and not continued into the final, macabre fetch quest ultimately leading to an unfulfilling and abrupt ending.

But be warned, it is -short-. I've just completed it whilst at work in a few hours (which means that time includes interruptions). The 'puzzles' are easy, and your antagonist actually explains most of what to look for herself.\n\nThat said, the artwork is beautiful, the story is complex and well written and you really do find yourself caring for the characters, even if by the end you're a little unsettled by the whole thing. I got the impression that this could have been increased for multiple endings/different finales - but perhaps that was just me.\n\nAll in all, well worth a play through, perhaps even more than once with a bit of time between. I'd recommend if you like dark stories and a bit of mystery.","October 28, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are point and click puzzles, but to anyone who plays point and clicks, they pose no real obstacle. Anyway, the journals tell an interesting Frankenstein story that I would pay $1 or so for. I bought the game at $0.50, so at least I feel I got my money's worth.\n\nAfter you finish reading the romantic horror story depicted in the journal, and wishing there was more story to read, the game takes a hard left turn to making a horrific undead army of mad science. The sudden tone shift is jarring. And then the sequence lasts barely 15 minutes, just long enough to lose the earlier focus, but not long enough to deal with the repercussions of such thinking.\n\nFor the most part, I don't recommend the game due to its lack of focus and short run time. But if you're bored and it's on sale, it's not the worst thing you could buy.","January 29","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are no "real" puzzles to solve, but there's exploration and commentary from the protagonist. The nods to literary greats like Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe were lovely, especially for bookworms like me! (There's also a character who is extremely reminiscent of the Bride of Frankenstein.)\n\nThe history and character information are fleshed out via journal pages/letters that you find while exploring. Each story is intriguing, with maybe one or two unexpected, little twists. While the style of the fonts were pretty, they were sometimes hard to read, but even I -- with glasses several years old -- read them just fine.\n\nThe music went well with the art style, and I appreciated some of the more dramatic moments. The voice acting was pretty good, not over-the-top or cheesy at all. Mechanics were easy and intuitive.\n\nOverall, this is a great game for someone interested in a more casual point-and-click experience with a good amount of storyline. A bit short, but more than worth it for a sale price.","January 29","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Had I payed full price I'd be very angry right now. I love point and click games and the art style is lovely but this game is simply not worth full price. It took me an hour to beat and that's only because I got stuck and had to wander for a bit (didn't examine one of the rooms thoroughly enough).\n\nThere were also no puzzles to solve which I could forgive had the story been better. It starts off interesting as there's a little mystery in who you are but then it kind of just fizzles. I would even suggest that the ending wouldn't be so bad if it were one a few options for endings? Not every game needs multiple endings to be good but I feel this one would benefit from it.\n\nI did still basically enjoy my time spent but again, only because I got it on sale.\n\n\n*MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS BELOW*\n\n\nTo be more specific, while I understand Belladonna's actions come from a place of grief, she's still a murderer and I had no desire to help her. (I also hate that I was forced to kill the cat, wtf?) I may have gotten behind her choice to build what is basically a zombie army had the game explored her reasoning more thoroughly but it seems like she's working out of vengeance and a desire to prove a point? Why no qualms about using Lucas's brain? Speaking of Lucas, I thought he was basically a baby when he died so what use would his brain be? Why can't Karla talk her out of it?\n\nReturning to my point of potential multiple endings, none of my questions were answered but they could be if there were multiple endings. One where you agree with Belladonna, one where you don't and leave/talk her out of her plans, and maybe one where you don't agree but can't talk her out of her plans and so you just wait for her to run down and throw her key in a lake or something. Seriously, this game has a lot of potential but basically feels unfinished especially since there's nothing else to do in the form of puzzles/hidden object areas that usually accompany point and clicks.","January 30","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If there is ever a way to define a "Short Story" in  video game form, a screenshot of this game will be right there, illustrating the definition, since one sitting is all that it takes to finish it. as of this writing, I had logged only 1.4 hours into the game  (probably going to add a bit more, since there is still one item to get).\n\nThat, is at the same time its best and worse feature.\n\nIf you consider this game a short story, its for the best. Its a small tale of lost love and love beyond death. there is no big developments or big twists. you character is the center of the narrative and uncovering what happened to you makes the story goes foward. small as a short tale should be.\n\n\nBut, specially because of the whole inspiration from Frankenstein, you can't help to wonder what if the developers decided to do a Novel instead of a short story. what if we could see each and every detail of how that final illustration came to be. what if there was more! in that regard, being so short takes from the enjoyment, specially if you consider most playthroughs are supposed to last more than 1 hour.\n\nother than that, the game tells too much instead of showing, but that is a problem even with AAA games out there. being a bit heavy on exposition does makes to comparisson to a short story or novel stronger tough.\n\non the sound department, its excelent. the soundtrack does convey the right mood at the right time. perfect. nothing much to add.\n\nGraphicswise, its competent.

Not the longest game around.\n-There is no volume control for the game, you have to adjust the volume on your computer itself.\n-During the final item hunt, I knew what I needed to get and how to get in there, what the game doesn't allow is for that to happen unless you talk to the character who gave you the quest to trigger it. A bit stupid but that took me a bit to figure out on run 1.\n\nBut what this game has too is some nice art and while cheesy with some dialogue, I did enjoy the fact 2/3's of the TINY cast were bi/pan and a lesbian.

My main problem really is that this game walks right up to the very edge of compelling narratives and then dismisses them and moves on. A character muses on a moral quandry that would make for a really interesting turn in the game, twice, and then just dismisses them. There is a vague reason for it in the narrative, but given the short playtime, it's frustrating that interesting content is teased but never delivered.\n\nAlso, given that the main character is a reanimated corpse, I'm not sure if the voice acting was well done or a bit off. Could have totally been intentional.\n\nA less important issue is that the game has 7 trading cards, but playing this through to 100% completion took me a little under one hour. With no more content to see, I just have to leave this running in the background as I wait for the rest of the cards. A bit troublesome, but not so much as to take away from the Frankenstien inspired narrative.\n\nI wouldn't pay $7 for it, but given I grabbed it at a steep discount, it was worth it.","June 3","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
