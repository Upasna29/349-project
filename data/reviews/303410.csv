Even games from the mid 90s had better model animations, back when the whole 3D thing was new.\n\nOnce you try to get out of your house (starting point) you'll notice loading times are higher than most AAA games. Skyrim with a bunch of mods loaded faster for me.\n\nCan't talk a lot about the actual mechanics of the game or the story, but the little I saw was not promising.\n\nDevs should provide a minimum quality before selling their (finished) game.\n\nAs I was going to post the review I saw the game is from the same devs as "Day One: Garry's Incident", one of the most infamous games on Steam. !! DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME !!.","July 9, 2014","false","1.3"," 158 of 170 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","158","170","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ForklifterMatt/recommended/303410/","ForklifterMatt","ForklifterMatt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ForklifterMatt/","360 products in account","Dysan the Shapeshifter (aka Dungeon Gate) is an open-world RPG set in a dull fantasy world with dull characters and a dull story. It fails in almost every regard except that it has a great soundtrack and great ideas behind shapeshifting.\n\nGraphically, the game looks like ♥♥♥♥. There is nothing good about it. Horrible character models roam around horribly textured environments with a bland art style, giving out unoriginal side quests.\n\nGameplay is a mixed bag of RPG elements and clunky hack & slash combat. Interaction with characters are limited to a wall of text. The RPG elements are very unoriginal and executed quite poorly. The combat is slow, clunky, and a tedious waste of time.\n\nSound design is dreadful. The game makes no effort to make the player feel immersed in this world. The sound of a woman in need of help or the gentle pitter patter of your feet hitting the dirt walkway is done in a very amateur way.\n\nThe story is dull. The opening cutscene takes about 10 minutes and it is about an old man, with poor animation quality, that walks very slowly to do something that isn't explained. Other than that, the protagonist pops up in some random ♥♥♥ town. (I cant comment on the rest of the story because this game is too bad to finish).\n\nFinally to the good stuff. The soundtrack is surprisingly great. It features many upbeat, melancholy, and emotional songs that is masterfully woven into the game. And the gameplay (and story) ideas about shapeshifting are integrated well.\n\nAdditional Thoughts: This game is poorly optimized. I have surpassed the recommended system specs and still get 20 fps on Low settings.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Broken piece of trash that has abysmal graphics, sound, pacing, story, characters, world design, optimization, clunky and reptitive combat, and horrible presentation. The only good thing this game has is a great soundtrack and an okay idea behind shapeshifting. AVOID THIS GAME LIKE THE PLAGUE EVEN IF YOU GOT IT FOR FREE!!!!","June 6, 2014","false","1.3"," 133 of 162 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","133","162","2","4"

The gameplay is terrible. Fighting mechanics are lost in the great void of nothingness. The story does little to no sense at all, just as does the first quest the game throws at you: "Find a rabbit. To do that speak to a scientist, find a dying chicken and bring it back to the forementioned scientist. Then pull the rabbit out of a cage that is next to the scientist and bring it back to a peasant". Seems legit. The only thing I liked about this game was the "skill tree" potential that got killed by the entire game. Also, the after-death-save-loading-thingy was neat.

I basically played the whole game without using any shapeshifting.\n\n-graphics are bland,blurry,the LOD is seriously awful,models are bad.\n\n-combat sounds are meh,music isn't too bad but there's little variation,also the combat music starts even if you take damage by falling.\n\n-animations are awful,clunky,some skip altogether,jumping is BAD,it'll make jumping puzzles frustrating as hell.\n\n-controls are awful,totally awful,clunky,unresponsive,have fun hammering that spell key 5 times before it finally decides to cast.\n\n-combat is boring when it works (face enemy,smash keyboard hoping it registers),frustrating when it doesn't work. A little elevation will prevent you from hitting enemies,they also get stuck often.\n\n-game balance is pretty bad,most fights are a breeze,a few enemies are too strong overall,stun abilities have a long duration,boss fights are best faced by running around,dodge their attack,cast a spell and then run around some more (waiting for mana) until you can cast again,boring.\n\n-what little story is there makes little to no sense,most stuff isn't really explained,the characters are very vague,their actions make no sense at all.\n\n-woeful game design,unfinished menu,little in the way of tutorials,the load menu doesnt exist,it's an ingame area where you choose a portal bearing the savegame date/time (WHY? WHO thought this was a good idea?). Also,date/time are often hard to read,so good luck loading the right save.\n\nStay away from this,it has no redeeming qualities.","February 13, 2015","false","6.5"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","28","30","0","0"

This game is very very sluggish to respond even under these modest settings, to the point where the game is unplayable.

The controls in moving are clunky and unfun to play.\n\nThe very fact that you can shapeshift is cool, but it has no weight in the world, if you change into a female and run up to a townie he will talk and greet you as if you are in your original male forum.\n\nNot to mention the world is just so darn ugly, it makes me want to change a babies diaper for more colorful scenery.\n\nThis game is not worth any money no matter how much it is on sale.","December 26, 2014","false","0.4"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","22","25","6","0"

I have played games worse than this, figured it would suck worse than a Dysan vacuum cleaner. the game is really nothing to write home about. Graphics are not to Unity capabilities by far. Npc's run around like they drank like 30 energy drinks. It's not terrible but not great either. Needs some work and should of been a early access title. I run a high end pc and it still has its "running in quicksand" moments so probably needs some optimizing or something. now do i recommend this title. well its in the middle of the road but just a slight cat hair above middle of the road so its a recommend, BUT only on a really sweet deal like 99 cents.","May 28, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","9","0","0"
