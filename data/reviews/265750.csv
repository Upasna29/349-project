"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/265750/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMultiplayer-only games are finding themselves in a tricky situation these days now that gamers are expecting a bit more from them. Once upon a time, it was enough to offer an experience specially tailored for a group of friends, but now that multiplayer has become commonplace to the point of being tacked on to most games unnecessarily, multiplayer-only titles are needing to step up their game more than ever. Although Secret Ponchos has blazed onto the scene with hardly any introduction, it does present an interesting, if imperfect, alternative to standard online FPS deathmatches.\n\nWhere Secret Ponchos shines is in its creativity, which especially shows in the character designs. Each outlaw has their own specialty and weapons, leaving it up to you to learn their mechanics and choose which style works best for you. While Kid Red is an easy opener, with his quick-firing pistols and room-clearing sticks of dynamite, veterans of twin-stick shooters may be more welcoming to a character like the Phantom Poncho, whose sawed-off shotgun and whip create a devastating combination in both close-quarters and distant combat.\n\nMore difficult outlaws come in the form of the Matador, whose ranged weapons are slow to fire and reload, but whose melee capabilities can be devastating if she gets close enough to an enemy. Similarly, the Killer uses a revolver with a low firing rate and an extremely lethargic (yet extremely deadly) dagger that requires much more precision than other outlaws. Finally, the Deserter is a tank through and through, bowling over opponents and blowing them away with single shots.\n\nYou’re allowed to create many different outlaws, all of which upgrade separately, and the upgrade system that expands their abilities is actually pretty creative. Players are rewarded a bounty after each match, and after a certain price is reached for your head, you’ll earn a few upgrade points to sink into one of a few categories. Of course, if you perform poorly, your bounty will lessen, leaving you at a disadvantage.\n\nThe combat is similar to your typical twin-stick shooter, albeit with a few twists. Characters can disappear for a few seconds if they take cover behind some scenery, and each is saddled with a small amount of stamina used to roll away from danger that is slow to refill but absolutely necessary for a clean getaway or a successful surprise attack. Outlaws are also outfitted with two distinct weapons, both of which have multiple uses that really allow for tons of improvisation and addictive battles.\n\nThe art style employed by Secret Ponchos is absolutely bursting with personality and color, making each outlaw a unique creation despite the fact that they never speak. The maps that are available, while small, are beautifully detailed, capturing the essence of old westerns perfectly, from decrepit saloons to rundown graveyards. Even if you don’t enjoy anything the gameplay has to offer, you can still appreciate the loving homages to westerns found throughout the game.\n\nOf course, since Secret Ponchos is still a work in progress, it comes with its fair share of issues, especially regarding the balance of the characters. Simply put, some outlaws are overpowered, especially Kid Red. He can fire the most shots in a row, most of which have the chance to stun the target, leaving enemies a pulpy mess in just seconds. Compared to the slower, more powerful characters, Kid Red completely obliterates the competition.\n\nThere’s also a noticeable lack of content, with only a handful of battle modes available as of now. You’ve got your traditional free-for-all, team deathmatch and domination modes, but with only four maps to choose from, things get stale pretty quick. The ability to play locally with split-screen is a great addition, but it does little to add to the replay value.\n\nAs enjoyably intense as Secret Poncho can be, with outlaws diving left and right, firing six-shooters and sticks of dynamite at each other in the middle of a dusty graveyard, it’s still a work in progress that suffers from its unfinished nature. Secret Ponchos is an absolute blast that should definitely make its way into your library when its completed. The upgrades that are being promised could elevate it to a whole new level. Until then, however, it’s a fun title that feels incomplete and short on content.","September 26, 2015","true","38.2"," 78 of 86 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","78","86","2","0"

The game has 4 characters in total in the current version of the game with only a few maps to play in, a practice mode, and 2 multiplayer modes. and I'm pretty sure they will add more as time goes on, but this early version (first public version) of the game and it feels great and my purchase is in good hands. From what i can see there will be single-player, split screen gameplay, and maybe coop. But at the moment, if you won't be satisfied with only multiplayer, i'd advise to wait a month or two, but if you don't mind it then go right ahead and get it, it doesn't seem that buggy and fun to play honestly. Plus the art style and the music are really awesome in this game that gives you a feeling of the old west in a cartoon-ish way. Also, these guys are 'good guys devs' , they have PS4 Dual Shock 4 Support for the game on PC. Massive plus.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/dhri5MxDs6I\n\nWill update when the coop mode / split-screen mode is out, and when the KB/M controls are out.\n\nUPDATE: From what the developers are saying, the 'Coop' is team vs. team multiplayer, there is no coop where you and your friend play against AI in a horde mode or single-player. That's really bad and false advertising if that is actually the case.\n\nThe developers see 'coop' as a competitive team vs. team multiplayer as the main definition of the term 'coop' , and such, they do not have the coop that we know as player vs. AI, but they also said that they are not rulling that out, at the moment they are focusing on the multiplayer side of things until launch and may add a singleplayer to the game with a probability of adding team vs. AI.\n\nDevs took the advice and feedback, and will hopefully remove the coop tag from the store page, and will update when it's actually removed (It's removed :) ). So when they do actually add coop, first of all that would be great, secondly then they would add the coop tag in the game's store page. Hurray for polite and constructive criticism.\n\nMore info here:  KSalue[www.ksalue.com]","June 13, 2014","true","4.1"," 59 of 75 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","59","75","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KantVersusHume/recommended/265750/","KantVersusHume","KantVersusHume","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KantVersusHume/","456 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYou Just Come Try and Shoot Me...Pardner.\n\nAnd, you'll probably succeed, but, whether you drop me or I drop you, or Ghin drops all of us simultaneously, you will have a lot of fun.\n\nLet's get down to brass tacks for a moment.  Win or lose, you will have fun.  That is what gaming is about, having fun.  This is competitive, tense, immersive, with lovingly handcrafted visual and audio ambiance; sometimes you will be overwhelmingly outmatched and other times you will have just about the optimal balance of play.  At times, you will pull off the perfect set of moves, in the perfect rhythm and feel like you just entered the Matrix--so under control and automatic, not thinking, just doing, and it's utterly satisfying--"no mind".  Other times you will enter freak-out mode, pumping buttons on your controls with all the deftness and poise of a hyperactive three year old,  listening to the repetitive, panicky dry firing of the empty chamber of your gun, about as able to push the "Reload" button for your weapons as you are capable of doing calculus speedily on an abacus, because you have straight lost your cool.  Probably multiple times in the same game.\n\nIn all cases, it will be fun.\n\n\n\nYou start off with a quick tutorial which acquaints you with the basic gameplay controls.  There is enough variety of control here that you can truly develop skillful, strategic methods of play with the character(s) that you choose to play.  Evading is as essential as attacking in order to win, as is taking cover, for protection as well as stealth, and for quicker stamina regeneration and reloading of your weapons (be careful just where you take cover, though).  Each character has primary and secondary weapons, which are quickly switchable, to go along with special attacks.\n\nIn Practice, you can play with or without AI active, and you may choose to play any character.  This is very useful for initially learning the basics and then later the timing and rhythm of the more advanced combinations you dream up and may wish to employ, first in a stress free environment and later under fire and on the move.  Also, it's a great place to warm up before you jump into multiplayer matches.\n\nWhile the basic controls are simple to learn, the more time you put into playing will reward you with greater adeptness in style and skill.  You'll come to appreciate how thoughtfully tuned the game mechanics are. The quality responsiveness of the core skills will allow you to play creatively.  As you master a character, and find the right combinations to counter your competitor's character and style of play, you'll smile at the versatility.\n\n\n\nWhen you are ready, jump into multiplayer, make a character, and join Rookie mode or Ranked mode.  In Rookie mode you can play 2v2 matches against other people of any rank, with and against low level AI, or a mix of both.  Games can be played in many different environments and under a variety of game winning conditions.  The environments and winning conditions can be chosen or left to randomly occur.\n\nMatches consist of timed games, where death leads to a respawn and the relative death count determines the winning team, one-off death-matches, where the last team to have a member standing wins the round, needing two to three victorious rounds to win the game, and free-for-alls, where healing, stamina regeneration, and speed-boosts are available in limited but respawning supply, leading to the possibility for games of varying length depending upon the skills of those playing.\n\nWhen you finish, you are awarded or deducted value to your character in the form of a bounty in dollars.  Every match, you have something on the line, which increases the enjoyable tension.  As you gain a higher bounty, you will reach higher ranks in your character, and be awarded skill points to distribute amongst a number of attributes affecting how your character plays.  These skill points can be redistributed before every match, allowing you to greatly alter how your character performs.   If you find yourself struggling against a particular type of opponent, tweaking your skills can absolutely turn the tide.\n\nYou can gain a bounty toward progressing in the lower ranks in Rookie matches, but after you reach "Outlaw", you will need to compete in ranked matches to further bounty progress.\n\nDon't worry if you find yourself in matches against others of higher rank.  The more of an underdog you are, the more bounty you can gain just for successfully doing damage, winning a round, or winning the match, whereas you will make much lower bounties against opponents lower than yourself.  You may still gain some bounty in a loss to a higher ranked character, or you may gain a huge bounty should you win.\n\nA lower ranked character can compete with much higher ranked characters if you have learned how to play in general and explore the different methods in which you can play a particular character.   The more you play, the better you will get, and the more complex your style of play will become.\n\nI cannot stress this enough.  The control methods and mechanics are well thought out and masterfully executed.  Both tactics and strategy are well rewarded because of this.  Skillpoints matter, but skill at play matters more.\n\nAnd everything counts.\n\nWaste your stamina?    You'll regret it and learn not to.\n\nDon't reload that millisecond you have to gain a couple of bullets back in your chamber?      You'll learn when you are one bullet short in an epic, game-ending, side-winding showdown, as both of you decide you've been forced to take cover just one too many times and it's time to put a round to bed.\n\nThink you've figured out how to beat a certain type of character every time?    You'll learn better.  Don't be surprised to find different individuals playing a character very skillfully in completely different styles.  And the synergies between player tandems that can be exploited add even more creativity to each character skillset and game.\n\nFinally, Secret Ponchos is both KB/M and Gamepad controllable, with advantages to each.  As you might expect with a twin stick shooter, KB/M enjoys a natural advantage in aiming precision, whereas character movement and control is innately more fluid with the controller.  I am ready for my Steam controller to arrive.  This should be the perfect game to demonstrate its capabilities.\n\nBe you good, bad, or ugly, grab a fistful of dollars, and buy Secret Ponchos. For a few dollars more, order a Steam controller.  It should lead to a uniquely enjoyable gaming experience.","September 4, 2015","true","102.1"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","40","45","11","0"

The game honestly needs more exposure to flourish!\n\nWhen I think of this game I think of a famous MOBA like Riot's League of Legends, it started out with a group of developers that were just hungry to work on their game, and now it is the most-played PC game worldwide! Why can't Secret Ponchos be one of those titles?\nIn the words of Switchblade Monkeys (the developers): "Fighting mechanics that use quick twitch reflexes, careful timing, and precision. Picture a split second dive roll behind cover, then rushing a pair of enemies guns blazing as you stun one and gun down the other. Secret Ponchos was not built as a MOBA, but as a fighting game that supports fast paced group combat. "\n\n\nI rate this original upcoming masterpiece a 10/10 and it doesn't burn a whole on your wallet either!            Questions        Answers                Will there be more characters (Outlaws) anytime soon?        Yes.                Are there achievements to collect?        Yes, and more on it's way.                Can I whip another player?        Why, yes of course!\nFrequently updated?        Yes                Do the developers care about the community?

This game's visual style is magnificent but i have to say the music is just top notch. For an indie title like this the soundtracks have an incredible vibe to them and they surely live up to the western theme. Cannot repeat it enough, the music is pure high quality candy for the ears and brain. I would even go so far and say that the soundtracks used in this game are better than most triple A titles nowadays.\nThe core gameplay mechanic is just fantastic, its fast paced pvp action where u challenge yourself all the time and try to perfect your moves with a character. You definitely will need good reflexes or otherwise you might get rekt really hard. Other than that, i dont see any noteworthy negative aspects except that its playerbase needs to grow. A few bugs here and there but thats ok, they get fixed fast, since the devs seem to work with their heart on this game and thats what makes it even better. You get the best stuff possible from the devs. Its rare to see this type of relationship between a game and its developers, so definitely worth supporting these guys.

Also the importance of perk points (points you get while levelling up to improve your outlaws stats) has been reduced massively so even a player with the lowest rank has a chance against players with the highest rank. Additionally a tutorial has been added and an in game lobby chat where new players can e.g. ask more experienced players for tips.\nAnother really good thing about this game is that it is really easy to communicate with the devs. They stream Secret Ponchos weekly and talk with the community about changes and future plans on the live stream.\nThe gameplay is really competitive. The art style and the music are just awesome. So just give the game a shot (whether it will be with Deserters bayonet or The Killers revolver ;) ).\nSee you out there in Lonetree :D\n\nUpdate: All the new content that has been added in the Most Wanted Edition makes this game even better and I think everyone should be able to find an outlaw that fits his playstyle because there are 10 unique outlaws now.","June 3, 2015","true","129.8"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","1"

It seems like a typical twin stick shooter and in many ways, it is, it's meaty though, very meaty, the guns feel good, sound good, feels tight. You'll be dodging, shootan and using your special weapon to try and get kills. Reloading usually takes time, so you must be aware of how many shots you've got left otherwise you could be left stuck in a crowd with no bullets. Taking cover allows you to reload faster, but not many people take cover surprisingly.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, it's a highly skilled twin-stick multiplayer deathmatch, there's lots of tactics involved and you can turn any bad situation around. It just... feels good to play, it has a lot of potential as an early access game.","June 14, 2014","true","6.4"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","28","40","0","0"

I do NOT like top-downs but somehow this game has bypassed my loathing for the camera angle and become one of the most fun and smoothest games I have played. There is many Outlaws to choose from that you can make your own with a name, a skin, and even their stats are upgradable to fit the playstyle you mainly identify with, as well as you can make as many characters as you want to switch back and forth from.\n\nThis game currently has 2 main modes, Competitive and Arcade, Competitive you can either play 3v3 for a fun fast-paced teamfight or a more personal 1v1 brawl, and somehow this game manages to make you grin and have fun even when you are losing terribly.\n\nNow, the game isn't all rainbows in it's current state as it does take a little bit to find matches for some people, and also the party system can be iffy at times but this is NO issue as if you go to the community steam chat (which is linked inside of the game for fast access), the devs are sitting in the chatroom listening to every issue you may have, giving suggestions on how to fix your issues, answering your questions, and even fixing problems WHILE they have a nice chat with everyone! I have not seen a SINGLE game be this involved with the community but it definitely gives them huge bonus points with me!\n\nThe game is amazing and frankly quite cheap, I say take a try at it as this is generally a loved game, and if you're scared about the matchmaking issues, have no worry as they will be fixed very soon! 11/10 game for sure from me!","December 14, 2015","true","2.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orangekun/recommended/265750/","orangekun","Naughty Bear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orangekun/","505 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSaw this game for the very first time at the Indie showcase at EVO.  Wasn't sure what to make of it.\n\nI got the chance to speak w/ the devs of Secret Ponchos and they explained it to me.\n\nEveryone seems to be trying to get into the MOBA scene these days.  Hell, even Blizzard is.  When it comes to the fighting game scene, new titles come and go; but, its the classic titles/franchises that withstand the test of time.\n\nSecret Ponchos realizes that there are elements from these genres that work well together, creating a blend of gameplay that puts it's foot in a wide area of appeal when it comes to gamers, casual, fun-seeking, hardcore, or just plain competitive.\n\nBut, what is it exactly?\n\nWell, its hard to call it one thing.  I'd like to just say its fun; but that doesn't say much now does it? xD\n\n- It is a spaghetti-western themed action-based twitch shooter.\n\n- Its a multiplayer game, for sure.\n\n- It utilizes an isometric view, used in action games and mobas like Diablo, Torchlight, League of Legends, and DOTA 2.\n\n- It features a roster of widely different, but balanced characters, known as Outlaws.\n\n- It features several game modes that allow the player to choose whether they'd prefer to have a classic 1v1 duel or a team based battle or maybe you just want all-out chaos with an 8 player free for all.\n- Team battles can be 2v2 or 3v3\n- Team battles can be played as deathmatch, with whoever is the last man standing wins for his/her team.\nOR, team battles can play in Domination to see which team can outkill their opponents.\n\n- Outlaws are able to use a dodge roll to evade enemy attacks and put distance between them to gain better positioning or a hasty retreat.\n- Outlaws can also take cover behind objects to hide themselves or shield themselves from attacks.\n- Each character/Outlaw has a different way of fighting that feels unique to them and they all employ 2 weapons, each with primary and secondary attacks, that can be switched back and forth with ease.\n- Having 2 different weapons, with each having 2 different ways of attacking adds an intriguing amount of depth and strategy to the combat; especially during team battles.\n\nMy Outlaw employed a Gatling Gun as his primary and could utilize a ground slam that let out an aoe stun effect that enveloped a small radius around me.  For my seconday weapon, he possessed a Molotov Cocktail which he could throw and have it explode in an area, giving off an AOE burn effect to anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in it.  It also is able to be used as a close range deterrant by igniting the ground around you, putting flames between you and anyone wanting to get close.\n\nHaving these differing ways to attack and defend gives the feeling that its more than just "see person, shoot person".  Its about positioning, defending yourself, capitalizing on your opponents mistakes and knowing when to strike.  The fundamentals of MOBAs are good strategies to use in this game.\n\n- Don't overextend yourself.   Be aggressive, but not reckless.  Stay with your team.  If you die, your team is at a disadvantage. etc. etc. etc.\n\nThe community is small, but is fun, friendly, helpful, and approachable.  The devs also enjoy playing the game they made and are easily accessible.  They have a great game here and it can only grow from here.\n\nIt is worth every penny and I look forward to playing it for the rest of early access and beyond release.","July 25, 2015","true","5.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

I guess the Steam free weekend is to combat that problem, but at the first day of the free weekend, I still have troubles finding a game.\n- Balance is non existant. But this might not be the game's fault but the low playercount's, as the Steamspy statistics show.\n- This is only my own opinion but if the game had higher damage and scattered healing stations (it could be wells or travelling doctors to fit the aesthetic)\n- There are some weird angles that you can't see where you are or where you're aiming at.\n- A simple color change to aiming line, making it bright red instead of faded black would drastically improve playability.\n- More objective based modes instead of deathmatch or domination would improve the tactical side of things.\n- Steam workshop for characters and maps could do wonders to increase the community forming and involvement alongside with cosmetic drops and marketplace instead of buying skins directly from the developer.\n- There is no form for team chat.\n\nThis game is not good enough right now, but there are some simple changes that could make it my go to multiplayer game, I hope the developers continue developing and not be downhearted by low player count.\n\nI am recommending you all this game as it is now free and if you want to continue playing, it's cheap enough. I wish they also put 4-pack to the sale so it would see a greater increase in population.\n\nEdit after couple more hours: The game certainly has enough depth and gets better when you start playing with the guys that use their outlaws creatively.

Every night I have to find players I know that play the game and gather them at 8pm pst to see if we can round up 4 to play. I just wish there was enough to just hop on and join at any time of day, but unfortunately these are the problems of an alpha or beta or whatever.\n\n\nBUT, that is the only major downside to it. There are so many positives to this game, I would still give it 5/5 if I could. The characters, the artwork, the sound, the animations, the controls....all have such depth and you can feel a backstory to them that the developers have bled into the game.\n\nAs for my grievance, the developers hold a twitch stream where you can play them and also partake in dialog with them about questions you have or suggestions you bring to the table. From these meetings, I have gained an in depth understanding of their direction of where they want to take the game, the reasoning behind their decisions, and the motivation behind their work. Some games on steam that are still in develop like Secret Ponchos just take your money and pooping a game on your hard drive, but unlike those games, Secret Ponchos has such a solid foundation and it's easy to see the developers have the passion to make this one of the best games of 2015.\n\nFeel free to add me if you wish to get the game and want to join up with the regular players of the game during devlopment.","October 27, 2014","true","62.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

They confirmed new characters and skins will be added in the future as DLC, but no player will have an advantage by spending more money in the game. There's even a chance we'll have every character unlocked on practice mode, so we can try before we buy and who doesn't love that?\n\n♥ Controller + Mouse and Keyboard SupportJust pick what you prefer and rebind if needed!\n\n♥ Constant UpdatesCurrently, they'll release major content updates every week until full release, can't wait!\n\n♥ SupportFor an indie studio, they are freaking amazing. You can see 3 employees constantly active in the group chat answering questions and setting up matches to play with everyone.\n\n♥ CommunityRight now it's honestly very small, but solid. We meet up every night to play, discuss and welcome new players. I've personally invited at least 10 players to the group in just a few days after the June 02 update to spread the word even more.\n\n☹ BalanceThe game still needs some balancing tweaks so any character can win against the rest with enough practice. After trying the game for the first time 10 months ago, this has been greatly improved. Developers are open to feedback and constantly tweaking the characters, so I think having a balanced game on release is possible.\n\n☹ AnimationsStill needs improvement. Being a competitive multiplayer game, this needs to be especially polished. I can feel the animations are sloppy sometimes and the gameplay doesn't have the flow it should have. The game isn't finished yet, so I can understand this and hope it's one of their priorities.\n\nTL;DR Highly recommened, see you at the gun fight!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/recommended/265750/","liberteer","Fißtechead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/","503 products in account",""On that October night back in 1876, he sold his soul to a devil trapped in a bottle of cheap whiskey. He did it right there. See the Raven's crossroad? Yes, right there. And even now, years later, you can hear him shriek in cold, windy nights. His body is long gone. That scarred emotionless face turned to dust. Those milky eyes dried up like the rivers down south. Yet his soul screams for blood. You know why, son? Because the devil comes for his own. He never forgets, he never forgives. He reaps."\n\nYup, that's the story of Dragoja. He was a local blacksmith until his woman and daughter got ♥♥♥♥♥ by Heartless Willy. Crucified on a cross made of insanity and love, Dragoja swore he will revenge his family.\n\nNow, this is not the story of Secret Ponchos, an ultra skill based PVP game that's free to try for the next 3 days. This is a story I've made up, inspired by details, emotions and art of Secret Ponchos.\n\nIn the vein of all great spaghetti westerns, Secret Ponchos is not for everyone. It is made for tough as nail gamers. It doesn't forgive nor hold your hand. Isometric camera will remind you of MOBAs, but there's nothing 'mobish' about it. There are no towers to shot at. You will control your character with WASD. You will aim and shoot with your mouse, slowly reload with R, change weapon with Q, dash with Shift and hide behind the covers with CTRL. That's it. No upgrades, no magic potions. Your weapons have range, you need to reload them manually and where you point your cursor, that's where your bullets will tear the flesh or buzz through the air.\n\nShooting and winning in this game is extremely satisfying. Seeing your enemy fall down in slow motion after you win the match is the ultimate reward and testament to your skills. When your opponents says "GG" in this one, it's not a polite way to end a match - it's a token of respect. Real gunslingers respect each other, either in victory or defeat.\n\nYou start your reign (or shame) in Secret Ponchos by creating your character. You can pick between 10 characters (and more on their way, as devs say on their website). Each of these can be additionally customized in the fields of fire rate, stamina, damage and health. Once you create your character, get accustomed to his/her weapons in tutorial and arcade offline modes before you take on the online crooks. I firmly suggest you do this and recheck your moves list. It is of utmost importance.\n\nWhen you finally decide to step over the line, you will be able to enjoy 1VS1 and 3VS3 showdowns. I simply can't tell which one I like more - 1VS1 feels intimate, it's tense, it makes me crazy excited about every bullet, every miss and especially every hit. 3VS3 is a game of tactics, chaos control and multitasking - there's no time for any kind of breather. Online matches in Secret Ponchos are bringing me all kinds of joy and anger, but never frustration. Addictive gameplay keep you coming back and getting better.\n\nAlthough it seems trivial once you start, as you play more and more, you will start creating advanced tactics in your head. Are you a creeping backstabber or forward lunge lunatic? Soon enough, you will learn to properly dash and plan your shooting up front. Button mashing and not aiming will be the end of you.\n\nPlaying online puts a price on your head and seeing those number roll (think leveling) will really boast your already inflated ego.\n\nSecret Ponchos doesn't stop at having weirdly complex and fun gameplay. The art style presents all the characters as larger-than-life Clint Eastwoods of Secretville. You can see the effort, and Switchblade Monkeys even managed to make stereotypes look over-the-top cool. Music? Music is perfect. It is that kind of Enio Morricone soundtrack that makes you ride the wave of chills from launch til shutdown moment.\n\nThe thing that I don't like are the numbers. Let's face it, Secret Ponchos will make you add unknown people on your friends list in case you want to have a constant source of opponents to match. There are simply not enough players playing it and it's a DAMN SHAME. This game, as many others of our time, is the victim of uncontrolled mass production and gaming community short attention span and believe me, it deserves MORE. That is the only reason why I'm writing this right now. I urge you to try it. After finally trying it this week, after only two matches, it was an instabuy for me, and I usually stay away from these kind of emotions.\n\nWestern didn't feel this good and authentic for a long, long time and winning feels like going second base when you're 13 years old hormone driven lunatic. Yes, that good.\n\n***\n\nHey, you've liked this review? Hated it? It made you buy the game / abandon the idea of buying this game? Super awesome!

The latest update(June 2nd) just released a new character with more to come.

It looks like a traditional MOBA at first glance, but relies heavily on reflex and twitch actions. The game has a lot of character; music, design, and art direction are all executed well, adding a certain level of polish one does not expect. Gameplay rewards a player who can read situations well and coordinate actions with teammates. The classes are all fairly balanced as well, maybe not the case in a 1v1 scenario, but most definitely in a 2v2 scenario.\n\nCurrently the game modes are narrow, and finding a game can sometimes take awhile due to the low population. These issues have not cut into my own enjoyment of the game. The game does have a number of glitches that can become annoying and affect one's performance. I will note that after one day of owning the game patches have corrected several glitches I had been experiencing. The game is not optimized to run on the PC, also. These are all problems that are currently being adressed by the creators of the game.\n\nBuying an early access game is always somewhat terrifying when perusing through Steam's catalog.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gynnit/recommended/265750/","gynnit","Sammage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gynnit/","537 products in account","I've enjoyed this game a great deal over the free week. I've spent a lot of time trying all the different classes and matchups at different skill levels, as well as played with friends. Ultimately I won't be buying the game afterwards, but I've had a great 25-ish hours in the week.\n\nThe good:\n-The game's theme is fantastic, a nice western shooter really tightly put together. Instead of getting a ranking you get a bounty and a wanted poster. All the characters are visually very distinctive, even in their different skins. The maps are typical western tropes - train tracks, a ruined village, a gold mine - all the game would need is a tumbleweed going by to be fully there, but that would be visually quite distracting.\n\n-The music is especially good at setting the scene. It seems to be dynamic, picking up when the action starts up. It's proper showdown music, and totally badass in places. The soundwork makes good pistol ricochet noises, but some concessions are made for gameplay elements - when an arrow crits, it makes a satisfying loud crit sound but not really an arrow sound. One neat gameplay element is there is a character that can blind you with dust - but you still hear their sounds as they move around you. It's just one of the many small things this game lets you use to your advantage.\n\n-The gameplay is pretty well balanced. There are 9 asynchronous classes, and I've played them all to at least 'outlaw' level, where the game opens up and you can play people of higher skill. My experience is that the mastery of the class and the game has always been the deciding factor.\n\n-The game is a blast with friends! There's a lot of room for teamwork or silly strats, or just rp the wild west. The game makes some great moments like a shootout in an abandoned church, or a misfired dynamite blowing your teammates up. The matches are short enough that you can get a bunch of these moments with different people in one sitting, often running into the same people over many matches.\n\n-The community is encouraging. I've come across a few moba players spewing rage at their teammates and lag and the like, or a few people with really racist or offensive names, but for the most part people have been friendly and communicative. You know what everyone likes? Dumb jokes about the wild west and westerns. It seems universal.\n\n-The devs have been really communicative and patient throughout the free week, posting a bunch of fixes and faqs and answering questions in the community chat all week. That's really promising, like if the game gets a following it seems like development will continue.\n\n\nThe bad:\n-The game, while balanced, only really feels balanced at the top end - at lower levels you'll currently find the killer and deserter classes really strong compared to the others. Even at the top end it feels a bit sketchy - I went 2-0 against one of the top 5 players with the killer (with only 10 games under my killer's belt), which I probably shouldn't be able to do playing from a free week. Likewise I got 2-0'd by a deserter after doing twice the damage he did, but I feel that had I played him more I would have found his weakness.\n\n-While I have had a blast over the free weekend, I do worry about the size of the playerbase after it's over. Even over the free weekend I ran into the same people many times (this is likely to do with me queuing in the UK, smaller than america). Is it worth the risk of buying a game that could possibly be empty?\n\n-The game is pretty polished, but there are a few things that bugged me. First and foremost the lack of team chat. In a game where you play as a team, why can't we tactic as a team? So it turned out looking into this that the game did in fact have a team chat - if you /t into speak you can chat with your team. However, this is the only way of doing it and it's completely undocumented - I found out from a buried forum post. There are some menu difficulties too - why do I have to escape out of a chat window? Why does random mode only random 2 modes when there are 3? Why must I leave a party to change class?\n\n-The other thing is the latency and network issues. It's not TOO bad but it makes some things difficult - particularly guns that put you into the hurt animation or whatever, if you're playing someone across the pond you can get violently stunlocked. Projectiles you've clearly dodged end up hitting you, that sort of thing. The game feels like it would be fantastic on a lan where you can all talk with each other and there's no ping issues, but over the wild wild web it suffers a bit.\n\n-There is no punishment for people being abusive or trolling. People can have racist names, teamkill your team (if I didn't mention it anywhere else, this game has friendly fire always on, magicka style), say nasty stuff, with no way of reporting them. Leaving a game costs 300 bounty, which means you can leave early every other game and still keep an even keel on bounty. (I have also lost 300 bounty when the opposing player left the game early in 1v1 sometimes) While the developers are actively working on the game this is fine, but it needs improvement if the playerbase goes critical.\n\nOverall, the game is totally worth your time, I had a blast. It's twitchy, it's strategic, it's funny.","December 19, 2015","true","27.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

So let me discuss the good, the bad and the ugly that this game has to offer.\n\nFirst of all it should be said that the game is a lot of fun, and for that reason alone I can recommend it.  It is challenging, skill based and seems pretty well ballanced. The devs actively engage with the community and are open to suggestions. And contrary to a claim by a certain well known reviewer, the game does have a practice mode where you can try each of the outlaws either in a free for all brawl against 3 AI opponents, or in the same level with said opponents disabled.\n\nNow despite the goodness this game has to offer it is not without its flaws. The settings available at this point in time can be rather lacklustre for some players, and the community is small enough to make matchmaking a bit of a hassle at times, particularly on slow days. The matchmaking issues also mean that it is harder to get teams of around the same skill level, although a recent patch has tried to alleviate that by trying to shuffle (non-premade) teams so that they are more even, rank wise. Still this system isn't always 100% effective, as one of the first matches I played after the patch was implemented shows. Another (rather) experienced player and myself got matched up against a pair of new players.\n\nOverall I recommend you give it a try, though it might take you more than the 2 hours that steam allows for a refund in order to get into the game. If you're worried about the population you can buy the four pack for a few dollars* more, and gift some spare copies to your friends. That way you're at least assured of a few 2v2 matches.\n\n*Or other currencies that don't make for good spagetthi western puns.","October 25, 2015","true","156.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Being a Referee at EVO 2015 decided to take a break and ended up playing this game for hours. This game had people screaming with excitement and suspense. The mechanics are easy to get used to, around 2-3 games. Once you get the mechanics down you can branch from multiple characters to chose from all with their own awesome abilities.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most is the combos you can land with each character. It's not a game where some characters counter others or some are stronger. It is all about skill and how you use your stamina bars. Some one can land a combo without taking any damage while another can miss that combo and end up losing a chunk of their health. The characters are balanced, all are unique, and all have their mechanics to understand and combos.\n\nThis game is by far my top 5 indie/ video game. If you want to play just join the awesome community or seatch for a game. Everyone seems to be friendly here. give it a shot. Im going to buy some extra keys and give away on my streams on Twitch come check it out.","July 24, 2015","true","38.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Featuring a huge cast of colourful and unique "Outlaws" that you can play as each with a very different skill set and playstyle.\nThere is surely an outlaw for everyone to fit their individual preference. At the moment there are 10 outlaws that you can pick with possibly more outlaws in the updates to come.\n\nAt the moment there are several gamemodes and gametypes : Unranked 2v2's, Ranked 1v1's or 3v3's.

The developers have even gone out of their ways to include a chatroom in game that you can access that takes you to a steam group where you can talk with the developers to inform them of any issues you may be facing. The developers are extremely friendly and reactive to community feedback. This is truly one of the few developer teams that I have felt really comfortable with as they are willing to answer and clarify all questions that I had with utmost patience.

Old school gameplay mechanics mean you are relying on skill and reaction time to win. It's\n\nI really enjoy the multiplayer in this game because its really competitive. Each character's unique skillset means a good balance of characters vs. skill on your team could be the difference between winning and losing. If everyone is running melee characters versus the more slower, long range character types it can completely flip the scales of the game. However, there are some people who just find great skill with one or two characters and regardless of what they're up against they've managed to master the art of the twin stick mechanic and own people. There is a great dynamic in place that keeps the game fresh, especially with the varying playstyles you'll find while playing.\n\nThere is most likely a character you'll align with even if you're predominantly an FPS/3rd Person shooter player, and while the twin stick aiming is harder to master than traditional FPS games, it's not an impossible thing to master. Take your time, learn the mechanics, and enjoy the game. It's a great competitive community and I'm really excited to see the next wave of players join in on the fun.\n\nIn short, I recommend the game for the fun casual mp with friends, and the competitive team-based aspect when playing against randoms online.","September 9, 2015","true","6.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Initial impressions I was a bit disappointed because the game appears deceptively simple, but don't let that fool you. More people need to play this game, it's a ton of fun. Once you're in a multiplayer room you'll start finding that the game is VERY addicting! The game itself is polished and stylized in a way that gives it a distinctive flavor and dexterity. It's a snappy fast reacting game.\n\nThe developers are very proactive and will speak with you one on one if you have constructive feedback which is a refreshing take on gaming (I come from experiencing horrible alternatives i.e. Blizzard Entertainment). Some feedback I'd give the developers: After a player has joined a group or party in a public match don't have it disband automatically after a match and rather have people elect to leave. That way you keep people playing without having to reque. Maybe consider chat channels in the title screen to have clan chat or a channel to create games in, talk about strategy, or anything else the community may want to use to connect their experiences in a visible way.\n\nAs far as a message to gamers: Really try this game out, don't let the initial simplicity fool you and give the experience a shot.

Each characters with it's own background and style, they compete for fame as the most dangerous.... and now it's time for you to prove you have what it takes !\n\nGraphics:Cell Shading cartoonish Western Spaghetti is a delight for eyes if you are like me an absolute fan of westerns.\nThe game has a real atmosphere and characters have a lot of charisma. You don't fall into usual clichés and it's a good point, the game has its own personality and it's a real pleasure to fight in Secret Ponchos's levels. Levels are viewed from above and you follow your character the same way, only aiming moves the camera a bit and can be tricky because of some walls. Also menus are clear and simple. Secret Poncho is a very nice looking game if you like cartoons and cell shading.\n\nControls:You can play with keyboard, for the first hours it will be okay.\nBut a gamepad is a must. When in ranked matches where anythings acts in a matter of seconds, playing with sticks and buttons is perfect. Especially because of the fact that you have to swap betweens your weapons/abilities very often.\nIf you have a gaming mouse with side buttons it might be better but i still prefer the gamepad.\nYou have been warned !\n\nMusic:A bit "shy" sometimes, it's of course in the mood of the title. Very nice to ear and doesn't bother you at anytime.\nMaybe more different tracks for menus and more in-game actions impact. A music full of tension when showdowns turns into real duels would have been great !\n\n\nGameplay:Secret Ponchos is a multiplayer arena based action game. Criminals fights each others in differents maps and modes from deathmatch in teams, free for all or domination. Matches are fast but intense, around 5 mins per fights.\n\nYou can play a small tutorial (one tutorial per character would have been great) and an arcade mod to pratice and find your favourite outlaw.\nAnd talking about outlaws every characters has skills and stats, you can open a menu at any time by pressing left arrow to see movements combos and understand how to play them. You can also create as many characters as you want and customize them at your will because every skill point spent can be used on any other stats bars. Experience gain by characters is measured by cash earned after every fights and represent the bounty placed on your outlaw's head.\nEvery titles represents a certain amount of money and determines what kind of player you will find in ranked matches.\nYou can still fight in unranked matches but results still affect your progress.\n\nThe game is extremely hard and every encounter will be a challenge. You have to take cover, dodge, watch your allies to prevent that your skills wont incapacitate them, reload your weapons or even check your abilities cooldowns. Many factor makes combats very dynamics and requires a lot... A LOT of skill to bring sufficient pleasure.\nFirst times are though especially if you are like me, a complete noob and unable to check character's movements menu before first online matches....\nBut one of the most interresting feature in Secret Poncho is a presence of lines of sights and aiming. You can flank players if you crawl behind covers or when you have to draw your weapon, you will see on the ground your range and the appropriate way your ammo will follow. Your enemy can see it too wich makes fights really quick and tight !\n\nLife Span:10 outlaws. 8 Alternate Skins. Tons of titles/ achievements to grind. Very hard characters to master. Very hard maps to master (around 10 for the moment and all excellent). 3 different modes from deathmatch, free for all or domination, i would like to see more modes and maybe objective based ones (with so much content allready in the game, it's completely possible to add such modes... only players feedback and sells can help in this way !).\nAdd to that a very good community that is NOW on the game and it was about time !\nAnd you can guess that Secret Poncho has a huge life span and glorious days ahead if you can endure it's difficulty.\n\nStress/ Fun:Secret Ponchos can be really difficult and even a nightmare if you don't pratice during few hours. As i said before don't hesitate to check movements menus (left arrow son !). Also characters are all special and it will take time (or not) for you to find your favourite. Also some teams layouts are horribly strong and without any organisation or communication you won't stand any chances. Alone you can still have fun but playing with friends is a must... especially if they are in the enemy team !\nRemember that's it's a skill based game so be prepared to smash your keyboard especially when an ally can blow, burn, stun you during fights ^^\n\n\nTO CONCLUDE:\nA BLAST ! Secret Ponchos is a gem, very addictiv and beautifull, the game has done quite a lot of work and succeeded in its attempt to increase player base. Secret Poncho has no interrest in solo mode, it's a full multiplayer game and requires a lot of patience and skill to get into.\nDeveloppers are very active and also did (again) an amazing work for character balancing and community support.\nMy previous review has been commented and i updated it with pleasure in front of sucn an excellent game.\nI also appreciate the fact that every characters has it's own gameplay wich makes the game extremly deep and entertaining.\n\nSo now Kid, grab your gun, grab a copy of Secret Ponchos from the Steam market... we are waiting for you ;D\n\n\nN.B: The only issue really annoying is the lag. But in the first few hours i played only 3 matches had major lags. I'm sure it will be fixed soon.","October 15, 2015","true","5.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Its even harder to get be successful in the Moba business, with games LOL and Dota, its even harder when you're not free to play. Well Secret Ponchos not be considered a normal Moba, but it does have an online store where you can buy skins, and takes place from an overhead view. It also has a difficulty curve like a brick wall that is common to mobas, it also has the twitchy gameplay. Unlike a moba every hit you make is a press of a button, there is no animation that plays, no auto attacks, no creeps, no item shop. So when it comes to genre the game falls in a weird spot. Its also a western which most mobas either are fantasy or Sci-fi. But the western setting backs up the twitch gameplay with the draw of a gun and only a few shots fired before looking for cover.\nThe art style is comic booky and the characters are  weirdly rigid and it implies a sense of humor, but the game is so intense that it undermines its artistic integrity and…..\n\nThis game contradicts itself a lot.\n\nSecret ponchos is a stylish and original spaghetti western multiplayer combat game. That ones straight from the steam page. Its also says its a quick-twitch fighter, all of these things are true.\nThe gameplay of the game is fast as a quick draw, wow great joke right? Its a dual stick shooter that uses every button on the controller except for right and left on the d pad. Each button has a different function except for a and left bumper both share the cover button. Each Character in the game has 2 weapons and each weapon has 2 fire modes and there are 5 characters which adds to a total of 20 attacks across 5 characters and leads to all sorts of tactics.\n\nand I really feel like i'm getting ahead of myself. Ok lets start at the beginning\nwhen you start you are asked to make a character and name them. There are 5 characters with different stats that after you select them you can upgrade through a point system like in tony hawk. The Only game mode as of now is a 2v2 domination mode in which the opposing teams fight to kill each other. If your team gets a kill the counter adds a point  if the enemy team gets after that kill you lose that point and the first team to get 5 points wins. After each round you are given a bounty, if you win your bounty will go up, if you lose your bounty will decrease. The bounty acts a a leveling system if you get 1000 bounty you will level up and become a higher level criminal, and also get more points to upgrade your stats, but since you can lose bounty if you go under that 1000 you will go down and lose the stat boosts that go with it.\n\nNow to talk about the combat. The combat in this game is surprisingly deep, allowing you to employ many tactics against your foes. The game also does have a difficulty curve like a brick wall as i mentioned earlier and takes a good 4 to 5 hours of gameplay to adjust to the game. The games many weapons each have different effects, some have blast damage, some stun your opponent, some allow you to dodge and its how deploy these to your advantage is what makes the combat deep. Another layer to combat is Team Comp since it is 2 v 2 you have another player with you. Unfortunately you can't switch characters on the fly so you may end up with someone that compliments your play style or some that hinder it. But the game allows duplicates to play in the same match so you may end up with 4 grim reapers all duking it out. Friendly fire is also on so you have to be careful around your teammate. You also have a dodge mechanic that lets you dodge roll 3 times but then has to regen. You also have a cover mechanic that you have to throw in there as well. So with all this stacked on top of each other what combat usually looks like is a slow approach to the enemy team taking cover along the way. Then a short but violent skirmish and if you're still alive dashing away to find cover again. But in that moment of skirmish every second counts depending on who is using which of their 4 attacks, weather or not you miss, how many dodges  they have all of it determines the outcome of the battle.  You may win and walk away without a scratch or your team mate might die and you get left to have to run from 2 armd killers.\n\nNow i know i've talked really good about the game so far so im gonna rattle off the things that irk me about the game.\n\nEven though there is a ranking system it doesn't matter even if you are lowest level you can still get have to go against someone with the max bounty on their head.\nThe hit boxes sometimes really screw up\nIf you accidentally disconnect from a match you can't reconnect.\nAlot of general glitches\nThe game has no tutorial (witch would really help the difficulty curve problem.)\nThe fact that it wants you to purchase skins in a paid moba, an early access one at that.\nPlaying with friends is a pain. Every time you start the game you have to invite them to the lobby witch is normal. But after the match is over it kicks them and you have to re invite your friends to the lobby to play another match. At one point we all had to restart our clients to even to connect to each other.\nNow I know its early access but this really need to be addressed since this is a multiplayer game and playing with friends is a big draw to the game. Unfortunately the hassle to get with friends almost isnt worth it.\n\nDespite all that the game is rewarding and addictive enough to encourage you to climb that brick wall of difficulty curve, and the fights are so fast and fun that the game will keep you playing all the way to High Noon.\n","August 17, 2014","true","4.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The game has easy to learn and simple controls that mix with phenominal character balance to really make the game lean on each players skill and teamwork abilities rather then simply picking what is considered best.

Kind of a mix between a moba and a shooter. The only thing that may get players to not purchase the game could be the lack of of people playing the game, althou this should be fixed as the game becomes more popular (because it will, this game is amazing). Secret ponchos is very easy to pick up on, 2 different dodge and a strong/weak attack on both the primary and seccondary weapon.\n\nPlease note the pros and cons following are only because of early acess most of the cons and bugs will be fixed\n\nPros:\n- Unique gameplay\n- Very funny and friendly community\n- Easy to understand and get good at the game\n- Intense battle\n- Great art style\n- Diffenrent character to suit the player's play style\n- Bugs dont usually affect the overall enjoyment of the game\n- Active dev\n- Game events to test out new gamemode ( usually very fun and lots of hype )\n\nCons:\n- Needs more resolutions and options\n- Slight need of rework on character hit boxes\n- Some character are more powerful than all others wether it be because of range or combo attack pattern ( they are working on this issue )\n- Usage of a controller is a must ( could expand into keyboard and mouse controls to attract more player )\n","July 12, 2014","true","6.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/missinghost/recommended/265750/","missinghost","Missingno. Pig Forme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/missinghost/","306 products in account","A very smooth and beautiful game set in the wild west, featuring stereotypical gunmen battling for outlaw and vigilante supremacy. Secret Ponchos is a top-down team shooter based around spacing and aiming, with emphasis on the different characters' weapons rather than skills. Fights are quick and snappy, with players having to take aim at the opposing team while simultaneously dodging and weaving through the rain of bullets they're putting down. Combining the strengths of the different Outlaws affects the outcome in many ways, ensuring that there is no real "optimal" team.\n\nVisually, the game is stunning. The outlaws and environments are perfect in the classic west setting. The outlaws themselves are stylized in a very dark, cartoonish way that fits the game's theme. Each of them are statistically and visually different from one another so that you can always tell the group apart.\n\nThe soundtrack is phenominal, sounding exactly as though it was from a classic spaghetti western film. It never feels intrusive or like just background noise. The guitars and trumpets flaring up press you forward subconciously, adding drama and intensity to your gunfights as you both linger on the verge of death.\n\nAll in all, Secret Ponchos is one of the best team shooters I've played, and I reccomend it to anyone who digs wild west games or movies.","June 13, 2015","true","114.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Buy and play now, as there are quite a few players at the moment. This would also make a good LAN party game.\n\nSecret Ponchos is a nice twin stick shooter that feels great with a controller. You can level up your favorite characters and assign skill points to customize their traits to your playstyle. The developers have been applying feedback and even play each weekend. Each character has different dodge and primary/secondary attacks as well as differing strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn the future this game might be dead, there isn't much in the way of singleplayer, besides bot "arcade" battles and practice mode, so if you're interested in playing it online with random players buy now. I'll update this review in the future and let you know if it's still recommended with the player pool at the time.","October 19, 2015","true","4.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The concept is great, as well as the art, but there is a great frustration to a third-person team shooter when the average latency between players causes a fair amount of earned hits to miss. Ultimately I found myself just increasingly frustrated with each match, even after investing enough time to become competent with the controls and strategy.\n\nAnyways, it is an attractive game and for $5-10 I would say it could be worth it. I will state I was impressed with the cover mechanics: you can crouch behind most any wall/object on the map, which will hide you from view (okay that sounds pretty basic but for a third-person game its a nice tool). Still, I wont invest any more time to it and for $15 bucks I wouldnt advise others.

Having played the game for only 2 hrs the amount of teamwork and team combos is amazing and make this game really fun to play. The game mechanics work well on PC and the characters are well done and have good attributes to accomodate each of them within the team as well as the character itself. The game is well paced for the objectives in each game mode and the maps are well done with places to take cover, get health, or a cheeky speed boost every so often. The devs are some of the best people i've had the chance to meet before with all the help and community get togethers they put on. The least you could do is grab this game because it is one of the best Early Access games ever with the amount of time and effort the devs have put into this awesome game, so don't wait and join in on the fun now.","September 12, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A top down arena style shooter that's fun and fast paced.\n\nIt's easy to get into but tough to master. A nice selection of characters that are all different in playstyle. Some can be easily picked up and played while others will take some time to get their gameplay mechanics just right.\n\nRight now the community is fairly small so finding games can take a lil time (SP community chat helps here) but do yourself a favor and buy this game!

Guess what... You buying the game! :D\n\nBut don't worry, until ppl see the shine of this gem, there is still AI to play and train against, plus, you can(and should) always join the group chat, not only you will meet other guys who are looking to play, but you can communicate directly with the devs, that are always on and giving the players as much attention as possible.\n\nSo, really, this game has very few bugs and all, but with all the work the devs are putting in it, you shouldn't really worry about it. If you like western, fast paced action games, pick it up!

I would like to note that the devs of SP are an awesome bunch and poured a lot of hard work into this game and hope they know it doesn't go unnoticed I'll be looking for more releases from this studio for sure.\n\n\n\n****** Full release review\n\nAfter having a good time in the early access portion of Secret ponchos I was really excited for the full release with all the new content and man am I happy to report it was worth the wait!!!!!\n\nThe game at its core is a fighting game, essentially its Powerstone for those of you who played that gem on DreamCast back in the day. Combine that with League of legends style skill shooting and you have Secret ponchos!!!\n\nMy favorite part of Moba style games has always been the hero vs hero aspect of it not the creep killing. Skill shot fighting is so much fun and this game does really well at utilizing it and turning it into a fun arcade style fighting game.\n\nCore mechanics of the game feel really smooth, I've been using an xbox 360 controller and will most likely move to steam controller for the game but KBM work really well for this as well, maybe even better for certain characters depending on your skill lvl with each periphrial.\n\nSound is really good in the game, gun shots sound nice the crack of a whip the breaking of a moltov cocktail all of it feels well placed.\n\nVisual look is somewhat comic booky and I really enjoy that estetic.\n\nPrice, for the cost of this game I feel like your getting a lot, if you have some friends to play with this little gem could be your go to for a fighting game easily, if you don't have friends interested in this genre I would still recommend it as the community is great, finding matches is quick and the devs play often as well which is even more fun!\n\nI would recommend giving this game a go if it even peaks your intrest slightly you'll most likely enjoy it. Keep in mind it takes a lot of learning and people online are really good! Your going to get your butt kicked until you get good I can promise you that!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n******Early Access review\n\nReally fun game so far! Looking forward to putting some hours into it and getting good.\n\n\nSupports both KBM and Controller I personally like KBM controls for this, small community right now but with great potental for growth just be patient when looking for a match some times it takes several minutes.\n\nMost of the community seems to use the group chat function, I highly recommend this for anyone playing its a great way to connect with everyone and get matches faster.\n\nDevs are very active in communicating with the community.\n\nVery worth picking up right now as you get a copy for free for a friend!","August 22, 2015","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Idea and Delivery\n\nImagine yourself as Clint Eastwood walking into a deserted city in one of the movies in ‘The Man with No Name’ Trilogy by Sergio Leone. See yourself pulling a revolver and trying to aim at your opponent while he dashes to the side and tries to smoke you with a Molotov cocktail. Well, that is what Secret Ponchos is about.\n\nThe gameplay reminds me of the simpler times. Do you remember the sheer enjoyment of those good old Atari games that kept you glued to the screen for hours at a time? Secret Ponchos is a spirit child of those classic ancestors. It retains the intensity of engagement and simple but immersive mechanics.\n\n3D cartoon graphics and subtle western instrumental in the background amplify the enjoyment of the game. Switchblademonkeys managed to produce a renaissance-like game by going back to the good old basics – fun experience, fair but unforgiving gameplay dynamics, with intense but humor-infused light-hearted competitive element. It is very likely that at some point it time, you will be blown to pieces by Kid Red at the last moment of a really tight match, while he simultaneously rubs it in – ‘TAKE THAT!’\n\n2. Gameplay Dynamics\n\nSecret Ponchos is game of dynamic paper-rock-scissors across 5 or 6 different dimensions – damage, moving speed, stamina, health, reload speed and range. Each character possesses some innate traits, two different weapons, and there is even a mini-element of RPG game allowing you to adjust the first 5 of 6 aforementioned characteristics.\n\nThe action is fast-paced and interactive. It amounts to tricking your opponent into making a mistake. You will need to anticipate your opponents’ move before making your own to be a great player at this game. In addition, you will need nimble fingers to sort through a variety of well-designed moves and combos each character has.\n\n3. Depth, Versatility and Balance of Characters\n\nIn general, each character possesses two different weapons with at least two different types of attacks for each weapon. The depth and RPG element of the game, whereby you will be able to give a boost to some of your attributes as you gain experience, is perfectly suited for the ‘The God, The Bad and The Ugly’ type of confrontations. But do not be mistaken each attribute point will count. If you doubt me, play as Killer against Matador and adjust the speed attribute differently in each match.\n\nEach character is unique and will provide a very different experience of the game and will require you to craft and use very distinct strategies in addressing various opponents. For example, a Killer has two weapons, revolver and a knife, which he can use in 4 standard and 1 three-part combo attacks. Each attack has unique characteristics and provides plenty of debt to serve most of the matches that will rarely exceed 5-7 minute timeframe.\n\nSome characters will be harder to play than others, but no character will turn a bad player into a good one or a good player into a bad one. Imagine that you are playing pool and someone gives you a slightly better cue. You may sink few more shots but you will still be unable to play in the top league.\n\n4. Community\n\nI do not think that this review would be complete without mentioning the incredibly supportive Secret Ponchos community. My interaction with them began when I emailed SwitchBladeMonkeys on February 13, 2015 and received a reply from Yousuf Mapara the very same day. SBM team is effectively smaller than a dozen of people. The amount of commitment they showed to the players is incredible. Join the PC game chat and see for yourself. You can see them on a Twitch each Saturday morning as well.\n\n5. Post-Game Experience\n\nThis is a category I don’t see but I think it should be included in game reviews.\n\nRemember that feeling you had when playing Diablo for 8-hours straight, just repetitively left and right-clicking the screen in hope that you will be the lucky one bestowed with a legendary item drop. Remember that absurd, tired and angry feeling that overwhelmed you when you finally managed to turn off the computer and ask yourself – ‘What have I done with my day?’\n\nSecret Ponchos is a game that will never make you feel that way. You will be able to play short, fun, engaging and interactive matches. Personally, I can’t spend hours on gaming. However, that doesn’t prevent me from enjoying this game to the fullest. I can play for 15-20 minutes at a time, put it aside, have a dinner with my wife or entertain guests shortly after without feeling exhausted.\n\n6. Price – At 16.99 for one or 49.99 for a pack of four games this is one of the most affordable games with incredible replay value on the market. Enough said!\n\nI hope you liked the review and I also hope to see you on the other side of the Saloon – colt and I will be waiting! I also can’t wait to try the new characters – Warmonger, Mad Trapper, and Gunman.\n\nP.S. I would like to apologize, this was a lengthy post.\n\nP.P.S. I base my feedback on the following experience in the game, which I started playing in January 2015:\n\nKiller – 974 matches; 2,293 kills; 272K in bounty (106K deathmatch; 272K domination);\nHunter – 131 matches; 401 kills; 51K in bounty;\nKid Red – 57 matches; 219 kills; 27K in bounty;\nGordo – 22 matches; 90 kills; 10K in bounty;","September 25, 2015","true","131.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I mean look at the trailer, it looks awesome... right?\n\nAfter 7 hours I'm pretty confident in my understanding of the failures of the online modes.\nCore Game:\nSo there are 10ish, very unique, classes in a twin stick shooter with moba elements, game modes that pit 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 in 6 or 7 different maps. In online mode you have a selection of characters. Characters are built from the base classes, and have rpg-esque attribute points that can be spent as the player wishes, as the player wins with the character the character gains xp in the form of "Bounty." At certain intervals you go up a rank and are given 2 more attribute points to spend on that character. This means more played with characters are also more powerful. Shouldn't cause problems except...\n\nMatchmaking:\nMatchmaking sucks. Where I am (the UK), in ranked mode I'm very often (80%) matched with way higher level players, even this wouldn't be a problem except that you are penalised for it. Your character loses Bounty, even though its going up against players several ranks higher than you. For example my rank 3 character went up against a top rank player, I had about 2,500 bounty, they had over 100,000, this means also about 14 more attribute points (to my 6), and presumably more than the few days the game has been out experience (great job early access), despite actually hitting them, and in total dealing half the damage they dealt to me back at them, I lost Bounty. How does that make sense?\n\nBalance:\nSo here is a weird quirk with the matchmaking, when you play as some classes that have a high "difficulty" stat, such as The Killer, or The Wolf, in the 2v2 matches I played about 80% of them would feature 1 or 2 more of the exact same character. So 3/4 would be The Wolf or the Killer, I feel this speaks to the developers understanding of how imbalanced the characters actually are, they try to circumvent that problem by not matching them up. There are just some classes that can't compete with others. You can tell in the practice mode by how easy it is to kill some characters, and how easy you die when you switch to them.\n\nBut these are only criticisms when the game works as it should:\nThe latency handling is terrible, it is noticeably harder to play a game with players who have bad connections, to the point that I could predict a poor match by just looking at their connection status, regardless of my rank advantage. This latency manifests as being shot by bullets several times out of the range of the character, almost never being able to hit the laggy player and classic warping (of them) across the level.\n\nIn my session today, the game crashed 5 times and sometimes would lose Bounty for that.\nThe Wolf character's line of sights were crazy unstable, sometimes they wouldn't appear but you could still fire, other times your character does the animation of pulling a bow, but releasing the trigger does nothing.\n\nFinally the frustrating menus, there are too many boring and over repeated animations that make things like changing your character a chore, or just getting to the next game. You can't even cancel joining a new game before you have joined it. You have to wait to join, which would be slightly less upsetting if finding a game didn't sometimes take several minutes.  But sometimes you join a game past the point you can leave at all (even thought it hasn't started yet), and have to play a whole game or lose some bounty.\n\nSo I definitely cannot recommend this game, as I have confidence in neither the design of the game or the execution. I'm frustrated that this game has been played so long, making it less accessible to new players (days after its official release).","October 18, 2015","false","9.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

And that's something strange for me to say. Normally i get bored in a few minutes... This, i really like, when i saw the game i thought: ohh it's another smash the keyboard isometric game. Well, nope. It requieres for you to think about what to do. You have 2 weapons or a main weapon and an accessory that changes depending of the character you're using (dynamite, a medkit, a critical enhancing badge (yes.. weird), a knife, a lasso, molotvs, etc). You also have at least 2 styles of using your main weapon that can inflict status (like wonded, reducing movement speed, or blindness. You also have a stamina bar that allows you to dash and make melee attacks (if you choose a melee oriented class). Aiming is quite difficult in the good way, gamepads respond perfectly but you really have to aim or you won't hit... So it's all about timing and resourcces, running out of stamina, bad timing, not looking at the map. It's a really good game that mixes skill, strategy and knowing your opponents... To me, fun factor is 9/10. Every character feels different, so you can play in various styles.\nCharacters: there are about 10 right now. Everyone is different in playing styles. And i found everyone (but the tipical obese/nasty one, for now) being really fun. Normally i go one character and i'm done... here i'm playing with everyone online . I like that they stayed in stereotypes but they didn't at the same time. You have the characters you thought you would... but their designs are interesting. There's not the lawful sheriff or the big bad guy, they're all... normal... excentric characters... I love them all... But again, since i like them all, i would like to have more so...8/10 (skins are too expensive).\nMusic: Great, i didn't mute it... that's saying a lot. I normally play while watching something on the other monitor... Well, nope, i like it, but to be honest you eventually can get tired. Also, i don't remember any song but the title screen one.. so 7/10\nArt style: i LOVE it, 10/10. it's that simple. I'd like more creativity in some characters (again, big ugly guy again)\nBalance: Well, here's something odd. I was playing a match thinking: ITS IMPOSSIBLE, THE SNIPER IS TOO STRONG... then i played with it and i found that the trap-ster kicks it's ♥♥♥... But the rogue-speed guy defeats him (well, in a rocks paper scissor style, it doesnt mean you will win with him, you'll have more chances). So, there's balance issues in 1 vs 1... 2 vs 2 thing changes. Example, we were playing 2 vs 2 and we were two ghost ponchos (low range+dashes) against a bowgirl and a trickster (2 with the most range of the game) Impossible to attack them before being shot in the face. Eventually we found openings and made a strategy, without talking, without ... nothing, just by playing and syncing, and that happened lot of times... strategy becomes that intuitive. It really REALLY becomes a team game where you can work as a team, it's not about a guy sniping and killing everyone, it's about aiding each other. So... balance wise, it's balanced yet it's not... 2 vs 2 yes, 1 vs 1 ... not a lot...... 7/10\nMatchmaking: I'm from south america... I had it for a few days, i managed to find about 10 people online (i think it's regional matchmaking). I wouldn't say the game is dead, but it could use a boost. Also, it kicks you from matchmaking if you've been waiting for too long... so if you're 3 waiting for the 4th player the room could dissolve. BUT, matchmaking, when there's people works like a charm. IT's -> click -> you're in the game. No waiting at all. Also, i'm from south... again... my ping isn't the best with ANYONE, and i can feel lag sometimes, still when i'm hit i cant curse a lot because i knew i was going to be hit. I have to lower the score because im from a third world country and no one buys games here so i'm alone like every valentine's day 6/10\n\nOverall... i love this game... It's great. It would be awesome if the matchmaking worked a little better for me...\n9/10.\n","November 11, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am really glad I got to play it during the free week. Secret Ponchos is a game I plan on purchasing in the future, as I have come to really enjoy it.\n\nIn Secret Ponchos you play as a criminal of some sort racking up a bounty by defeating other players in multiplayer. While there is single player arcade and practice modes the real focus is on the multiplayer side of things.  There are 10 playable character classes currently, each one with its own unique weapons and play style. There are multiple skins for some characters, and character stats are tweakable with stat points through the customization menu.\n\nThe actual gameplay revolves around running around a variety of maps, solo or in your "posse" battling it out with enemy gangs in the wild west. There are a good deal of maps to play on, and a only few different game modes I have experienced including "one life" round based survival game mode, and a more arcade style deathmatch game mode. That is of course excluding the arcade singleplayer mode and practice modes.\n\nI enjoyed what I played of Secret Ponchos and I would recommend it to anyone who likes isometric shooters, or western themed indie games.","December 17, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am really glad I got to play it during the free week. Secret Ponchos is a game I plan on purchasing in the future, as I have come to really enjoy it.\n\nIn Secret Ponchos you play as a criminal of some sort racking up a bounty by defeating other players in multiplayer. While there is single player arcade and practice modes the real focus is on the multiplayer side of things.  There are 10 playable character classes currently, each one with its own unique weapons and play style. There are multiple skins for some characters, and character stats are tweakable with stat points through the customization menu.\n\nThe actual gameplay revolves around running around a variety of maps, solo or in your "posse" battling it out with enemy gangs in the wild west. There are a good deal of maps to play on, and a only few different game modes I have experienced including "one life" round based survival game mode, and a more arcade style deathmatch game mode. That is of course excluding the arcade singleplayer mode and practice modes.\n\nI enjoyed what I played of Secret Ponchos and I would recommend it to anyone who likes isometric shooters, or western themed indie games.","December 17, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once you get the hang of the controls, you'll really feel like you're in a wild west shootout. There's nothing quite like ducking for cover just in time to miss a shotgun blast, or making a sudden dive and wheeling around just in time to blow away your foe. The interactivity with the environment is great, and adds an extra layer to the action.\n\nThe aesthetic of the game is fantastic. The music has the perfect mix of compelling western flair with just enough modern spice. The characters are vibrant and evocative, as are the locales. The SFX are solid too; landing the final shot that ends a tough duel sounds as good as it feels.\n\n--The CONS--\nThe game's single-player options are very limited. This is effectively an online multiplayer game only. Indeed, it feels like the multiplayer options also have a lot of room for expansion (4v4 or 5v5, more maps and modes). The game takes some getting used to, and the tutorial does a mediocre job of preparing the player (definitely will need to play a few real rounds before you really get it). Also, there are the occasional bugs in the menu and matchmaking that can be an inconvenience (though they're not really significant).\n\nSecret Ponchos is a short shot of frenetic fun. I definitely recommend checking it out, especially now while it's on free week and on sale.","December 16, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The tutorial is nice, and the learning curve is quite reasonable. It's really easy to just go into the game and start playing. Even if you only know the very basics of the game, you're still guaranteed to have a blast, just as I did. That said, there's alway more to learn and improve on, so the gameplay never feels stale, and every play that you pull off feels immensely rewarding, since everything is a skillshot, and there's always a cost to using any ability. I'm honestly blown away by how much fun I've been having. A friend of mine recommended this game really highly to me, and I like it way more that I thought I would. Even so, I did recognize that this game has a pretty small playerbase...\n\n\nBut we can easily fix that by getting more people to play with us!\n\n\nBuy this game. I promise you won't regret it.\n\n\nStay classy, outlaws. <3","December 20, 2015","true","28.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it could be classified as a MOBA, I really dont think of it as one because of several things that seperate it from other mobas. For one, it requires more skill than other mobas, since your attacks don't lock on to your targets and Movement is much more important. It also doesnt have a shop, towers, lanes, minions, or any of that.\nWhile a simple game on the surface, it is suprisingly hard, with a high skill ceiling. I would recomend looking at some guides before you hop in and use practice mode to get a good feel for your characters against AI bots.\nThe only negatives are the occasional bug and balancing issue, but they rarely get in the way of the gameplay.\n\nOverall, a original, great game (with a great community as well) and a few problems gives this game a solid 8.5/10.","December 22, 2015","true","39.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recommend it to people who enjoy a game that can pick up and play with ease. The game definitely falls under the category of 'easy to learn, hard to master', as the kits of the Outlaws (champs) are reletively simple at face value.\n\nPros\n- lovely art\n-competitive gameplay\n-great music\n-fun in 20 minute intervals, fun in 4 hour interevals... it's fun\n-with different team comps, brings totally different playstyle for teams. With 10 differnt Outlaws, there are a LOT of team comps\n-enough maps to keep gameplay from becoming stale\n\nCons\n-small community makes for some long Queue times\n\nOverall this game is fantastic. Once the community begins to grow, I believe it will become a game I will play for years to come. This game has mechanics that I think rival some triple A games. If you're thinking about getting this game, I absolutely think you should, however... Be patient, game communities do not grow overnight. A game with such great mechanice WILL gain in playerbase, it just take a bit of time.","January 5","true","35.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may be Early Access, and that shows in a few places such as the keyboard controls are a bit clunky and there's not much in the way of control setting, even for gamepads.

In Domination, you compete to move a kill marker to your side.  Each kill moves your marker closer to your victory.  Of course, the enemy team is doing the same, so it's quite the fight.\n\nYour ranks are stored per character, so while I may have Kid Red ranked up a few times (with obligatory stat point investiture) my rank with The Killer remains at 0 - so you have to use each Outlaw if you really want to have a full arsenal of options - but if you like your character and don't want to change, then there's no reason to, since you're not hurting yourself in any way.\n\nThe battles are fast and fierce, and you aren't extremely durable, so you're always wondering if the next fracas will be your last.\n\nIt's a game that absolutely MUST be played.","June 8, 2015","true","23.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You will see alot of them in chat playing and talking with the players, and are very welcoming to new comers.\n\nNegative:\nThere are a few bugs, and balancing issues (it feels like, only a couple hours played so far) which I came into the game expecting, however the only major one that hinder gameplay was the server stability. Perhaps it was just me, but occassionally players would jump around, despite this lag issue, it didn't ever feel like I was being cheated by it.\nPlayers who hate latency issues may want to wait a little while, I'm sure they will patch the problems soon enough though.\nThe only other bug that was a nuisance was the occassional crash.\n\nWorth?:\nIn it's current stage I actually reccommend, the game is only going to get better, and the community is quite a nice bunch. However if you get this game, and ignore the community, at its current stage you might not get where I think alot of the enjoyment comes from.\n\nSO TL;DR\nIF YOU GET THIS GAME, COME JOIN THE COMMUNITY ON THE STORE PAGE, OR YOU ARE MISSING OUT ALOT.

I very much enjoyed my time dueling my friends.\nI WOULD recommend this game, HOWEVER there are just one too many negative aspects which make means I would only recommend it if you are prepared to deal with these annoying issues:\n\n-Menu system/lobbies are absolute garbage:\nto make a new character you have to backtrack out of your team's/friend's lobby to the main menu and then navigate to the online lobby and find the option that lets you make a character.\nEverything is hidden away in random menus and nothing is intuitive untill you have learnt how to navigate them.\n\n-Matchmaking: (particuarly with friends)\nIf you want to play online with your friends you are going to have to be prepared for a lot of hassle and long waits. Very occasionaly it will work first time and you will get straight into a game, most of the time however when you try and invite your friends it wont let them join or it will refuse to find any other players to match you with. Often to fix this you have to leave and rejoin multiple times.\nThis is made even more annoying by the fact the game is incredibly fast paced. Deathmatches can be over in minutes meaning that you often spend a lot longer waiting to play the game than actually playing the game.\nEDIT: the issue with friends being broken up has been fixed according to the devs, however the waiting time can still be lenghty even when playing by yourself or doing 1v1s due to not enough players/ inneficient matchmaking.\n\n-Bugs:\nYou will probably notice a few weird bugs whilst playing. It is possible to clip edges if you are dodging around too much and the line of sight mechanic can sometimes bug out meaning you can see/be seen by players in situations that shouldn't allow it. Also some characters have very weird hitboxes with some of their ranged attacks and it is obvious that more time has been put into making and polishing some characters over others. Although these bugs are to be honest very minor and really not too much of an issue (despite showing an obvious lack of polish) since the games are so fast paced as I mentioned earlier one small glith can mean you lose a trade and therefore lose the game.\n\nSo to conclude:\nI wouldn't buy this game at full price for sure, on a decent sale however it might be a great pick up and definitely good value. There are a lot of frustrating elements that detract from the actual game itself and overall force me to give this game a nevagive review, however as many other reviews talk about the meat of the game itself is very fun so if you enjoy MOBAs or bullet hell games and you have some friends to play with go ahead and get this game.

It is still too unpolished for me to enjoy and recommend it. As an Early Access, this would get a solid 9/10 from me, but as a game that's being presented as a final product, I can't give it such a high score.\n\nSome game mechanics are unbalanced and bugged (like The Killer's knife, which can fly over a cover and hit a target hiding behind that cover, or Phantom's whip, that can be seen by opponent even without clear visual on covering Phantom, therefore rendering any cover for sneaking totally useless with whip equipped), there are typos and misspelling in achievements and moveset descriptions, hitboxes sometimes behave way too odd, and connecting to a match (even if we don't count the matchmaking system, which is sometimes quite unballanced) is a pain in about one fifth of all 1v1 cases - if the opponent doesn't load the match, you get stuck on the match loading screen (which is just a blank screen with crow wallpaper - no indication if you are still loading or waiting for an opponent). The only way out is to force quit the game, which then causes a -300 $ Bounty drop every time.\n\nThis game certainly got my attention and I will definitely consider purchasing it in the future, if the issues will get solved. The atmosphere of spaghetti westerns, the music, the design and both single and multiplayer gameplay (if we ignore all the negative stuff I wrote above) are quite good and original.

We then played for the first time since we bought the game with the devs. I am here to tell you that they worked hard and although it's not perfect the improvements are significant and I really enjoy playing this game. The free copy while in early access is a great deal and I encourage anyone to spend their money on this game because it is lots of fun. However I won’t lie to you and right now there are not many people playing. These devs are working really hard to reach out to the community and to build hype as they count down to launch. Buy the game and message me, lets play. Together we can bring the players to this fun game by a hard working dev team.","July 15, 2015","true","13.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sheepnerfer/recommended/265750/","sheepnerfer","sheepnerfer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sheepnerfer/","176 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirstly - the art style is fan-flipping-tastic. Everything about Secret Ponchos feels really fresh and unique. I'll have to review again once I've spent more time in it, but my first impressions are great.  Each character has a unique loadout which provide more than just range/damage/speed differences, but in some cases completely alter the way you play the game. There's  a really slick level of polish to areas of the game that make it a joy to play. From the way the whip trails after you on the Phantom Poncho, the gorgeous poses and animations of every character, to the responsiveness of the controls and abilities. I'd definitely say some characters are much easier to pick up than others. Within a few minutes of playing Phantom - landing a stun with his long range whip, diving in close and quick-switching to his short range double barrel felt really great,  Where as other characters, such as the matador have some extra layers of depth in the learning, and most certainly the mastering phases.\n\nObviously it's early access, so there's a miriad of areas for improvement that, with the active and involved devs, seem like extra layers of polish just waiting to happen.  There's nothing that really stands out as "game-breaking" or annoying in the gameplay right now. Once you're playing it feels fluid and seamless, and the strategic aiming /range mechanics mixed with the fast-twitch FPS feel is a ton of fun. I would 100% recommend picking up the game with a bunch of friends and dueling it out Secret Ponchos style!\n","June 24, 2015","true","6.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The matches are nice and quick and there is good flow between the matches.\n\nGraphics are good and I have no issues playing at full resolution and max details on my laptop (Nvidia GTX850m) or on my desktop (Radeon HD 7970).\n\nMost importantly, the devs have been on top of listening to the feedback and appear to be constantly improving and adding to the game which is a huge plus.

It's one of the very few early access games that I have actually played longer then getting the just of it and waiting for release. It's fast paced action and never a dull moment. The dev team is small and actually listens and talks to the players. Things come along slowly but this will be a must have game upon release. If you are scared or tired of early access games the deal right now is to good to pass up. There will be bugs and glitches but it's to be expected just report them on the games forums and the devs will reply very quickly. The only major downfall right now is that there is only a small community and it will grow and grow with such great and caring people making it. I see a great future for secret ponchos and will support it on any console it comes out on. I Fully recommend buying this game and is pretty much the only EAG's that I would in their early access state. Their twitch saturdays are a blast too.","November 5, 2014","true","141.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I've only played it a couple times when it wasn't even support mouse in this game. But still, the game experience attracted me to wait for its development and the release of its full potential. The only problem this game is facing is not having too many players at the moment. This doesn't mean that the game is dead since it also runs on consoles. Plus, I've contacted the development team and they told me that the game is about to be fully launched into steam, which means a huge boost of population coming soon.\n\nWhen the game gets out of early access, this is definitely a worthy buy if the population of the game can maintain at a stable amount. The combat system and the graphics are very good, style of the game is nice and etc. Only one thing I've not that satisfied was there's only 2v2 available.

This game is not just good, it's crazy good. The gameplay is fast and extremely addictive (in a good way, you'll just want to rematch those a****** that just beat you). I would recommend it to anyone who like competitive pvp action, it's 100% based on skills and (thank god) it's absolutely not pay to win. Most of the negative reviews I've read so far are bout the menu (with the no mouse support) or the ranking and skill points system. This brings me to the second great quality of this game, the devs are actually listening. They want players to enjoy their game and they work hard in that way. Already they announced a patch for the skill points, less than 10 days after the official release. I love this game, I really do and I think it needs to be promoted to increase its population. The game deserve it. How much money many of you guys put in CoD franchise?

Matchmaking is easy. The characters are quirky, and they appeal to a broad range of play styles. And small elements of the MOBA format are blended seemlessly with fast-paced isometric twitch shooting in such a way as to not be overbearing, complicated or inaccessible. Secret Ponchos is casual good times, and its community is a friendly, fun-loving one. The $9.99 customization DLC is well worth it too. Bombed-out Kid Red is pure hilarious eye candy.\n\nI can't reccomend it enough. In fact, Secret Ponchos is so damn good that I actually bothered to write a Steam review of it. Buy it. Lose yourself in it. Enjoy a well-earned break from organizing stacks of building materials and consumables in the rushed-out early access survival game you are currently playing and are no doubt already getting sick to death of.","October 15, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everything seems too "slow" or short ranged. Melee chars are overwhelmed by their ranged counterparts as every shot you recieve (or almost) knocks you back so whats the point of even trying. For every attacks you make, be it range or melee, you have to actually use your "aim" button first which starts a lil "aiming" animation of .5 sec which in turn makes your quick melee dash useless since you cant just dash forward, slash, dash back for a quickie. By the time you reach your target for a melee strike, he prolly just aimed at you with his revolver/shotgun/whatever, waited for you to try your roll in and shooted his thing, knocking you back or even worse, knocking you down.\n\nMost weapons have a very short range though I admit some have a secondary that makes them become more of a medium range. Problem is, it takes yet another 1 sec for the animation to complete and by the time you can actually get your shot off, your target rolls back out of range anyways and you have to waste your shot.\n\nYou can crouch behind cover but what for? Weapon range are way too short to even bother trying to shoot from cover and if you try to simply take cover to evade a shot, well good luck because again it takes a second for the game to animate your char behind the spot.\n\nFor those who wonder, 1 second isnt long, but in a game where reflexes counts for everything, it -is- a friggen long while. In games like CoD, that one sec is the diff between you having the headshot or your target.\n\nThe way I see it, the combat mecanics would work for matches of more than 1 vs 1 or 3 vs 3 ...Meleers could navigate more easily behind and get their attacks off.\n\n","December 14, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I can definitely see the appeal for this game.\n\nLearning curve is pretty insane, large amount of skill required, no remorse for anyone that wants to play more casually, and kinda unbalanced classes. I can go on for more but it honestly gets down to nit picks at the point.\n\nI can see the appeal for highly skilled players but for the other majority you're probably just going to get pub stomped or carried. The little time I played there was only one close match and that was pretty fun ended up losing but at least everyone on both teams actually got several kills. I think the main problem with the game is there is only small games (1v1 or 3v3) I think it could benefit from larger games, anywhere from 5v5 to 8v8. Or even possibly pub vs bots. I honestly kinda doubt it'll have players after long since it being really unforgiving for new players/less skillfull players. It's not a bad game by any means, just I can't see allot of people really getting into it.\n\nTL;DR: Not a bad game but if your bad at the game it'll suck horribly, and I'm bad at the game.\n\nIf its no longer the free week get it when its less then or 10$.\n\n\nAmazing art style though.","December 14, 2015","false","2.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The gameplay itself is a top down shooter but in a MOBA themed arena - 2vs2. You choose a character, add a few stats and that is it - you are good to go! Well..no, unfortunately. Why? Because no one seems to be playing the game. Seriously! I was waiting for a few minutes in a lobby, until 2 more people joined.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/betadaysuk/recommended/265750/","betadaysuk","BetaDaysUK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/betadaysuk/","747 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSecret Ponchos is a competitive twin-stick shoot-out fest with MOBA styling’s set in taking in an isometric Old West world.\n\nPick a miscreant from four characters, partner up with another player to create a gang, albeit a small one, then head out to the digital frontier to find another like-minded couple and do them more harm than they can do to you in the time that’s allowed.\n\nThe game plays much like an online battle arena title as the classes selected play an important part of the game. Each of the characters posse has a unique trait, weapon and play-style. The four currently available are: ‘The Killer‘; a balanced all-rounder with medium range and movement speed with a six shooter and a throwing knife. ‘Kid Red‘; who’s a quick lad but deals light damage however does have a mean arm to throw sticks of TNT! ‘The Deserter‘ has better range, but slower rate of fire/movement but carries a deployable medic bag, then finally the ‘The Phantom Poncho‘. The mysterious Phantom uses a double barrel shotgun and is a lethal whip wielder able to stun at a good range.\n\n\nLike Team Fortress 2 (a game the developers have stated as an influence), the title plays the most fun when understanding your buddies and baddies abilities because working effectively with your cohort will win the duel-duel (double-duel?). Playing as the ‘Phantom Poncho’ for example you’re able to use your whip to snare or stun the enemy while a ‘Deserter’ class can then impale an opponent dealing an impressive 1-2 of massive damage. This is not a game to play lone wolf – unless the match making is broken …which it is from time-to-time.\n\nOn the subject of bugs the game is still in it’s “Early Access” cycle so as you would expect it has some stability issues and as well as absent features. The game will crash out from time-to-time or you’ll encounter ‘quirks’ – such as if you’re in the lobby on your own you can force the match to start with just your character leaving you to wonder the badlands on your lonesome.\n\nThree maps are available to duke it out in. This is quite a small amount, but each does offer a different scale, style and are well crafted enough to allow for plenty of choke points or spots to hide and ambush an opponent using the cover, such as behind barrels and walls. These items are however destructible so you do have to pick and choose your hideout wisely. Although a player’s health doesn’t regenerate, around the map, you’ll also have access to random pick-ups that spawn (along with other perks).\n\nAt the end of the round, doing well in a match allows you to level up and to increase a characters reputation/notoriety. This progression results in points to spend on boosting the base stats and abilities of your character (movement speed, fire rate etc).\n\nThe Good\n\nGraphically Secret Ponchos is slick and polished. The characterisations are amazingly animated, look detailed and have a fun Gorillaz-esq style to them. Levels and environments are created with a lot of care and attention to detail. Touches like bottles on tables in the saloon can be shot/knocked are small, but add to the overall feel. Aurally the music is a real highlight with selection of distinctive western style melodies that are both catchy and memorable. The four characters are also well balanced towards each other and give a solid learning curve that when you proficient prove complementarily to your duelling partnership and to be feared.\n\nCurrently the game has no keyboard and mouse support, but thankfully the game works really well with a twin-stick controller (either Xbox 360 or DualShock game pads). Controls are responsive and layout is intuitive/easy to pick up and play after only a few minutes of game time.\n\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe biggest issue, and one I completely understand how it has occurred, is that the game doesn’t have enough bodies playing, making its matchmaking at ‘off-peak’ times decidedly difficult. When you do manage to play, the only team sizes are 2-vs-2 and in addition having only one flavour of game mode available, Domination, does tend to make things go stale shortly. Four playable characters and three maps, as wonderful as they are to play and look at, are too few to allow you to get stuck in or hold your attention for any duration. If you do wish to hone your skills away from real people, the offline practice mode consists of a measly match against constant respawning lifeless and stationary opponents. This brings us on to….\n\nThe Ugly\n\nThe unattractive truth is that Secret Ponchos is a toothless prospector; the game is missing a lot but knows where the gold is! Players will need to be patient before we can finally hit pay dirt.\n\nNumber 1 on the Wanted list has got to be increasing the team sizes. Four players (2 vs. 2) is simply not enough. Next new characters and game modes are also needed. Stable mates of any such game of this ilk should include free-for-all or even some sort of capture the flag/objectives are needed. The maps I also feel should be more interactive and have elements that can be used against your opponents – such as TNT crates that explode, or some sort of hunters traps that stun.\n\nAfter this the top priority for the devs should be adding AI and then using them to craft s a singleplayer experience with a narrative (as these characters are crying out for a back story or an adventure) or even better still co-operative mode with you and a buddy, Butch and Sundance against the ‘horde’ of desperado’s.\n\nOptions are woefully missing from the menu for the basic and usual technical titbits you’d expect from a PC game. No interface exists for changing the screen resolution; this is instead managed via a keyboard combination, nor an option to even quit out of the game at the time of writing.\n\nIt appears although not implemented that eventually you’ll be able to see how you stack up against your internet brethren in official league tables. At the moment the Leaderboard to check your standings against other players, ‘Blood Bets’, gang management and an Online Store for what appears to be character customisation lead to nowhere.\n\nVerdict\n\nSo what does the future hold for Secret Ponchos? Well although Switchblade Monkeys have confirmed very little of a development timeline, they have said that many of the wish list (maps, modes, AI and even split-screen etc) are coming to the game at launch. Two more characters are due. A lady Matador appears in promotional material who is seen to be lightning fast, but has to utilise melee attacks only, and the other being teased by the development team is a “Trapper” (whom I envisage as a brawler Davy Crocket type fellow) who they hint at will be able to lay suitable ambushes for other dastardly outlaw types. As well as new characters and more maps are mentioned throughout development and more post launch to expand the universe they’ve created.\n\nSecret Ponchos is not a bad game. It’s not an overly buggy game. It’s just a very early release of something that could be amazing. For the money and its status I’m not expecting League of Legends or Team Fortress, but at this moment it just has too few ways for you to die in the Old West. The game is paper thin, but on that paper it has jotted down some good ideas, created some wonderfully presented art work and a detailed treasure map for its planned journey ahead.\n\nThose that are keen to get in on the ground floor of a new game, work with the developers to find bugs and perfect character balance will be appreciated, however if you are looking for something you can get your teeth into you most definitely will want to wait.","July 10, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gaming community is much too large for any game to create such a blatant gap in capability between those who have played a lot and those who have only just touched the game. After about an hour of game time I seem to be able to go toe-to-toe with anybody near my 'level'. However the damage numbers and stamina recharge time as a starting player is terribly inferior to those who have logged tons of game hours. Granted I understand you can reach those levels, but every time you lose a match, you also lose your cash. This is not the best system to draw in more players. And speaking of more players... this game needs it... bad. The que times and stat differences between players make for a very displeasing experience.\n\nDespite all the bad the game really is pretty for what it is, and the characters are obviously thematic and not just copies of eachother. The gameplay is fun unless you find yourself trying to manage the cover mechanics. I'm sure volume control will come with the platform shift, but until then we'll have to struggle with frustrating volume and controllers.\n\nAll in all. Here's what I score it.\n\nArt: 8/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nOutlaw Balance: 4/10\nMultiplayer Interraction: 2/10\nAddicting: 7/10\nOverall: 6.5/10\n\nWorth the buy if on sale or if you have four friends who want to try something new. If you want a game that will entertain you for years, probably find something else. If you love westerns and 'P4WN1NG n00bz', then skip on a few spit shines on the way home from the bank and drop the current price of 15$ to enjoy something entertaining.","July 15, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have to aim at their feet to shoot them in the middle of\ntheir body.  Normally in a game you aim at the chest or the head.

Do I get extra damage for a headshot?  Do I aim at the knees to hit the head?\n\nEven the long range fighters can't shoot very far.  It looks like the fighters are 10-20 feet away from\neach other when in range to shoot.  When you shoot beyond range, you cannot hit even if you're lined up\nperfectly.  It's like a magic bullet eating forcefield eats your shot.  I get what they are trying to do\nhere, but the bullet was invented so you could put holes in things that are far away...and short of a\nnerf gun, I don't know of any weapons that are ineffective at ten paces.

Laggers can warp and kill you even if they don't hit you in your screen. If you've played GunZ online you know what I am talking about.\n-Has some bugs but they're mostly harmless except constant crashing\n-Very low player base. If I can reach top 100 with my 31,7 hours of gameplay it tells that only about 100 people invest a lot of time into this game.\n-Ranked leaderboard is TIME based. It rewards you for playing a lot of matches not for being good.\n\n\nSoo.. outside of that devs are really nice and listen to community. The only downside is that they will probably never fix the net code. They've only said that they consider making regional locks but IT WILL NOT FIX THE LAG PROBLEM it only reduces the amount of laggers. Devs are also trying to make patches which make this more "esport" like... nothing wrong with that but this game WILL NEVER BECOME ESPORT GAME because of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ P2P client based net code.\n\nSummary:\nBuy the game only if you want to play against friends. Playing against random people just makes you to lose your nerves because eventually you'll run into laggers / bug abusers.","October 23, 2015","false","31.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After that you just go abuse your main "combos" most complex of which are something like - dash, hit cc skill, go deeper in, shoot, go out, regen stamina, repeat.\nalso there are quite a lot of bugs (aka features :D) which can affect your gameplay. This reminds me of Dragonica and is actually rather good because you can make your opponent mad, not just outplay.","October 19, 2015","true","8.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Absolutely not recommended for PC gamers with even light quality standards.\n\nThe control scheme is utterly unintuitive, because the devs decided not to bother to create a proper PC control scheme and instead simply rebound the functions to the keyboard and mouse keys.\n\nAnimations constantly seize up, causing terrible visuals such as your character sliding around along the ground with legs paralyzed in a static position while reloading.\n\nActions don't have a fluidity/queue system implemented, meaning that chaining different actions together is unnecessarily rough, and this was in single player -- I can only imagine how bad it would be in multiplayer with even moderate latency.\n\nAnd overall production quality is nothing to brag about either.\n\nYes, this is an indie game, but there is never, ever an excuse for not implementing a proper PC control scheme.\n\nCheap console ports are always unacceptable, regardless of any circumstances.\n\nCouple that with lazy production efforts, and you get a mediocre game that controls awkwardly and lacks the depth to keep people playing even if everything else were polished.","December 14, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

(2 min read time)\nFirst of all the most glaring thing, the perspektive. It sucks as as you begin because you only hit the feet of the people which is a complete mind♥♥♥♥. It also makes it very hard to gauge distance so you prob get outranged even though you shouldn't more on that later.\nATLEAST the idea is good. Never seen anything like this. Bright unique and lovely crafted characters. It reminds me a lot of Magicka which is just as unique (maybe a little more).\nThe next is the lvl/rank sytem (have this from TB I didn't play enough to get out of unranked) as you get a higher rank you level up your bandit which makes you stronger so higher rank=stronger character. You see the problem? Good. NEXT!\nTHIS GAME HAS AN ASSFULL OF POTENTIAL. It's not overly complicated and there for has quite a big margend to improve and out skill your opponent. But all the bugs and ♥♥♥♥ and lag make it impossible right now.\nNow ALL THE BASIC FLAWS! IT'S RIDICLIOUS! It's an enhanced ♥♥♥♥ING EDITION! It lags like ♥♥♥♥ has a ♥♥♥♥ing huge exploit ( you can shoot while dashing *facepalm* ). I can't tell if it's the case that it lags to much so that I don't hit my enemy but he hits me, that my character has less range than anyone else or I just miss the shot and they hiz. I can't figure it out which. that is also a big problem you can't see your mistakes. There is no introduction for the chracters and not a lot of souce material. That fact makes it impossible to research how to play a character.\n\nOverall nice idea/game but it's build into ♥♥♥♥ with exploits and bugs and lag...","December 18, 2015","false","1.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","6"

That can seem scary at first for inexperienced players, and you may get your face melted a few times as you learn, but it's infinitely more engaging once you get the hang of it, and more satisfying when you finally nail a game-changing shot.\n\nThe character classes all seem very well-balanced, and they accommodate the full range of play styles. You can run-and-gun, snipe, charge into melee, or play defense, and you can be pretty successful at any of them if you learn how to do it right.  There's also plenty of synergy between different classes, so even an OK team can pull off effective combos.\n\nMaps are solid--enough space to maneuver but not enough that anyone disappears. The game could probably use another play mode or two, but the current ones have been enough to keep me busy.\n\nArt style is... Well, take a look! It's beautiful. It's fun to watch even when your team's getting rolled, it almost it feel less painful.\n\nAnd if you want dev support, you really can't beat it. Devs are in the chatroom for about half of every day.\n\nOnly thing that the game's been struggling with is its population... From what I hear, before the free week it was a ghost town, much like the in-game visuals. But a lot of people like myself joined for the free week and have decided to stay for the long haul, so the population issue is gradually ironing itself out. US matchmaking is good until about pre-dawn, EU is creeping upward, and Down Under is the only region that still needs a helping hand. But we're only halfway through with the promo as I type this and haven't even reached the weekend yet, so there's nowhere to go but up.\n\nFinal Note: The community that's already here has only a hint of salt in it... You get some overlap from the rest of the Interwebz, and there will be the occasional n00bs14y3r,  but nothing even CLOSE to the level that you'd expect from Dota2, LoL, etc. This may change as the game continues to grow, but right now it's in a pretty comfy place.","December 16, 2015","true","10.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Through those years I've never come across a more unbalacend game then this. Don't get me wrong I like the concept and the mix, but the execution is horrible. more so when they have had a early alpha. In most MOBAs I've played there is that sense that atleast one hero/champion/etc has a huge advantage over the other heroes/champoins/etc, but with time you find interesting ways to take down that advantage or limit it to an extent. In this game there are a good amount of advantages for those who  wanna play 2/3 spesific outlaws, if you use those 2/3 outlaws there is no way to lose, not skill and not time (even tho time also means new patches and updates) can fix that problem if you face them.\n\nOne of the first outlaws I tried was "The Wolf" or something similar. The bow has little dmg, but a pro is long range, but range doesnt really matter much when there is evade in a game (you have to consider the charge time for that range too).\nThe second ability is a prone mode where you have a dagger and you can charge someone and you have more speed to move with, but the instant you try to charge or jump someone you're faced with another charge up time and you are so slow that catching up with someone is impossible. At this you might say I could just run up and jump him as if he doesn't have time just evade and run away. Now if he doesn't run away he can always just shoot you once and you willl have to do the charge up time again. Yeah I think it's starting to sink in now. So you  have one ability taht you can rely on and it was almost no dmg. The other is a interruptable ability that does good dmg, but is impossible to do if you're up against someone over 12. The Kid can just empty his rounds into you without moving a muscle and you're dead.\n\nConclution: Get El Matador, The Kid and Gonzo, you'll never lose (you could switch El Matador with The Phantom) and have fun winning everything for the few hours you waste in this game. Otherwise get a game where the odds are equal and it's interesting to see who is the better, not who wanna spam "The Killcombo" the most.\n\nLegend out.","October 14, 2015","false","1.9"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

I then proceeded to matched against them 3 more times. Each time I lost about 140 points, since they slaughtered us at every turn. Couldn't even damage them.\n\nNot only did they have a perk point advantage, they were clearly better than us skill wise too.\n\nDid I mention we had only been playing for a few hours? And here we are in ranked, getting our ♥♥♥♥ pounded in, because the game’s player base seems to be dead on release.\nAs for an actual review I might as well add some points as to why I dislike the game. Besides the matchmaking.\n\nGAME PLAY\n\nIt's actually fun. Each Outlaw is unique both art wise and ability wise. The art is done by the same people as Darkest Dungeon, so expect lots of character in this game.\nThere are a few latency issues which let you get hit by things that you may have seen yourself dodge but that’s something that plagues numerous other games, so I don’t expect an indie game to be immune to these issues.\n\nThe game feels satisfying, and would be fast paced, if not for the ♥♥♥♥ing timers and animations and post-game screens you have to sit through during, and after a game. This stuff makes my skin crawl. The last thing I want to do after a defeat is be forced to do ♥♥♥♥ing nothing for a solid 30 seconds. This is pretty well known in games that pauses and animations are nice in a game, but only when used conservatively. Take portal for example. When you die in portal, you instantly respawn at the beginning of the puzzle/checkpoint. In this game, when I die there’s a death timer/waiting for your ally to kill everyone/die. And then the post-game stats and ♥♥♥♥ can’t be instantly skipped. I should be able to press a key twice and have that ♥♥♥♥ gone from my view, because half of it doesn’t even matter when you just want to queue up again. But you have to be punished even further for your failure.\n\nHUD\n\nThe hud is very minimal, which I like, but certain things aren’t displayed properly, with no way to know what they do. I understand that ~!!WOUNDED!!~ is bad. And that I should avoid that and try to do it to my enemies. But am I ♥♥♥♥ing slowed? Am I stunned/disarmed? Should I take cover should I not roll is my AIM ♥♥♥♥ed? Big red letters do me ♥♥♥♥ all if I don’t know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on.\nBesides from the total lack of information about status effects the hud doesn’t take up much screen space which, again, is always nice.\nThe camera angle naturally favors those who are beneath you, or yourself, if you’re below your enemy. This is because the camera angle is fixed at a tilt, and while visually pleasing means that your enemy will see you before you see them, in this case.\n\nIN GAME MENUS\n\nPorted straight from a console game folks. You can’t even change the horrendous bindings. I should be able to navigate the menu with one hand. Or at least be able to use my mouse. But I have to hit ♥♥♥♥ing enter. Ya know, that one key ♥♥♥♥ING MILES away from wasd. I thought this was a core of gameplay design? You bind that ♥♥♥♥ to spacebar. Always. No exceptions. It’s inconvenient and annoys the player.\n\nOVERALL\nGreat gameplay broken up by frustrating pauses in gameplay and bad Menus which only serve to frustrate the player.","October 13, 2015","false","8.4"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","1"

But i had to on this one.\nFirst of all they advertise this game as a game of skill , where every shot counts.  well that is false,\nAll the game ends up is either both teams charging at each other every match , or one team that just runs the entire match , but mostly it is just run towards each other and and smother , and it never changes , gets old real quick , its like counter strike , but not near as good , and counter strike is not good. Just two teams running at each other, And far as the skills go , well you have around 3 of those and get old real quick. And as far as a persons "skill" affecting the game? Not really , pretty much charge and button mash will do , thats what pretty much everyone does.\nAnother thing i found that i did not like is , after just a couple hours of play your toon has to move to ranked play.  You dont even have time to get a feel for your toon and your playing ranked, its just silly , Overall , the graphics i did like , something different and kinda cool. But game play is a big fat thumbs down , skill to play , very little , time before realize it is not worth what you paid , not quick enough to get money back unfortantly , but wont take a day. 12 hours tops.

What's the point in the game that is all about aiming and quick reflexes when every second enemy / team member has bad 1mb net connection and warps around the map?\n\nIdea and gameplay is exellent but the game is unplayable at it's current state. Also there are not many players since matchmaking (which basically just puts anyone possible in same match with anyone possible) takes sometimes up to 10 mins. Rounds last 20seconds - few minutes and waiting for new game takes long. Also atleast for me 2v2 feels too few. 5v5 and 10 v 10 would be more chaotic and fun.\n\nGame also suffers from countles graphics bugs which occurs 100% every round. Most notable is the blue map where everything is invisible exept players and this does not happen to everyone sametime so it makes you to be true underdog. Not being able to see where walls etc is when enemy can makes it quite hard to survive.\n\nAlso since people with toaster computers and hamster powered net connections usually DC before round even starts making you to fight alone versus 2 enemies which would actually be cool (I like challenge) otherwise but then you realize your enemies run on bikepowered net connections and warp around the map while you take dmg and get stunned from invisible bullets in all blue world where you can see only yourself.\n\nThe point is that all this would be "ok" if it happened once a while.

It's like a moba but without the farming leading to just pure combat which boils down to outtrading your opponent and managing your ammo and your stamina while keeping an eye on the both for your opponent. Under any normal circumstance I would recommend this game, however, I can't with Secret Ponchos. The biggest downfall of this game is that the game is practically dead on launch. I know it says the game is early access but to have only 10 people playing the game in the last 24 hours with an all time peak of 71 people playing as of 9/7/15 is just not acceptable.

Right now there seem to be plans for more than just 2v2 deathmatches, currently available, things like 2 player splitscreen, some form of single player matches, other than just a dummy shooting gallery. The game is also lacking some features like key binding, but that is in the works, and menu functionality with mice, is also on the list. These aren't terrible inconviences but could be a big negative for some. Overall, if these inconveinces are too much wait a couple months for a newer build to come out, or go nuts when the game is released, but DEFINITELY pick this title up if you like MOBAs, its fun, fast-paced, and a great experience.","August 23, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a game so close to being fantastic that it deserves a little more attention which I'm sure the devs are going to provide anyway.\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful, clear, informative art style, those character designs are incredible.\n- Slick controls that feel great to use.\n- Fantastic soundtrack for the most part\n- Core gameplay is extremely fun with deeper strategic layers slowly becoming more apparent as you play.\n- Level design is tight and levels don't feel larger than they need to be. Rich in character.\n\nCons:\n- Strange, arbitrary game mode restrictions (why only 2v2 in unranked and 8 player in private match?)\n- Characters unique abilities hidden in an in-game menu, which the game can't be paused while reading said information.  Making you vulnerable. Put those combo descriptions on the character selection screen instead.\n- Possible problem with ranked perks that boosts seasoned players even further ahead than newer players, which are often found in the same games due to either poor matchmaking or a small player base.\n- Tutorial seems to be bare-bones and doesn't feel like it covers all of the basics.\n- Really bad bot AI\n- Only problem with sound is the trumpet sound that is jarring and annoying when picking an online game / partying with other players. Maybe a slightly softer distant bell toll would help instead?\n\nAll the cons I've listed are really just nitpicks that seem like they can be patched out. Again, this is a great game held back by small problems and really deserves to be pushed just that little bit further. Me and my friends bought a 4 pack and don't regret it at all.","October 21, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I honestly didn't expect much, and bought the game because it was on a small sale and I was looking for more Local Co-Op games. Sad to hear there isn't any Local Co-Op (Yet, it is on the works), but what I found was an incredibly deep arena game, with an astoinishingly well made art style to acccompany it.\n\nEssentially you are a wanted man/woman/crazyperson in a town called Lonetree, where the only rule to exist is: hunt or be hunted. The game is technically a twin stick shooter, but that's a very rough explanation. I'd describe it as a mix between a moba, a twin stick shooter and old western films.\n\nYou start the game by picking 1 of 10 unique characters. Afterwards, you can practise with bots or go online for Unranked or Ranked play. And when you surprisingly quickly find a match, you get... decimated, and realise the game has such a high skill ceiling, you feel like you're in an open space. Combos, resource management, stressful decision making and more.\n\nHonestly, it's a hard game to describe and the only con of it is the small playerbase, which can be fixed by you buying the game. So whaddaya waitin' for? Get busy shooting, or get busy dying.","October 21, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mostly with the skill cards. Its where the life of the characters, and game, reside.\n\n-Typos (See Poncho's Skillcard)\n-Last few skill cards just repeat the short character bio which implies laziness compared to the slight expansion of the character backgrounds from the earlier characters.\n-I feel like practice mode could be polished up a bit, including adding the option to view skill cards.\n\nIt lacks a je ne se quai. Action happens, but theres no depth beyond shooting. What this game would wildly benefit from is characters with personalities. Currently they shoot and move in basic silence except for gunfire and muted grunts. They need quips, voices and interactions. We're at that point in videogaming where character depth is more than just the way they look, especially in a game that lacks any sort of story or exposition beyond a few sentences.\n\nIts fun, but the problem is the fact that it gets boring quickly. There is absolutely ZERO investment to make me want to keep going with the characters. Once you play them, thats all there is to them, theres nothing left to learn or unlock or discover about the most important part of a PvP fighting game.\n\nAlso, on a small personal thing, the inconsistency with the Solid White eyes being prevalent except for a few characters irks me.\n\nWouldnt pay 15 for it, not quite as is, it just feels a little unfinished and unrealized.\n","December 15, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art direction is likewise spectacular. Matchmaking, however, is absolutely abyssmal. The lack of offline content besides a 2 vs. 2 mode and a 1 vs 1 ladder Arcade mode really holds the game back as well for those who have trouble connecting. That all said, when you can get in a good match online, Secret Ponchos is easily one of the best twin-stick competitive shooters released in quite some time.\n\nThe variety of characters is welcome, and each handles distinctly. For example: the Matador is the close-range damage dealer, while KidRed peppers enemies with his six shooters, and Poncho controls the ebb and flow of battle with his shotgun and whip. The map selection also have several notable highlights, including a midnight saloon shootout and a crashsite from a train robbery gone wrong. The modes, however, are limited to Deathmatch (one life, no respawns, 3 vs. 3), Posse (Guard one VIP, take out the other team's VIP), and another mode that combines tug of war with traditional Team Deathmatch. There's also 1 vs. 1 fights, and those can feel more akin to a fighting game than you'd expect, but overall, most people will be interested in the team modes.\n\nIf I were to make a direct suggestion to the developers, I'd strongly advise for some form of cooperative multiplayer modes, and along with that, the possibility of a 5 vs. 5 mode. The maps feel like they could support larger scale battles, and fighting waves of bandits would be quite welcome as well. Most importantly though, I cannot emphasize this enough -- THE MATCHMAKING NEEDS FIXED. It is truly terrible at many points, especially when playing in a party with even just one friend. I know this is an indie production but really, this game needs to polish up the networking side of things if it wants to last.\n\nSo, should you get Secret Ponchos? Definitely if it's on sale, but at full price, the game lacks the polish it clearly has in other areas. The dev team have a strong direction and talent with game design that I hope they'll be able to put to use in future titles, but they have got to get someone to clean up the netcode.","December 16, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The cover system is neat and overall the gameplay is fast and results in furious matches that usually end in some appropriately epic way.  The maps are laid out well and have cool details to see as you dive around corners or behind tables, weave in and out of train cars, or run through an old town.

After the initial struggle from my lack of skill, the game started getting more and more interesting the more we played it.\nCovers became helpful, hiding became very important and I finally managed to keep enemies far from me.\n\nMy suggestion is, keep playing when you feel it's time to drop off, the game has MUCH more to offer once you get more used to it. It gets very interesting all that cover-stealth-shoot gameplay and I love how you can use the evade move not only to avoid being shoot, but also to cover long distance which makes extremely helpful when you need to take cover, hide and reload.\n\nStay tuned for further updates, it's time to play Secret Ponchos a bit more ;)\n\nFIRST REVIEW\n\nThe graphic is STUNNING, however the gameplay as of this date, felt extremely dull. Instead of promoting a somewhat ranged combat, we ended up playing mostly on short range (or even melee), and even there it wasn't really interesting.\n\nI'll wait until out of early access","June 6, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mostly with the skill cards. Its where the life of the characters, and game, reside.\n\n-Typos (See Poncho's Skillcard)\n-Last few skill cards just repeat the short character bio which implies laziness compared to the slight expansion of the character backgrounds from the earlier characters.\n-I feel like practice mode could be polished up a bit, including adding the option to view skill cards.\n\nIt lacks a je ne se quai. Action happens, but theres no depth beyond shooting. What this game would wildly benefit from is characters with personalities. Currently they shoot and move in basic silence except for gunfire and muted grunts. They need quips, voices and interactions. We're at that point in videogaming where character depth is more than just the way they look, especially in a game that lacks any sort of story or exposition beyond a few sentences.\n\nIts fun, but the problem is the fact that it gets boring quickly. There is absolutely ZERO investment to make me want to keep going with the characters. Once you play them, thats all there is to them, theres nothing left to learn or unlock or discover about the most important part of a PvP fighting game.\n\nAlso, on a small personal thing, the inconsistency with the Solid White eyes being prevalent except for a few characters irks me.\n\nWouldnt pay 15 for it, not quite as is, it just feels a little unfinished and unrealized.\n","December 15, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116988131/recommended/265750/","76561198116988131","oss","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116988131/","10 products in account","Secret Ponchos is an amazingly fresh and beautiful take on the twitch fighting genre. The developers have put together a very tight package where the artwork, style, learning curve, controls, music, environments, etc. are all extremely well considered, put together and complimentary. The minute you open the game, you notice the artwork and the design, and then as you play, you are happy to notice that the mechanics and gameplay hold pace and do not disappoint.\n\nIt's hard to classify this game in comparison to other games because it's not like much else I've ever played, but if I had to pull from other games I would say that it shares:\n- Twitch style controlling of a Street Fighter game (unless you're a button masher). It's not a point and unload your clip kind of game. Every shot is a skilled considered button push and can combo out with your other "moves" and every movement of your character is a considered move in relation to the positioning of your opponents and the map.\n- MOBA style arena. Not in that you have a set spawn point and half the map is kind of yours, but pretty much only in the way that you have an isometric viewpoint and there is a large arena where two teams battle (unless you're in free-for-all mode).\n\nThrow those elements into a fast paced beautiful spaghetti western environment and you've got yourself Secret Ponchos.\n\nAs for the game play: There are 10 characters to choose from and they all cater to different play styles and learning curves. Unlike street fighter, there is not a dozen or more moves to master. Each character has about 4-5 unique moves that can also potentially combo for devastating effects. But these moves are very nuanced in their execution and very reactive to the conditions around you. You never feel at a lack of moves/attacks to use when playing a specific character.\n\nSome characters you can jump right into and expect a couple kills per match, others you will need to master. All characters though - as I have experienced first hand - can be very deadly in professional hands. And this is the good thing: every character, and the game itself, have a high ceiling in terms of skill. Even the characters that are easy to immediately play with have a lot of subtle nuance that takes a long time to perfect. And how you play according to your environment and your opponents/teammates takes a long time to even begin to master.\n\nThis does create a skill deferential between the pros and the newcomers, but a rookie lobby, a supportive community, and an intelligent progression system (explained below) all help the fact that a relative rookie still has a decent chance at gunning down a pro a couple times per match (and it's not like a pro/rookie skill differential has prevented people from playing other games such as COD).\n\nThe manner in which your character progresses is one of my favourite aspects of this game. As opposed to an empty and overused "Experience Points = Level Up" sort of structure, the developers have gone with something that suits the genre and the vibe of a Wild West setting. Instead of collecting experience, you collect notoriety. And much like the real world, notoriety can come and go; you play very well and you gain notoriety, but if you play poorly, you will lose notoriety. For me this is a welcome change, and something I have been secretly desiring out of more games of late. No more players who don't cooperate with their team because they want to get the "throw back grenade achievement" (I'm looking at you COD Black Ops).\n\nEveryone feels like their neck is on the line and it makes the game play riveting and exhilarating. The important thing here too is that it's well balanced. A loss will never strip away so much notoriety that you will feel devastated and ready to quit the game. And for rookies starting out, each match calculates your odds of doing well, and the notoriety you gain/lose is in relation to those odds. So if you play a group of pros, you can still gain notoriety if you lost but still successfully dealt some damage or made some kills. TO NOTE: this progression is specific to each of your characters, so if you want to try out a new character or a new play style, you can do so without influencing the notoriety of your star player.\n\nAs you do gain notoriety, you get to drop a couple points into various skills (damage, reload, health, speed, etc). These points don't come often though and are well balanced so that the differences it creates between a rookie character and a pro character is noticeable but not so distancing that there is no competition between the two.\n\nEverything in this game (the setting, progression system, matches, etc.) leads to a very strong and cohesive immersive, addictive, fast paced game where you can really feel your character gaining notoriety, and feel your skills improve. On top of that it's fun!\n\nI would strongly recommend trying this title out as it's a wonderfully styled and scored adrenalin rush to play! And to top it off, there is a strong dev team that play the game and consider and respond daily to issues, ideas and concerns that the community has. Their supportive and friendly attitude seems to trickle down into the community, forming a supportive and friendly player base.\n\nAnd to those curious about the community of this pvp-only game: since launch it has been growing steadily and I have found no dead times where I couldn't find a match. I only see it getting better and I am looking forward to a growing strong and friendly player base!","October 15, 2015","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a game so close to being fantastic that it deserves a little more attention which I'm sure the devs are going to provide anyway.\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful, clear, informative art style, those character designs are incredible.\n- Slick controls that feel great to use.\n- Fantastic soundtrack for the most part\n- Core gameplay is extremely fun with deeper strategic layers slowly becoming more apparent as you play.\n- Level design is tight and levels don't feel larger than they need to be. Rich in character.\n\nCons:\n- Strange, arbitrary game mode restrictions (why only 2v2 in unranked and 8 player in private match?)\n- Characters unique abilities hidden in an in-game menu, which the game can't be paused while reading said information.  Making you vulnerable. Put those combo descriptions on the character selection screen instead.\n- Possible problem with ranked perks that boosts seasoned players even further ahead than newer players, which are often found in the same games due to either poor matchmaking or a small player base.\n- Tutorial seems to be bare-bones and doesn't feel like it covers all of the basics.\n- Really bad bot AI\n- Only problem with sound is the trumpet sound that is jarring and annoying when picking an online game / partying with other players. Maybe a slightly softer distant bell toll would help instead?\n\nAll the cons I've listed are really just nitpicks that seem like they can be patched out. Again, this is a great game held back by small problems and really deserves to be pushed just that little bit further. Me and my friends bought a 4 pack and don't regret it at all.","October 21, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I honestly didn't expect much, and bought the game because it was on a small sale and I was looking for more Local Co-Op games. Sad to hear there isn't any Local Co-Op (Yet, it is on the works), but what I found was an incredibly deep arena game, with an astoinishingly well made art style to acccompany it.\n\nEssentially you are a wanted man/woman/crazyperson in a town called Lonetree, where the only rule to exist is: hunt or be hunted. The game is technically a twin stick shooter, but that's a very rough explanation. I'd describe it as a mix between a moba, a twin stick shooter and old western films.\n\nYou start the game by picking 1 of 10 unique characters. Afterwards, you can practise with bots or go online for Unranked or Ranked play. And when you surprisingly quickly find a match, you get... decimated, and realise the game has such a high skill ceiling, you feel like you're in an open space. Combos, resource management, stressful decision making and more.\n\nHonestly, it's a hard game to describe and the only con of it is the small playerbase, which can be fixed by you buying the game.

Matchmaking is easy. The characters are quirky, and they appeal to a broad range of play styles. And small elements of the MOBA format are blended seemlessly with fast-paced isometric twitch shooting in such a way as to not be overbearing, complicated or inaccessible. Secret Ponchos is casual good times, and its community is a friendly, fun-loving one. The $9.99 customization DLC is well worth it too. Bombed-out Kid Red is pure hilarious eye candy.\n\nI can't reccomend it enough. In fact, Secret Ponchos is so damn good that I actually bothered to write a Steam review of it. Unthinkable!

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116988131/recommended/265750/","76561198116988131","oss","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116988131/","10 products in account","Secret Ponchos is an amazingly fresh and beautiful take on the twitch fighting genre. The developers have put together a very tight package where the artwork, style, learning curve, controls, music, environments, etc. are all extremely well considered, put together and complimentary. The minute you open the game, you notice the artwork and the design, and then as you play, you are happy to notice that the mechanics and gameplay hold pace and do not disappoint.\n\nIt's hard to classify this game in comparison to other games because it's not like much else I've ever played, but if I had to pull from other games I would say that it shares:\n- Twitch style controlling of a Street Fighter game (unless you're a button masher). It's not a point and unload your clip kind of game. Every shot is a skilled considered button push and can combo out with your other "moves" and every movement of your character is a considered move in relation to the positioning of your opponents and the map.\n- MOBA style arena. Not in that you have a set spawn point and half the map is kind of yours, but pretty much only in the way that you have an isometric viewpoint and there is a large arena where two teams battle (unless you're in free-for-all mode).\n\nThrow those elements into a fast paced beautiful spaghetti western environment and you've got yourself Secret Ponchos.\n\nAs for the game play: There are 10 characters to choose from and they all cater to different play styles and learning curves. Unlike street fighter, there is not a dozen or more moves to master. Each character has about 4-5 unique moves that can also potentially combo for devastating effects. But these moves are very nuanced in their execution and very reactive to the conditions around you. You never feel at a lack of moves/attacks to use when playing a specific character.\n\nSome characters you can jump right into and expect a couple kills per match, others you will need to master. All characters though - as I have experienced first hand - can be very deadly in professional hands. And this is the good thing: every character, and the game itself, have a high ceiling in terms of skill. Even the characters that are easy to immediately play with have a lot of subtle nuance that takes a long time to perfect. And how you play according to your environment and your opponents/teammates takes a long time to even begin to master.\n\nThis does create a skill deferential between the pros and the newcomers, but a rookie lobby, a supportive community, and an intelligent progression system (explained below) all help the fact that a relative rookie still has a decent chance at gunning down a pro a couple times per match (and it's not like a pro/rookie skill differential has prevented people from playing other games such as COD).\n\nThe manner in which your character progresses is one of my favourite aspects of this game. As opposed to an empty and overused "Experience Points = Level Up" sort of structure, the developers have gone with something that suits the genre and the vibe of a Wild West setting. Instead of collecting experience, you collect notoriety. And much like the real world, notoriety can come and go; you play very well and you gain notoriety, but if you play poorly, you will lose notoriety. For me this is a welcome change, and something I have been secretly desiring out of more games of late. No more players who don't cooperate with their team because they want to get the "throw back grenade achievement" (I'm looking at you COD Black Ops).\n\nEveryone feels like their neck is on the line and it makes the game play riveting and exhilarating. The important thing here too is that it's well balanced. A loss will never strip away so much notoriety that you will feel devastated and ready to quit the game. And for rookies starting out, each match calculates your odds of doing well, and the notoriety you gain/lose is in relation to those odds. So if you play a group of pros, you can still gain notoriety if you lost but still successfully dealt some damage or made some kills. TO NOTE: this progression is specific to each of your characters, so if you want to try out a new character or a new play style, you can do so without influencing the notoriety of your star player.\n\nAs you do gain notoriety, you get to drop a couple points into various skills (damage, reload, health, speed, etc). These points don't come often though and are well balanced so that the differences it creates between a rookie character and a pro character is noticeable but not so distancing that there is no competition between the two.\n\nEverything in this game (the setting, progression system, matches, etc.) leads to a very strong and cohesive immersive, addictive, fast paced game where you can really feel your character gaining notoriety, and feel your skills improve. On top of that it's fun!\n\nI would strongly recommend trying this title out as it's a wonderfully styled and scored adrenalin rush to play! And to top it off, there is a strong dev team that play the game and consider and respond daily to issues, ideas and concerns that the community has. Their supportive and friendly attitude seems to trickle down into the community, forming a supportive and friendly player base.\n\nAnd to those curious about the community of this pvp-only game: since launch it has been growing steadily and I have found no dead times where I couldn't find a match. I only see it getting better and I am looking forward to a growing strong and friendly player base!","October 15, 2015","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is and old west kinda stickfigure shooter, and my god it is amazing. I would no doubt recommend this game to anyone, it has alot of depth, the matches are intense and the skill ceiling on this game is  high as balls. I heard about the competitive side of Secret Ponchos had an astonishing potential and I kinda doubted it. Well it has.\nIf you like the amazing aesthetic this has to offer, old wild west appeals to you you should get this game for some Outlaw intense experience matches.\n\nNow I wish everything in this review was positive, I really really did because the game blew me away in surprise and sucked me in. But there is a big negative here and it is the community. People here are the friendliest I've ever seen in any game in years, but it is really really small.. If you are a late night time player, the sad truth at the moment is that you might not get any matches at all.. It takes sometimes a really long time to find a match, fortunatly because of this people tend to stick with each other after the match, so in my experience when you find one you are pretty much set and the next matches will be quick if not instant since the game gives you a rematch option.\n\nIt boggles my mind how the player base is so small for this amazing game, it really really REALLY deserves so much more. I could honestly see this game with a strong viewership on twitch for example it has that potential.\nI'd say this happened because of the poor advertising and proprer word spreading of the game. From my understanding this game has been in early acess for at least an year I think? And I've never heard of it. Ever. I can't see any place other than a very very small percentage of youtubers that make a few videos here and there to Secret Ponchos where I would find this game.\n\nNow I've been going to forums and the developers are aware and are going to implement features, possibly changing the "rules" for a bigger player base so there is hope since the developers are actually pretty active with the community it seems.\n\nSo honestly, I wish I could be a ♥♥♥♥ and not say this negative side just so more people would buy and the playerbase to grow, but I can't be that ♥♥♥♥. Would and do I still recommend it? YES. When you get a match is amazing, and since the game is NOT abandoned by any means witha ctive developers announcing they are going to further look and fix this issue I would say it is still a relative safe bet. Because honestly I know the developers know they made an amazing game. I know it is an amazing game and the fault I would put in very poor advertising. This game is a hidden gem, you just don't hear it anywhere.\nIf you like it get it, contribute to the playerbase, and rest assured the developers are here and not abandoning ship!\n\nSorry for the long rant","January 13","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is and old west kinda stickfigure shooter, and my god it is amazing. I would no doubt recommend this game to anyone, it has alot of depth, the matches are intense and the skill ceiling on this game is  high as balls. I heard about the competitive side of Secret Ponchos had an astonishing potential and I kinda doubted it. Well it has.\nIf you like the amazing aesthetic this has to offer, old wild west appeals to you you should get this game for some Outlaw intense experience matches.\n\nNow I wish everything in this review was positive, I really really did because the game blew me away in surprise and sucked me in. But there is a big negative here and it is the community. People here are the friendliest I've ever seen in any game in years, but it is really really small.. If you are a late night time player, the sad truth at the moment is that you might not get any matches at all.. It takes sometimes a really long time to find a match, fortunatly because of this people tend to stick with each other after the match, so in my experience when you find one you are pretty much set and the next matches will be quick if not instant since the game gives you a rematch option.\n\nIt boggles my mind how the player base is so small for this amazing game, it really really REALLY deserves so much more. I could honestly see this game with a strong viewership on twitch for example it has that potential.\nI'd say this happened because of the poor advertising and proprer word spreading of the game. From my understanding this game has been in early acess for at least an year I think? And I've never heard of it. Ever. I can't see any place other than a very very small percentage of youtubers that make a few videos here and there to Secret Ponchos where I would find this game.\n\nNow I've been going to forums and the developers are aware and are going to implement features, possibly changing the "rules" for a bigger player base so there is hope since the developers are actually pretty active with the community it seems.\n\nSo honestly, I wish I could be a ♥♥♥♥ and not say this negative side just so more people would buy and the playerbase to grow, but I can't be that ♥♥♥♥. Would and do I still recommend it? YES. When you get a match is amazing, and since the game is NOT abandoned by any means witha ctive developers announcing they are going to further look and fix this issue I would say it is still a relative safe bet. Because honestly I know the developers know they made an amazing game. I know it is an amazing game and the fault I would put in very poor advertising. This game is a hidden gem, you just don't hear it anywhere.\nIf you like it get it, contribute to the playerbase, and rest assured the developers are here and not abandoning ship!\n\nSorry for the long rant","January 13","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can no longer call this  my pick for Game of the Year.  In fact, I wouldn't even recommend the game.  If you want hardcore PvP, this isn't going to be it.  The lag issues as well as the way the devs have balanced mechanics have broken the game to the point where it will not be competitive.  If you want a seriously good free PvP game, try Brawlhalla.  In case the game becomes good again,  I will update this review, but as of right now, I cannot recommend this game to people reading my review.  Save your money and wait for this to go free to play.\n\nBelow is my previous review of the game at launch.\n\nI'm a hardcore PvP'er and 2015 has seen a complete lack of good PvP games.  Secret Ponchos has finally brought a breath of fresh air with their PvP Arena style combat.  This game takes my vote Game of the Year easily.  At the current price, it is well worth the money for the quality of graphics and polish on the game.  If you have been wanting a good PvP game, this is it.\n\nFair warning, the PvP in this is developed and there are really good players around.  The one drawback is that the game has not been marketed with tons of cash as it's an indy game.  So the game population is low and they're balancing between good quality matches and a reasonable queue time for matches.\n\nIf you decide to get this game, realize that you may fight some players who crush you.  It's okay, learn from your mistakes and grow and get better.  The game isn't for the faint of heart who easily give up and blame the balance of the game.  It's fairly balanced in 1v1s and very balanced in 3v3s.\n\nAgain, if you like arena style PvP, get this game and come try to take me down.  I could use fresh meat.","October 24, 2015","false","158.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is full PvP, easy to pick up but hard to master.\n\nHowever, my game craches 1/2 times. I can't even run the game smoothly at the lowest graphics. Speaking about graphics, the options are like non-existant. You cannot change the resolution. You can only change the overall graphics (low, medium, high), fullscreen or windowed mode and Vsync activation or not.\n\nI mean this game didn't look like you needed a really good computer to play without bugs.\nWith my computer I can run Ultra Street Fighter IV, League of legends, CSGO, Fifa 16 etc. with really good graphics, but even with the lowest graphics, I can't run this game smoothly.\n\nSo yeah, be careful before buying this game, because you need a better computer than it seems.\n\n\nExept from that, the idea of the game is really cool, the concept is amazing.\n\nLet's see in the future, but for now I don't even want to play it anymore.\n\nIt's hard to say but I don't recommand it yet. It took 6 years for the developpers to do this game so I don't think they will drop the project. Just waiting for the right updates.\n\nEDIT: The developper got back to me after this review to ask for my specs etc. I forgot to answer but today i launched the game to see if anything was better and the game run smoothly now with high quality.\n\nSo you can forget about all the cons in my review because they have been solved somehow.\n\nBuy the game and enjoy :) Help them get a wider community","October 21, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The community is small but dedicated and the developers are great about listening to feedback and having visibility in chat/forums.  The game is fairly balanced, with characters being tuned up or down as needed.  Small changes are made which is a good way to balance as no character is super weak or super strong, at least in my opinion.
