I resisted trying this game for quite a while because of the price.  All that wasted time I could have been playing.  Got it on my birthday.  Instead of letting my wife take me out to dinner that night, i ordered pizza and played P&S all night.  After 16 hours of game time, I finally completed the final tutorial.  Each of the four tutorial missions were themselves emotional rollercoasters of "I got this" to, "oh crap, I'm screwed" to, "oh my god, i might just pull this off."  No, i'm not being sarcastic.  Instead of feeling screwed by a random number generator, every misteak I made was a quick lesson in how not to do that again.  I would try a different approach, only to see the AI adjust and respond.  "Why won't the enemy advance into my specially designed killing zone? Damn!"\n\nThe gameplay is NOT what I thought it would be.  More chess than "Total War" but that's a good thing.  The odd thing is the battles somehow feel more real than the "Total War" series.  Initial set up and planning are much more important and changing can be diffacult.  Planning is more important than timing and the battles feel back and forth instead of just tipping point.  The tutorials will take you though open battle, assaulting fortified positions, ambush and gurella tactics.  Not the usual, "take point A in X number of turns" nonsense.  I assume this is how tabletop miniature wargaming feels, if you're patient enough to do that kind of thing.  Apparenlty P&S is based on an esablished tabletop game, so the mechanics and balance are spot on, you just dont have do math or have all day for a turn(though you'll spend all day playing anyway).\n\nI havent even touched the campaign and skirmish generators, so if i ever compleate the four huge  historical campaigns I can generate endless hypothetical conflicts.  I don't like to use the term "endless replayability" but that how alot of people describe chess right?  I don't think I have ever bothered to write a "review" on here, much less a novella trying desperatly to persuade you to buy this game with my crap spelling and run on sentances.\n\nTL DR_ If you think this is the kind of thing you might like but you just don't know if its worth the price, let me tell you it is! Cant recommend enough if you like history and strategy!","December 27, 2015","true","95.5"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","39","42","4","1"

Backbone unit of most armies being a combined Pike and Shot formation that has evolved from huge 2000 men pike squares by adding the shot and making them smaller.\n\nMain focus of the game is on battles which are challenging and chaotic. Player choices for each unit are seemingly simple: move, shoot or charge into melee. Charging removes control from the player: melee continues until one side breaks and is automatically pursued.  Automatic pursuit can be bad or good: pursuers can run into the thick of the enemy and expose their flanks, wander off for several turns until control is regained or they can chain charge and rout a big chunk of enemy battle line.\n\nUnits have a momentum: turning takes time and can expose flanks, ZOC and priority target rules drastically reduce options when close to the enemy and charge takes all control from the player as unit tries to hammer its way through the enemy lines. Main attack directions must be well planned as opportunity to disengage vanishes rapidly.\n\nAI is very good. Historical battles have a great variety: offensive, defensive, unit types evolving from Swiss pike squares to Swedish salvo, from Gendarmes to Cromwellian horse.  Completing all 40 historical battles in the original version took me over 100 hours.\n\nNew campaign aspect seems to be a great addition: not too complex (majority of the time is still spent fighting battles) but still offering some real choices.  Random battle generator used in campaign and skirmishes is pretty good.\n\nBasics are learnable from the tutorial battles but these will leave some important things unclear: ZOC and priority charge target rules, cohesion effects of artillery fire, interactions between terrain and different unit types etc. Reading the pdf manual is recommended.\n","August 15, 2015","true","114.2"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","40","46","0","1"

Bought this as a BD present to myself a week ago, and if it weren't for other committments of time, I would easily be closing in on 100 hours by now.\n\nThis game is somewhere between the tactical simplifications of Paradox and the complications of Total War, with just a whisper thin strategic overlay and persistent universe that makes one battle matter because its effects carry over into the situation you will face whatever happens afterward in both the strategic and tactical conditions.\n\nBattles may be small, or may be enormous, and the feel of the era's formations is authentic and immersive (I cannot count the number of times one or another of my son's have come in to see what is on my monitor that has called them away from theirs because of loud, and I hope, at least creative cursing).  If you like the time period you _will_ get carried away with the simple to learn but hard to master game mechanics, and fairly granular difficulty levels.\n\nYou won't be seeing individual sprites like you would in TW, so have a look at some playthroughs and if you aren't hooked, this may not be for you...   If you think to yourself 'that looks like fun' - dammit man, it is.   I can't see the end of this time sink, so if you have classes or projects, or something that HAS to be done by a spcific date, LOOK AWAY!\n\nQuickly.\n\nSeriously you don't really need more than a couple of these reviews, just find a couple of playthroughs on YT, and you'll figure out whether you should get this.  You'll know if you find yourself looking for more after the first one or two playthroughs, whether you should probably be a player not.\n\nIn the words of  Robin WIlliam's in Dead Again: "Cozy Carlisle: Someone is either a smoker or a nonsmoker. There's no in-between. The trick is to find out which one you are, and be that. If you're a nonsmoker, you'll know.

Even if I know I will enjoy a game, I typically wait for patches and a large sale.  Not with this game, though.  I bought it the morning it became available, installed it as quickly as I could, and have enjoyed it immensely.\n\nThis game is great, but not just because it offers in-depth historical detail for twenty different nations over around 6 time periods each (some nations have even more time period options than that) or because the battles with those units give so many different viable tactical options.  This game is great because there is that complexity (at both the campaign and battle level) in mechanics, yet everything still feels intuitive and easily understood, and very few games really manage to walk the line between complex and confusing.\n\nBecause of the stat system, terrain system, and excellent A.I. battles and campaigns feel more "real" than in many other video games: when a tactic works, you know why, and it seems like the same events would plausibly have happened in a real battle using the same units and tactics.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game because of the excellent job it does both at demonstrating the warfare of the time period (which is not often represented in popular culture of any kind) and as a wargame in general.","August 13, 2015","true","20.7"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","36","43","2","0"

I've pretty much been playing it straight for about 8 hours now and for a turn-based strategy with simple mechanics, the game is tough as nails. Trust me, the AI knows when it's soldiers are stronger than yours and will not hesitate to either force you into melee or keep it's shooting distance. The key of the game is to utilize the various units you're given and to force around 60% of the enemy army to rout. The campaign is the newest addition and it operates rather simply, you've got manpower, you've got money and you've got supply limits. The more territory, the more money and manpower but because of supply limits, it's almost impossible to completely overpower your enemy with sheer numbers. You'll have to succeed with brain and unit composition.

A Large battle will end around 60% losses of Forces, and have around one Hour of Realtime.

It covers the less well known Italian Wars, English Civil Wars and Thirty Years Wars. The nation's have their own indiviual flavours, from the flamboyant Royalist Cavaliers to the all-but-tercio-crushing Polish Winged Hussars.\n\nThe campaign feature adds a whole new dimension to the game that concentrates more on the raising and movement of armies, so it's definitely NOT like Total War Campaigns.\n\nThe battles are in my opinion, brilliant. There are several difficulties you can choose from, from having to think about deployment and flank maneuvers to begging that kuirassier unit to destroy the enemy's horse unit so you can charge into the enemy's flanks in the next turn or your line is broken.\n\nIn this game the battle can rely on a lone skirmishing musket detachment sit atop a hill fending off a right wing attack whilst you struggle to hold your left flank, or you could watch your pike and shot unit chase their vanquished foe, leaving said flank vulnerable to exploitation to greedy hussars.\n\nInevitably in the endgame the battles turn to swirling melee's in the confusion of gunpowder smoke as you mop up/get mopped up by the enemy,  but it is an enchanting game in it's simplicity and effectiveness nonetheless.\n\nIt's a yes from me\n20/15","December 12, 2015","true","77.4"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","17","18","3","0"

The period is one that is rarely seen in the form of a game, and the mechanics of the game are well constructed. However, there are a few things I wish to bring up.\n\nFirstly, after playing several offensive style games, including seiges on forified positions, I have to rasie a concern. I have noticed that artillery crews, while in melee have an EXTREAM advantage over regular lines of pikemen and musketeers. Historically, an Artillary crew would consist of 4-6 men, and mabye a rear guard of a few pikemen. Considering that artillery has been divided into 3 cannons per section, that would mean that whilst in melee, there would only be up to 18 enemies. However, my lines of supperior pike and shot. at almost full strength, ALWAYS loose in melee to cannon crews.\n\nI decided to test this issue, and have counted casulties from four seperate encounters.\n\nAttack 1: 14-0\nAttack 2: 9-0\nAttack 3: 12-0\nAttack 4: 8-0\n\nAfter a course of four melee encounters on cannon crews, I have lost 43 men, and the enemy lost nothing. I belive that this needs to be adressed, 18 men, armed with sabres shouldnt be able to fend off a line of Pike and Shot at next to full strength.\n\nNext on the agenda is the Graphics. I understand the idea of using historical artwork as a basis for your graphics, which is actually not a bad idea on paper, but when actually applied to the game, makes it look rather bland and cheap. For a game that costs as much as it does, the graphcs should really be polished to a resonable quality. This game costs twice as much as some Total War titles, so it couldnt hurt to invenst in some better graphics design.\n\nAnother feature I would like to see is a free roam camera, this would allow for the combatents to overview that battlefield  from any direction they so choose, however, you have limited it to only two options, which dosn't provide much variety.\n\nThat being said, I have quite enjoyed the game. Its classic strategy playstyle, mixed with a very intreting period, that has made it an instant favourite of mine. I enjoyed the campaigns greatly, as well as the custom features.  I would recommend that game for its playability, but be ready to pay a heafty price.\n\nOverall, it is a very enjoyable game, and has great playability. However some game mechanics need to be ballanced, the price should be much lower for the graphic quality and new features need to be implemented. Other than that, I have nothing else to say about the game, only that I really enjoyed the period and hope to see more titles like this in the future.\n\n","February 6","true","8.4"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","1"

Honestly if this game was in real time, it would be my dream game, well almost, it would have to be on a much smaller scale because some battles are just massive.\n\nWhat I like most about Pike and Shot though is much like in history if a foot unit is engaged in battle it cannot disengage until one side routs, and once a unit routs the winning units can go charging after them leaving a hole in your line. Units cannot magically change direction, cavalry has to wheel around, units breaking affect units near them, your worst unit can save the day and your best can break at the worst possible moment, all these things so desperately missing from other games is here. Unit cohesion too, something games like Total War are completely oblivious to, is incredibly important.

"Campaigns" offers the player even more ways to match up against a capable AI that will punish your battlefield blunders. In "campaign mode" armies gain experience in battle -- but, importantly, the victors gain confidence while the vanquished lose confidence. And so, crush the enemy two or three times and see your own small army grow in battlefield ability and "elan". That's neat. The "campaign mode" also models basic economics and attrition -- so split yout forces to keep them fed and concentrate to enagage in battle. That said, the AI will only accept battle if the odds are reasonable, so there's quite a bit of to-ing and fro-ing on the campaign map. When you're done with the various campaigns, there are many stand-alone scenarios, a random-battle generator, and a detailed scenario editor. At the higher difficulty levels, the AI is a tough opponent.","August 16, 2015","true","13.3"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

I to this point can not say that I have played every single army in this game, with over a hundred hours of time spent on the title, and I would probably claim to have mastered only a handful of the ones I tried\n\n+ tons of historical scenarios. For the history buffs and scenario players out there, theres a lot of stuff to tackle. Some of the most iconic and famous battles of the covered era are in the game, and while some of them are really tough, they add just so much more content. I personally am a skirmish player though, so I cannot say too much about their overall quality.\n\n+ Historical accuracy and flavour. For some bizarre reason there are not many gamesset in any of the periods covered by the game. So that alone is a unique selling point. The dynamics of the game change fundamentally with the development of arms and armor and tactics as well. And since it ranges from Landsknechts and the ver first Arquebuses to the first Bayonets, your in for a lot of variety and rarely seen Armies. As far as I can tell the historical accuracy is also very high, with the few units I or armies I felt are performing different then I expected, the community and developers were quick to cite historical sources for their actual performance (Haeselrigs Lobsters come to mind immediately) Which leads me to the nxt point.\n\n+ Developers are active in the forums. While not the most prolific and active steam group around, if you have bug reports, questions on game mechanics or historical stuff, a developer usually enters the thread. This is always a plus.\n\n+ Smart AI. The AI in this game is one of the most capable I've seen in a Tactis game in a long while. Especially, and to my personal preference this is really important, in Skirmishes. Everybody can fully script an AI for a premade scenario that works on predefined paths, but the AI of this game "understands" enough of the systems and balance involved to adapt to almost any battlefield and situation its handed. Especially when you are new to the game, expect to loose battles, get outmaneuvered and outsmarted by the AI a few times at least. Its not without its flaws, but still one of the best programmed and adaptable AIs I've seen in a Videogame that is not a chess simulator. It know which units are strong against what, looks for flank and rear charges with deadly efficiency, and seems to be recognising terrain features quite decently. It'll also shift its reserves to where they are needed. Compare this to a lot of mainstream and niche titles where the AI isnt even able to handle the most basic battleplans outside of scripted scenarios, and you are in for a good time.\n\n+ Limited Randomness. While there is a lot of RNG involved in the game, the conditions of battle and units involved count a  lot more then dicerolls. While extreme dicerolls do of cause happen, 90% of the battles end up being decided by the better executed plan and troop composition, not by extraordinary heroics or catastrophic failure of your troops.\n\n+ Editor and easy moddability. The Game comes with a great looking editor for maps and scenarios, that I honestly havent delved into too much as of yet, but there is a lot of additional content for download straight in the game. Including a few additional nations and a mod for the war of the roses.\n\n+ Campaigns. As in the title of the game, there are campaigns with a strategic map. Which add just that much more planning, strategy and consistency to your skirmishes. Its no total war, but its definitely an enjoyable addition to the game. The big historical ones also include a few unique conditions and special elements (like starting with strong swedish forces as gustavus adolphus during the 30 yeas war, but only being able to recruit from a german list after the start of the campaign).\n\n+ Multiplayer PBEM. I love playing by email, it fits my schedule much better than sitting down for hours at a time just playing a game. And in my opinion no turn based game has an excuse to ship without this function.\n\nCons:\n\n- Graphical fidelity and Polish. I personally do not care about this one at all, but I see how it might put a lot of people off this game in an instant. While I personally like the clear visuals and the reference of historical battle paintings in the style of units, its by no means a pretty or spectacular game. The Menus, Tooltips and UI are also very basic at best.\nThere are some unnecessary or misleading stats in the game as well (like the melee power value, which is just an abstraction of the actual system and should not be trusted). So prepare to read the manual.\n\n- Repetition. Again not a con for me personally. But if you are looking for variety, you wont find it here. P&S does tactical turn based battles. It does them very well. But its the only thing it does. If you want a ton of different things to do in your game, or you are looking for a lot of special and unique mechanics to diversify playstyles and factions, this is not your game. Also while I praised the variety of army lists under pros, some nations, as in history, dont really change that much throughout the game. If you are playing ottomans, you are getting the same stuff in most timeframes for example, just with variances in terms of armamane t(bows, arquebus, muskets)\n\n- Limited Campaigns. The Campaign Mode, while a fun addition, is definetely not as deep as many other games who offer a strategic layer. There is no building or development involved, no special actions or setups. The kind of battle situation you get is completely up to the AI. And sometimes it seems a little occult if you get a dug in defense or your trrops just run. Again: it is all about the actual battles. The strategic layer is a nice addition, but if you want this to be your core experience, this is not your game. Also no multiplayer campaigns :(\n\n- Some Weaknesses in the AI. While overall the AI is excellent, as any AI it still has a few weak points. It absolutely refuses to perform any kind of organized retreat and can be goaded into attacking superior formations. Its also very very very bad at using and countering skirmishers in my experience. It does rarely fight skirmishers with anything that is not a skirmishers. Its also a bit passive at the beginning of many battles\n\n- sometimes limited control over your units. While I personally enjoy this a lot, a lot of players don'T. your units are limited by zones of control and priority charge targets, and you loose direct control for a few turns after they win a melee fight. I think this makes battles a lot more tense, and it feels more like commanding an actual army to me, but some people hate not having full control. Some of these Interactions feel a little awkward sometimes as well.\n\n- Multiplayer limited to company servers.\nWhile there are no problems or limitations to the multiplayer functionality, the PBEM is handled through servers by the developer. If at any day or time they discontinue support for this game, you might be left without MP functionality in the worst case.\n\nOverall 9/10. Great SP experience, and playing it with a friend in MP is the closest I've been to a good tabletop wargame session in a long time. More than worth the pricetag.","May 2","true","134.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I never looked back. This is an awesome tactical game. There are some things that are actually an improvement over Battle Academy in my view--the slower moving units make the I-go-you-go more realistic as a game format. But really one of the main things that make it amazing is the occasional uncontrolled actions of your units on the battlefield when they rout the enemy and set off in hot pursuit, rest of the battle be damned. Also I read that some people were put off by the graphics of the pike & shot units--looking like little sheds moving around the battlefield--and I was a bit as well... until I saw that the developers had faithfully designed the images that way to replicate how those units were drawn in depictions of battles at the time. Now I think they look great, reminding me of those Renaissance pictures. Finally, the more I read about this era of warfare, the more I realize that they developed the game to nicely emulate the battlefield tactics and realities. All in all I would definitely recommend this game.","August 29, 2015","true","116.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","1"

This is all about putting your units on the right fronting and planning where you want to fight - don't expect the graphics to be fancy or detailed, or you'll be disappointed by the little squares of foot troops, cavalry and cannons, which don't even deteriorate as they take fire.\n\nAs a war game, it's a great purchase for fans of early modern warfare. But casual gamers beware: the big problem with the period is that in some of the campaigns there's very little to distinguish between the two sides. The English Civil War units start off largely identical (with the Royalists having better cavalry), and this can lead to grinding matches rather than games where you can show off your tactical flare. Still, a solid game worth the time of turn-based strategy fans.","August 16, 2015","true","5.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

There is only a marginal learning curve, however, the game can be played learning by pure experience. You probably will only read the manual if you really want to understand what's happening, but a bit of muscle memory can be developed from pure experience gained with each battle.\n\nI was planning on leaving the review short, but surprisingly 89% rated my review positive so I will add more to it. As other reviews might have said, the time period that Pike & Shot covers is rarely covered in any game, whether it is PC or console. While I will note that there are probably seasoned boardgames/tabletops (lots too) that cover this period. The manual for Pike & Shot will give you a brief description of the time period, and describes the progressively development of european warfare from the italian wars up until the thirty years war. Thanks to the latest update, Le Roi Soleil, the game officially covers any major units from 1400 [above] to 1700 [below]. The game offers so much content in terms of scenario and endless battle lists to experiment with, it is definitely well worth the price, especially noting that even the multiplayer is very active. There is a lot of units, and while I'm not sure if all the nations have their own special units, most of the nations in Pike and Shot has their own type of units during the time. If you want some backstory of the release of the game, the first release was just Pike and Shot, and then a DLC expansion Tercio to Salvo. The base game itself was 39$ US and the expansion was 14$. Later, the developers announced a campaigns portion of the game. (Before there was just the skirmish mode and 40 scenarios covering various conflicts of the time period). When campaigns was releases, they combined both Pike and Shot and Tercio to Salvo together with Pike and Shot: Campaigns and then later released a free dlc Le Roi Soleil shortly after to bridge any gaps between 1494-1698. Not only after all that but they then decided to list the product as 39$, therefore, I don't think there is anyone ever again going to say, the price is too much for this game, because they could have released all of it in separate portions, which they did not.\n\nOverall, a very good game. If is well worth it because it's one of the few games that really covers the aspect of Europe's innovation of warfare that was happening in the 1600 and 1700 century.","November 23, 2015","true","46.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The skirmish is too ease for me. You can win easily by concentrate your cav on one flank. On the other hand, the historical battle and campaign are difficult for noobs like me. (Yes, you can win New Port and a few other battles, but most battles are difficult because you are out numbered) So I would not recommand it to noob wargamers.","May 26","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
