"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LuxanQualta/recommended/41900/","LuxanQualta","LuxanQualta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LuxanQualta/","114 products in account","The Bard's Tale is a great casual RPG that takes  you back to gaming as it was nearly ten years ago. So be prepared for a top down third person view most of the time.  What makes it most enjoyable are the bawdy humor in the dialog and the lyrics to the songs.\n\nOur hero in the game, The Bard, is not really a hero; but a scounderal given to snarky comments and possessed of an ability to get himself into trouble.  His comments are not limited to dialog with NPC's.  He is equally capable of taking issue with the narrator and both seem to have a mutual hate relationship which adds to the fun.  You'll also encounter Scottish, English and French accents with a healthy dose of Scottish words for things, which is fitting for story based on legends from the Orkney Islands of Scotland.\n\nThe Bard needs to recruit a team to help rescue a damsel in distress and true to his character, he's not willing to help without a reward, which the damsel offers.  That offer ought to make you chuckle.  Along the way you'll summon many creatures and finally figure out which ones are most useful to you.  After that you'll have an opportunity to really wreak mayhem and get yourself into some interesting situations.  The game is full of cliche's on purpose and they spice it up instead of detract from game-play.  And of course there are always complications along the way to add dimension to the game.\n\nThe screen resolution choices are based on what was available at release time.  Don't fuss over them too much.  Pick the largest resolution with the same ratio as your screen and it ought to look fine anyway.  Works fine on a 1900x1200 monitor.\n\nIt can be played with a controller, but you may find the onscreen prompts to be confusing and awkward.  If you do use a controller, you can find a useful list of controls at http://www.gamefly.com/Rent-The-Bard%27s-Tale/109860/GameplayControls/ - seriously though, the game is best player with a mouse and keyboard.  It just works better for a game this old.\n\nThe original game was released in 1985 and twenty years later this version was released with much improved graphical content and music.  If you want the full retro experience, the menu system will let you load up the original game and have a go at it.\n\nIf you want to get a feel for the music and dialog in the 2005 version of the game, I would recommend these YouTube videos:\n\n*  The Tale of the Nuckelavee\n*  The Bard's Tale Silkbeard and the Viking Song\n*  Here's to the Bard\n*  The Chosen One #4 (There are several variations of this song and all of them have an Oompa Loopa feel to them right down to ending with a Diddly-Do.)\n\nI just replayed a bit of the game on my Win gaming rig, but it will play equally well on a computer with low graphics capabilities.  Worked just fine on a stripped down Mac Mini when I played it a few months back. (Disclaimer - used non-Steam version on my Mac.)","December 4, 2013","true","5.0"," 65 of 71 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","65","71","2","0"

The game is short enough (about 20 to 25 hours of gameplay tops, and you level cap could be achieved easily) but very funny and costs every cent of its price.\n\nThe strongest part of the game are its witty dialogues and excellent voicing, however the plot is not so bad too and jokes are good (and yes, I’m almost forty). Combat is simple, especially with a bow and easy mode (which affects only start attributes and number of save points, so don’t bother with harder difficulty). This game is really a game, not some kind of computer sport where you need huge guides on spell usage and skills allocation. Still, the summons are fun and efficient, the weapons are sparse but don't become obsolete too fast. You are free to experiment. Save points number and location are well chosen. Songs and music are awesome! I sing them under my nose now and then.\n\nIn short I like the game, the way it is designed, its gameplay and humour. If you are not combat-obsessed power gamer try it. If you are, still try it to for a change.","October 30, 2014","true","65.9"," 57 of 60 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","57","60","0","0"

Well worth playing just for that! And you'd be surprised how much is based on real world mythology and places.\n\nThere are essentially two main characters in the game - the eponymous Bard, whose misadventures you follow and whom you control directly, and The Narrator, who holds the Bard in great contempt, never failing to throw in some sarcastic commentary. There's fourth wall to be broken for sure, and generally the game does instill this idea that it is a tale, sort of reenactment you're witnessing, rather than directly participating in, at least that's how it worked for me - I would place myself, perhaps paradoxically, more next to The Narrator, who's spinning the tale, rather than the Bard, who's living (reliving?) it.\n\nThe story mostly revolves around Bard being a Chosen One, enduring trials and tribulations to save a princess, although his motives are clear: coin and cleavage, and definitely not saving the world. Which rapidly enters worse and worse state. Which may or may not be related to Bard's questing around. Nothing really to dwell on much, you're here pretty much to enjoy the ride.\n\nI finished it on hard difficulty, but I wouldn't really bother if I were you, it only serves as annoyance really rather than a proper challenge, and everything can be easily cheesed anyway, with you shooting offscreen enemies with bows, minmaxing dexterity and rhythm (as a bard, you can summon variety of allies and rhythm makes them stronger), so playing it easy just lets you enjoy the ride more.\n\nIf you're unaware, it's well worth pointing out that none other than Brian Fargo is behind this game, one of industry titans (does Fallout ring a bell? something he was personally responsible for, not mentioning other great titles he was more or less involved with, and most recently, Kickstarter backed great promises of Torment and Wasteland 2). You really should cast away any doubts with regard to writing quality this game has to offer (mind though, again, it's not a "serious" title, and not big one either, giving off somewhat indie, passion project vibe rather than triple-A vibe Interplay could muster and inXile not so much, at least until Kickstarter and ever growing technological advances.. but I digress; look the guy up on Wikipedia if you don't know who he is).\n\nOh, it's bad luck to be you.\nA chosen one of many isn't new\nWhen you think you're full of luck\nin the bullocks you'll get struck\nOh, it's bad luck to be you.","July 12, 2014","true","37.6"," 47 of 50 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","47","50","0","3"

The game is something of a fractured fairy-tale and focuses more on poking fun at the fantasy/adventure/rpg genre than creating just another entry in the sea of fantasy rpgs. You play as The Bard (voiced by Cary Elwes) who is more interested in women, wine, and coin than adventuring. He uses his magic for his own personal gain. Being pulled into an adventure to save a damsel in distress and stop an evil sorcerer was the last thing on his mind. So of course... that's what happens. And so our story begins... The game serves more as a vessel for crude humor, snarky remarks, and breaking the 4th wall. This may not be for everybody but certain lines are bound to make you chuckle. As for the gameplay, it's not bad at all. The game is solid, simple, and different from most fantasy games. Rather than having convoluted tech trees and a long list of abilities, The Bard's Tale focuses on simple top-down combat and using summons. My main complaint is the repetitiveness of the combat. Some segments felt like they were there to pad the game time and give you more experience but gaining new summons and the occasional weapon upgrade help to keep things a bit more fresh. Overall, I had a lot of fun playing this game and enjoying some sharp wit and silly songs while exploring a unique Scottish fantasy setting.\n\nFor those who are fans of the original games, the original Bard's Tale trilogy from the 80s now comes with this game. I haven't played them but I've heard that The Bard's Tale (2004) hardly resembles the original games. With 4 games in 1, this may be enough to hold you until the release of the newly kickstarted The Bard's Tale IV.\n\n7/10","June 13, 2015","true","22.0"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","25","26","0","0"

There are even fewer RPGs.  This is one of them.  With the amazing vocal talents, excellent music, laugh-out-loud funny comments, asides, and conversations, this game will forever give me a smile.\n\nAs with the majority of RPGs, you're a low-level schmo who gets 'invited' to partake on an ever-expanding adventure where you ascend the level tree, getting bigger weapons, fighting bigger monsters, and eventually get the girl, and live happily ever after.  Except in this case, the game shows that things aren't quite peachy, and seem to go downhill, rather than up.\n\nThe game shows you the wonderful side-effects of your murderous misanthropy, as you gaily stab, shoot and zap your way across a beautiful scottish and norse-themes fantasy land... Whether you follow the plot, or try to deviate from it, the wonderful writing keeps you amused, and on your toes, guiding you in the right direction at all times.\n\nThere's a LOT in this game, although it sometimes doesn't feel that way.   The level-grinders will find a lot to keep them amused, the magic-lovers, the archers, the swordsmen, will all find that the balance is quite nice (although I think the bow may be slightly under-powered compared to the sword, but only by a fraction, and the ability to sit out of the action and pepper opponents with arrows is fun enough.).  I've played this through as both sword and bow, and both are very playable.\n\nI can heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good old-fashioned RPG, but wants something with its tongue firmly wedged in its cheek.    Wonderful on both PC and android, it's a great game for whiling away the hours.\n\nThe voice acting of the wonderful Tony Jay will forever be missed.  His voice lives on in all the games and TV media he did.  You should play this, just to hear his wry humour and phenomenal voice.\n\nThanks  InXile!

I would Recommend it to "Old" and "New" fans, but; I'd say, it you do not like a Boarish, Crude, Sexist, Male Anti-Hero, Protagonist, then maybe it's not for you... but I'd at least can comfort you that Everyone, including the Narriator, seem to hate him, and the "4th Wall" jokes, seemingly over the top at times actually made me laugh, but the Dark Humor, and Lighter Humor of the Game is around the Misery and Hell the Bard has to go through to "Rescue", the "Princess" again no spoilers, but that makes me laugh... Good luck knowing you get what you sow, and literally the Endings all three are good, the "Neutral Ending, while semi-dark is kinda funny, and I loved the Dance off with the Zombies Vs Skeleton-Zombies (A.K.A., the "You Got Served" Scene), too funny and original.\n\n\nStory is great, actors are original, and your choices of "Snarky" or "Polite" at "Certain Points" of this game are ironically funny, again no spoilers...

As you venture through the game you'll encounter all manner of singing goblins, hilarious misunderstandings, and of course, your own personal bard who doesn't so much want to adventure as get laid.\n\nPlaying as an all around shady individual in a hilarious atmosphere is good fun but the majority of the mechanics in the game are noticably dated at this point.  I recommend the game for those who enjoy humorous stories that don't take themselves too seriously and for those who had a blast in old-school action RPGs (Baldur's Gate or Champions of Norrath on consoles come to mind).  I do not recommend it for people looking for anything groundbreaking in today's era or those looking for a game with complex mechanics.\n\nA good game as long as you go into it expecting it to be what it is and not something more.","May 25","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You level up abilities which in turn allows you to specialize in summoning, melee, bows, etc. Worth a play. Around 12-15 hours or so with one or two optional sidequests.

Visually the only issue I noticed was\nas the game wasn't designed for 1920x1080, the overhead view was\nlacking a bit in peripheral vision, making it difficult to see far ahead.\n\nThe level design does hint at its' age, and although it isn't bad,\nand ties in well to the world map, it does harken back to ye old "05.\nIt does a good job of showing different atmospheres, but does get\nrepetitive as you travel between the main towers of the game.  That\ncombined with the limited combat makes for a stretched out feel, and\ntakes away from the enjoyment of gameplay.\n\nThe UI is well done, and every object in the game has the potential\nfor synergy with other objects.  One big plus is that unwanted loot\nis automatically changed to money, eliminating the need for constant\nreturn trips to merchants, or constant inventory management.  As a\nself-admitted loot ♥♥♥♥♥, I found this to make the game stronger by\nplaying around its' limitatons.\n\nOverall, this game is well balanced, has a strong and entertaining story,\nand while it may not be 'game of the year', it's a fun experience that\nI can happily recommend.\n\nFor more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of what I cover in my video.\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","September 1, 2014","true","22.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

No inventory, little depth to the game and it becomes repetitive.\n\nThough no inventory can be classed as a good thing especially if you're a hoarder who finds it hard to part with anything in case you need it later. Not so with this game, no need to sell anything, it is automatic, any loot you pick up whether it be wolf pelts, or jewels etc. immediately turn to silvers, the currency of this game. If you find a weapon more powerful then the equipped, it immediately equips it and turns the old into silvers. But it also means less depth and not really any choice of what you equip.

The Bards tale is  a lackluster, basic rpg that you will enjoy playing but doesn't have the depth, roleplaying aspect, nor versitily to be a good rpg. Most characters wind up exactly the same, the only difference is if you want to concentrate more on an archer character (recommended) or a melee character.\n\nYou start off as The Bard, and like all rpgs you run into problems, have to fight monsters, visit stores and talk to people, and bla bla bla. Unlike some rpgs this game tries to keep the Bards Tale humor in it, with funny comments and happenings. Sadly this does not add to the gameplay or the depth of the game so instead of making the game better, all it does it make it a tad funnier. If i wanted funny i'd watch a comedy stand-up show.\n\nYou can fight either with melee weapons or archery, and your main ability is to summon allies to help you in your quests. You really have no choice on your character build other than if you want to focus on melee or archery, all characters usually wind up with max summoning, luck, endurance, etc. Your real only choice is to have strength and use melee weapons/shields, or dexterity to use bows, and since bows seem to be vastly superior to melee choice, most just go with bows. You only have 1 line of bows to be skilled in, while if you focus on melee you have a variety of choices such as 2 handed, dual welding, weapon/shield, etc. If you pick bows, you just focus on bows and get better much easier. Plus bows let you attack out of range, bows are useful vs all foes in the game, and only bows are useful vs some foes in the game, making picking anything other than bows as your main attack ability wasteful.\n\nThe maps are small, basic. The gameworld map overland map is small, not many locations, linear in nature, you do get a few extras while playing such as artifacts to use in combat, which sadly you won't use 99% of the game because it isn't a hard game especially with your summons. You can summon a variety of helpers to use, a few you will use a lot but many you won't even touch due to there not being a huge variety of combat gameplay that would need them. You can summon melee warriors, area-of-effect summons, distance attackers, plus support healers, light casters, etc. As you progress you can upgrade the summons once into better summons, but again you will find yourself simply using a half dozen or so summons all the time while the rest sit in the dusty closet never to be touched. You and your bow are the main force in combat so you'll have some melee fighters to hold off foes while you plink away at them, and a backup healer just in case. Thats about it.\n\nMost fights, even boss fights just require you to smack them until dead, very little strategy nor difficulty. Some boss's i just blasted with arrows and my summons and they were dead in 10-20 seconds.. Not very difficult boss fights. There isn't really an inventory system, there isn't really a stat/skill system to vary your characters other than noted earlier, melee or archery. There isn't any crafting, not many secrets, not a huge store variety to buy stuff (you are given most of your gear as you play), and absolutely no replay value to the game at all.\n\nLackluster graphics, gameplay, maps, and rpg elements make this game a nice buy when its on sale due to the inclusion of the original bards tale 1-3 games, plus the game isn't incredibly bad, but just make sure to pick it up on-sale so you can enjoy a basic so-so rpg game that you've seen 1000 times before, usually with better gameplay.","September 1, 2015","true","153.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Full voice acting, narration, even sing-a-long drinking songs - it's hard to ask for more. Story is quirky, even slightly parodic, but not over-the-top like Grotesque Tactics. As a mobile game (played it on my Android phone, but also available for iOS), I'd give it a 9/10.\n\nUnfortunately, the PC version of the game is just clunky and weird. The controls are slow, un-intuitive, and often buggy - and the graphics... hardly make it worth playing on a bigger screen. (Not to mention the added features in the mobile versions, like autosave, that are not implemented in this version). I had to stop after about 5 minutes and switch back to my phone. If you don't have an Android or iOS device, and can put up with the annoying controls - it might still be better than not playing it all.

The original three from way back are nostalgic titles, even if they were just on Apple IIe. Was a Vic-20/Commodore/Amiga owner myself so wasn't privy to the series until I was at my friend's house who was an Apple fan, and let me 'try' it out a few times.\nIf you're a BIG fan, you might want to check out http://www.bardstaleonline.com/ for all your Bard's Tale needs.\n\nNow, for the recent Steam release of The Bard's Tale (original game release in June 1985 according to Steam), I'm having a blast playing it.  I had played it just a little bit on the old Xbox since my son had got it from some bargain bin at Zellers.  Now that I've played it for 8hrs, I'm really wondering if my young son 'got' some of the off-the-wall comments our Bard throws out there or the one's by the commentator for that matter.  One thing is for sure though, I'm finding it very funny and have been laughing my ♥♥♥ off at some of his antics and those impromptu singing groups that appear throughout the game.\n\nThe gaming itself is pretty basic with a simple questing system with corridor like zones where you complete these quests received from the denizens of various towns you travel to.  Other than having to set my compability settings to Windows XP Pack 3 to eliminate a nasty Crash-To-Desktop (CTD) issue when starting the game, I've had no issue whatsoever playing the game.  I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, an i5-2320 CPU @ 3.00GHz (4 CPUs), DirectX 11, and a somewhat crappy (ok, crappy) Nvidia GeForce GT 520 card.\n\nSo what does the game entail and what does it let you do?\n1. You do get to upgrade your gear by buying it from a blacksmith or looting some in chests you can loot,\n2. Smash and break tons of barrels that don't hold anything, but you do get paid.  You may ask, "Uh? How? Why?"  Those are well asked and valid questions, since I had made the same response.\nBy the vendor who actually makes the barrels of course!\nAll depending on how many replacements he sells to replace the ones you smashed up obviously.  You obtain the quest from him after you break one of his barrels just outside his place at the starting town.  I believe he pays you $5 for each barrel you break, and you can collect payment anytime you come see him.\n3. Obtain new songs, which are a bard's magic spells per say, which allow you to heal yourself and friends, or summon a helper with specific skills, and other things,\n4. Each level you get 2 points to spend on your stats: Strength, Vitality, Luck, Dexterity, Charisma, and Rhythm, to a maximum of 20, except luck is 21 due to skipping the unlucky number 13.\n\nWow! Ok, just noticed how much stuff I wrote into this review of mine, so I'll shut up now and let you guys go and buy the game so you can also play this pretty fun and funny game of coins and cleavage.\n\nFor more fun stuff about the game and a walkthrough, if you care for those, see an IGN guide at this website: http://ca.ign.com/faqs/2006/the-bards-tale-810205-walkthrough-562447\n\nSilly Me!!

The story was corny and cliche (intentionally) and voice acting was well done.  The songs with the oopah loompah type guys got annoying after about the 2nd time, but I toughed through those moments.

We shall begin with the pros.\n\n- This game has fully voiced dialogue\n- Hilarious songs and dialogues (not your usual lame jokes)\n\nAnd this is as much I can say for this game. The main reason for the low rating is mainly due to constant framerate drop (not entirely sure but the dialogue does not follow the subtitle) to the state where everything is in slow motion. Few reasons I could think of:\n\n- Game does not support Windows 10\n- Outdated engine\n- Not compatible with ATi Radeon Graphics Card\n\n(I have a decent machine that can run Battlefield 4 on Highest Setting)\n\nAnd since this is a quite old game there are a few things you need to know before buying/playing too:\n\n- Hit boxes are horrible (the sword clearly swings right pass the crate but it did not break)\n- Voice dialogue are recorded poorly (sometimes it gets soft slightly)\n- Controls are awkward because keyboard movement does not work sometimes (other actions are fine just WSAD)\n\nAnd there is as far as I can comment too.","October 7, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"

This game is no longer maintained. Don't expect it to work in future versions of Mac OSX, or Windows (Windows 10 is supposed to be the "last" windows version, according to Microsoft, after which they will focus on maintaining the system only).\n\nIf you're buying this game because it supports Linux, don't. The audio/video codec used here is seriously bugged. The video/audio will play for a short while, pause, then play again--and I'm running this on an 4.0 Ghz 8-core system with 32G of RAM.  If you're in a quest, the audio playback is based on a timer, so you'll only hear half of what the other characters were trying to say, so the game is essentially unplayable.\n\nIf it weren't for this playback bug, it probably would be a good game. It's been over a year since I reported this bug. Since then I've built a new system with all new hardware, and upgraded my OS to 14.04.  The bug still exists for me-- you can expect it to also exist for you. You can also expect new bugs and compatibility issues to go unfixed that can surface with the release of new operating systems and video drivers.\n\nI got this game for free when I bought Wasteland 2, which is a great game, and runs perfectly on Linux (in fact, it runs better in Linux than it does in Windows for me on my system).","May 19, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I have no idea why this ia 4 gig install.  If you have nostalga for them, then I guess you should buy it.  I thought they were enahcned somehow, as in these were a remake of the bards tale games.  But no, they are the actual orginals.\n\nAs much as I like adventure games, I can't deal with the bad UI. (I am not talking about graphics here).  For example in combat to cast a mage spell, I need to type out the code for the mage spell I want to cast.  One additional problem is, I have NO IDEA what spells my mage even knows.  There is no way to tell as far as I know.\n\nThen combat:  You can face 4 stacks of 99 monsters each.  On round one you need to give orders to your party, each member.

It may be dated but the ease in which the story unfolds is akin to being sprawled out on a sofa next to a fire. It is an omage to simpler times in a modern package. The combat, however, doesn't suit the game type. What has historically been a multiplayer genre (pen and paper RPG) is now a single player experience with no ability for co-op fun. This alone hurts this game and ultimately prevents it from reaching 'Classic' status. Worth your money? Yes. Could it be better?

The humour is most similar to Mel Brooks, a director of parody films that not everyone finds funny. On the other hand, I do. It has Cary Elwes (Wesley from Princess Bride) as the Bard's voice, and Tony Jay (Megabyte from ReBoot) as the narrator and the two have a charming back-and-forth. The game is routinely funny and though the gameplay is nothing new it does add some interesting bits you won't see in most game, ex: FLAILS.\n\nIt's not without it's flaws, the soundtrack is meh, which is sad for a game starring a musician, and the animations are as dated as ever, as well as having some issues with controls. I myself dislike top-down RPG format, but this game does it competently enough that even anti-fans may enjoy it. Its graphics seem dated in environment textures, but the character designs are still pleasing to the eye.

Sure, it's definitely ARPG rather than RPG and combat and inventory management have been simplified muchly..and sure the top-down view and controls won't be to everyone's liking, but it's made up for with witty, sardonic dialogue and narration and lots of things to do.  Of course, many won't appreciate the humour, but preview the start on youtube and see if it to your liking.\n\nLinux users: Sadly, it's a terrible port.  It is playable, but there's lots of reports of multiple problems.  The main one being large portions of the screen will turn white or yellow (sometimes bleeding out of a light source) and fps will drag in next-to-nothing.  None of the current proposed solutions appear to work and inXile have washed their hands of it.  Reloading is the only way to get around it (and it happened many tens of times in my playthrough).  I also found FMVs to slow and stutter (there's not that many of them though) and the original trilogy (that's included with the game) will CTD.\n\nDespite this, I still played through the whole thing (including finishing all the side quests I could find) and would definitely recommend..just make sure you set the game to autosave!\n","February 4, 2015","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The humour is most similar to Mel Brooks, a director of parody films that not everyone finds funny. On the other hand, I do. It has Cary Elwes (Wesley from Princess Bride) as the Bard's voice, and Tony Jay (Megabyte from ReBoot) as the narrator and the two have a charming back-and-forth. The game is routinely funny and though the gameplay is nothing new it does add some interesting bits you won't see in most game, ex: FLAILS.\n\nIt's not without it's flaws, the soundtrack is meh, which is sad for a game starring a musician, and the animations are as dated as ever, as well as having some issues with controls. I myself dislike top-down RPG format, but this game does it competently enough that even anti-fans may enjoy it. Its graphics seem dated in environment textures, but the character designs are still pleasing to the eye. Granted, the game can slow to a crawl sometimes and gets somewhat repetitive, but overall the humour and the gameplay gets the job done.","June 26, 2014","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Bard is vibrant and brought to life through banter with the narrator and other characters in the game. The character skills and attributes are similar to diablo 1, you can sort of choose how you want to play, as a tank, as an archer and some magic but in the end it comes down to being a tank. Unlike Diablo 1 it is not a game to be taken seriously, there are jokes and clever come backs around every corner. It took me about 20 hours to complete the game, there are a couple of things I missed but I don't really want to play through again to find them.\nThe bad things about the game are that it is an older game, the models are pretty low quality (you can't really zoom in on some of the characters ;), the engine doesn't "do" 1080 -that is you can see creatures freeze/activate in the corners of the screen on a larger monitor (lets you have a 1080 screen though), the game mechanics are basic and some things are missing (you can't buy everything you need (magic crystals for healing) to prepare for the final boss, no fast travel, you can't give advanced orders to your followers like tell one to stay back and heal -the healer always runs into the middle of things and gets killed).\n\nI enjoyed this game and would recommend it to others!\n","June 23, 2015","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is decent and challenging and perhaps the only thing I didn't like about it was the top down view, it just took awhile to get use to.  The storyline and game play is very close to a Monty Python, Princess Bride, and Robin Hood Men in Tights.  It's just full of great derp.  The narrator, by Tony Jay brought the game to life.

Some people say it's unfunny but I disagree. For what it is the graphics are pretty nice and the story was worthy of a good comedic movie. It was also one of those games that took almost 10 years for the graphics cards and drivers to catch up and make the game playable. Overall a very simple game you can plow through in a matter of hours or couple of days.","February 21, 2015","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Bard is selfish, he breaks the fourth wall, he's sarcastic. It's all quite good. Combat can be a bit repetitive but it never dulled my experience.

Play a Han Solo-esque adventurer more interested in coin and cleavage than saving the world and end up saving the world anyway. Positive and negative dialog options shape the outcome of situations (and positive isn't always necessarily better). Summon beings to fight by your side and find some great weapons including a guitar axe at some point. It was an excellent adventure that I will be replaying again eventually.\n\nAvailable on Linux now with Dualshock 4 support.
