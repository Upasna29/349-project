"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/382490/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","If somebody walked up to me and said "Hey! Free candy! Take some." I would immediately call the police or suspect some shenanigans are involved.  More or less the same stands true for a free game. "Hey! Free Game! Take it!." This game is either going to poison my pc or do unspeakable things to my mind. Free games usually have some sort of connotation with poor quality or cheap budgets, which can make for very simple games. So you can imagine my surprise when I took my bite out of Relic Hunter Zero and was left not only unscathed, but with an incredibly fun game that was challenging and replayable.\n\nRelic Hunter is an action top down shooter along the same lines of Nuclear Throne or Tango Fiesta. There are many games in this crowded genre, so Relic Hunter already had to set a high bar to set it apart and make it unique among the crowd. Relic Hunter accomplishes this with tactical dynamic combat,  relics, and unlockables. To give a brief summary of the game, you are fighting the invading forces of Duke Ducan and his ducks, turtles, and other fowl creatures.(See what I did there?) Inside of this mysterious asteroid are relics that grant the owner incredible powers. To be honest, the story isn't all that important, but it's there. The important thing is that your ultimate goal is to take on the Ducan Commander, who is a big bad and will likely stomp on you the first time you encounter him. To gain an edge, you need to collect the relics.\n\nRelics come in three pieces and are randomly found at the end of a level. The buffs range from extra health to unlimited bullets. Aside from the relics there are many guns to choose from and the old favorite, grenades. Combat in Relic Hunter is incredibly fun and rewarding if you play it smart. You have a dash in combat that lets you slide around like an action star, also an aim feature that enhances your damage for landing precise shots. Enemies get progressively tougher as you get into deeper zones. Coming armed with better weapons, shields, and even grenades that most of the time one shot you. As you play through Relic Hunter more and more, you begin to unlock more of the armaments to bring into combat from the beginning. So in a way this gives Relic Hunter a form of progression. You are likely to die before you even reach the Commander and when you do reach him, probably die as well.\n\nReplayability is a key feature of the game. Now one could say that it is more reminiscent of a grind then actual replay value but I define grind as monotonous activity. I never got bored of Relic Hunters gun fights and levels. The level design may be repetitive but most of the time I was to focused on getting cooler guns and making head shots that I never really noticed that all that really changes is color and enemy type. On occasion between levels you are allowed to spend your currency on unlocking more guns and even buying relic pieces. So no matter what, even if you don't find relics at the end of levels, you are going to progress in some form.\n\nThe look of Relic Hunter is again a jaw dropping moment when you realize this game is free. The game honestly reminded me of higher quality titles. Yes, it's all pixel art, but each character, blast, and effect looked very well done. I laughed gleefully as enemies turned into a pile of bones as I put a bullet in between their eyes. I felt like an utter bad ♥♥♥ when I slide dashed right past an enemy group and unloaded on them from behind. Could it look better? Sure, but it gets the job done and is quite stylish, in my opinion.\n\nOther areas of the game stand out as well, such as the music. The soundtrack for Relic Hunters is a fantastic blend of retro inspired music. It never got dull or grating on the ears and actually kinda kept me wanting to keep fighting faster. The sound effects match suit with satisfying explosions and the sound of bullets bouncing off my enemies shields.\n\nSo lets talk about extras. Relic Hunter already being a replay focused game, includes multiple characters to choose from. Each character has his/her weaknesses/strengths. This makes the games Co-op feature really interesting as two players have different strategies. I shouldn't fail to mention also that the games source code is completely open for all you modders out there. Giving this free to play game possibly intent updates depending on the community.\n\nWhile I could go on about how much I enjoyed the game such as controller support, rebindable keys, Steam cards, and an upcoming Endless mode. I think you get the idea. Relic Hunters does plenty of things right in a crowded genre and I am honestly shocked that nothing is being charged for it. You could easily slap a five to ten dollar price tag on this game and it would completely worth it. One issue that I do have with the game is that it really doesn't bring anything new to genre. We've seen games like this before to be honest but for the price tag(Which is zero, don't forget) and quality, Relic Hunter is easily nearing the top for me and I highly recommend it! Oh and best part? No Microtransactions!","September 7, 2015","true","1.3"," 232 of 246 people (94%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","94","232","246","64","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RathaWynter/recommended/382490/","RathaWynter","Ratha Wynter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RathaWynter/","1037 products in account","Relic Hunter Zero is a top down shooter in the same vein as Nuclear Throne thats been sprinkled with a tiny bit of Binding of Isaac's progression and unlocks. Despite being a freebie, this game ranks up there with some of the best top down shooters out there at the moment. And while seeming simple at first glance, the game actually has a lot more to it than first meets the eye. Each game mechanic that Rogue Snail chose to include in their (surprisingly free) game has multiple facets that add up quickly to create a well-polished, functional, and challenging skill-based shooter.\n\nThe gun play feels good, the sounds are strong, the screen shake adds to the impact, and the enemies fall when you'd expect them to, simply put: its visceral and satisfying. Each weapon has an effective range after which the damage falls off and enemies also take extra if hit in a certain place too, The damage indicators are nice and fit the flow of the game well. Grenades can travel over destructible cover to hit dangerous groups of enemies, and theres even an aim mode which lets you see further and increase your accuracy slightly. Ammo management is also a thing, rather than just having an infinitely firing weapon, each gun has its own magazine and reload times. You can use up whats in a mag and swap with a weapon on the ground without spending ammo from your ammo pools too. This can be a great way to stock pile early on and is surprisingly fun to swap weapons out all the time (but you dont need to!)\n\nMovement mechanics seem fairly solid. You have stamina for sprint alongside a dash/dodge ability. The player is given everything they need to dodge, seek cover, return fire, and close the distance with the enemy if they want to get up close and personal with a shotgun or their fists. Beware though as melee also pulls from your stamina so you cant just dash in, hit and dash out. If i have -any- gripe at all its to say that using the keyboard and mouse, you can only seemingly dash in the 8 cardinal directions. Sprint and dash are bound to the same button which causes the accidental dash sometimes when you dont want it, or the inability to dash (because you end up sprinting instead.) But even with that said, the movement feels pretty good, even if it could use a bit of tweaking, an alternative key bind, and possibly an option to 'dash towards cursor' There is however a melee weapon that serves that function.\n\nEach character has health and a rechargeable shield which can be upgraded slightly throughout the adventure. If your shield ever breaks though you will lose any boosted over-charge ability, so dont get complacent.. just rushing in and taking fire when you've got a big shield will lead to losing your shield powerups before you know it. Both your health and shield are determined by your choice of character and can be modified with relics that you unlock, as well as in-game pickups.\n\nWhen it comes to unlocks you can unlock multiple characters, as well as guns, ammo, and relics to start the game with and make things easier. Like in Spelunky theres an unlockable level skip which can help you get back into the action a little more quickly if you find yourself too good for the early levels, and may put you at a slight disadvantage for increased challenge in the later ones. One thing that confused me at first was that the store not only sells you items for your current run, but if you buy an item it also unlocks for your next play through and you can start with it if desired.\n\nThe AI is even a decent challenge too. Enemy variety is moderate, Ive only seen a handful of types in the few hours that I've played but what is there is well placed when coupled with the variety of weapons they can use (and will occasionally drop when defeated.) Different enemy soldiers will fight together as a more effective group, and sometimes the enemy will even run away for cover if it needs to. The AI can even interact with itself on occasion which is a really nice touch that adds a bit more variety to the gameplay, can even be used to your advantage sometimes.\n\nAll in all the developers at Rogue Snail really hit a homerun with Relic Hunters Zero. The music didnt quite resonate with me fully on all of their tracks, but they nailed their gameplay mechanics in this title without any question. They even made it an open source project as well, meaning that we will likely see some great content mods come to this freebie because the ground work the Devs put in made for such an exceptional gaming experience. You can tell that the team put a lot of love and effort into creating their game; it shows in the influences taken from all over the genre being brought together in a way like we had not quite seen before.\n\nRelic Hunters Zero might be a free to play game, but its more polished on launch than most of the paid titles we see on Steam these days. Dont let its price fool you, Rogue Snail put out a quality product here. You wont want to skip on this one if you're a fan of top down shooters. This is by far the best game I never bought this year, and turned out to be vastly more fun than many of the games I had been looking forward to.\n\nPros:\n- Good weapon play / ammo management.\n- Variety of characters to play / relics to equip.\n- Sounds feel impactful.\n- AI and enemy variety are decent.\n- Destructible cover / dynamic fights.\n- Unlockables to strive for.\n- Challenging.\n- Free and moddable.\n\nCons:\n- Music might not fit everyone's taste.\n- Dash/Dodge/Sprint movement has a few quirks using keyboard control.","August 24, 2015","true","8.9"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","21","23","4","0"

The K/M controls are great and the controller support is excellent. It's somewhat like a free and lite version of Nuclear Throne (though the analogy isn't perfect).\n\nThe game allows co-op, but the downside is that you can only play local co-op with one person on K/M and the other person on controller. If the game ever features online co-op, it'll be a great way to kill time with a friend.\n\nStarts off fairly easy, but steadily rises in difficulty until you get obliterated. Fortunately, the more you progress and collect money from kills, you can pay to have better equipment unlocked from level one, so there is a sort of RPG-esque growth to it over time.\n\nHighly recommended if you're in a place where you don't wanna spend any money but wanna try out a quality game.","October 20, 2015","true","1.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","2"

Don't get me wrong, there are elements to improve with some bad color choices at times and some difficulty spikes that can cause people problems, but that doesn't undo the great top down shooter gameplay that the guys behind Chroma Squad and Dungeonland have to offer. Different Characters and weaponry can lead to some variety in gameplay, while the core shooting mechanics keep the action up while not being too boring. Randomization in spawn location and enemy location helps the game in question, while not going to far in making it too unpredictable. It's a solid game that you can even look at the source code at, and for a game that doesn't have microtransactions? Yeah, it's definitely worth your time.\nLists:\n\n+:\nCore combat and controls work: give you a feeling of power and allows for different skill sets without being overbearing.\nNo microtransactions for a great experience all around. It's free. Great for local co-op with the chaos it creates.\nGood progression that allows for real growth in terms of gameplay and feeling strong.\nVariety in character builds can lead to different play styles despite the simple gameplay.\nGood set of options actually, in particular with the ability to remove the screen shake.\nStrong aesthetic that reminds me of a comic book style in some ways, like a cross between Scott Pilgrim and modern comic aesthetic.\nMusic is appropriate and really is just a good mix all around.\nSource code is available for people who really want to see what the game is under the surface.\n-:\nGrenades may be too over powered, for both you and the enemy. They can screw you up rather easily.\nOnce in a while, the aesthetic works against itself, in causing issues with attempting to see your envrionment (red laser on red background).\nLater levels can have get hit of screen that can really cause frustration.\nDifficulty spikes will frustrate at times.","August 18, 2015","true","4.7"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","31","43","5","0"

Can't really complain about that.\n\nEDIT:\n\nNow that I'm willing, I'll add a little more depth to this review.\n\nPros:\n\n+ The game's art direction is simplistic, and may be a little bland to others, but I think it looks fantastic. And it runs without a hitch. The dynamic duo of good visuals. This isn't a game that aims to awe you with intense visuals, but the style is inevasive and enjoyable.\n+ You can play with a friend! I hope online co-op is eventually added, but local co-op is a huge plus as it is.\n+ All the characters I've played so far have something fun and unique about them, while not feeling  over/underpowered or like they were just added for the sake of adding something.\n+ Enough progress related content to make you want to sink time into it, but not too much to make you feel overwhelmed. That being said, I like the way you progress in this game. You do the stages, collect the currency, and find/buy relics/buy weapon/shield/ammo upgrades to permanently give you an edge before each stage. (that is, you buy a weapon from the store after completing that stage, and you can now select that weapon to be part of your loadout before you enter another stage)\n+ Challenging but not to the point where it causes frustration.\n+ 100% free and Open Source with mod support.\n\nCons:\n\n- No online co-op (yet!)\n- Limited content. (for now!)\n\nNote that all cons are possibly temporary. So they're pretty irrelevant until it is explicity stated that neither of those things will change.","August 30, 2015","true","5.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","1"

The final level is a huge difficulty spike that will stop you in progression no matter how good you are, leaving you to grind 3 very short levels while unlocking new weapons/powerups etc.\nI guess it's ok for 4 hours, as it's the minimum time required to unlock most of the good weapons, classes and relics to complete the final level. I squeezed everything i could from this game, i didn't beat the final boss, it was more frustratingly unfair than fun, but i can say that this game is ok time waster between bigger games. Also i think it was designed for co-op, which is a little point because of it only being local.  But it's open source, so techically it doesn't have any downsides that cannot be fixed.","August 20, 2015","true","4.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordofwatermelons/recommended/382490/","lordofwatermelons","Twitchy Nemesis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordofwatermelons/","23 products in account","The very fact that this game is free, there is nothing stopping you from giving this game your time, and trust me, it warrants it. Do you like arcade-style gameplay? Done. Fast-paced run-n'-gun action? Absolutely. Addictive levels of replayability? Triple check. tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nThe main plot is easy enough to follow: You're a Relic Hunter, and you hunt relics. Simple enough, right? One hitch: the asteroid you're on is teeming with vicious wildlife and cutthroat thugs. The solution? Shoot everything that moves.\n\nYou select from one of 6 hunters, that're all gradually unlocked over time. Each one starts with their own weapon, like Jimmy's Elite Pistol, Raff's Keytar Cannon, and my personal favorite, Pinkyy's devestating melee gloves. Each Hunter has their own unique playstyle, and may take a bit of practice with each to truly master them.\n\nThe game features a main campaign made up of 4 stages, 3 levels each, including a final boss. Between each level, you can search for new relic pieces, and after stages can purchase weapons and equipment that carry over into future runs.\n\nThe name of the game is the Relics, handy doodads with a variety of effects. Find their 3 pieces, and the relic is yours! You can only carry 3 relics at one time, however, meaning you need to plan and synergize your relics around that plan.\n\nBeat the Campaign? Time for the meat of the game: Endless Mode. This is where the game kicks into full throttle: new mechanics, like Mods that alter gameplay; new guns, like the legendary Relic Weapons; and even new Relics like the Morning Star, which boosts all Bounty pickups massively! But by-far, the most menacing is the addition of new enemies, including Ducan Elites, who'll hunt you down relentlessly!\n\nThere's also an expanded post-stage hub, allowing you to spend your Bounty to restock, hack out Mods, purchase Relics, and swap out Relics you've already found. That Crude Pistol a bit weak? Give it a couple upgrades at the gunsmith, and you'll crack skulls like a champ!\n\nRHZ comes with Co-Op mode for both Campaign and Endless, local-only, which lets you bring a buddy along to share in the joys of genocide! As the old saying goes: there's power in numbers! Just make sure not to "accidentally" kill them. Especially for an achievement, wink wink.\n\nBut the best part: This game is OPEN SOURCE!\n\nWhat's that, exactly? In a nutshell, it means you have the ability to edit the game's code however you like; create new weapons, characters, and enemies! The community, even now, helps fuel constant updates to the game, hence the game's tagline of "Updated Forever." And they're not wrong! Strong community presence means endless content, endless replayability!\n\nTo sum it up, Relic Hunters Zero is a game that demands your attention. It's a true labor of love, and it shows. The game developers throwing the reigns to its community was a bold move, and it's absolutely paid off in spades. This game gives Zero reason not to try it! You won't be disappointed.\n\nFully recommended for any lovers of arcade-y goodness.","November 13, 2015","true","27.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It's a 2d shooter rogue lite, meaning that later in the game is really difficult. Your character across runs gets guns as you play through the stages, and at the end of each stage there's a chance to find a piece of a relic that upgrades your character. Along with that you can get bounty, the in game money, to get things in your ship before you begin.\n\nThe shooting and movement mechanics go hand in hand. You are really floaty in movement, you can dash and sprint around, and dashing makes you invincible to weapons. The guns are very fun as well. There's three types of guns with their own ammo like Destiny, light, medium, and heavy ammo. It has a mechanic where putting your crosshair over the enemy instead of behind and in front does more damage.\n\nThe game has huge potential as far as other features go. I would like to see an online multiplayer along with the couch co op (however controllers aren't really the best way to play this game) and some sort of multiplayer. The balance would be an easy change, as the enemy AI in singleplayer is about as hard other people get.","August 20, 2015","true","3.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It looks like your typical top-down shooter indie game, but it's so much more.\n\nAround a half hour in I realized that I kept dying to the minor enemies in around stage two, and that was when I realized how much this game has to offer. If you plan on running in and firing away into crowds like you do in every other top down shooter, you won't make it far in this game. Long reload times, relative ammo scarcity, and strong standard enemies mean you have to put a reasonable amount of thought into each encounter.\n\nIt's not a strategy game by any means, but I regularly find myself looking at the latest cluster of enemies and quickly planning my shots in the back of my head before I go in, as to leave the best chance of making it out alive. However, it doesn't require so much thought that you spend any time waiting, thinking of what to do. All it requires is that you're actively aware, and that's really fantastic. The game trusts that you'll learn how the weapons, mechanics, and enemies function, in order to really master the game. It's also not the grueling challenge that you see many games that require that understanding become. Relic Hunters Zero is a happy medium between the difficult game that asks you to master, and the fun shoot-em-up romp we've come to expect from a game of it's style.\n\nIn summary, Relic Hunters Zero is a great way to spend some time if you want a top-down shooter with a little more substance. 10/10.\n\nP.S. I'm hoping the fact that it's open source will lead to lots of additional content in the future.","August 21, 2015","true","5.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Just finished the game (defeated the boss) and it took me about 6 hours! That is a long time considering i probably got to the boss in 2 hours! This game is HARD if you have not tried rogue like games like the binding of isaac or risk of rain this game may shock you when you start it because of the difficulty but you have to keep trying! This game is not bad because of the difficulty, i think it improves the game a whole load and i hope the game can be updated without having to download mods for it. I think it would be ok though if it was a steam workshop thing as it is easy to apply mods from there. A bad thing i want to say about the game is that i dont see any other character than the starting character to be any good... unless you are amazing at the game i dont see it being easy to defeat the game and get the achivements you get by using each different character so i wanted to say that i think they could use some buffs to be able to compete with the default class. Also i think that there could be more mechanics in-game like grenades (which are already in it). Im not sure what but maybe something like invincibility abilities for tanky classes and damaging abilities for damage based classes. This could also be used to buff the weaker characters (not the horse obviously). But without the things i think could improve this game it is amazing for what it is, completely free and only just came out (at the time of me writing this), This game could become the new best rogue like!\n\nAlso for a rating out of ten it would hav to be ten : 10/10","August 19, 2015","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a F2P game that's NOT ♥♥♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ me, right?\n\nRelic Hunters Zero is  a cute little singleplayer shooter, (which is in desperate need of multiplayer; the game would be twice as fun). You shoot monsters with different kinds of weapons, different kinds of power-ups (relics) and you can choose between different types of characters to play with. The game is minimalistic and short, but has mad replayability, which compensates for it's lack of content. Actually, the 'lack' of content is not even a bad thing; this game is free after all, so I shouldn't be asking for more. This game is as fantastic as it is already, especially since it's for free.\n\nI love the artstyle, addictive gameplay and music of this game. Do I recommend this game? Yes, but you're wasting your time reading these reviews rather than actually trying out this amazing free game.","January 12","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's free.  Really free.  No DLC, deluxe editions, or microtransactions hidden in the game itself.. There's nothing to buy, it's just free.. because I guess the developers felt like it.  And that's really nice of them.  They gave out the source code, too.. so if you know how to mod stuff, you could do almost anything you can imagine with it.\n\nIs it fun, though?  Sure!  It's right up my alley.  It's a top-down action game, where you explore procedurally generated floors, kill all the enemies, and look for pieces of relics to bring back to your home base.  There's a bunch of stuff to unlock, including additional playable characters, weapons to grab before you head into the action, shortcuts to lower floors (similar to spelunky, so you can skip the early floors if you desire), and the relics themselves, which you can equip once you've found all the pieces, for bonuses to your characters' attributes and abilities.\n\nIt's challenging, but not unfair.  There's also plenty of strategy to employ.  The dog-like enemies hate the humanoid enemies.. If you can make them fight each other, that makes things easier on you.  Sometimes you'll come across cages of the dog-like enemies, giving you the chance to release them to thin the enemy numbers, just be careful and watch to make sure you don't get caught up in the attack!  I also enjoyed the exploding barrels.. they jettison themselves roughly in the direction opposite from the side you damaged them, so they essentially become missiles that can clear a lot of enemies when used effectively.\n\nAnyway.. I don't know why I'm writing such a lengthy review for something that costs nothing, you should just download it and try it yourself.","August 18, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's bit on the grindy side since you'll have to replay stages to get better items, but it's never bad to the point of intruding on fun. There's a surprising amount of item variety in even the early stages and surviving the later stages will demand that you know all of the mechanics inside and out.\n\nThe presentation is OK. I'm not a fan of the lineless, unpolished style but there's some semblance of an art direction here. The music has a cool atmospheric feel, going after chaotic mish-mashes of waveforms rather than catchy melodies. The framing of the story works and has a nice blend of nostalgia and original ideas to it. It's all very silly and does a good job with setting the tone for the game.\n\nIf there's one big complaint to be had, the controls feel really unpolished. The way you move and collide with objects feels more like a Game Maker prototype than a finished product. And that's a shame, because having tight "game feel" is  really important in top-down shooters like these.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game an 8/10.

The art style is super appealing and easy on the eyes, even after countless playthroughs and the difficulty is high enough to provide a challenge, but the fact that new items are available after every run makes you want to jump back in immediately after being destroyed. Frequent updates and in-depth modding tutorials are the cherry on top.\n\nI can't recommend a game more.

There is plenty of ammo to gather and enemies do drop their own weapons from time to time making it easy to switch weapon types if you are running low on a specific ammo type.\n\nSo far I have made it to level 4-2 in what looks to be a four zone game, and it seems there are only two different enemy types. The ducks and the beast.\nThe ducks come in numerous types and carry a good variety of the weapons so each zone has diffrent types for you to try out. Unfortuatnly what I call the beast enemies don't have the variety of the ducks coming in with just two different beast.\n\nTo lengthen your play time there is a bit of grinding to be had. Killing enemies rewards you with bounty. Bounty is used to open up checkpoints between zones which is great if you just are just trying to play to the end as quickly as possible.\nAnd of course there are weapons to buy as well to get you set up for a better run starting. And I cannot forget about upgrades. These include extra ammo packs, extra grenades, and the super useful sheild upgrades. Good stuff.\nAnd then there is the last and best items of the game. The relics. Relic pieces can be found randomly in levels and bits of them can be bought from the donkey. Once you collect three in a set you can use them to give yourself a little boost for your next run. Things like starting with more health and arrmor or even extra ammo. There are more of course. But those are for you to find.\n\nThe sounds track is alright. Nothing amazing but thankfully it isn't something that has to be muted. Just my opinon of course. Some people adore this kind of music. Listen to the trailer yourself... or better yet download and play. The best part of this game is that it is completely free. There is no in-game shop to use real cash on anything, which is great of course.\nIf there is one true complaint to be had is the lack of online co-op. There is local co-op of course and it is great.

Relic Hunters made me think differently, and so this is the first review I have ever written.\n\nThis game, besides being free, has a wonderful development (team?) and many intriguing and unique features. The art style is super appealing and easy on the eyes, even after countless playthroughs and the difficulty is high enough to provide a challenge, but the fact that new items are available after every run makes you want to jump back in immediately after being destroyed. Frequent updates and in-depth modding tutorials are the cherry on top.\n\nI can't recommend a game more.

It's free.  Really free.  No DLC, deluxe editions, or microtransactions hidden in the game itself.. There's nothing to buy, it's just free.. because I guess the developers felt like it.  And that's really nice of them.  They gave out the source code, too.. so if you know how to mod stuff, you could do almost anything you can imagine with it.\n\nIs it fun, though?  Sure!  It's right up my alley.  It's a top-down action game, where you explore procedurally generated floors, kill all the enemies, and look for pieces of relics to bring back to your home base.  There's a bunch of stuff to unlock, including additional playable characters, weapons to grab before you head into the action, shortcuts to lower floors (similar to spelunky, so you can skip the early floors if you desire), and the relics themselves, which you can equip once you've found all the pieces, for bonuses to your characters' attributes and abilities.\n\nIt's challenging, but not unfair.  There's also plenty of strategy to employ.  The dog-like enemies hate the humanoid enemies.. If you can make them fight each other, that makes things easier on you.  Sometimes you'll come across cages of the dog-like enemies, giving you the chance to release them to thin the enemy numbers, just be careful and watch to make sure you don't get caught up in the attack!  I also enjoyed the exploding barrels.. they jettison themselves roughly in the direction opposite from the side you damaged them, so they essentially become missiles that can clear a lot of enemies when used effectively.\n\nAnyway.. I don't know why I'm writing such a lengthy review for something that costs nothing, you should just download it and try it yourself.","August 18, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's bit on the grindy side since you'll have to replay stages to get better items, but it's never bad to the point of intruding on fun. There's a surprising amount of item variety in even the early stages and surviving the later stages will demand that you know all of the mechanics inside and out.\n\nThe presentation is OK. I'm not a fan of the lineless, unpolished style but there's some semblance of an art direction here. The music has a cool atmospheric feel, going after chaotic mish-mashes of waveforms rather than catchy melodies. The framing of the story works and has a nice blend of nostalgia and original ideas to it. It's all very silly and does a good job with setting the tone for the game.\n\nIf there's one big complaint to be had, the controls feel really unpolished. The way you move and collide with objects feels more like a Game Maker prototype than a finished product. And that's a shame, because having tight "game feel" is  really important in top-down shooters like these.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game an 8/10. Relic Hunters Zero is a thoroughly difficult and satisfying experience that's free to boot. Try it out!","January 7","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Umm... Wow.\n\nThis review for Relic Hunters Zero reflects version / patch 5.\nReally though, for me to give a positive review for a free to play game is more rare than you digging up a diamond in your backyard. Unless of course, you're playing Minecraft. And just so i'm clear, this game isn't free to play, it's just free. No in-game purchases, no $50 yearly subscription, AND it's open source. Plus, it's  really, really fun.\n\nOverview\nSo I log into Steam and see a new free to play game, Relic Hunters Zero. Relic Hunters, huh? Looks okay, I guess. Probably made on a $5 budget over a three week period. (I didn't think it looked THAT bad, just exagerating) Watching the trailer I start thinking about the type of game I've been wanting to play for a long time, that I could never find without it being "free to play" or requiring a $2000 upgrade on my PC. This type of game is like an adventure, hack and slash, beat em up type game. Not too much of a story, unless it's really good, and mainly just you versus thousands of weak to powerful enemies.\n\nI belive I've found the closest thing to what i want in Relic Hunters. Not entirely what I want, but pretty close.\n\nActual Review\nGraphics\nOne of the first things i look for in a game is graphics. That's one of my main turn offs (or turn ons ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°))  especially  when it comes to free to play games. Of course RHZ doesn't have Arkham Knight graphics that melt your 30 core GPU and make your cat poop rubies, but I really like the pixelated art style of the game. It really works with the "low fi" soundtracks, the sound effects and every other element of the game. The characters are cute as well, and you can play as a donkey, one of the biggest reptiles on the planet.\n\nSoundtrack / SFX\nI don't know why I haven't downloaded the soundtrack for this game. I love it. One way of telling if a game has good soundtracks is if it's memorable. You know it's a good soundtrack when you hum along with it as you play. When your eyes light up when you hear someone playing it. When you hum it so much your parents kick you out of the house. There's a soundtrack for the menu, spaceship / lobby, and each four level area, as well as the boss and tutorial levels.\n\nIt's wierd how much i like the sound effects. Like, really wierd. I love them. I find myself paying a strange amount of attention to them as soon as i pick up a sub machine gun and fire off a clip, hoping to save my last 19 health points. My favorite one has to be the reload sound effect, I don't know where they got it from but it sounds super realistic with a slight "video game" undertone.\n\nGameplay  ( version 5 supports two local players )\nThis review is coming from a guy who played over 200 hours of Spelunky. 300 hours of MapleStory. I own Super Meat Boy, Terraria and Starbound. Unrelated to this game type I have over 50 games on Xbox 360, about 10 on Xbox One, and probably about 20 on Steam. I own Destiny, every Halo there was (all the way from Halo: CE, besides the Spartan games) and a variety of platformers, shooters, and others. I'm a pretty good authority on games like RHZ.\n\nI'm still wrapping my head around the fact that RHZ is a free game, not even with in game purchases, but it's  still this good.  After the tutorial, there's a portal for you to go through. This portal starts the game, taking you from level 1-1 to level 4-4. (now that i think about it, the devs might've been fans of Spelunky. Man i hope they make a RHZ: HD :spelunky:) Each level gets progressively harder, giving you a chance to get good at that game while playing, but still have plenty of challange as you play.\n\nI play with a gamepad, wired Xbox 360 and sometimes Xbox one (i don't have a wired Xbox One controller, you can use a play and charge cord or any micro USB). I love the new and unique play style that RHZ has. It's not your average top-down shooter. You aim by holding LR, which brings out a laser that turns white when you can get a precision kill. You can change the direction you fire in with RS. This can be challenging at first, but after your first or second playthrough it's easy.\n\nI'd say there are about 20 guns in the game, and each of them are either Light, Medium, or Heavy weapons. They all start out with a bit of ammo, but with three different kinds of ammo that spawns randomly, it creates a situation where you can't just spray away and hope you hit something. You have to be almost strategic of how and where you shoot. If you run out of ammo, you can resort to your melee attack, which kills weak enemies in one hit. You also have two grenades to start, and a max of three.\n\nThere are 6 characters in the game, four of which you have to unlock by completing certain prerequisites. You start with Jimmy (all gun type user, rounded stats) and Pinkyy (melee specialist, starts with gloves and skilled with heavy weapons). So far i've unlocked Raff, who starts with a medium Keystar gun that shoots through walls. It's amazing how much your play strategy has to change between characters.\n\nJimmy is perfect for beginners, being skilled with all types of guns. You will face challenge playing with all characters, but Jimmy seems to be easy enough to learn the game with.\n\nPinkyy, being melee based and having huge stats, can seem overpowered as I thought, but if you run out of ammo and shields, playing the game only with her melee attack can be quite the problem. She also has a grenade indicator, but when you press LB (or the keyboard equivalent) you actually get an overshield.\n\nRaff's Keystar gun doesn't start with too much ammo, so buying the medium ammo start from Ace (previously A♥♥) can be a huge help in your run. If im not mistaken, he's skilled with medium weapons, and has regular grenades.\n\nAll things considered, RHZ is an amazing game, and has great replay value as far as i see. Before chalking off another game on your not reccomended list, consider that it just might not be your type of game. Hope my review helps, and happy Relic Hunting :3","September 23, 2015","true","11.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I will still suggest this game and do not blame them, working on another huge thing after the game's already released is hard, he (they not sure) said that if anybody wants to mod in online he'd try to support but he won't work on it.

Everything is up to you!\n+You kill ducks daily.\n+Supports local co-op\n\nCons\n-------\n\n-The game can be a bit repetitive and lacks replayability after unlocking most (if not all) of the unlockables. Hoping for a Daily soon!\n-The worlds aren't randomly generated (the item spawns and player spawns are, though!) so you'll be able to figure out enemy locations and possible loot locations pretty fast.\n\n\nThis is definitely a game that you should give a try. The game is like 85MB in size and it's free. If you hate fun, then skip right over this of course.\n\ntl;dr, the game is a ton of f**kin' fun!","August 19, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And the copy is exact, same enemies, same numbers, only thing that changes is their placement, that is random, like the original mode. You will be probaly bored when you finish the first loop.\n\nAmmo is really scarce, so you need to be really good at aiming or alternate with melee to keep using guns. (And don't even think about using stuff that drinks ammo)\n\nThe game has a lot of challanges and upgrades that are too much strong, the huge majority doubling or halfing gameplay stuff like damage and shields or ammo usage, this makes the longplay really uneven, as you can be having a good time and in the next level be in a nightmare, to have a easy time again after a shop stop.\n\nMost of the enemies aren't creative, all will shot directly (or run if they are melee) at your position and some have homing missiles. End of the story. (Obs: The Halloween update adds some nice opponents, but only to one zone)\n\nThe shield systen is really bad. You have as loot a semi-permanent shield upgrade that you can find as loot, it can give you a boost in your max shield of 30 points, (and is cumulative, so you can keep collecting up to the doulble of your shield) your only way to lost is if you deplete your shield. Ok... until you see that you will breeze with the power-up, and be in constant trouble without, in special in the advanced levels or playing as the donkey.\n\nThere's a relic in endless that doubles the bounty you earn from stars but it's appearance is random... Yet, it is so important to have it, that you won't have enough equipment to play the elite loop.\n\nThe chest systen is cool in the campaing, as you are building some new relics. But in endless it's only a pace breaker, and for many times, a frustating one, as you will get many weapons that you can't carry or you surpassed.\n\nThe weapon upgrade mechanic is ironic... as will make you stick with the same weapons all the time because the investment you made. it incentives you to keep the same guns, even when you have a 3 ammo types + 2 weapons carry systen to make you try new stuff.\n\nExplosives are a major problem in game, they do nothing or a big hole on you because of how the damage works, so you will have a lot of frustation when your perfect run ends abruptly because you took a granede or rocket. (in special if you play as Biu) And granede previews are hidden by the ground color on the last level.\n\nThe game have a bunch of bugs, I didn't came across anything nasty,but most are really annoing, as menu buttons going crazy and hud words overlapping, and some have minor effects on gameplay.\n\nThis game could be a lot better and the developer is trying to improve, but for now is really crude, so if you are unsure, wait for more updates or only play the campain.\n\nHalloween update: A really good content add-on, 3 new enemies that make you be cautious, 3 new maps with really cool colors, including a arena, a candy mechanic and scene hazards! This is a nice step forward but I'm affraid that this  cool stuff will only stay in the bonus area... the rest of the game needs it...","October 5, 2015","false","41.9"," 15 of 41 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","15","41","0","0"

Had my characters sprinting most of the time which was annoying since you can't continuously do it\n- Finding and digging relics may take time if the relic is hiding on the other end of the map. After clearing a stage, you have to option to dig for a relic. That's fine and all but it's a huge guessing game unless you're in proximity of the relic, then it's just a game about being too hot or too cold.\n- Key bindings. I changed them before I started, so when I tried to actually start the tutorial or first stage, I couldn't because the game was telling me to use the default keys and not the ones I've  selected. So I was meleeing around the whole ship until I figured that out. Also had a gun drop near an exit which took a while to actually exit/enter next map since my character kept switching guns but what can you do.\n- Once you die, you have to start over from stage one (unless you buy the checkpoints)\n- Final boss seemed random. Each stage is a variation of the previous, map layout and type of enemies you face is the only difference I've noticed. So after fighting birds and the wildlife for four stages, the final boss seemed like he was thrown in so that there could be an ending","April 9","false","2.9"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","0"

While I would not pay much for such a game it is free and worth the download, if you have a pc. I play on both mac and pc, I have small games liek this on my mac.\nThis game would earn a thumbs up if it werent for a really annoying glitch. The glitch makes the game impossible as every time I place my mouse even near the edge of the screen, it buggs out my mouse and makes me restart my computer. This makes the game nigh unplayable in my opinion.\nIf this glitch were fixed it would be a perfect game to play every now and again.","September 26, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","4","18","0","0"

I would've bought this gem up for a good amount! Well hopefully it'll stay that way for a little while at least.\nANYways, this game is fantastic in pretty much every aspect.\nThe art is cutesy and at the same time rough and tumble, it reminds me a little of the Power Puff Girls and that's definitely a compliment. The colors are bright and punchy and I think that adds to the high energy experience.\nThe music is catchy and fun, it definitely adds a lot to the feel of the game and it gets your blood up for some rootin' tootin' shootin'.\nThe gameplay itself is pretty dang solid, aiming and shooting is really fun and easily controllable, and I absolutely LOVE the way the grenades work, they are fun to chuck about, but of course they're limited so it adds that level of decision making to the game, you have to decide if the situation really requires one or not.\nThe only thing I would say needed improvement is the character selection. Now to be clear, I love the available characters I've played so far, but it would be nice to have some more diversity and some cool new faces to choose from. (Or maybe even a character creator, just a thought.) Also, maybe a couple more starting characters to choose from and some more that don't require as many achievments to play with as a little added bonus for beginners.\n\nThat said, this game is definitely worth the price and then some! If they charged $15 for this i wouldn't even bat an eye, it's THAT good.\n10/10 much good game","August 23, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though the throne is always the top-down shooter I would usually play, it's nice to see there's another game similar to it and is incredibly fun. Soundtrack is a bit repetitive but great, and the art style is again simple, but eye catching and nice to look at.

The fact that this game is free! FREEE!!!!!

I was surprised how wrong I was.\n-------Pros\n-This game has some really fun and unique mechanics .\n-Weapons feel strong and powerful cause of the freeze on kill\n\n-----Cons\n-Rooms/floors aren't randomized\n-The difficulty scaling is quite odd\n\n\nStill, this game is definetely worth a shot.

I gotta say, I would've expected stuff like DLC or something to make us pay one way or another. That's how free games go on about nowadays.\n\nHowever, these developers have returned the feeling of tingly warm sensation of generosity! For a game this good, it feels like it should be worth ten dollars or so. Instead of slapping a price tag, they just hand it to us, showing phenomenal artwork with pixel graphics so good, it brings back the old days. Music fits in well, and everything feels alive.\n\nFocusing on game play, it really dives in the arcade feel.\n-It has 6 characters, all having unique stats and some having different game play. How they shoot, punch, use their grenades, or even what weapons they start off with. The variety of your tactics mixing with these characters make a lot of difference, but fun nonetheless.\n-Each of them has the following standard.\n-Health determines how much hits you can take before you get K.O.'d\n-Shield acts as a barrier for your health, and can recharge if you're safe from attacks long enough.\n-Grenades are throwable bombs for most characters. Some may use it differently however, like Pinkyy uses it for an invincible barrier for a short time.\n-Ammo, ranging from Light, Medium, and Heavy, it refills your guns clip depending on what kind of gun you have.\n\nThe game features two modes.\n\n-Adventure Mode would be considered as "Story Mode", or "Campaign". It holds 4 stages, each having 3 acts to complete the stage, then followed up by a boss known as Duke Duncan. The Adventure Mode is short, but is meant to be replayed as it offers "Relics" that can be obtained through these levels or by buying them. (Not real money of course) Shoot or bust your way through these levels with planned out maneuvers or fast tactics. Watch your surrounding whether it's a crowd full of enemies, a cage full of dangerous beasts, an explosive box, or breakable barriers. The environment is there, and how you go about is up to you.\n\n-Endless Mode is more or less like Adventure Mode. The only difference? It's mixing in with dungeon curses! The disadvantage occurs during the stage, sabotaging you or supporting the enemy. Now with even more troubles to worry about, you'll have to watch your ammo, health, shield, and your surroundings! Along the lines, there are even more relics to unlock and an exclusive weapon upgrade! Try the game and feel the difference!\n\n-Rating-\nPrice Range: More than Generous!\nGame play: Fast, Smooth, Tactical, and lots of Arcade fun without the use of quarters!\nOverall: 10/10 - No risk in trying something that's free!","October 5, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It may get a bit repetitive, but it should usually hold up.\nOne major thing that I think was kind of dissapointing was the fact that there is no online multiplayer. I strongly, strongly recommend to the devs that they implement some sort of online play, it would make this game much more entertaining.\nYou CAN, however, play local co-op on the same keyboard.. But, eh..\n\nOverall, It's worth a play if you like this kind of thing.","September 16, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, it's free - but it is the kind of free that is like a gift from the gods. This game is fantastic! It's tough - this isn't an easy game. But the graphics and sounds come together to provide the Lost 9-Bit Impossible Retro Game That Never Was, and from characters to weapons, it is a blast.\n\nSure - you can't beat the price... but you also can't beat the value. This really is getting something for nothing, and that something is punching, blasting, frustrating, chiptune bliss. You navigate mazes and kill stuff, and seek buried treasure and dig it up. There's three kinds of ammo and no shortage of carnage. At first, levels seem easy, almost empty - that changes quick and you will be overwhelmed if you are not fast, clever and careful.\n\nGET THIS GAME! It's free, and it's very fun.

Shoot alien ducks and collect the relic pieces to complete the relics which actually give you boosts during your play throughs. I'll list a bit of Pros and Cons right below.\n\nPros:\n-The most obvious one is that it's f2p and the fact that it's pretty good quality game.\n-Multiple characters to play as after unlocking them all each with different stats.\n-Multiple guns to use, each with different ammo types meant for different guns.\n-Multiple Relic pieces to collect and and combine to form Relics that can help through your playthroughs.\n-Easy to use controls with easy to learn mechanics.\n-Shops in between new game areas.\n-Rechargeable shield barrier\n\nCons:\n-When visiting the shop some of the prices or items seem pretty outrageous such as 8000 Bounty on guns which are easily obtainable, it doesn't necessarily cause problems but, it somewhat makes the shop feel useless at times when you can just find the gun on an enemy. Edit: This isn't as useless as I thought, I decided to buy a weapon for the first time and it actually stores the weapon for you to use once you have bought it.\n-The game can get pretty challenging later if you aren't prepared or have any relics to help you with (Though this can also be a Pro making the game just as more fun to beat as well as give you a purpose to collect the Relic pieces)","September 5, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

SIMPLE. CUTE. COOL\n\n- Gameplay- this game is best discribed as.... cave story from a top down perspective mixed with third person shooter elements? its very easy to pick up and has realistic undertones to the gameplay style. you can only hold 2 weapons , a pocket full of grenades and you have a recovering shield. weapons can be swapped out  from pick ups around the map and dead enemies. its really easy to kill things , and its really easy to die if youre not on your toes. you can sprint around your enemies, melee and dash to escape bad situations for aslong as you have stamina to do so , which regenerates over time. there are 6 characters to (easily) unlock that spice up both game modes (endless and adventure) along with a TON of unlockables that will have you backtracking through levels the majority of time while effortlessly unlocking all the characters along the way. SUPER FUN WITH MILDLY REALISTIC  FEATURES MAKES IT LESS OF A TOTAL RUN AND GUN  100% OF THE TIME.\n\n-Audio: the sounds in this game are charming , simple and pleasing like everything else, the soundtrack is just the same aswell , 8bit tunes, tracks i totally remember humming as i blasted my way through the levels. totally worth searching up and downloading if youre into videogameOST's!\n\n----------------\nWhat I disliked\n\nkeep in mind i understand its a free to play. i just say these things for future reference if the Devs ever decide to drop a continuation of the game!\n-no online  co-op: i played the game locally with a few friends but  still online co-op would be great (its still realy fun solo aswell but not nearly as fun with a friend)\n\nfriendly fire on or off: friendly fire is always on so you can kill your teammates mistakenly(or on purpose) alot. it wouldve been nice to have option to turn it off.\n\nPVP: PVP for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles? while some of the characters would be a bit unbalanced against others , it would be cool to face off in  arena of sorts and maybe play as enemy characters in a senseless battle royale!\n\n- not enough levels and bosses! there are 5 worlds each with ( i think) 2 levels. there is only one boss , the final boss. it wouldve been nice to see more but yea , its a free to play that prolly didnt have that much of budget to work with.\n\noverall the only real issue is that there is no online co-op , more levels wouldve been nice but the game has really good replay value and the endless mode makes it even more enjoyable.","December 10, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I gotta say, I would've expected stuff like DLC or something to make us pay one way or another. That's how free games go on about nowadays.\n\nHowever, these developers have returned the feeling of tingly warm sensation of generosity! For a game this good, it feels like it should be worth ten dollars or so. Instead of slapping a price tag, they just hand it to us, showing phenomenal artwork with pixel graphics so good, it brings back the old days. Music fits in well, and everything feels alive.\n\nFocusing on game play, it really dives in the arcade feel.\n-It has 6 characters, all having unique stats and some having different game play. How they shoot, punch, use their grenades, or even what weapons they start off with. The variety of your tactics mixing with these characters make a lot of difference, but fun nonetheless.\n-Each of them has the following standard.\n-Health determines how much hits you can take before you get K.O.'d\n-Shield acts as a barrier for your health, and can recharge if you're safe from attacks long enough.\n-Grenades are throwable bombs for most characters. Some may use it differently however, like Pinkyy uses it for an invincible barrier for a short time.\n-Ammo, ranging from Light, Medium, and Heavy, it refills your guns clip depending on what kind of gun you have.\n\nThe game features two modes.\n\n-Adventure Mode would be considered as "Story Mode", or "Campaign". It holds 4 stages, each having 3 acts to complete the stage, then followed up by a boss known as Duke Duncan. The Adventure Mode is short, but is meant to be replayed as it offers "Relics" that can be obtained through these levels or by buying them. (Not real money of course) Shoot or bust your way through these levels with planned out maneuvers or fast tactics. Watch your surrounding whether it's a crowd full of enemies, a cage full of dangerous beasts, an explosive box, or breakable barriers. The environment is there, and how you go about is up to you.\n\n-Endless Mode is more or less like Adventure Mode. The only difference? It's mixing in with dungeon curses! The disadvantage occurs during the stage, sabotaging you or supporting the enemy. Now with even more troubles to worry about, you'll have to watch your ammo, health, shield, and your surroundings! Along the lines, there are even more relics to unlock and an exclusive weapon upgrade! Try the game and feel the difference!\n\n-Rating-\nPrice Range: More than Generous!\nGame play: Fast, Smooth, Tactical, and lots of Arcade fun without the use of quarters!\nOverall: 10/10 - No risk in trying something that's free!","October 5, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Using a controller is recommended for this game. So why is there no option to change the controller configurations and there's only an option to mess with the keyboard mapping. I need controller to be able to play multiplayer on this game so what the heck.","September 13, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
