It is just roulette with players non-stop. You cannot stop anyone from signing your players and you cannot renew contracts with higher asking prices because players reject them. Players do not recognize when you offer them more wages in exchange for higher transfer asks. This is just a really awful game in all. I had a player whos agent asked me for 118,500 per season and a 850,000 transfer sum, well, I offered him 500,000 per season and a 25,000,000 transfer sum, he rejected. Tried again and offered him 10,000,000 per season and a 10,000,000 transfer sum and he rejected it. I tried this with every player just to test it and every player just declines.\n\nThere is no way to call this a football manager game at all.","March 14","false","1.9"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","1"

Also you can only decline or accept a clubs offer.\n-counter offers need to be added.\n\n6.5/10\n\nif the above things got fixed/adjusted in the future it could even push for an 8/10.","March 6","true","6.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","2"

Clearly iam not a good manager.\n\nI recommend the game but you need to give it some time before you starts to understand it.","March 4","true","2.1"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","4"

It's stressful and frustrating. Without this problem this game would probably be ok. Probably. Sadly it's not Pc Futbol.","March 10","false","2.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

Interesting, entertaining and a bit addictive.\nIt's perfect for those that enjoy managing your own soccer team. Not easy but not too much challenging, so you can spend a nice time playing it. There are some bugs but, as i could see, they aplied fixes frequently.\nGive it a chance, as far as i'm concern, it has been a good spend of money.","March 23","true","7.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's certainly has some bugs and that can disturb when playing. But it looks thaht they are solving and fixing the bugs.\nAlso, it's another philosophy of the game and you see a tendency to set the guidelines themselves and create a model of game that is enjoyable and entertaining.\nMy opinion is that this game is seen potential and can become a very good game. We have to see the evolution of the game, that have a lot of work.","March 23","true","112.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
