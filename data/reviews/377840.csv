I cry tears and rainbows.\n\n\nAlready tried it on mobile, so it was easier for me.\n\n- Not ported, but adapted. You can click on different places on the field to move your character for example.\n\n- Quick save of some sort. Works like a checkpoint system or something like this, not entirely sure. I just turned off the game occasionally without saving and when I turned it back on I just hit "continue" and it placed me on the start of the last screen I've visited.\n\n- New screen where you name your character. It looks good, I liked that.\n\n- Music. It is just original FF9 score in same quality that PSone version had. Not that botched ff7-ff8 piece of s~. This one is personal, so I put it last.\n\nGreat game. 100 impressed nobles.","April 14","true","46.0"," 778 of 852 people (91%) found this review helpful 168 people found this review funny","91","778","852","168","17"

To me, Final Fantasy IX is that game. And to me, this is the best game that a life being have ever crafted. Yes, I say “life being”, not “human”, because I’m assuming aliens have their own videogames. But they won’t be as good as Final Fantasy IX.\n\n---------------\n\nOkay, here comes a very long review. I’ve been waiting this for so long.\nFirst of all, completely ignore my time count on Steam for this game. I’ve put 1000h+ into it, and I can easily make a perfect run by memory. Do you know that particular favorite movie you watch every single year? Well, I do that but with this game.\n\nI have SO many things to comment about this game. And I need to spread them.\nFor those who are new into the franchise, Final Fantasy IX was a big contrast compared to the close older and newer games. Yes, they kept the turn-based battles. Yes, most of the same people worked for it. Yes, it’s considered to be part of the golden era of Square Enix. But let’s look closer to see the main differences:\n\nFirsly, and probably the first thing to notice, is that characters are more cartoon-based. They’re not that sort of adults anymore and some of them even have a very funny, friendly looking.\n\nThe world’s aesthetics also changed a lot. Final Fantasy titles are famous for combining magic and fantasy features with metallic, cyberpunk machines. FFIX crushed that second part and instead they put an antique, more steampunk-like background instead of the actual machines.\n\nThe last big noticeable feature is that the class and battle system went back to the deep basics, where characters have their unique role and can only fight strictly to that [for instance, on FFVII every character could cast anything if the skill (a.k.a Materia) was properly equipped].\n\nAnd now that I’ve just summarized the most basic info about FFIX… Welcome… TO THE MOST UNDERRATED TITLE OF THE WHOLE FRANCHISE!\n\nThat’s right. This game has been so irrationally denied, it makes me question humanity’s future. For Christ’s sake, even Square itself seems to be OK about forgetting this game! Lately, many hidden fans have appeared out of nowhere stating that this is their favorite FF game, but I’m not OK with this. Too late. You joined too late. The damage is already done and this title will probably never be on the top for most people. So I’ll put this game as the most underrated one. Forever.\n\nAs a vivid fan of the franchise, let me tell you something: I will NEVER understand why so many people put FFVII on Top 1. I’ve beaten that game for like 10 times already, and the question keeps coming to me every time. Have you paid attention on what you’ve played? For its year, the game was very good but the amount of flaws it has (even story-related) is just infinite. When rating a classic game, it’s just a failure when someone puts 90% nostalgia & 10% trying-to-be-objective review as their analyses.\n\nThat being said, I’ll try to detail every worth-mention thing about this game and why I think it has been so underrated. Here we go.\n\nTHE STORY\nI’m pretty sure many people didn’t understand it. I’m not telling any proper detail for spoiler avoiding, but the story starts being pretty simplistic and easy to follow but the more you progress through it, the more complex it gets. It gets so complex at the end most people don’t understand the final boss! I guess Japanese narrators love to make those sort of mindf*cks. With that in mind, let me tell you something: this is the only game that has managed to make me cry.\n\nI’ve never ever seen in any other game a party of characters that evolve and mentally grow as hugely as they do in FFIX. Everything is connected, from start to finish, and during your journey you’ll clearly see how much impact their personalities have onto both circumstances and other characters. Everyone has their way to see things, their values, and their past justifying their present and future actions… and somehow they all manage to change and mature. I swear this game teaches SO MANY life values through their characters.\n\nAlong with the characters, the story flows in a world that feels extremely alive and varied. Every place is just so different from the previous one. But I’ll talk about the map later.\n\nFinally, the story is long. Very long considering how short most games are nowadays. In case you don’t know, this game was separated into 4 CD’s on the PSX version, and in a blind run it can perfectly provide 40-60h, depending on how much you want to explore and how many secrets you want to discover.\n\nTHE MUSIC\nIt’s Nobuo Uematsu. And I could finish like this.\n\nI mean, come on. It’s one of the most iconic video game composers. How do you expect to be the music? With hundreds of tracts, FFIX soundtrack is just over the top and unique, and together with its partners (VI, VII, VIII, X…) it will be one of the most remarkable soundtracks from PSX. Ever.\n\nTHE CHARACTERS\nMy god, where to start…\nAs I have stated before, this game has some of the most powerful characters in the franchise, by far. All of them feel extremely unique and relevant, and you will PERFECTLY follow their progress and grow during the story. It is just amazing to see how varied every personality is, and how much impact it can bring to the plot. You might not like one particular way of thinking, but soon enough you’ll realize it’s there to make you think; everyone is different and we all have different points of view. And they have to be relevant. And yes, they are in FFIX. Just see all Vivi’s maturation and I dare you, I double f*cking dare you; I dare you to tell me you haven’t learnt anything from it.\n\nAlso, I want to highlight some aspects as well: Those are NOT your conventional Square Enix characters. That’s right. The main character (Zidane) is not the emo, cold-blooded guy from the famous FF games. Instead, it’s one of the first main characters of the franchise that constantly share optimism to his crew; stays on their side; puts himself and his life on risk (even when he knows he can’t do everything) to save the others, even people he doesn’t know, and he doesn’t hesitate to do so.\n\nLast but not least: the main villain is acclaimed to be one of the best of the franchise (together with Kefka). No more super-emo guys; this is the kind of cynic who’s always a step forward and who loves to make fun of the rest.\n\nTHE UNDERRATINGS\nSo why is this game so underrated? To be honest, I don’t fully know. I know the reasons that puts this game on top but not why it’s been that ignores for the media.\n\nMaybe the fact that every character has their unique role in fighting was not that appealing to people? Something I don’t understand either. To me, that makes MUCH more sense rather than seeing a brute-force guy casting a summon spell. Really.\n\nMaybe the friendly look of the characters? Is this seriously a con to you? They look amazing to me, and definitely much better than all those weeaboo-jpop-like characters Square keeps doing in the recent games.\n\nMaybe because it has no futuristic machines? In that case you’re just a close-minded person. And you definitely can’t appreciate how magnificent some places (like Lindblum) are.\n\nMaybe the story looked boring to you? Then there’s no doubt you didn’t understand it. It is INFINITE TIMES more robust than FFVII storyline, and definitely way more polished, and interesting. Seriously stop overhyping that game.\n\nIn the end, every time I replay this game I start it with a feeling of “meh, I’m sure I love it because of nostalgia”. But that banishes when I reach the credits. This is still the best game I’ve ever played in my entire life, and I’ve played THOUSANDS, and completed about 700 probably. So go and buy it, see what I mean, experience this masterpiece and overall enjoy every minute of it.","April 14","true","61.0"," 933 of 1,126 people (83%) found this review helpful 143 people found this review funny","83","933","1","143","101"

You will love the story, the characters and the locations you visit. It's a beautiful fantasy world filled with life that will have you exploring and looking at everything and appreciating the detail instead of just running through it.\n\nAlso, back when this was released for PS1, this was THE GAME to get if you ever dated a girl who didn't like playing video games and wanted to get them into that. 5 minutes into this game and they were hooked and taking over your PS1 to play. xD\n\nAh, good times... ^ ^","April 15","true","6.8"," 161 of 184 people (88%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","88","161","184","24","4"

Kupo!\nThis is my favorite final fantasy. It was when i played it on PlayStation and it still is now. This game is almost perfect.\nIn general by gameplay it's similar to Final fantasy VII and final fantasy VIII. The graphics and overall world design are very similar. This is the last open world Final fantasy game where you can travel freely around the world in a flying ship. After IX the series got worse. I‘m in no way saying that newer games are bad, i still enjoyed them but they lack so many things from older games and some of them shouldn‘t be called Final fantasy because the only thing they have in common with Final fantasy is moogles. But i must admit they have some improvements like no random encounters and faster battles.\n\nThe combat in this game is awesome. I think it‘s the best from all three (VII, VIII & IX). VIII was the worst because everyone could be a mage or a healer or whatever. In IX characters are who they are. Garnett is a white mage and Vivi is a black mage, same goes for every other character,  you can‘t change that. Only mages can cast magic for example. Also not everyone can use eidolons, they‘re something special now, not unlike VIII. The downside of combat is that it‘s a bit too slow. When fighting the same enemies again and again it‘s little annoying to waste your time on those long fights, but it‘s not a big deal, you get used to it.\n\nThis game has a game within a game. A card game. I really love it, i don‘t get why people are hating it so much? Is it because they don‘t know how to play? Of course it‘s not as good as Gwent in Witcher 3 but it‘s really fun.\nWhat slightly annoys me is absolutely no information on side activities or a way to track collectibles. I know it‘s good when the game doesn‘t hold you hand and i really don‘t need the game telling me what to do and where to go, but i really hate when i‘m forced to replay the whole game if i miss something. So it would be nice to be able to track your progress, to have some checklist or something.\n\nThe graphics are really improved. Character models look sharp and CGI is amazing. Even today CGI looks gorgeous, you can see Steiner‘s eyeliner perfectly clear. The background images on the other hand are untouched and they‘re low quality and blurry. I read that SE lost the HD backgrouds and couldn‘t do anything about it. Don‘t know if that‘s true. Anyway it‘s playable and the game is still good to look at.\nThe game runs at 4:3 resolution with nice black borders on the sides. It doesn‘t bother me, i‘m just happy i can play this game on PC finally.\nI see people complaining about this game how it is a bad port and everything is crap etc. Don‘t trust those people, they‘re wrong, everything is fine with the game. People just like to complain, some of them expected a complete rework of the game maybe. The port is really good, it‘s nothing like VII (didn‘t play VIII on PC yet). The controls are good, you can change button mapping in the config menu. The game runs at 30fps, world map is locked to 20fps and CGI is locked to 15fps. But i don‘t really care about fps in this game, it‘s not a fast paced game where 30fps is barely playable, so it doesn‘t have any influence to gameplay. And the game is really old, so it‘s understandable.\n\nA big thank you to SE for in-game cheats. You enable/disable some of them any time you want and some are permanent when activated. I really like no encounter mode, it‘s handy when you‘re looking for something. You can speed up the game which makes the grinding faster and your party level up faster. Also you can turn on 9999 damage, which again makes repetitive fights faster. Just don‘t use these on bosses and important fights and don‘t ruin the game for yourself. The three permanent boosters are: max gil, max level and max abilities. These should be helpful when you‘re replaying the game if you missed something on your first playthrough.\n\nThe story is another thing this game shines in. Every character has their story, there‘s lots of dialogues in the game so prepare to read. But characters don‘t talk some boring nonsense, everything is interesting to read and time flies fast. The character stories can be funny or sad, you will laugh and want to cry while progressing through the game. The characters are really different in this game. I think none of the game in the series has such variety in races. The main character Zidane is a boy...with a tail. Another character is a Rat and Quina...well i don‘t know, she/he has no gender and loves frogs.\nAlso i like that your party now travels separately. Your party members are separated by the story and for some time you play with one half of the party and then you play with other characters in other location. That way most of the party members are leveled up and you get to use them all unlike in previous games where you have 10 characters and you‘re forced to play with only 3 or 4 of them.\nThe world, the world is beautiful with beautiful cities and villages, each having their own stories.\n\nI recommend this game to everyone. Even if you don‘t like jRPG‘s. This is not a generic jRPG, this one is exceptional. If you like good stories, you‘re not against reading through dialogues and want deep and fun combat buy this game. Considering the price it should be a no brainer, the game offers a lots of content and you will spend hours playing it.\n\nPros:\n\nEnhanced graphics\nAmazing CGI\nGreat story\nDiverse and interesting world\nMusic is amazing\n\nCons:\n\nBackgrounds are poor quality","May 4","true","27.7"," 70 of 77 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","70","77","2","3"

Kupo!\nWhat can I say about my favorite game? Only positive things. Final Fantasy IX is definitely one of the best games and RPGs ever made. It's my favorite along with FFVII and VIII, there are other beloved FF games too like VI or X. But these three classics done by Squaresoft stand above the others. Playing FFIX always reminds me why it has a special place in my heart.\n\nOriginally released in 2000 for PS1 around the times when PS2 had released or just before. I remember receiving this back then <3 and I have replayed it countless times during the years, bought it for PS3 and Vita also lol. I fell in love with the story and characters instantly when first played this. I love the music so much too...Nobuo Uematsu is in my opinion the best composer for video game music, FFX was the last in the franchise he worked as main composer. His music just makes the games so alive. Even if FFIX don't have voice acting, the dialogue combined with such beautiful music alone makes you feel a lot just like with the previous games ;).\n\nFFIX tells the unforgettable story of amazing and likeable thief Zidane Tribal, who gets entangled in a epic journey with the lovely princess Garnet Til Alexandros ^_^, best black mage ever Vivi Ornitier <3, a faithful and often dumb/funny knight Adelbert Steiner and many other great characters.\nIt's a journey to save the world, while forming a strong bond of friendship and finding answers, for example to their existence or memories. The character development is excellent. A beautiful story with a lot of funny, light hearted, touching moments and also with many mature and dark moments. The cutscenes are epic too.\n\nGameplay is really great and IX has the ability system, where you can customize your party defenses etc, depending on the situation. It has my favorite Chocobo minigame too, Hot&Cold where you hunt for treasures.\n\nThe port itself is very good, graphics are sharper, xbox controller works perfectly if use it, lots of achievements, combat hud is a bit bigger which is okey, includes some boosters that can help newcomers (like no encounters) and also music isn't messed up like in VII or VIII ports. One downside for some might be grey bars at the sides of screen, it didn't really bother me as I've wanted to play this so much on Steam. But still experiencing this game without them is the best feel and there is a simple ReShade mod in community guides, which I installed. That removes them so can enjoy fullscreen better.\n\nI love how IX return to the more fantasy style with mages, knights etc and I feel like it has everything that a masterpiece requires. A game that I still enjoy playing after 16 years is something special. I always love returning to this game. The newer Final Fantasy games simply don't feel the same. They don't capture the magical story and give feelings that these good older games did, but maybe FFXV will return to the good ones. There are still some moments in IX story that make me shed tears <(T_T)>.\n\nI recommend everyone to play this <(^_^)> and especially those who like more old-school games. If you don't like other FF games, well you might enjoy this. Those born after PS1 era or who just didn't experience it much and that possibly can't enjoy older graphics, I hope you give this a try.

While the rating doesn't agree with me, I honestly believe Final Fantasy IX is a fun way to introduce RPGs to all ages, and being able to replay it remastered made me relive me playing through it as a child.  Definitely a contender for one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nMost reviews point out the mobile UI used in the game, but honestly, I like it a little more.  If you look at comparison screenshots between the PC/Mobile and PS1, the crisp, easy-to-read UI wins out for me.  Granted, this could be my poor eyesight, but that seems to be the one thing most complain about.\n\nTo me, this game helped me relive my childhood again.

This port is their best port yet (which is saying a lot, yet not much at the same time).  And they have another one (of X's Remastered edition) coming out in a few days.\n\n-The FPS is still 30, but that's forgivable on the basis that it's a PS1 game.  Definitely a lot less jarring than the 30-to-15 reduction that IV and III see during battle sequences.\n-Unlike the other PS1/PC titles, they actually used the PS1 soundfont, so the music on the PS1 and the PC is identical, unlike VII and VIII which used a generic PC soundfont.  The music even loops right (unlike I's iOS/Android port, or V or VI's ports!\n-The UI is a lot less intrusive than you'd expect, since this port kept the iOS/Android UI.  The battle menus in particular are large enough to be visible from several feet away even on a smaller computer, but still not big enough to really take up half the screen.  After a while, it actually, dare I say it, looks pretty good that way, since there's little empty space to be seen in these menus.\n-The GRAPHICS!  The original game had the characters look incredibly pixelated (not that that was really Squaresoft's fault), but this game looks absolutely amazing (as though they rebuilt the textures from the ground up).  Prerendered environments still look a bit out of place, but the models are pristine.\n\nAnd as far as the game itself goes, nothing has changed.  It's refreshing that they didn't add anything (boosters aside) but didn't subtract anything either, meaning there's no real sense reviewing the game itself here when you can look a really good one from 2000 up with no problem.\n\nIf you have never played Final Fantasy IX, or if you have and would like some amazing nostalgia, or if you're an RPG lover, or hell, if you're a human being with a soul, play this game.","May 9","true","39.4"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","35","40","5","0"

It doesn't quite edge out VI or Tactics, but it's right up there with IV and XII.\n\nThis is a port of the old Playstation game from 2000, and if you aren't a little baby, there's a good chance you've played that version. If you have, you don't really need any type of review, as nothing has really changed. If you haven't played this entry in the series for whatever reason, say maybe VII and VIII were too different for you, IX is very much a return to basics.\n\nWhere as in VII the characters are largely interchangeable aside from their limit breaks due to the materia system, in IX we're back to each character having their own set combat commands and feeling like a unique class. Extra abilities come attached to various equipment, and if you wear the equipment and earn enough AP from fights, you can master the ability and use it without having that piece of equipment equipped on the character. This still doesn't let you learn any ability on anyone you want; just because you can equip an item on a character doesn't mean they can use the abilities it has. You're probably not going to learn magic on a melee type character for instance, even if he is using a hat that has cure magic on it.\n\nLike the somewhat recent Steam port of VII (and I assume VIII, I don't have that one on Steam) this version has some added options to help you speed through the game if you just want to experience the story. You can easily make everyone max level, learn abilities instantly, and max out your gil. They've also given us higher resolution cutscenes and character models. These aren't actually new assets or new cutscenes, they just look better than what the Playstation version had since they don't really have to worry about disc space anymore.\n\nSadly, that's really all the extras we got. It really would have been nice to get some of the extras that VI had in its recent iOS/PC port. With that game you got some extra espers, a new dungeon that was much more difficult than anything else in the game, and a new in game bestiary. I know these weren't made specifically for the PC port, and were carried over from the older GBA port of VI, but still... I mean, couldn't they have at least added some small stuff, like making the right stick turn the camera on the world map?\n\nThe lack of new features / content aside, I can't really find anything bad to say about this game. I'm hardly what I'd call a fanboy of the series, and this is still a really good jrpg. If you're into this genre, you could do a whole hell of a lot worse than Final Fantasy IX.","April 17","true","9.7"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","37","49","3","0"

I won't comment on the actual game since it came out 16 years ago and y'all should have a pretty good idea of what it is. I will however comment on the quality of the Steam release. Now I know that it's been out on Android for some time now, but having not played the mobile version, I cannot compare the two.\n\n- After reading some reviews (both negative and positive) and the forums, I wasn't expecting my Xbox One controller to work without getting a Joy2Key and performing the "run the game, then connect the controller when you get to the options menu" black magic. To my surprise, the controller worked right away. No tweaking, assigning controls or any use of keyboard+mouse was involved while I was playing.\n\n- Some said that they don't have an option to choose the 1080 resolution, I wouldn't know why that happens since I didn't encounter that issue.\n\n- Reworked fonts and menus look crispy clean. I didn't think it would matter until I saw it!\n\n- I'm not a fan of filters/other emulation enhancements and I took a moment to compare the standard emulation to the Steam release. The difference between the two is colossal. Yes, the static backgrounds haven't changed all that much but the new character models textures make more than enough difference.\n\n- The new autosave feature is extremely useful and works flawlessly. For some of us who has gained real life responsibilities since the last time we played FF9 this is an actual lifesaver.\n\n- Unlike FF7 and FF8, it was never ported to PC before so the MIDI sound issue 7 and 8 Steam releases had is not present.\n\nTo sum up my first impressions, I think the Steam version looks fantastic. This does feel like playing a remastered game. I know there's a lot of disagreement on what a remastered game should look like since the level of expectations goes from low to realistic to unrealistically high, but in my opinion this is a remaster worth playing.","April 14","true","9.3"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","26","31","2","1"

A game I have really fond memories of. In a lot of ways it's a game all about nostalgia.\n\nFinal Fantasy 9 takes place in a very cutesy chibi fantasy world where steampunk technologies like airships are just starting to become a thing. You play as Zidane, an amusing rogue who initially starts his quest on a mission to kidnap a princess. A far cry from the cold and distant protagonists of Cloud Strife and Squall Leonheart. However the plot gradually opens up into a very long quest as you eventually explore the world and encounter it's inhabitants.\n\nThe characters are where the game truly nails it. All of the party members in Final Fantasy 9 are memorable. Your black mage Vivi is insecure and always nervous. And Zidane and Vivi gradually grow into this almost brotherly bond with one another. Your princess Garnet yearns for adventure and over the course of the storyline develops a very pleasant romance with the protagonist. You eventually pick up her bodyguard Steiner, a perpetually aggravated knight sworn to protect her. And even more fantastical party members like Freya, an anthropomorphic rat clad in armor who joins the party looking for her long lost love. And Quina, a bizarre creature who has abilities based on enemies you allow him to consume. All of the party members in Final Fantasy 9 are great. I remembered all of them and the way they interact with each other and develop over the course of the story is a real treat.\n\nThe battle system in 9 takes from the previous games in numerous ways. The ATB system returns and they increased the amount of party members you can have in a single battle to 4 just like the pre-7 games. What I like about this release of the game in particular is it allows you to select elements of the user interface using the mouse. Which is very convenient and reduces the amount of fumbling through the menu that it usually would with the controller.\n\nThis is the first time Final Fantasy 9 has ever been released off the original Playstation so there are a few things to note if you've played Final Fantasy 7 or 8's PC ports. It doesn't let you use linear filtering like the original PS1 version, it uses a bilinear filter. For most people this won't be that big of a deal but it does look different compared to how you're used to. Otherwise it lets you play the game either with a controller or with a keyboard/mouse. And lets you control the user interface using the mouse which is a real treat to me. They also added an autosave feature and numerous little quirks into the game like allowing you to skip cutscenes.\n\nOne other thing to note is this isn't a full remake of Final Fantasy 9. The FMVs are the same, as are the 2D backgrounds and the 3D models. The only major differences I've noticed in the port compared to the original PS1 version are changes in the user interface. And like 7 and 8's PC ports it lets you optionally enable cheats to make you super powerful at the start of the game. So far the only major issue I've noticed is related to controller sensitivity so I hope that gets promptly fixed.\n\nThe entire game has this feeling of going back to something special. The soundtrack especially is full of very soft and somber themes that hearken back to childhood. It's a game that makes you feel like you're a kid again, and makes you want to return to old games you grew up with.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbwqTgJjtE0","April 14","true","2.9"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","24","31","2","3"

(Although why anyone would do so because a tiny screen)  The only thing I disliked about this whole thing was them annoucing it to be out in Feburary but did not get release until April 2016. But I see why now. It is still glitchy hence the "black screen of death" I got and that BSoD did not  lose much other than repurchasing and equiping equipment.\n\nPeople have been complaning about the audio. "Sounding off" as they say or "sounds compressed" while YES this is true, it is NOT the Final Fantasy VII midi sound quality.  It is not enough to detract from the game itself tho. It sounds good enough for me. All I can suggest is either play the OST in the backgorund and time it.. mute your tv... or deal with it. Maybe they will come out with a patch to remedy this but doubt it.\n\nThis game is worth 20.99 so if you miss off on launch sale, you can get it for that, or wait till the end of the year sale or Squares publisher sale...\n\nOkay PROS:\n* Nostalgia Nostalgia Nostalgia..\n*Added cheats if you so desire to be lazy.\n*Grapics are better.\n*AUTO SAVE everytime you change screens.\n*Full USB Contoller support .\n*The ability to skip cutscenes.\n*Fast Forward button "F1"\n*Did I mention Nostagia (for us 30-40 something players)\n\nCONS\n*Has a menu glitch (will strike trough when this is fixed)\n*Compressed music, but it is very tolerable.\n*No auto detect to change what to press when you are playing via keyboard to game controller. I had to relearn a few buttons.\n*Frame rates are stuck at 30fps for non cutscene screens 15fps for the cutscreen...\n*Does not save the "Cheats toggles" on reloads of saves.\n*Having to click play after I chosen my resolution everytime I start up.\n\nThis little gem is one you should play even after FF VIII made you decide to stop playing after that game. I just do not like the mechanics within. Square Soft made up with it in FF IX. It is worth buying.","April 18","true","32.6"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","5"

You have the tanky and hard  hitting knight Steiner. The white mage and healer Garnet, and the Black Mage, vivi, who can use elemental magic to damage enemies.

I hope FFXII and FFXV will follow suit, especially now since FFX/X-2 HD is released. With that said onto the review!\n\nI was skeptical at first regarding this game because I've heard so much good things about it but on the other hand it wasn't really a "hit" in terms of sales (it didn't get to the popularity of VII),  but rather than it got a cult following which I can appreciate. And because of that I decided to try it out having never played it before but hearing good things about it.\n\nSo here I am at the end of it and I must say that it surprised me completely with it's characters that were very well developed (especially Dagger & Vivi and let's not forget how awesome Quina is). I got so much into playing this game for the past couple of days without stopping until I finally reached the finish line.\n\nIt's one of the most "complete" Final Fantasy games in the franchise that I have played and it has managed to reached 1# on the FF games list for me followed by FFVII and FFX.\n\nDo I recommend this game? YES! Especially If you are into old school RPG's with an ATB system, it's charming characters and a soundtrack that will make you sometimes sad and sometimes happy.\n\nPS: This must be mentioned, but the PC only features that Square have implemented in these Final Fantasy ports in terms of boosters have been a godsend for those who want to go back and play the game out of nostalgia or for those that don't have hours and hours to grind through and make the minigames enjoyable.","May 18","true","103.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Plenty of other people already have, and many can be found right on this page. So I'm going to assume that you already know it's a good game. (Although just to add my own two cents to that matter: FF9 is, to this day, the only RPG - and very nearly the only game - that I have played all the way through to the end multiple times, and since getting it, I don't think I've ever gone more than two years without finishing it at least once.) Instead, I'd like to talk specifically about this version.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's still a great game (overall, I am still recommending it, after all), and everything that made it a great game is still here. But that's kind of the trouble - what makes it a great game is pretty much only what was already there in its original PlayStation release. Fun fact: the textures and backgrounds stored on the discs in the game's original release were actually quite a bit higher quality than the PlayStation was actually capable of rendering and displaying at the time. And sadly, it seems the devs were aware of this, because pretty much no effort went into updating anything except maybe the main characters a little. It seems like all they did for the backgrounds was simply blur the textures a little to hide the pixelation which probably works well enough at lower resolutions that are still higher than the original, but becomes pretty apparent at what I at least assume is close-to-standard gaming PC resolutions of 1600x900 and 1920x1080. Ironically, I think these would have looked much better had they actually put in even less effort, and just left them pixelated. I mean, they originals are almost pixel art as far as pre-rendered backgrounds go. The FMV cutscenes are spectacular however, and it's really great getting to see them without the resolution limitations of the PlayStation, however there are a few in-game cutscenes that use rendered models and the pre-rendered backgrounds and because of the slapdash update, these are borderline horrific. Thankfully, they are few and far between, and never more than a couple of seconds long, so they don't ruin the experience.\n\nAll in all, this supposedly "updated" rerelease is about what I had expected, though not what I had hoped for. Luckily, compared to plenty of other 15 year old games, it already had spectacular graphics that I, at least, think aged fairly well even in their original state, so it's probably only going to be hardcore fans of the game (like myself) who might be tempted to claw their eyeballs out. Ultimately, my recommendation is that if possible, you should actually get the original game. Just last year I finished a playthrough on my PS2 using a respectable 1080p widescreen TV, and it was just as beautiful there as I always remembered. However, if that's not feasible for you, I still recommend you at least get this version given that it is definitely what I would consider one of the must-play classics of gaming history - for its own merits, not simply its influences.\n\nAnd even slapdash and hasty as this rerelease was, I don't regret purchasing a second copy one bit. Just... be aware.\n\nP.S. Some other notes:\n- The sound seems to... I'm not sure what the technical terms are, but "cap out" at times, and gets a bit static-y with the higher pitches or louder sounds. It could just be that I was playing it with the speakers turned up a little louder than I usually game at, but I rather doubt it. (Incidentally, the original game doesn't have this problem.)\n- They seem to have basically cut out the stick-based movement controls. No matter how much or how little you push the analog sticks, you're going to move at the same speed and walking/running is based on the B button and which one you set to the default. I can see this potentially causing problems for veterans of the game since the analog stick and the D-pad controlled slightly differently. Basically, the analog stick moves you in the direction you move it, while the D-pad will shift so that when, for example, you're in a hall that is laid out at an angle, just pressing up or down moves you up or down the hall at that angle, rather than requiring you to keep tapping left or right every now and again. I haven't played enough to see which they've defaulted to for all movement, now, but either way I foresee some messy accidents, particularly in areas like Cleyra's trunk where you sometimes need to tread carefully.\n- On the brighter side, when naming party members you get this beautiful splash image of the character's face (from the those that appear when the title screen is idle, for those familiar with the game) along with a short (spoiler-free, even if it means occasionally lying to you) bio for the character telling you their age, species, and so on. Which I did appreciate.\n- Again, the FMV cutscenes are gorgeous in their full resolution glory.\n- Also again, it's still a fantastic game at its heart. Far and away the best Final Fantasy game (and certainly one of the best RPGs - J or otherwise), and I will only concede to Final Fantasy VI as a contender. Even then, I'd only agree to disagree. (And I say this as someone who has played every non-MMO Final Fantasy through to XII, as well as dozens of other western and JRPGs from Persona to Planescape to Elder Scrolls.)","April 15","true","4.8"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

There were quite a lot of improvements though it seems some people hated the Borderline that was added and wanted widescreen but kinda defeats the purpose of bringing back the Nostalgic days.\nI don't really see much problem about the price and people complain it being a mobile port when it doesn't as I don't see how it's different from the PsP/Console version besides all the HD Texture models, sounds and FMV. Even the file size is completely different. So I'm guessing its the minority people who really didn't go full research. Sure there is a FPS lock but this was created during the Playstation 1 Era and its not really easy to code the entire game to fit its FPS. You can turn on the highspeed mode with the F1 if you read the manual. There are cheats there though best not to use them unless you wish to speedrun or just to kill time.\nGame supports both Gamepad Control (It uses Japan Standard Layout) and has a perfect Keyboard+Mouse settings. The UI is kinda big and gets in the way at time.\nOnly the Main characters get a Remodel Texture while the rest didn't get the same Treatment. With the background it didn't see to fit also.\nThe sounds is also beautiful. Its not the Digital sounds that we all know as its replaced with actual musical instruments.\nBugs, I've yet to even encounter any of them. I guess it differs to peoples PC/Laptop setup so if you have any problems go check the Discussion Forums since people have reported missing sounds or some sort of broken controls.\nOverall the port is perfect and there is no DRM which is a bonus.","April 15","true","31.1"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","20","29","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalgokaito/recommended/377840/","dalgokaito","Demilikos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalgokaito/","115 products in account","Final Fantasy IX is like a childhood friend of mine I'm meeting again for the first time in over a decade. Among the cheerful memories, witty banter, romance, moments of doubt and lessons-learned... it opened up a world of intrigue and steampunk-sprinkled adventure to my 13-year-old self during a time in which the world had me jaded. The game especially held a dear place within me as I introduced it to my childhood best friend. Raised in a religious household, she never grew up with the television shows and general entertainment that most millennials growing up in the west were able to consume. After we played through the riveting kidnap and crash sequence, I could see in her eyes a new world of possibilities had emerged. Not too long afterward she had somehow obtained a PlayStation and a copy of the game, which she and her little sister would soon complete. I noticed from afar that it had colored her life, and her little sister's as well. That friend of mine left this world two years ago, losing a hard battle to cancer. Her little sister lost her life in a car accident just prior. It was devastating that they had gone and yet I would remain. And now Final Fantasy IX has returned like a ghost of the fond memories we had shared in our distant past.\n\nFinal Fantasy IX was released in 2000 for the PlayStation. Until 2016, there was no legitimate way of playing the game outside of PSN in the west. This re-release will open the game up to many who have never had the chance to play it. This absolutely excites me. Final Fantasy IX was my first Final Fantasy game. I have since played them all, but Final Fantasy IX still remains my favorite. From the setting, to the differed ideologies of its characters, to the clever dialogue and story with its well-executed character development, and Nobuo Uematsu's brilliant, beautiful music which tied the story and its varied settings together. Also, it arguably had the sharpest and most-unique graphics among the PlayStation-era Final Fantasy games. I held to this being my favorite in many conversations, and until recently, had been the only one I knew standing behind it. Most people I talked to would just laughed at the mere mention of IX, usually citing the character designs as the reason they never gave it a chance. It is by far the most underrated of the PlayStation-era FFs, and I'm curious to see if this will remain to be the case going forward.\n\nThis is a great port of the game. The character models and textures are highly improved, although as I write this so close to the Steam release date, many gamers are currently complaining about the pre-rendered background textures. I never expected SquareEnix to go back to the source files and re-render those CGI files for the modern-era. I'm not even sure if they have access to them, or are still able to open them with a program. If they could somehow do that, perhaps they'd even be able to re-render the 4:3 aspect ratio cutscenes into 16:9, but I'm just happy they were even able to improve the in-game 3D models, textures, and text -- although I could imagine a portion of the original players expressing some gripe toward the latter.\n\nSome would attribute these high-praises from original players to nostalgia-glasses. I'm here to say that I actually have a bigger appreciation for this game as an adult having a go at it again. So if you haven't given this game a try, what are you waiting for?","April 18","true","57.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

After the high tech themes of FF7 and FF8, Squaresoft went back to roots with a more traditional setting with boat airships, knights, and mages. The characters are all very well done with unique personalities that play and clash wonderfully with each other. The story starts out with a simple abduction of a princess, but eventually turns into a story about life and death itself.\n\nTHE PORT:\n\nThey did a good job of porting this to PC. The default keyboard controls are bizzare but can be rebound in the config menu. I would still reccomend using a gamepad though. The main characters have been given a higher poly makeover without looking bad or tacky. The cinematics have been given some love and been made sharper. I'm not sure how they did that but I wish FF7 and FF8 had been given the same treatment. All in all, you'd never even know this was a mobile port if no one told you.","May 13","true","73.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

That being said, this port is just not worth the money.\n\nThere are audio bugs rampant everywhere from sound effects being way too loud and clipping the audio near deafening you if you're wearing headphones, to audio just cutting out for apparently no reason. The HD models are nice but with the backgrounds just being upscaled from 144p (or whatever it was) there can be a huge disconnect at time and it can just look plain bad. The framerate can dip (Most notably on the world map when you have a chocobo, ship or airship) down into the 10's for a number of seconds or just straight up freeze for no reason, with a game that's already locked at 30 or sometimes 20 depending on if you're on a normal screen or the map/battle this is very disappointing.\n\nGoing back to the models it's clear some were given more love than others, models like Garnet and Steiner look fantastic whilst people like Zidane and Eiko still have these weird awkward faces that look ridiculously out of place. Most NPC's models have just been upscaled too and when standing next to the player models they look terrible. One of the biggest irks I had was the issue of no longer having infinite analogue control movement. instead of being able to run in any direction like you could in the Playstation 1 version of the game, for some reason this game only lets you run in 8, meaning you will get caught on the scenery A LOT and when you're playing something like Chocobo Hot 'n' Cold it can lead to a lot of frustration.\n\nLike I said I hate having to put this, but I cannot recommend this game in it's current state. Just buy the port on PSN if you want to play it OR play the original version on Playstation.","April 30","false","40.6"," 24 of 42 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","24","42","3","1"

The characters move very smoothly and the clarity is unreal. I can actually see the details in weapons that I never knew were there in the old Playstation version. Everything is very much up scaled. I'm kinda bummed Square Enix didn't remaster the music too (it's amazing to begin with though) but this isn't a full on remaster so it's whatever.\n\nThus far, my only gripe(s) is that sometimes the frame rate craps out only slightly because they up scaled the characters so much that the back ground gets a little constipated. Like when you take control of Vivi and the camera zooms in with "Alexandria" fading in and out of the screen. Then when he gets knocked down by Puck... sweet baby jesus TEH blur. I also noticed it suffers from the same nonsense the other Final Fantasies when they're ported (to/from) andriod--the interface. The stupid battle menus look like the same cancer as before which perplexes me.... this was meant for PC but I feel like it being held back because of the port to android?\n\nOne last thing, no matter what screen ratio you choose or even if you full screen or window the game has this border on both sides that's distracting. I blame android. I feel this could have been SO MUCH MORE if they didn't bother with the android stuff and pushed for a PC release only. Just my opinion though.\n\nANYWHO! I'm grateful this was "remastered" because it is my favorite Final Fantasy from the Playstation era. It's nice to see it at least cleaned up and easily accessible for me to play again. I love it for the nostagia factor yes, but I also love the game in no matter what format it's in.

Final Fantasy 9 orijinalinde 2000 yapımı bir oyun. Uzun yıllar sonra sonra steama daha doğrusu PC ye geldi. Diğer FF ler gibi.\n\nGrafikler elden geçirilmiş ama 16 yıl öncesine ait bir oyun olduğundan çok bişey beklemeyin. Yine de hem FF oynamak istiyor hem de grafik arıyorsanız 13 üçlemesine yönelin.\n\nTantalus adlı görünürde çeşitli şehirlerde tiyatro oyunları sergileyen gerçekte ise hırsızlık yapan bir grubun üyesiyiz. Görevimiz tiyatro oyununu maske olarak kullanıp prensesi kaçırmak. Tabi ilginç bişey olur. Prenses de saraydan kaçmak niyetindedir. Ve böylece maceramız başlar. Konu Final Fantasy olduğu için bundan kat be kat fazlasını gönül rahatlığıyla bekleyebilirsiniz. İstediğinizi alacaksınız.\n\nOynanışa gelirsek Final Fantasy 7-8 i oynadıysanız yabancılık çekmeyeceksiniz. Sıra tabanlı random encounter olan sistem. Farklılıklardan bahsetmek gerekirse; 7 de Materia sistemi vardı, 8 de Junction. 9 da ise şöyle bir sistem var. Kullanacağınız yetenekler itemlere bağlı. Misal bir yeteneği istediğiniz zaman kullanmak istiyorsanız size o yeteneği veren itemi giyip o yeteneği öğrenene kadar o itemi takmalısınız. Genelde çok yüksek rakam isteyen yetenek pek yok. Ayrıca boss dövüşleri yerine göre 8-10 20 30 yetenek puanı verdiğinden çokta sıkıntı olmaz bu.\n\nKesin olarak öğrenmeniz gereken yetenekler ise auto-life, auto-haste, auto-regen. En az 4 karaktere bunları öğretin. Dikkat etmeniz gerekn birşey daha var. Diyelim bir itemde 3 yetenek var. Bir karakter bu 3 yetenekten 2 sini öğrenebilirken diğeri sadece birini bir başkası ise hiçbirini öğrenemeyebiliyor. Aynı item ama öğrenilen yetenekler farklı. Yetenekleri hızlı öğrenmek istiyorsanız "ability up"ı öğrenip equip yapın. Sonra gidin farm yapın.\n\nFinal Fantasy 9 neşeli cıvıl cıvıl bir oyun. Öyle ki en hüzünlü anda bile yemek muhabbeti duyabilirsiniz. Bu yüzden bolca kahkaha attığınız anlar olacak oyunda. Oyunda midesine benden daha düşkün bir karakter var. Daha ne diyeyim.\n\nOyunla ilgili ufak bir hayalkırıklığım oldu. Nasıl dediğinizi duyar gibiyim. Olay şu; Final Boss savaşı (3 savaş) çok çabuk bitti. 15 dakika sürmedi bile. Sadece bir karakterim 2 kere öldü bu 3 svaşta. Gerisinin hp si 1000 altına inmedi bile. Üstte bahsettiğim yeteneklerin ve sağlam gitmeminde etkisi var bunda tabi ama benzer şekilde Sephiroth a gittiğimde öttürmüştü resmen. Ki onda hp im 9000 lerdeydi. Bunda 7000 de olan HP im yoktu. Resmen "öldüya la" deyip kalakaldım.\n\nİlginç bişey daha söyleyeyim. Oyundaki en yüksek Hp ye sahip karakter aklınıza bile gelmez. O paylaştığım küreye benzer şekli olan değil. 2 tane var gerçi. Birini rahatlıkla bulabilirsiniz ama belli bir görev yapmadan savaşamazsınız. Görevse çok vakit alıyor. Ben yarısından sonra yapmadım. Ekipteki kişilerden birinin ultimate silahı bu dediğim kişide. Diğeri içinde Friendly Monster görevini yapmanız lazım. Hepsini yapmadan bulsanız bile. Ötekilerle buluşmadın deyip kaçıyor. Bu görevse inanılmaz sinir bozucu. Çünkü bi türlü çıkmıyo dallamalar.\n\nSevimli dostlarımız chocobolar bu oyunda da varlar. Bu sefer chocobolarımızı geliştirmek için yarıştırmak/çiftleştirmek zorunda değiliz. Sıcak-soğuk diye bir oyun vardırya sonuca yaklaştıkça sıcaaak sıcaaaaaaaaaaaaak denilir. Ona benzer bir oyun oynayıp chocograph denilen parçaları buluyoruz. Chocographlarda bize bir noktayı gösteriyor. Hazine orda. Bu bulduğumuz hazinelerden bazıları chocobomuzun gelişmesini yeni yetenekler öğrenmesini sağlıyor. Bazı ultimate silahları gizli yerleri hatta resmini paylaştığım o yuvarlak küreyi bulmanın yolu chocobo side questi olduğu için yapmanızı öneririm.\n\nEee müzikler, müzikler nerde? Onlardan niye bahsetmiyon diyeceklere; "Uematsu var bir kere taam mı. Siz Uematsu nun adının geçtiği bir yapımda müzikleri tartışmaya mı açıyorsunuz?" 10/10 müzikler. Özellikle ending şarkısı çok çok güzel. Dinlemek isteyen olursa diye parçanın adını söylemiyorum. Bilenler de söylemesin. Oyunu oynayın kendiniz görün. Çünkü hem şarkı hem öncesi çok güzel. Ben bulup dinleyecem diyorsanız da klip olarak değil de bi tane resim olur şarkı çalarya o şekil dinleyin. Çünkü spo yiyeceksiniz ve spo benim en nefret ettiğim şeydir oyunlarla/filmlerle ilgili.\n\nBu sefer kısa yazacam deyip gene destan yazdım. Sağlam hikaye, bol esprili bir oyun istiyorsanız ilacınız Final Fantasy 9. Alın oynayın.","April 27","true","80.0"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","17","29","3","0"

In fact, probably one of the best stories out there in general. This is by far my absolute favorite game ever made. I played it at least 11 times through on my PS1 as a kid, and this port on Steam was not only solid, but (unsurprisingly) also brought me along for one of the best nostalgia trips I've ever had. This game STILL makes me cry, and even after just now completing it again for the 12th time, I STILL wouldn't mind playing it again. It's because this game is built on two major things that so many games lack, and that's VISION and HEART. FFIX is filled with interesting character designs, environments, side-quests, and overall story. It's very light hearted and really stresses the theme of the strength built through working together with friends. If you like Final Fantasy games or turn-based RPGs and haven't played this before, please please PLEASE give this game a try.

But if you look at the discussion forums, you'll note that half of the entries are from people where the game is simply too buggy to play.  I'm one of those people and I do not want anyone to buy this game and waste their money until SE patches the game.\n\nThe problem is the controller interface.  If you have an Xbox 360 controller there is, for unknown reasons, a 50/50 chance the game will be unplayable for you.  You can update all your drivers, and in the forums people have rituals they're trying to do to make it work (similar to blowing in an NES cartridge back in the day).  But the bottom line is, the PC version of the game was a direct port from the smart phone version, and the programming for the controls was not done well.  If you have an Xbox One controller, the game will be unplayable.  For me it's so bad with the One controller that I can't even make it past the start menu.  The problem is so bad for both of these controllers that if I had them plugged in at all at any time before I start the game, I can't even play with my keyboard!  I literally have to go into my device manager and turn off Human Interface Devices and enable only my KB and Mouse as peripherals.  And I have to do that every time I want to attempt to play with my KB (which kills the experience for me anyway).\n\nSo in sum, you're playing roulette with purchasing this game.  And the sad part is, the opening week deal will be over before they patch it, if they even do.  I personally am considering the 16 dollars spent on this a donation to SE, since I don't feel like going through the hassle of getting a refund.  I own FFVII, FFVIII, FFXI, FFXIV, and Lightning Returns, all on Steam.  And every one of those titles works just fine with both the 360 and the One controller with default device drivers.

Although many times the Final fantasy series have similar plots such as the protagonists being branded as outcasts, run around the world then at some point managed to save the day and concludes with a happy ending but it still never fails to captivate me. In addition, FFIX has very detailed characters where each character holds a very deep story of their own. Not to mention, all the characters are very likable. Like take for example animes, dramas, movies, novel and basically anything that is a story; there will always be that 1 irritating egg head character that stresses you to the point where you would go ‘JUST GET THE FUQ OFF ALREADY KUNT?!?!?’. But for some odd reasons these characters somehow someway get a lot of screen time... WHY? -.-‘ Nevertheless, FFIX has none :3 (maybe Steiner in the beginning I guess LOL).\n\nMoving on, FFIX also has great music that comes along with it ( yea.. Garnet.. and her mellifluous voice [I think she was my first crush >.<]) I must say I absolutely adore her when she was singing the ‘Melodies of Life’. Then there’s also Beatrice. Her theme and her character without a doubt carries their charm too. Although there is also Freya and Eiko but since they are not as visually attractive.. I have decided to skip (Don’t judge me :P)\n\nThe graphics and gameplay matter little to me back then, they still matter little to me now. The fantasy FFIX brought me through remains beautiful.

This was probably why it managed to slip under the radar for many folks, even though the graphics were on par with the PS2’s titles at that time.\n\nThis game harkens back to the NES and SNES world-types, and was the last game composed entirely by Nobuo Uematsu – the brilliant mind behind Final Fantasy’s genre defining music.\n\nThe truth is, the characters are all stereotypically cliché, and the plot is formulaic – but the world is so immersive and the storytelling so charming that this fails to detract from the experience. It’s fluff, not Machiavelli; it’s meant to be enjoyed. It overcomes the sitcom-like positioning of its set-pieces and embarks the player on a delightful experience, full of drama, pathos, and a fair number of laughs. If that’s not something you find desirable in a game, I suggest you look elsewhere – otherwise I can’t recommend it enough.\n\n----------\n\nThat’s all well and good, but how well does the port run?\n\nBetter than the original, honestly. I’ll address the cons in a moment, but they got everything as good as I could have hoped. Comparing both to the original PS game and optimum emulator settings, the game is so much crisper than it’s ever been. Previous aliasing miss-alignment are gone entirely, and the image fidelity is exactly what you’d expect from your computer’s hardware (again, qualifying these statements below). The UI has been updated, others attribute it to the mobile port which I haven’t played, but I’m inclined to say it’s a marked upgrade, even if it takes up additional screen space. I’m going to pick it apart in a moment, but with everything I’m about to say taken into account, I don’t really see how it could have done better.\n\nThat’s a hell of a statement, and you may be disinclined to agree with me in light of some other reviews, or even if you’ve played the game. And you’re right, you see graphical flaws, the textures are fair-to-poor in many places, the framerate is capped to about 30fps, and it’s pillarboxed.\n\nYes, these are issues this port has, and it’s understandable if they detract from your experience playing the game, but as I said: because they’re using the original game assets, it’s as good as it’s going to get.\n\n“What!?” – Let me tell you about how they made this game 16 years ago. The majority of the game (except for cut scenes, world map, and battle arenas) are all sprites, not rendered scenes with hundreds of polygons. FFVII and FFVIII used actively rendered scenes, this is true – but for FFIX they took a completely different visual style. They pre-rendered all the landscapes and “baked’ them into a dozen or so polygons – significantly lessening the processing necessary, instead opting for a much higher level of detail than the previous two titles were able to achieve. The thing is, many gamers today would prefer active rendering because it’s become the norm, and that the resolution of the textures are very lacking by today’s standards.\n\nBecause of this, you get the reasoning behind the biggest complaints folks seem to be having in the reviews: The game is pillarboxed to 4:3 because that was the stock aspect ratio of all CRT screens used 16 years ago – they can’t just extend the camera to 16:9 like they did for the FFVII and FFVIII ports because the game’s assets were finalized into 4:3 images.\n\nSecondly, along with the 4:3 target aspect ratio, standard-definition[en.wikipedia.org] PAL televisions only had a max resolution of 720 x 576 (NTSC TVs in the US were a little smaller). This is why the textures are at the low resolution you’re seeing. If they made the game with higher quality textures, you’d never (ever) see a quality change on your standard-definition television. Personally I can’t blame Square for not having the foresight of knowing they’d be re-releasing the game into 1080p 16 years later. I’m just glad they didn’t emulate interlacing like you need to if you’re emulating the game on the PC.\n\nThe framerate cap is understandable, if undesirable. I’m not sure the reason, but the game runs dependent on a fixed update, not per cycle of your processor. 30fps was likely chosen because the original framerate was either 24, 25, or 30fps per SDTV. While HDTV is frequently 60fps, they likely used the age-old doubling jitter-reducing[en.wikipedia.org] trick to match current monitor refresh-rates. (It’s not particularly necessary to understand what this means). The odd thing about this is that it is a solid framerate cap – I attempted to insert a speed-hack modifier into the game’s memory, only to have it crash every time (I wanted to use this as a frame-skip feature present in emulators). The game doesn’t hang when loading new scenes like the original did, so I suppose I’ll take that as an acceptable improvement.\n\nThe only other thing to talk about are the changes made to the UI. All-in-all I think it’s a large improvement, the only detraction being the increased size to accommodate mobile users. Everything about the menus, including the portraits, are much (much) sharper than they were in the original. If anything it’s too much of an improvement because it’s so much of a contract from the rest of the game. It does leave me to wonder that if they made such improvements to the UI, they could have adapted it to be a little more efficient with screen-space for the PC port. The additional features (infinite money, max level, etc. cheats) are in an out-of-the way place that are kind of hard to find, but they weren’t in the original, so I’m not sure where else they should have been put.\n\nSo, after all that, I can certainly recommend the game – both the core game and the port.","April 14","true","23.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Haven't played it in many, many years and it is a huge notalgia trip for me. Just a few pros and cons below:\n\nPros:\n-Obviously the updated character models and menu graphics, which look amazing.\n-Haven't played it on a keyboard and mouse, but the controller setup plays just how I remember it on the PS1. (Had to   switch two buttons around, but that's not a complaint.)\n-One of the best stories of any of the Final Fantasy games.\n-I like the fact that when you try to interact with an npc, that game brings up icons to let you know if they are a character that you can challenge to a card game.\n\nCons:\n-The controls bug out when I start the game with both the PC controls and controller active at the same time. (To be fair that might just be my computer.)\n-The 2D background look absolutely horrible. They are incredibly blurry and clash very obviously with the new high quality character models.

My friend gifted this game to me all of sudden, so I have an opportunity to replay it.\n\nBack then my english was not as good as now. The emo heroes such as Cloud and Squall shaped the general jrpg heroes, the sudden introduction of Zidane deviated the popular tropes, it's probably the reason I didn't like FF IX back then. Perhaps because Final Fantasy VII was my first Final Fantasy entry (I only played three rpgs on SNES: Chrono Trigger, Mystic Quest, and Super Mario RPG. I played FF VI only after the re-release on PSX) therefore I couldn't understand why everyone praised FF IX, when actually this was a very refreshing entry on JRPG.\n\nI have forgotten 80% of the plot, so this is almost like a new gameplay for me. Well, I gotta say this game is truly charming. The opening scene and the kidnapping of princess Garnet is probably one of the best opening I ever seen. It truly established the characters of the cast very well and you can tell the light-hearted atmosphere of the game. I really like it.\n\nNow for the quality of the port itself. So far I think it's the better port of FF entry, the game is capped 30 fps which is just fine. The 3d graphic has been upscaled to HD version.\n\nAs this is a port of an old game, you will notice that the pre-rendered CG don't age very well. One of the main reason is that Square lost all the high-resolution arts (please read and cry)\n\nhttp://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=551612\n\nthe good thing, this game has also a built in cheat. 9999 damage for example. if you don't care about the gameplay and just want to enjoy the story (it also has a fast forward button). just activate the cheat. Be careful about the level 99 cheat though, it will only increase your level, not your status\n\nThis game is truly a classic. I think I can appreciate this game better than before.","April 19","true","5.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It was rather disappointing to wait this long for the release after they announced it for "early 2016" but anyways, if the reason is that they needed more time to make it even better I don't care.\n\nThe game itself runs perfectly smooth and works the same way as expected from a console port that is done well. I can run it with my keyboard alone if I want to, which is nice, because my pad broke down..\n\nDon't expect everything to be reworked because that is not the case. The character models and render movies are reworked, the world and most other things aren't.

Again.  And the same warning as last time.\n\nWARNING:  IF YOU ARE EXPECTING FINAL FANTASY XIII GRAPHICS AND FOR WHATEVER REASON HAVE IGNORED EVERYONE TELLING YOU, REPEATEDLY, THAT THIS IS A PORT OF THE ANDROID/IOS VERSION - WHICH IS A PORT OF A PS1 GAME FROM 16-17 YEARS AGO - DO_NOT_BUY, or at least don't complain.  Why drop $16 on a game you know you'll just complain about?\n\nOkay, so if you're expecting high-def backgrounds - don't.  Look.  This game was released in 2000/1999.  Back then it looked spectacular, they DID put a lot of effort into it, and I'm almost 100% certain they never ever thought that they would be re-making this game.  The models used for the pre-rendered areas no longer exist.  Accept it.  There's far more to the game, such as the story, dialogue, and music.\n\nThe character models, battle scenary, and menus?  They're great.  At times it looks the models are watercolor painted, and personally I like that.  The menus and item icons are well-polished.  The music is still the same music as before, maybe slightly higher audio quality - but that could be due to hardware, so don't take my word on that.\n\nSome people are having controller issues, but my 360 controller seems fine.  Your results may vary, but I'm 100% certain it'll be patched in the next couple days.\n\nBut I digress on the port issues.  Let's delve into the meat of the game...\n\nFinal Fantasy IX is a return to the midieval roots of the series. This doesn't necessarily mean four crystals and yatta yatta.  It's about people coming together, becoming friends, and overcoming evil. Characters hava pre-defined classes, but while there's no job system they're the classic Final Fantasy I-IV classes.  Customization is plentiful through weapons, armor, and accessories.  Music is memorable, and as it's stuck with me for 16 years at this point?  I'm pretty sure it'll have a similar effect on you.  The storyline has a good many twists to keep you interested.  Personally some find the begining a bit long and boring, but I -promise- you that after you get out of the forest you'll be on the edge of your seat for the rest of the game.  As fr the characters, some are hit-or-miss but I honestly feel like if you got attached to the characters in Undertale that you'll do the same for at least of the characters in this story.\n\nIf you're not new to the game, but are thinking of buying it for nostalgia?  There are some nifty additions that'll help you beat the game more quickly without breaking the gameplay experience. So yes, for the nostalgia, $16 ($20 if you're reading this after the sale ends) is worth it.","April 14","true","102.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

I still remember their game discs were made in black, and that added on to the special feeling I have for FF9 since then.\n\nI will not compare to other Final Fantasy games because each has its own attraction and audience. For me, FF9 feels like a throwback to the classic FF system. Although the mechanisms may seem simple, along with its simplistic graphics, it allowed me to "fill in the gaps" in my mind with my imagination, and allowed me to immerse in its story and emotions.\n\nThis is my Final Fantasy, and this is how I tell and re-tell the story. This is the fourth time I'm re-telling the story, and I still have more interpretations each time. Final Fantasy is about telling a story like no other games can. Yes, graphics may be a boon, but if a Final Fantasy game can't tell a story 10x better than its graphics could, then it has failed as a Final Fantasy.\n\nI believe Final Fantasy IX has done that. It shows how great games don't necessarily need to have life-like facial features and individually-moving strands of hair. In fact, I'd rather let the mind fill in those gaps for me, as that is actually more enjoyable and personal than having everything laid out for me.\n\nThis is my Final Fantasy, and this is how I tell and re-tell the story.

My all time favorite Final Fantasy game and one of my top 3 favorite games of all time. I am so glad just like Final Fantasy VI remastered edition, you guys have out done yourself on bringing this game to a pc port. Everything I loved about this game back when it released in 2000, is here, and it makes me so happy to be replaying it again. I still own my PS1 copy but the PC version is so beautiful in HD resolution. I totally recommend this for all the classic Final Fantasy players and new players of RPG games all together.

(Unsure about 360 controllers, but should be the same)\n\n- Cheap port from the iOS / Android where it still has that ugly grey background so you cannot truely have the full resolution ---> I did find a mod to fix this, but that mod does not satisfy me.\n\n- Battle UI is so CRAMPED ! you can barely see your characters as the UI is covering it !!! This was more utilized for the mobile gaming hence the cheap port\n\n- World map is so huge as well as the chocograph in the way, they should have kept this the same as the PS1 version\n- Android/iOS saves do not sync over the cloud, you have to go out of your way and transfer it (Only found method for Android)\n- Honestly, all the above needs its fix !!!\n- Also notice some characters portraits have been swaped such as FREYA (Not much of a hassle, but I still prefer the classic)\n\nPros:\n- Many side quest\n- Turbo mode (F1 key) to skip long dreadful random battles\n- Good story\n- Mini games etc\n- Music\n\nSquare, please fix this issue don't leave this master piece slightly broken and let modders fix the game for you!","June 5","false","28.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Probably the most awkward among them is that this port offers no real analog control, plus name entry is mouse+keyboard only. This is not a port that can be easily enjoyed in big picture mode (that said, this is plainly stated on the store page). I like mouse and keyboard support, but not when it fully supplants gamepad input. Overall, it seems like controller support was at best an afterthought, which makes sense in the context of a mobile release, but not for PC these days - and certainly not for a game that originally saw release on a console 16 years ago. It's more than a little obnoxious that I should have to hold a button to run while using the analog stick, rather than just using the analog stick like nearly every other 3D game has since Super Mario 64. Final Fantasy 9 really deserves better.\n\nOtherwise, things are pretty good. Obviously the backgrounds don't hold up terribly well, but they get the job done. Only a handful of high resolution assets from development of the PS1 version still exist, and nobody reasonable was expecting Square Enix to remake the rest to match. I don't know what the situation is with the FMV, but it looks surprisingly nice. The 3D models of course look great, and while it is a shame the game is still 30 fps locked, I can't honestly say I'm that broken up about it.\n\nAt the end of the day, while it exhibits some unwelcome mobile-to-PC port idiosyncracies, this is still a good PC release of one of the best Final Fantasy games ever. It could use a bit more polish, but it's fun and nostalgic as is. If they improve the controller support, it'll be damn near perfect.","April 16","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But, in the sake of a complete review I will give my opinion of the game, itself. If you're reading this review, you probably have some interest in this title. If that is the case, then I suggest you play it. As plain as that.\n\nNow, what I am really here to do is sell you on the Steam port of Final Fantasy IX. I have played the game on the original Playstation, and I have played the original version on both emulator and PSP. I have not played the mobile version, but it is essentially the same as this port without controller support. This version is, by far, the best way to play this game.\n\nLet's start with the negatives:\n-One of the biggest complaints I've seen is that, while sprites and menus have been updated, backgrounds and other images in the game have not. This didn't bother me one bit. Yes, the HD assets do stand out against the old PS1 pre-rendered environments, but given Final Fantasy IX's cartoon-like art style, I don't think it looks bad at all. Your mileage may very.\n-Another big complaint I've seen is that the battle menu is so big. It can often cover-up the numbers that appear over the last two characters in the party when they're damaged/healed. This is obviously to cater to touch-screen for mobile, and a lot of people point out that they could have left the original menu in as an option for those who wanted it. It's a fair complaint, I think.\n-I have encountered a few bugs. Mostly involving the music cutting out momentarily or stuttering during scene transitions. It always corrects itself after a moment, but it did annoy me and break my immersion once or twice. They're a slight nuisance at worst.\n-To activate the Toggle-able Boosts (No Encounters, Fast Forward, etc.) you have to pause the game and then press one of the 4 shoulder buttons if you're using a controller (permanent boosts are enabled in the config menu, and using a keyboard the toggles are F1-F4, just FYI.) First, there is no mention in the game that these boosts even exist, and there's no way I've found to change these contros. When I was first playing, I was unaware you could control the boosts this way, and I must have bumped one of them coming out of pause, (not noticing the visual indicator in the corner of the screen to show a boost is active) because the next fight all of my characters magically had full trance bars. Little heads up would be nice.\n-Certain areas of the game that are meant to have low encounter rates seem to have MUCH lower encounter rates. At first, I thought it was a bug with Qi's marches. I didn't encounter an enemy in one until the end of the third disc. Having caught 99 frogs and defeated Quan I finally learned Frog Drop. I also didn't get a single random encounter while going through the Desert Palace. (And, no, the No Encounters boost was no on, I checked every time I paused)\n-No windowed full-screen mode. Probably my biggest complaint. There is a TON of stuff in this game, and a lot of it requires a guide. Having a guide up on one screen and playing on another means dealing with the game minimizing every time you click off of it, or running it in a window (yuck!)\n\nNow, on to all of the good stuff:\n-Battles are faster. This, alone, makes this THE way to play Final Fantasy IX. The PS1 vsersion had notoriously slow ATB gauges. Being able to increase the battle speed is a Godsend. At max, there's virtually zero downtime between animations.\n-The new models and menus look fuh-reaking awe-some. Nothing seems to be changed at all, just HD-ified. Even with the backgrounds really showing their age, these changes breath some life into this sixteen-year-old title.\n-Skippable cinematics and a Fast-Forwad mode for whatever you can't skip. Do I need to explain why this is awesome?\n-No Encounters is great for when you have to revisit areas and you don't want to be bothered by low-level encounters. I wouldn't recommend leaving it on permanently unless you're using other boosters or going for fast times or low level or whatever.\n-Speaking of the other boosters, they're there for those who want to use them. If you're looking to play through the story hassle-free or achievement hunting I could see them being useful. Maybe not trance every fight. That one is mostly just annoying.\n-Aside from the issues outlined above, the game runs perfectly. Load times are virtually nonexistant, no slowdown anywhere. The requirements are very low. I don't see many people having a hard time running this.\n-AUTO-SAVE! Hallelujah, auto-save. Did you forget to equip Master Thief before the boss fight? Or maybe you just plain got K.O.'d. Don't want to start all the way back at the save point? No problem, just hit 'Continue' on the title screen and it takes you right back to your last screen transition. (Note: scenes that start right as you enter an area will automatically start when you continue this way, so in rare cases you may not be able to access the menu before a fight. This means you should still save often just in case you need to roll back a few screens.) Couple this with cinematic skips and fast-forward and you can get right back into the action.\n-Controller support is fantastic. Feels just like the original, although you'll probably want to swap A and B if you're used to a western control scheme. Mini-games like Jump Rope or the duel with Blank are just as responsive as in the original.\n-It's $20. I bought it during the release sale for $16. I think it's a good price.\n-If it's not listed here, consider it untouched. As of writing this, I am 50 hours into the game, and I have found no gameplay differences from the original (the Cotton Robe trick still works, in case you were wondering.) It is as true to the original as it could be. Even the changes only enhance, never change or detract from what was already there.\n\nFinal Fantasy IX was, from it's inception, a love letter to the glory days of the classic Sword-and-Sorcery style JRPG.

Controller works perfectly too. The new character models look very good, although the slightly blurry backgrounds make them sometimes stand out maybe a little too much. The HD cinematics though are very pretty and very well done.\nAll in all, it's a good port.\n100 out of 100 nobles were impressed.","April 18","true","42.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though the frames are locked at 30, it hardly noticible. There are 2 stylized gray bars at the top and bottom of the screen for aspect ratio. As mentioned by so many others the graphics are really good on forgound characters and interactives and not so much on background; even so you can tell they touched up a lot in general. I don't know if they touched up the cinematics but they look splendid! The onlything that kind of gets in the way is the GUI at times, but I hardly noticed through out my play\n\n10/10 as a port\n","April 19","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
