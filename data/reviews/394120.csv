The creators of AU, Atom Republic, previously created content for PS Home, but after PS Home was shut down in March 2015, they asked the community what they should do next and the overwhelming response was to build a new virtual world as a successor to PS Home and hence the idea of Atom Universe was born. Atom Republic had a Kickstarter campaign for the game in April 2015 to help fund the development of the intial release which was successful. Atom Republic has partnered with several former 3rd party developers for PS Home such as Engine Giant, Game Mechanics, JAM Games, PS Talent (of which I am a long time member), and more to come. Patrick O'Luanaigh, CEO of nDreams, was also made the AU team's non-executive director during the summer of 2015. He has referred to Atom Universe as "the successor to PS Home." Since PS Home's closure, many former PS Home developers have created their own game, but Atom Republic is the only one to have partnered with others. The game is developed with Unreal Engine 4 and features amazing realistic graphics and supports cross-play between PC and PS4 with the potentional to be supported on other platforms (Mac, XBoxOne, etc.), including future ones, e.g. PS5. The game will also support Virtual Reality with such headsets as PlayStation VR for PS4 and Oculus Rift for PC. Atom Republic has been very responsive to feedback from its community and IMO done an excellent job with this project. As a reward for my donation level to the game's Kickstarter that I mentioned, I was given the opportunity to test the Alpha version of the game, which I have been doing for several months now. During this time, I have seen a lot of progress made on the game's development as new features have been added and various bugs fixed. The Early Access version was just made available to backers of the project this past Saturday, February 27, which includes a space which we have not seen in the Alpha called Arcade Plaza. Here's a promotional video that shows what the Arcade Plaza looks like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftGDFQCRVCs The Early Access version will later be made available to the entire Steam Community but until then, backers like myself will continue to test it. Whether you are looking for a successor to PS Home or a new realistic social game/virtual world in which to play then Atom Universe is for you. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!","February 29","true","163.9"," 53 of 77 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","53","77","7","20"

Graphics are cool and the idea might be good but you need to give us gamers something to look forward to not a bowlin experience which on my windows 8 PC didnt even work. Also to quit the game I had to hold Ctr+Alt+Delete to close it with task manager, and I have a really decent laptop for gaming. Not worth the installation wait. Froze my whole computer too, too heavy to operate.  Also how is this a theme park featured with fun? I swear from the looks of this game I thought it was gonna be sims but a play park lmao.

It would've been best it they finished a bit more and had more to offer on EA release date already it's put a rather bad taste on people. I think reason for them releasing it so early is either trying to build up a player base/community, monitor social interaction and how they can improve upon it, or trying to get some early profit through microtransactions (hopefully not the last one). This game already has a pretty well established community of followers and Kickstarters they could've waited before EA release with a bit more. If you were a regular user of Playstation Home back on the PS3 before it's shutdown you know why this exists but to anyone who is new you'll probably be a bit turned away from it. In the game's current state I can't really recommend it to anyone because like fore mentioned just not enough to show for to really past a sensible amount of judement in my opinion.","March 24","false","2.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The only accessible game seems to be the bowling game, but you need unobtainable currency in order to play it, so technically that is inaccessible as well. The chat system doesn't work either, so it is pointless to even try to do anything in this game at the moment.\n\nIn relation to the current game design, I must say that the menu system is irritating.

But the controls feel unnatural. Graphics look great, but the movement of avatars, the menus, and the physics need some work. AU is still in it's early alpha phase so we really can't judge it too harshly yet. Devs are still working on this and are really just testing how well things work out with players in game. So I suggest that everyone give this a try and then put your feedback on their forums so they can improve the game. There's really no reason not to recommend a game that is still in progress lol.

Nothing to do as the developpers already said in the game menu but better put games on steam when there is actually something to do.

Glad this one was for free but that doesn't mean i can leave a negative reply.\nProlly i will never come back to look if something has changed. Because i have bought 1 game from steam in Januari 2015 and now in March 2016 that game hasn't changed in a bit while that game costs 15 bucks.\n\nSorry steam but i never gonna buy a game anymore after i bought 1 of you.

When I heard about Atom Universe coming to the scene and that its like PS Home, I just had to check it out and so far, I am not dissapointed! :D In this open beta early access so far you can go to the Arcade Plaza and play bowling which is soon to have a multiplayer! The people here so far are friendly and most are from PS Home like myself so its great how we can all meet up here and soon, we'll all be able to explore the park once it opens and start racing, bumper cars, go on the big wheel, log flumes maybe even prize machines! :D Another thing to mention is that the ps home artists are helping out, cool right? This game defo has potential and can defo see the game along with the fanbase growing overtime and I will continue to support it as it goes along as this game is pretty much, PS Home reborn! If you are a player of that game or just like soicilising and having fun in a Virtual Space, this game is defo for you as I loved PS Home and loving this I guess you say reboot of it so far, bring on AU! :D See you in AU! c: Update: there is now a new Hub area and more to come in the future!","March 9","true","28.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Would be better to come back when it's more complete. I can see potential in this, the only reason for my own thumbs up. If this was a complete waste of time though I wouldn't have given it any attention. The bowling physics do need some tweaking I would think, I struggled with the controls a bit too much too, and the avatar selection is rather lacking.

The xbox 360 controller on it has almost the same maping as a ps4 just you can use both keyboard and mouse with controller on it. It does use at least 1gb on memory if you use it on high settings. With that said. I would suggest you update you drivers as well as defrag your pc. Clean out your cookies as well in the network settings. Some have already used this on Windows 10. I don't have windows 10 and can not say how really it plays. I have the following, Windows 7 ultimate, Intell Core I7 4770 32gigs of Ram SSD as my operating drive, 1 tb western Digital hdd, Nvidia GTX 960. When I wrote the review the first time I had less memory. For anyone that are having a issue with frame rate issues. Reinstall the driver or look at the minium specs to run this. Alot of times it will do with your hardware or a software not liking the Virtial World. Anti Virus programs as well as your firewall will play into part of alot of things.

Read up a bit on it and it's from the same people? Anyways, upon launching it you get 4 options: Game, User, Settings, and Social; Social doesn't work. The only features you'll be able to do is customize your character with very limited choices(just color and if you want a skimpier outfit for females,) and go to the arcade where you can just stand in the middle of the dance floor or go bowling for a price of 10 ingame currency. Ah.. you can also view images of the private spaces that you may get when it becomes available.\n\nIn the end this game doesn't have much to offer as of right now, but I did enjoy the edm playing in the public space. It reminds me of an empty version of Avakin(you can't even play internal games on this one, so Atom Universe has points in that category) for the mobile, and with games like these it needs to be filled with players to even consider to be fun. This IS a social game afterall. Wait a bit until they release more content, it'll get better, and for that reason I recommend it.\n\nI expect more customizations, clothings, and actions. Hopefully the game's community will grow further. Keep it up.","March 6","true","0.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

At the moment I really think Atom Universe needs a lot more work put in given that all you can really do is sit in chairs or go bowling. There are tons of previews and coming soon signs though so it looks like they have a good deal of things planned. I think the biggest issue will be player base, for a game like Atom Universe, even if you have a lot of things to do, it wont matter if no one is playing, activities does not a social multiplayer game make.

As long as they keep the ps home formula i think this will be a great social MMO for many too enjoy. One thing i do not believe is that if you have not owned a ps3 and have not played ps home before it shut down then i do not highly reccomend this game.\n\nplease atom rebulic bring back the ps home i know and love majorly","March 18","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this game/3D world is no where near as good as playstation home. The only updates are small baby updates and most of the time it takes months for 1 update to fix a few bugs and add a small amount of new stuff. Also the recent update that i have had makes the game crash every time i go into a room (ex. The Hub) and thats kind of really annoying. I really don't see why the developers would have made an early access version of this game when there is very very little to do. In my opinion they should've waited till they had alot more to do like personal houses, a handful of places to go and explore, mini-games in each area, pets, clothes, ect. and i feel like at this rate when they do release the real thing it might end up as a poor cash grab but who knows only time can tell.","May 25","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
