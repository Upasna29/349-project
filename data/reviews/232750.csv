The universe created by Spiders is certainly curious but is often let down by the badly written dialogue and pacing of the story, or the sometimes horrendous voice overs.\n\nGraphically it is an appealing game and the environments and music is all there in a solid fashion. The combat is largely enjoyable and has a nice punch behind it, the skill system and crafting mechanics are nice but the lack of variety within loot is a letdown. In the end, Mars: War Logs is an above average game that will certainly be an enjoyable experience for those looking for a nice little third person RPG, and are willing to forgive it for its diamond in the rough state.\n\nFull review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emM-sxmOx9c","November 27, 2013","true","13.8"," 245 of 291 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","245","291","0","2"

Combat is smooth, landscapes are gorgeous, and the story isn't too bad either. I'm aware when this game came out it was pretty bad, but they did an excellent job at fixing what needed to be fixed. So many of the negative comments don't apply anymore. However, many have said the combat and crafting system is a rip off from The Witcher 2. I will have to say false. Similar? Without a doubt, but not a rip off. This game takes it much more slow, and the option to use the techromancer abilities makes it its own. And a crafting system is a crafting system. Not much you can do there. Now, my impressions: I love this game. I was constantly entertained from start to finish. I love action RPGs and this game delivered. But not only that, the landscapes were amazing. The towns and such were nice, but you got tired of looking at them after a bit, but when you stare off into the distance, beyond the towns, you saw beauty. They made a boring red planet into something else. If you enjoy a not so hardcore RPG then by all means pick this game up. But maybe wait until a sale. I love the game, but $15 is still a tad high in my opinion, but nonetheless I think this game should be on any RPG lovers game library.","March 22, 2014","true","10.9"," 134 of 149 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","134","149","0","3"

For a traditional RPG it's got some things right, but it has its share of problems.\n\nPros:\n1. Tactical combat. Combat gets even more challenging and fun at Extreme difficulty, but at a price...\n2. Nice setting and atmosphere. Mars here is like a remnant of some former colony; a fresh change from those high-tech ones. Everything is rusty, red, and make-shift. Put it another way, it's more like an apocalyptic Mars.\n3. Your choices matter. People may die/live, quests may be locked/opened, etc... If you like replaying for different endings then this is for you.\n\nCons:\n1. At Extreme difficulty, a bad selection of skills will make the game almost impossible. There seems to be some skills that must be unlocked first, such as Evade, Sneak, etc.\n2. No crowd AI. At hubs you may get invovled in battle, but civilians do not react at all, even when the fight is happening right under their noses. This hurts the sense of immersion.\n3. Some quest are hidden inside branching conversations and are easily missed if you choose the wrong reply (but you have no idea of the difference). Choose between "just say it!" or "ok ok i got it"?\n4. Characters and lore are rather under-developed. For an RPG of this length (30hr for me), you only get to know a few of the characters. Some just pop up with little background info. The romance here is merely a filler.\n5. In combat you only have limited control on your companion (only 4 "states"), which sometimes is not that helpful.\n\nDespite the cons, I still enjoy this game a lot, primarilly for its combat and story. If you aren't that picky about graphics and AI and just expect a down-to-earth action RPG, this shouldn't disappoint you.","July 14, 2014","true","37.7"," 91 of 99 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","91","99","0","0"

Its settings is poorly described, even after I read through the in-game journal and the documents on the game's web site. The characters feel shallow and - not helped by poor voice-acting and writing - I never empathized with their plight. Mars is gorgeously rendered, but the detail is only skin-deep; too-few NPCs, quests and maps results in an world that is artificial and empty. The combat and crafting are moderately entertaining but, again, the lack of content hobbles even this; a mere handful of weapons and spells did not give me much to play with. Mars War Log plays very much like a game where the developers had a great idea, but neither the talent nor the ability to bring that idea to fruition.","November 25, 2013","false","11.0"," 407 of 546 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","407","546","0","4"

Mars is an amazing game despite what the Meta score says. People complained saying it falls short of a great RPG because it's to simple , but that's the wonderful thing about this game - It's simple. Its gameplay and combat is like Witcher 2 with Slow-mo chosen abilities , blocking and rolling.\n\nFor someone that likes the idea of an RPG but doesn't have the time or doesn't like the complexity of RPG's ,this is the perfect game for you! You don't have 20+ type of stuff you can get items from , only enemies , crates and piles ( No max items slots or weight too) There are side quest but not so much that you will leave them later on ,  but instead you will most likely do them all.\n\nAn amazing SIMPLE wonderful RPG that deserves your attention.

Too bad the game offers only a short adventure. Although a complete walkthrough can be done under a dozen hours with all sidequests accounted for, War Logs offers replayability thanks to the variety of specialisation it offers along with the choices the player can make during dialogues.\n\nPros:\n-- An interesting story that puts our protagonist, Roy, in the centre of a guild war. Two guilds are battling for the power on Mars where the most valuable source is water. Roy is a prisoner of war who desperately tries to escape the camp he's sent to by joining forces with others to plan the great escape.\n-- Techromancy: The manipulation of electricity. Technomancers are the mages of this RPG. Roy later on obtains this ability and along with combat and stealth the door is open to the 3rd gameplay style.\n\nCons:\n-- Horrid voice acting: Some of the voice acting is just awful. One particular example was when I needed to get rid of someone bothering a farmer. Intimidation was a good way to do that instead of a fight but the actor was so awful that I really felt like loading the last checkpoint and going for a fight. Also, sometimes the texts do not correspond to the sentences uttered. An example of why War Logs feels a rushed development.\n-- Shortness: See the first section. The game is quite short considering it's an RPG. They could have included a couple of more missions and one or two extra chapters. The ending also felt rushed and while the epilogue was satisfying I thought the game could have offered a better antagonist.\n-- Companions: Just like in Mass Effect you have companions. Sometimes one and sometimes two. The problem with them is that they die. All the time. I played the game on normal difficulty and a couple of hours into the game the enemies were so strong that they immediately took out my companion.\n-- Taking sides: Again, a similarity with Mass Effect. You can take the good or the bad path. But what exactly is the result of this? I could not really find out as I became good but did something at one point that immediately rendered me neutral. This could have been more refined.\n\nWell, I have more negative bulletpoints but make no mistake War Logs is an entertaining RPG. Coming from an indie developer it is a plus. Do give it a try if it has a discounted price.","March 8, 2014","true","10.3"," 66 of 76 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","66","76","0","0"

On a Mars that's been cut away from Earth for decades, Roy "Temperance" is an Aurora soldier stuck in Abundance P.O.W. Camp 19 that wishes to escape back to his home city of Shadowlair, just to find out the Technomancers have taken over the government.\n\nPros: Good base story that reflects a rich universe, much larger than the span of the game. While the graphics themselves are sub-par for 2013, the aesthetics are excellent, showing a dry planet built from scraps where people have obviously grown beyond their resources and no supplies are expected. Combat gameplay works well and prevents you from just going flailing about or shooting all in sight: you need to think and react properly to the different ranged or close-ranged attacks, blocking, leaping and hitting when the time is right, and the A.I. actually does a great job at becoming much more strategic and challenging at higher difficulty levels. Also, ranged weapons are under-powered, a good thing as it forces you to make use of the melee combat mechanics. There is an interesting, although limited, crafting system for upgradable items.\n\nCons: The voice acting and cut scenes are bad, and I mean it: out of sync voices, long awkward pauses between character reactions or interruptions, bad character animation, all so much more dated than the game itself is. The maps feel just as dated: floor surface is polygony, there is no climbing or jumping over 1 inch obstacles, invisible walls and "decorative" stairways or ledges your character should so obviously be able climb on, it reminds me of the one thing I hated in the map layout of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. The story is rushed, as so many concepts are introduced or teased at but get no development whatsoever. There is barely any equipment you can purchase (a few suits and a few sticks, some of which are not upgradable).\n\nVerdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget it\n\nI wish I could recommend this game, but in all honesty it's not that good. The writers obviously wanted to bite on much more than they could chew, as the game introduces concepts meant to rival the biggest modern RPGs or sci-fi stories out there: Mars being cut from Earth, futuristic guild wars, mysterious ruins from the first colonists, serum (body fluid) being used as currency, that and so much more gave the game a lot of potential, none of which is exploited in a significant way and all end up falling flat. Still, the setting might be enough to get me to look into the upcoming spin-off The Technomancer, hoping it'll be any better.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","August 24, 2015","false","42.0"," 70 of 96 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","70","96","3","0"

Yet I am somewhat disappointed with it. There is so so so much potential for story of this game but it just misses its mark. I think with a better budget and studio and with perhaps a different name, this game could have been huge. The plot/story starts off really well is so very interesting but this drops off rather quickly. It's still interesting, but the depth drops and the plot starts to feel somewhat half formed, before dropping out completely with a sudden ending. It feels like there needs to be a sequel, to fully round things up.\n\nThis may seem like a criticism rather than a recommendation, but I want people to play it and see exactly what I mean about the beautiful artwork, interesting concept and huge potential for this game despite the misgivings.

Very story-driven, that means NO for open world experience. But there are none good tale as well. Just a decent action part in narrow tunnel of somewhat "noir" agenda.\n\nIn truth, game isn't all bad, it's just mediocre. But I'm freaked out by how it is presenting itself there on Steam: "An Intense Cyberpunk Rpg On the Red Planet!" While it is really telling about humans on the fourth planet, it is as far from cyberpunk, as me from being a wealthy man. And "Intense" means it is very short and linear. Not a good point to present for decent "story rich" RPG, you agree?\n\nI'm going to tell you about my experience with the Mars: War Logs, so there will be some minor spoilers. Sorry for that, if you don't want any spoilers - don't read any reviews on that game before playing! But I suggest you to look the other way, there are plenty of games of much greater value.\n\nThere are many comparisons for this game to others. Somehow, Mars: War Logs are truly looks sometimes like Mass Effect or Star Wars KOTOR 2... But these moments are rare and second-handed at best. In other words, all what is that game going to show you - already been somewhere.\n\nTake a first act, for example: you are in the prison, and you're going to make escape from there. By stealing a train, for that you need some guy at generator, and some guy from the guard. And weapons. Funny, but ALL of these were in russian game Planet Alcatraz (2009), where you also starting at the prison, and gotta run out on the train. Only difference is what in Planet Alcatraz you can trust only in yourself in that prison, so you need to choose: either make yourself an electrician, or try to evolve in a guard - to get your hands on weapons and make ways to the train...\n\nOkay, I'm feeling I'm skidded away. Let's forget for a moment all other games, movies or books, in some way similar to our Mars: War Logs. Let's just look at it. For what gaming experience should we pay our money?\n\nStory? Well, it's sketchy. Bleak. At the end of the 2nd act you need to decide whoever party you'll side with. But truly, none of those parties are good choice for you. And, which is more - even that most affecting choice doesn't really changing anything for the player. Maybe except for the game achievement. But we know what genuine achievement hunter want all achievements, so he's gonna play for both parties. I suggest start with the Rebellion, and then for the General, it seems scheduled in that order by the game plot.\n\nWorld? Well, we don't really see Mars. Or participating in war, like it shows in the title. There are decent background, but it is absolutely static. In the worst way. Side-quests are about running from A to B, beating some guys, returning back. After that in point C appears some other quest person, and it's going further, to running to the D point - to beat or scare another bunch of losers. And the most annoying part is what sometimes some scripts aren't working properly, and you unwillingly skipping from A to D point, without even knowing what it was. Example? There are many, but side quests with romance line(s) are coming in mind first.\n\nAs for visual part of showing the life on Mars... well, it's nothing pretty. No John Carter stuff there. Dirty suburbs where we hanging back and forth, that's all you'll gonna see in the whole game.\nSounds are nothing spectacular too. Music is boring and forgettable. And voice acting... it's not That Bad, as some other reviews are pointing, but since all characters in the game are pretty obscure, their voices aren't really helping to bring them some personality. Pity on that.\n\nFinally, action part! Can you fight in this game? Yeah, there are decent battle system. You mashing people with your mace in the right hand and shooting with some nail gun from the left hand. Also you can cast some spells, like electric bolt, or stunning wave. Or you can throw grenades and mines. It helps in the fight, but, since the resources are scarce, you're still need to bash people with the stick. No power-chokes there.\n\nBut then, combat part is decent, but not really good. It is imperceptible at normal fights, but bosses are turning everything down. They are too easy to beat. And even easier to be shot. There are only one out of the line boss fight in the 3rd sequence, where you meet some challenge for the boss. But alas! It's only because of it's health bar, other than that - same boring stuff.\n\nSynopsis:\n\n1) game is not original. Not in the scenario, neither in the action part. And over the most of all, it is treating you not as an associate, a hero of adventure, but strictly as a player clicking the buttons behind the screen. There are no place to dive, it's knee-deep at best.\n\n2) I can suggest you many games of much higher value. Even for the action part, which is the most satysfying in the Mars: War Logs. And I'm not talking about AAA titles, like Mass Effect or Deus Ex. If you are looking for well-written story where your actions are really changing something, try Alpha Protocol. And if you are up to the good trip, try Risen 2&3. And if you are really want a sci-fi story, there are a fine gem of forgotten games, Septerra Core.\n\nAs for marks for Mars: War Logs, it would be 6.5/10, for the effort, and almost working scripts. It is almost a good game. Not worth buying though.","July 28, 2015","false","33.7"," 85 of 142 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","85","142","3","15"

Has all the elements of an rpg (character development, central story with a hero protagonist, etc), except for the extremely linear level design and exploration. The world is divided into hubs, each with 3 or 4 linear maps with repetitive design and art - and this is the one and major drawback of the game.\n\nOtherwise the story is decent, with few branching quests, but with a strong separation between following a tyrant or a peaceful path. The characters are also believable and have a fair developed background with a few options for romance.\n\nGame runs well with no bugs to report. Graphics are average (think last gen console level) but the combat mechanics are solid and the gameplay is fluid.\n\nI recommend the game for player looking for a ~12h RPG with no grand expectation. You will definitely derive enjoyment from the game.","October 4, 2014","true","12.6"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

I thoroughly enjoyed it. The combat system was fun to use and adapt to and can make your character look like a total badass if you've got it down, or a blind 10 year old waving a stick if you don't. Hell, maybe you're even a badass blind 10 year old with a stick. In any event, I found the combat very satisfying. As for characters, Roy (The protagonist) was great. I loved the way he sounds, his word choice no matter what option you choose, and just the way he lookes (having a main character with heterochromia just looks cool). I also liked the other characters and how you can influence them and converse. And as far as weaponry goes, you get a huge selection of makeshift, modifiable weapons and explosives.\nI can see why some people might have less praise for this game than myself though, it isn't a typical game like many of us are used to. It's not like any shooter here, and not even that similar to other RPGs like Fallout or The Elder Scrolls. Nonetheless, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good game with a good story, unique combat, and well rounded (and yet somewhat mysterious) characters.\n","November 26, 2014","true","28.6"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","17","25","2","0"

I've only been playing the game for a short time currently but I absolutely love it. If you're a science fiction fan or like games that really pull you into the story, what roleplaying game fanatic doesn't right, then you will really appreciate this title. The game like its namesake takes place on Mars and you play as Roy, a renegade tough guy, who gets inadvertently pulled into an epic story of which I won't get into so as to potentially spoil anything for you. The game is played for the most part in a third person view as you navigate yourself through the environment. There is enjoyable combat and anyone familar with titles like the Batman Arkham games or Sleeping Dogs will feel right at home with the controls as the fighting consists of similiar methods of attack and counterattacks. The roleplay elements of the game seem quite deep as there are many skills and perks that you can apply to upgrade and develope Roy to your particular style of play. Graphically the game is very beautiful...it manages to capture that rugged futuristic cyberpunk style that so many people seem to love. Another thing that I really like is that it's one of those games that doesn't use many load screens. Most of the time the story transitions from normal gameplay to cutscenes then to combat and vice versa seamlessly. Also like any great RPG you have the ability to craft and upgrade your gear. So far I've only scratched the surface of this fantastic title but I am really enjoying it and can't wait to play through to the end.

Think of it as just a sand desert world and you get the idea.\nYou are playing in 3rd person and you have during the normal game only one NPC in your party which always cares himself for his armor and weapon. You only decide the way they fight. I always put them to "defensive".\n\nThe story is understandable and good. The side missions don't look like side missions, it is just so that you are in a situation and can do some things. So I did everything I saw which I could do because I WANTED to do it. There is no "oh my god, another one of these side missions, AGAIN", nope. You just play the game and see the story and do what you want.\n\nThe fights are fair and sometimes you have to do them more than once until you get them done.\nBut the fights are fun. (And there is a quick save, yeah.)\n\nYou have to decide if you kill the guys or not, you decide after each fight\n\nYou don't have 1000 variants how to fight, but enough to not make it boring. And I just liked the different ways. Could not decide which one I like more, switched all the time.\nFirst attack with stealth for the fast first "kill", a bit of rolling and attacking from behind, breaking guards, throwing hand grenades and... ups, sorry guards, did I forget to mention the mines I put down in stealth mode before?\nAfter that a bit of magic, back to melee, win and loot.\n\nThen perhaps changing armor or weapon (that is all you equip) or upgrading one of the two.\nOr handcrafting some grenades, mines or ammo?\n\nI even had sex with one of the girls. Not like in Witcher, just so you know had it. And I liked girl even more after that.\nShe is a bit weird but really nice. I like her. I am weird too, so everything is ok.\nAnd each time she asks "can I do something for you?" you remember that one time and think, man, where is the dialog option for ... you know? ;)\n\nIt took me 15 hours to complete the game.\nBecause the game is a bit repetitive after some hours this is really enough.\nI liked the story, I liked the fights and now, after the finish, I am contended.\n\nThis is for sure not for everyone, and can't even imagine what people will like it,\nbut if you can get it for cheap and like stories and fighting and just do not want to\nread a book today, give this a try.

But good friend of mine, a great RPG lover, gifted it to me, so I gave it a try. Nice, it also has achievements. Well, let's load this thing up, and roll it on the hardest of difficulties (because achievement demands it!!!).\n\nFirst thing you'll notice - lots of orange and brown. Lots and lots of orange and brown. Good God! I know its a game on Mars, but orange and brown coloring is so intensive that after this Red Faction Guerrilla looks like an old black and white movie. It gets tiresome for your eyes sometimes, making occasional grey interiors relaxing... Its not that the graphics is bad, though. Its not perfect, but everything looks very detailed, although facial animation isn't that great. Movement and combat animations are very nice, and my personal favorite is how characters are bouncing of when they strike someone protected with the energy shield.\n\nThe game starts with "Innocence" Smith (who, for the difference, looks like his name, unlike many others in the game), narrating on his way to the prison, like the other cannon fodder from the clan wars. Skiny guy, with a soft voice... Well, since this is a RPG game, I guess experience will make him manly and muscular soon, since the war isn't already... Upon arival, big, fat and ugly welcoming comitee is so happy to see some fresh meat, since he's "grow tired of drillin' same old arses." Enter Roy "Temperance", who saves Innocence's innocence just in time, and he is the character you'll controll, which makes better sense. Roy is also tired of something, tired of being in prison, and with Innocence's help his plan to escape is set in motion.\n\nSimilar to Witcher 2, the game contains 3 large(ish) areas, through which you can explore mostly freely (some small gaps are locked until you get a side quest which leads throught them), but once you finish with the final task in them you can't go back. Besides story driven missions, you also have a bunch of optional tasks, given by the various folks in the world. If you are aiming for the 100% completion you have to chose dialog options carefully, and sometimes actions within those missions.\n\nCompletion of these quests gives you XP points (just like fighting), and every time you level up you'll get 2 skill points and 1 character point. Character points are invested into unlockable perks, which you are unlocking by accomplishing certain tasks during your playthrough (they are unlocking better crafting items, giving you more XP from the defeated opponents, etc), while skill points are invested into one of the 3 skill trees: renegade tree is mostly about sneaking and some dirty fighting techniques; combat tree upgrades your armour and makes you better in melee; and the 3rd tree will be unlocked at the end of the 1st chapter, after you defeat a Technomancer and obtain a power glowe from him. I would advice you to not waste any points into sneaking perks, because stealth in this game is useless, and you'll be able to sneak successfully maybe in the whole 2 places in the game.\n\nCombat is mostly melee focused, although you'll get a gun as well (it can't be equiped, its usable like an ability by mashing a hotkey) plus technomancing powers later on. Pressing "Q" key slows down the action and brings the combat menu, from which you can select your abilities, and you can also tie them to the numerical keys on your keyboard. Over it you can also give the orders to your current follower. Besides blocking, there's also, imo more efficient, dodge roll (and you'll better be upgrading it to the max becase you'll be doing it a lot...). You can break your opponents guard in a couple of ways, including throwing a sand in their faces, and the game even takes in consideration if someone is wearing goggles or a riot helmet (needless to say that this ability is completelly useless vs mutaded creatures with no eyes).\n\nDefeated opponents aren't dead, they are just incapacitated and will get up soon after you pass through that area several times. Near the end of the chapter 1, you'll get a hold of the serum extractor, which will give you the option to finish them off and get some serum (which is a curency in here), but it will lower your reputation which may influence how the enviroment is reacting to you.\n\nSome armour and equipement pieces are having slots (up to 3), which you can upgrade by crafting upgrades on them. Each type of upgrades requires certain amount of resources, which you can scavenge around, including from killed/incapacitated opponents. Via upgrades you can give various bonuses to your equipment, having better protection but with a trade off in another area, getting more damage to your weapons but being more susceptible to attacks, getting better chances to cause various crits like bleeding, stun, etc.\n\nNow regarding its difficulty. To say that this game is super-cheap is an understatement. On the easiest difficulty level you can run through it in just 5 hours, with completing all of the side quests (it also includes considerable amount of the backtracking), and its probably the only level on which your follower is semi-useful. On harder levels - its a nightmare. Except in the couple of side quests, where you'll be combating a single opponent, on every other occasion you'll be outnumbered and outgunned. Vastly. The best you can hope from your companion is that he will attract 2 or 3 opponents, while you are trying to deal with the rest of the gang. Once he is down you'll end up with a tail of 5-6+ thugs chasing you around, while you are rolling and dodging their attacks, desperately trying to make sucker punches with hit and run tactics...\n\nLike that isn't hard enough, the game is also glitchy, with devastating Technomancer shock attacks heat-seaking you through the walls. Also, you get hit if you don't dodge early. Even if you can clearly see that the model isn't touching you, somehow their claws/teeth/bats end up on your face. The game is so unforgivingly hard sometimes, it will really make you to think about your tactics and equipment. You'll be often changing your armour upgrades to suit the curent situation, trading damage sponge enforced metalic plates which are useless vs Technomancer's electrical attacks, to more shock resistant upgrades but they are offering less protection against physical attacks (at very least those cannot reach you through the wall...). Not to mention that happens when you load a quicksave where you were sneaking pass sleeping guards they end up awaken...\n\nOverall, its cheap but not that bad. It offers two endings, interesting dialogs, and I had some 10 hours of fun in my overall playtime, but the rest was a chore. For its price (especially on the sale) it may offer you your moneys worth, if you don't have anything better to play. But, as I said, I would never buy it myself, and I gave a thumbs down to some far better produced games than this (Crysis 2), so taking these things in consideration I think it would be a little bit unfair to say that I'm recommending it. Which is really a shame, because you can't get rid of the feeling like its overambitious, and a huge wasted opportunity.\n\nBesides somewhat interesting main theme, the rest of the soundtrack is generic and repeatable. I would recommend "Nine Inch Nails - Pretty Hate Machine" album in the background while playing this. Accidentally, friend of mine linked this album to me while I was playing, and for some reason it went nicely with the game.","July 9, 2014","false","23.4"," 57 of 105 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","57","105","0","2"

The worst of these is the voice acting, it's terrible and the game would have benefited with just text. At times the voice work verges on parody, badly stilted and it makes you wonder if English was the actor’s first language.\n\nNot only does the voice work detract from the game but the writing doesn't help. There's a good story hidden away somewhere but you have to dig deep to find it.\n\nThe biggest frustration however is with the combat, which is best described as the worst aspects of Risen crossed with the worst aspects of The Witcher. I played and completed the game on 'Extreme' difficulty mode which only highlights the problems, early on the game turns into a mini game of rolling around in circles desperately trying to regenerate health. The lack of weapon choice, a long stick with some additions doesn't change throughout the game but thankfully later on the technomancer skill tree opens up and allows for a bit more choice in combat. It's not perfect but helps break up the monotony of the combat in the first chapter\n\nThe UI and inventory system is also badly thought out, forcing you to craft one item at a time. On later levels you might want twenty health kits and have to painstakingly click through the system twenty times. Like Risen there is also no weight limit meaning you can pick up as many items as you wish which leads just grabbing everything. I had so many items at the end of the game that had no real use.\n\nNext up is the reputation system which is basic with what appears to be three different reputation levels, Good, Neutral and Bad. I hit the bad reputation early on and even though I killed as many people as I could I didn't go any further than bad. I'm not sure of the effects that reputation has on the game, I didn't notice any major changes to the way I was treated, the game says Merchants treat you worse but then Merchants aren't needed at all.\n\nSo what are the positives and why I am recommending it? Well the setting of Mars is well realised and the background lore is new and fairly interesting. The fluff is interesting enough to read through the diary excerpts and information about the various locations and characters. It also moves along at a nice pace and just when one area gets boring it moves onto the next.\n\nThere is something that I enjoyed; I just can't really put my finger on it. There's a lot of potential here and if we ever see a sequel and they iron out the various issues then it could turn into a great series.","December 13, 2013","true","18.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","2"

For most part here cutscenes are not rewarding our efforts since the voice acting and dialogues are really cheap.\n\nAs closure graphics are nice, crafting is nice and we can see changes on our equipment. Sound is fine and as I mentioned fighting system might be weird but it is playable.

In what I thought (from what I saw from the previews) was a simple hack then dodge, then dodge, then dodge again game I was slightly mistaken. Yes there is dodging, however there is a point to it. The storyline behind the game is an interesting one as you slowly discover what's going on around you and at this Mars prison camp.\n\nGameplay is as follows, 3rd person view with the ability to use a variety of weapons from a pipe tube, to a nail gun, to landmine explosives, to throwing sand in someones eye, to throwing grenades etc... Having options in any game is good and in this one you are able to buy a variety of weapons. My personal favorite is throwing sand at people as the only game I remember being able to do that is Assassins Creed ( which I never used it in ). Anyway besides having a multitude of things to choose from, the game play is somewhat consistent as multiple weapons provide for different tactics, and of course different opponents need different sort of lovin'.\n\nVisual graphics are stunning and are probably as top line as you can get for 2014. Although the graphics are cool at first it seems the game has some frame issues but just may be my computer, but that just may be the way the game is. At first glance it's noticeable but as the game goes on it becomes negligible.\n\nNow... what do I give a game that seems like people cared for it - but all the while keeping in mind something like this has been done before? An average rating for an average game to be blunt. Some will enjoy playing it, others won't. I'd give it a higher rating if there were objects in game that could be picked up and used randomly.\n\n7.3/10\n\n\n*note, some parts are ridiculously meticulous and require some serious fire power. Going in with a metal rod ain't going to cut taking on a few enemies at a time.","September 16, 2014","true","2.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's got a big game room on the bottom floor with a big screen TV, Pinball, and arcade. Fully furnished. Comes with a big pool and 6 cars in this really big mechanics-like garage. You go in the house, see all this stuff, and are in awe of the awesomeness of it all. But eventually you realize that everything is made out of cardboard. Yea, you can say you have all this stuff, but it doesn't work and it doesn't even look good in the house. Its just a really nice house with the idea of cool stuff in it. That's how I feel about this game.\n\nThere's a really cool crafting system, but coupled with the really bad fighting makes it seem like a waste. I keep seeing tips about relationships with your partner, but I never saw this in game. You can't level up your partner, can't give them better equipment, can't give them weapons, nor can you even heal them in battle. They give you the ability to give commands, but its bare commands like "attack the closest" or "attack who I'm attacking." All really good ideas, but none of it actually works.\n\nThe story is a really nice idea, but it feels off. I realized at the beginning that I shouldn't expect much though. When a game doesn't take the time to name a pretty promient character shows the lack of shine on the story. When the game starts you fight "the fat guy" in a prison who's so well known in the prison that he has been giving everyone trouble for a long time. Yet the character has no real name. Every one just says, oh I heard you took out "the fat guy."\n\nThe fighting system in the game, is also lacking. The "magic" isn't very good, and the fighting style isn't polished. It reminded me of the way Arkham games do fighting, except there's no flow to the fights. It's like they said 'here's what we want, and we'll put in the basics, then go back and fix it up'. But then never went back and tried to fix it.\n\nAll in all the game was, lacking. It's a good idea, but that's about all.","July 30, 2014","false","8.7"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","25","46","0","0"

Story takes place on planet called Mars, in time of war and poverty that followed soon after the colonization. Story is about different groups of people fighting for control over the land and resources.\n\nRPG element includes three character skill trees, perk system, weapon and armor modification and crafting of support, utility items (like medkits, explosives, etc.). You have a variety of abilities available, some allow you to enchant weapons, others protect you from damage like electric shield, some do damage or stun enemies like arc lightning shock, etc.\n\nYou mainly use melee weapons, like metal pipes modified with different attachments you make with metal scraps and hardware found throughout the game. Ranged combat is really limited to one shot nail guns, grenades or Technomancer electric abilities. You can craft and place traps, that are useful if you're surrounded by enemies.\n\nThere's decent amount of missions and side missions available, some have choice and effect element, so pick your answers wisely. Good amount of voiced dialogues. Reputation system in game was a bit weird, I didn't change from Neutral all game, though I didn't do anything bad, nor did I juice the downed enemies. Main currency in the game is pretty much human blood, as far as I understand, and was kind of weird.\n\nYou can have followers in game, five in total, two of those can be chosen by joining one or other group of people, one is partially available and two are available pretty much throughout the whole game. Two males and three females as far as I could tell. You can romance females, if someone wondering, though there's nothing special, just hugging and groping.\n\nVisually game looks poorly, a lot of low resolution textures for 2013 game, model quality is bad, animations are poor, voice over quality is decent. Game has a lot of glitches, texture clipping, hovering objects, bad lighting and other sort of things that could be fixed in post-production.\n\nOverall game was fun experience, but lacked serious polish. Some missions were hilarious, I also liked typos in text that made no sense, and weird naming for drugs and nurses advice for cutting someone's jewels off. Don't know if it was intended, but apparently you can bed both female followers and then chose which one you like more.","August 15, 2015","true","11.8"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

This game is pretty much a standard action rpg, designed with consoles in mind. Story is pretty nice, characters are interesting, but the setting is great. I really loved the brown, postapocalyptic Mars landscapes. You have customization of your weapon/armor, you can craft various things and advance your skills in three trees (pretty much stealth, craft / melee / magic). The game itself is pretty linear, there is no open world, and most of the locations are narrow, so if you expect open world gameplay, pass on the game.\nWhat i really loved is the amount of time the playthrough takes: 15 hours. It is ideal in my opinion, the game does not get boring and does not end too quickly.\nThe game is not ideal at all, as every aspect of it lacks something (limited options of crafting, skills, choices etc.), but it does not make it a bad game.\n\nSo, if you don't like corridor like levels, lack of open world and a bit limited options, pass on the game.\nHowever, if you don't mind these things, want a game that will take you about 15 hours and love the setting, try it out, i recommend it.","January 3, 2015","true","13.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Hard difficulty meant rolling around on the ground for minutes while getting an occasional hit in with melee weapons.  I just wanted to stop playing altogether.  Reducing to easy difficulty made the game playable (albeit a bit too easy), and some fun was had.\n\nThere is a monetary system of sorts, but no incentive to sell items.  Nothing available to buy with the cash you could get that you wont find laying around/be given for completing quests.\n\nI read reviews from console players gushing over the graphical qualities; the visuals were nothing more than ordinary.

It’s almost funny, given that solid combat mechanics, decent visuals, and creative and interesting lore should give us something substantial to play with – it’s better than a lot of games do nowdays, right? But it’s the little things like the fact that NPCs are placed at either the bottom or top of every staircase (in the same pose) to stop you from being nosy if you have the audacity to try and interact with the world, or that the dialogue options as they are written don’t match the dialogue that is it spoken – in either text or tone, or that the first two characters we see are two NPCs that use almost the exact same character model, sitting next to one another and performing the exact same looped movement, synchronised perfectly. These things break any immersion the graphical fidelity serves up and leave the game feeling really half-baked.\n\nNot to mention the down-right awful voice acting in parts. “Sorry the dog attacked you, really…” is read as “Sorry. The dog attacked you? Really.” Who, in 2013, was overseeing the development of a game where such obvious issues are overlooked or left uncorrected? And what kind of society are we if we let these basic things wash over us in favour of ‘pretty 1080p widescreen’ and a ‘smooth feeling fight’?\n\nReally this all makes me seem more angry than I was when playing the game - I was mainly just frustrated by the multitude of basic core issues. The game's NOT a piece of crap! It's just average or sub-par in a lot of immediately evident ways. Mars: War Logs seems like it’s trying to be the love child of Mass Effect and Red Faction, but it’s as if the developers thought that the key to the success of an RPG is that ‘they’re set in a far-away place and you get to fight things’, rather than the IMMERSION that the RPG genre is famous for, and the reason that it was created in the first place.","June 27, 2014","false","1.0"," 30 of 58 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","30","58","0","0"

To be completely honest I knew I'd end up liking it anyways simply because it's a sci-fi action-rpg, taking place on Mars in the future in some Cyberpunk-ish, Steampunk-like setting. The story is okay I guess, nothing special and super crazy like something you would expect from a game like Mass Effect, but it's... "okay". I liked it.\n\nWhat REALLY drew me in was the fact I could invest skill points into my character, the ability to also not only wear different armor and weapons but also modify them to suit your playstyle, which you need to find parts to do so. You can also romance two women in the game, I won't spoil that though if you plan on playing it. The combat is kinda' hard at first since you seem to have to dodge and roll around a lot to avoid enemy attacks, you can't just go in there and start button mashing because you'll get owned in probably less than a minute. Should've called this Mars: Enemy Dodging Simulator 2013. Also your partner barely helps you, if anything he's only useful if you plan on using him as a way to distract the enemy (at least I think so). The game is also extremely short, yes.... I beat this game in 16 hours, that also includes most of the sidequests, if not all of them. Crazy right?\n\nBut anyways, there is a sequel (or prequel) coming out called "The Technomancer", and it looks pretty damn good.

That's a big plus because technically, its well coded.\nThe plot is decently interesting as a whole with little loop holes but do not provide any gripping turning points or decisions that most enjoyable plots have.\n\nMy criticism with the game is mostly design related, because they feel redundant, unbalanced, trivial, or unrelated, all of which hurt mainly because it breaks immersion;\n\n1) Why did the company put in a reputation/karma system but make it that the only thing that gives you 'bad' karma is finishing off an opponent? No one in that universe considers sparing enemies you beat within an inch of their lives in self defense to be chivalrious. Actually, using excessive force stopping short of murder is also not really chivalrious in reality either. You can argue that being a ♥♥♥♥ to a fragile sexually abused girl or insulting a nurse who's son is a drug addict is bound to give you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reputation, but meh, not really. And then there's the lack of redemption. Reputations can improve or recover, but in this game it can't.\nAlso, the premise is that Mars is an unforgiving and dangerous place, right? It's not strange to protect yourself by finishing off an enemy that just tried to kill your life, because it's likely they'll come after you once they're on their feet again. So, is it immersive to be a "bad" person because of it? Maybe in reality, but not on Mars (in tandem with the rest of the story).\n\n2) What's the point of making money if it's so easy to find parts for crafting, and items are so cheap in the store? The economy is very unbalanced in that if you loot the containers you come across and clean up the enemies' drops, you will have everything you need to craft everything you need. Even if you didn't bother looting everything, you're so rich or things are so cheap that money is not at all valuable. (But at the same time, lore-wise, 5 serums (less than a piece of scrap metal sold in a store) is the equivalent worth of a person's life).\n\n3) The game is very short for the plot-line covered. This is the feeling I get watching the latest season of Game of Thrones, where the bad guy or whoever dies shortly after their character is developed (barely) enough for the audience to care and feel bad about. Case in point, the big bad and the dragon (tvtropes) have their differences and politics games in the back but the audience can't relate until the last cutscene of the game. There's a lot of intrigue that technically occured throughout the plot but the dialogue is so shallow, it's hard to really appreciate it fully.\n\n4) The side-quests occur pretty much in tandem with the main quest location and wtvr else -wise, and don't require extra effort to seek, do, fight, etc. All side-quests occur along the paths of the main quest anyway so by completing the main quest, you finish could its contents simply by talking to npc's you happen across. That's not entirely a "side" quest. Most of them got nothing to do with the plot. Why am I looking for counterfeit coins again?\n\n\nOverall, it's worth the $1 I paid it for on Humbl Bundle.","February 8","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think it was because in the first couple of conversations the same character had two different voice actors doing different lines.\n\nRoll on a few years later and I thought I'd clear the backlog. Tried to continue my previous game - where I'd done nothing but beat up the fat man - and somehow I was transported to the Epilogue for the Resistance path. Free achivement! Rather wierd.\n\nStarted a new game and was pleased to see the voice stuff was resolved. I'm sure I remember it being bad, maybe I am thinking of another game. Or maybe it was fixed who knows.\n\nAnyhoo, this is a pleasent RPG. It's not ground breaking, and suffers from being a 3D game that is strangely 2D (for example no paths cross each other at other levels), and it's far too fond of little invisible walls that stop you going into doorways and so on. And you can't jump.\n\nGraphically, it's not the best you'll ever see, but it does a nice enough job of depiciting a ramshackle Mars. In fact, the thing that annoyed me most was that you couldn't look up properly, so when you encounter giant cranes, towers and shields over the settlements you can't actually get a good look at them.\n\nVoice acting was great, and the audio wasn't bad overall.\n\nStorywise, it's a decent story, with a few marring jolts here and theres. There's plenty of side quests in addition to the main quest. The levels are fairly small, and quite linear.\n\nI liked the crafting system.\n\nCombat was fairly dull and it annoyed me that enemies respawned, although I did my usual non-kill policy. Next time I'll kill everything that moves and see if they still respawn.\n\nOverall, it was an enjoyable, if potentially forgettable, game, and I'm glad I went back to it.","March 17","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a Spiders game so you should go into it knowing what you're getting.  If you were a fan of their other RPGs (Of Orcs and Men, Game Of Thrones, etc) then you'll probably be able to overlook the simple combat and weird mechanics.  The Mars setting is unique for a game of this type, and the game is overall competent enough.  The voice acting was terrible but that comes with the Spiders brand as well.  The story was decent and had a solid conclusion with two separate endings creating two different final chapters.  The world building and the Technomancer idea is unique enough that it's worth checking out but be aware the gameplay is a little janky.  Hopefully their followup "Technomancer" will fix some of the gameplay hiccups and give this universe the game it deserves.","February 8, 2015","true","8.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It has very similar mechiancs, and a very similar combat system. While I can't say it succeeds, it's definitely very enjoyable.\n\nThe graphics aren't very impressive, and Mars is very monotonous and boring to look at.\nThe combat is fun and sometimes challenging, though since there are only a few different enemy types it gets repetitive fast.\nThe voice acting on most characters is pretty bad, and the dialogues aren't very well written for the most part, but they do the job in telling the story. There is a companion romance option, but it's so badly written it feels like they put it in last minute just to make sure the game has a sex scene. "Hey I like you" - "Oh I like you too, and now that we're finally alone with the entire crew watching, wanna f**k?" TRUE LOVE.\n\nThat being said, the story and the world are interesting and well crafted. A lot of thought was clearly put into the backstory, and I did feel intrigued to know what happens next at every point in the game.\nThe RPG elements are all there, some better than others. There's also a morality system but its effect on the game is so tiny that it really doesn't matter if you're "good" or "bad" (i.e. if you're bad you get more money, but if you're good shops sell to you for less. Ends up exactly the same... and doesn't matter either way since there is no reason to buy anything in the shops anyway). There is a significant choice to make at the end of the 2nd act which does alter the story, and isn't as obvious as good/bad, so I did enjoy that one.\nI really like the weapon customising system. It was new and innovative - You start with a pipe or iron bar or something like that, and you craft it according to your will. Add a sharp piece at the top and you have an axe, put a brick there and it's a club. Put iron on the bottom if you want a hilt, or leather if you want a better grip.\n\nOverall this game reaches far and doesn't quite get there, but it's definitely worth the ride. Hell, if they ever make Mars: War Logs 2, I'll probably buy it as well.","March 29, 2015","true","10.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Don't waste your time or money on it like I did.\n\nNormally I'd say that bad gameplay can be made up for by a good story, but in this case both are equally abysmal. Fighting largely consists of kiting enemies around for long amounts of time waiting for your health to regen so you can risk getting another hit in. This is exacerbated by the fact that any ability other than melee is worthless. For example, by my count there are about 100 total nailgun ammo shots that you can pickup throughout the entire campaign (and it's the only gun) but it would take about 20 shots to actually kill a single enemy. The other abilities are similarly worthless. Fighting becomes a chore best avoided, and you can't respec your abilities, so if you commit to one that doesn't apply - e.g. you have points in stealth when a big battle is forced upon you - you can be screwed and have to replay a checkpoint for hours until you get lucky enough to edge by. The NPC's also die in just a couple hits, so there's no help. It's like they didn't try to balance this game at all. Or worse, they purposefully didn't want anyone to have fun playing it.\n\nThe story isn't even worth mentioning. The writing, the voice acting, everything is just at the worst caliber imagineable.\n\nEven mediocre RPG's or third person action games are better than this. I'm baffled at how it got funded and made.","June 10, 2014","false","20.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Of Orcs And Men was a sleeper hit for me personally. It was a game with terrific graphics and fun and exciting gameplay. Yes, it was light on the RPG elements, but that didn't matter. It was truly fun. Mars War Logs has none of that fun and exciting gameplay, and comes across as dull. First of all, the graphics are decent. They're in no way similar to the graphics in other RPGs or even OOAM, but that's to be expected for a budget game. It's perfectly understandable and they're perfectly serviceable.\n\nBesides, it has lots of stuff that other RPGs have as well. Think of crafting and sidequests, for example. But it all feels so similar to a low quality version of OOAM, I just can't help it. The interface reminds me of it, the way the story is cut up in chapters, the quick-skill menu, you name it. It's all feels the same, but... cheaper. The voice acting for the main characters is decent, but for most of the other characters it's just terrible. The quests, however, are somewhat fun so it's not all bad.\n\nMars War Logs should take about 7-8 hours to finish. And that's including all or most of the sidequests. So it's not that long, but still long enough to keep you entertained.\n\nIf I had to make a decision I'd pick up Of Orcs And Men, but, then again... that's me.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","April 28, 2013","true","8.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The combat can be a bit clunky and the story was far too short for its own good but in the end it provided a welcome distraction from the norm. Mars creates what could have been a vibrant and rich universe were it not for the disappointing length of the story. I will say caution that those who value the story above all else -like myself- may find themselves slightly skeptical of the events that transpire but if you can manage to overlook a few convenient events, you should be fine. Similarly in terms of mechanics, Mars has the feel of something that could be great if only more time was taken to hone and streamline the end result. Visually, the game isn't bad. Though somewhat lacking in striking alien vistas or magnificent architecture, Mars makes up for it by bringing us the gritty almost noir feel of refugee ridden slums and the vaguely resigned industry of POW camps. Though saddened by thoughts of what the game could have been, I still found the experience to be enjoyable.

Combat is adrenaline filled, requires active dodge and parry--very much like Witcher 2--and you can pause, well not totally pause it but slow time to a crawl, if you've played Witcher 2 you know what you are expecting. The combat also feels akin to Kingdom of Amalur and Game of Thrones RPG (which is jointly developed by Spider Studios i believe). Crafting is rewarding and simple: almost every weapon can be improvised using various material you've looted or recycled from other trash equipments, and upgrades not only give a variety of customizable stats bonus of your choice, but also modify the look of the gears significantly.\n\nThe plot and setup of the game is sort of refreshing--like Red Faction games, tossing in some Fallout's apocalyptic lo-tech touch. Only problem is the Dev's budget is low, so even though the graphic is alright, it's nothing special or impressive. This reminds me of Alpha Protocol, which resembles the look and feel of this game (only the levels in Saudi of course).\n\nIf you like:\n--Witcher\n--Alpha Protocol\n--Red Faction\n--Fallout\n--Kingdom of Amalur\n--Game of Thrones RPG\nthink you can give it a go.

I opened my list of old 'to-do games' and went to Mars.\n\nWhat I discovered there on Mars was not a 'game of the year', but remain for me an honest and original RPG, at a good price.\n\n+ atmosphere = music, sound effects, artwork, dialogs, light and dust animations, levels and background are coming very well together. The game managed to get you the taste of this rusty Mars of Bradbury or mad-max like post-apocalyptic background.\n+ scenario = Mars is an abandoned colony from an Earth who failed the terraforming and simply left his colonists/workers behind to die in the dust. Technology became religion (Mars of 40k), water became more valuable than gold and oil put together, and mutants are both superstitious slaves and relics of a mysterious first 'war'.. The main/side quests are making good illustrations of a rich background, unfortunatly without special revelations on it. (budget limitation?*)\n+ Characters/dialog: morphing, voice casting, etc.: all NPC and allies have a particular personality, story and place in the scenario. Funny choices and dialogs. The bad reputation gives you some nice situation of intimidation.\n+ RPG Inventory= which is not as complex or labyrinthic like in other RPGs (which are mostly fantasy RPGs and not SF), but fun and easy to explore and try out.\n+ Scavenger/upgrade system: original and well designed\n+ Combat system: not perfect, but I get the feeling of table RPGs when you have to think about all your stuff and upgrades and levels.\n\n- *like it was explained on the forum, they don't had enough money to expand the game like they wanted in the first place. Yes, there are too few bosses or real cinematics, some bonus like artworks to gain with achievements, and the separate Epilogues could had been more 'customised'. But the game remain coherent.\n- FOV: especially in fights and some maps, you have to choose carefully the place/corner of the map who you want to fight, otherwise your characters can disapear from the screen and get kicked by invisible enemies. (there is already a fix from the dev in the forum to modify the FOV)\n- too easy: especially with bad reputation (when you kill the wounded): you get intimidation which is nice, but also very quickly all the best upgrades for weapons and material (Difficulty=normal).\n- not very long (3 chapters) but can be replayed with a lot of side quests.\n\nIMHO:\n- if you like SF, RPGs and Mars, get curious and build your own opinion","January 27, 2015","true","49.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The combat mechanics are a bit glitchy (maybe the controls would work better with a game-pad?), and when you're playing real-time melee combat, this becomes a big problem quickly.\nIn the end I simply couldn't be bothered grinding through the quests to find out the rest of the story.\n\nIf the same studio were to make another game, I'd certainly take a look, but I would be a little cautious before spending too many Ducats on it.\n\nI'm giving it 2/5 stars, and would only recommend buying it if it's on sale for a few bucks - even at the cheap ticket price of fifteen bucks, it's not polished enough for me to recommend.\n:(","April 12","false","24.1"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

As does the random encounters which are quite hard in fact most of the "big" fights are in fact easier than the random ones. Also the amount of equipment in the game seems rather limited and has very little to do with modern much less sci-fi concepts I spend most of the game running around with a metal pipe with what was basically a nail through it. Finally the biggest flaw of the game is it tends to forget to teach the player the consequences of using ingame mechanics, apparantly to be "good" in the game you shouldn't kill (do forget that we knocked the guy down with a barrage of 7 inch nail darts and several massive blows to the skull), however if you do kill you gain more money, when this mechanic is introduced it isn't explained that you just knocked everyone senseless up to know (except animals which you apparantly kill).\n\nOn the up side the game autosaes quite often before fights so you can redo them, the dialogues are fully voiced and feel more natural than most RPG dialogues and the dialogue choices actually fit well with what is being said (I am looking disapproving at you mass effect) and there are sometimes everal different ways to handle a situation. the combat mechanics are solid and doesn't change wildly from one fight to the next with two exceptions, other than that the enemies mostly stay the same in terms of tactics while you gain new combat skills and improve your old ones.\n\nAll in all I will give this game a 7 out of 10.\n\nThis game is a joyful little trip to a post apocalypotic world.","January 10","true","12.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't think I see many games based around Mars, with that, they did a decent job.\nFast Pace Combat\nGood menu system overall for doing quests and such.\nLimited resources which makes the game feel challenging.\n\nCons:\nThe story was okay, but felt very rushed while a lot is explained it's own version (War Logs) of it's Codex; I feel the game should have explained this in a bit more detail.  Roy the main character of the story is still a mystery to me and a lot details wasn't revealed about him.  Wheather or not this was intentionally, he just felt empty of a character.\n\nAs for other characters, except for the first character/party member Innocence everyone's story felt rushed.  Mary the other character is the only othjer one that didn't feel too rushed as her storyline was cut and dry.\n\nFor other aspects of the story, it really felt rushed and while I could tell I was near the end, the final moments felt really anticlimatic.  Romance options are in this game but they too, are very rushed and other than a few dialog options, They're easily romance and don't build up to the point of snoo very well.  Wanna go out?  Sure? Ok that's that.\n\nShort game under 20 hours and VERY linear aside from a few side quests.\nCombat and such is cut and dry while there's a few tactical things you can do it's more near a button masher for most of the fights.  Sometimes hit detection wouldn't hit on enemies.\n\nOverall not a bad knock off of Mass Effect but there's a LOT of room for improvement.

The moebius-esque images of the "technomancers" with the total recall setting of mars really caught my attention.\n\nThe truth is this game is the proof that small studios should not do "open-world/areas" RPG games.\n\nCONS:\n\n* NPCs: The game presents you with small areas, supposedly cities full of NPCs, but reallity is they dont feel like cities at all. NPCs are no better than crate boxes just standing there, they stay in the same position 24/7, they don't even react when you are fighting enemies 1m away from them. The only NPCs you can talk to, are marked in the minimap so that you can rush directly to them, they are normaly vendors or quest involved characters, 3 or 4 per big area, and are very shallow and uninteresting characters. You'll forget them immediately.\n\n* Quests: Quests normally are take this item to the other end of the city, or kill this guy and come back, which you get really bored of at the third time, even if they try to call the objective something else.\n\n* Maps: The minimap is horribly implemented, to the point I try not to use it, even though it is essential for not hitting dead-ends while you run around the city, dead-ends are extremely common and add to the destroying of the city feeling, there's normally just 1 or 2 paths from point A to point B.\n\nNormally, when you start a new area, you can open your minimap and guess which of the areas will have enemies (it's always the ones which look like big rooms for you to roll around to avoid enemy attacks, opposing to the rest of the city, which are just corridors). For some reason I really don't understand, each city, or area, is divided by some shut-doors, or barricades, which you have to interact with in order to advance. They introduce no apparent loading-time, so they just break even more the feeling of being in a real city.\n\n* Enemies: Enemies for some reason know you are a threat, even though they have no way of knowing it, at least in the early stages of the game. They just attack you on sight. There's some enemy respawn too, I'm not sure how does it work, but it is very annoying when you have cleaned a now full of enemies area less than 10 minutes ago.\n\nPROS:\n\n* Fights/Crafting/Skill Tree: The fighting is melee based, where shooting is just a special ability. This, along with the crafting abilities and the skill tree, are very decent. They all remind me of The Witcher 2, they are very similar. The fights, even in normal difficulty are tough, you die a lot, which require you to do somekind of planning or preparation before confronting enemies.\n\n* Plot: If you can ignore all this gameplay wrecks the game presents, the story is somewhat interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel like this game could have been incredible if more depth had been added to it, but I have to say I do not recommend it. I got it for 2.65€ in Steam sales and I still payed more than what it's worth.","April 18, 2014","false","9.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The voice "acting" is horrible, and that's apparent even though the actors admittedly have nothing to work with in the script, and a plot that plods along with only the loosest justification for its characters (but a laughably healthy appreciation for cursing). The PC port is especially atrocious, given that it does not even consider that one might use a mouse and keyboard instead of a gamepad. The fighting is somewhat similar to Dragon Age 2 or Batman: Arkham City, yet less engaging than either of those, as it has a targeting system that loses track of the enemy constantly. And then, to top it all of, it's got that same feces-and-metal color palatte as every other game, plus a dosage of rust that does nothing to make it visually more enjoyable.","April 30, 2013","false","1.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Some have deemed it the "poor man's Mass Effect" but this is incredibly misleading as the similarities between the two games stop at the sci-fi setting.\n\nWhen I finished the game I found myself wondering how I made it from start to finish without utterly giving up on it. If it wasn't because the game is only 10 - 15 hours long then the only other reason I could come up with is that the game really makes you ponder what it could've been if it had come from a more experienced developer with a bigger budget.\n\nAll the usual trappings of an RPG are present but none of them feel particularly fleshed out or provide any kind of depth. The combat harks back to the "old school" style of pause-and-play (ala Knights of the Old Republic, Dragon Age: Origins, etc) but beyond the fact that you can pause and then choose an ability none of the other aspects of the style are there. On top of this, while the game allows you to have a companion character you can't choose their attacks, outfit them with weapons/armor, or even take control of them in any way other than choosing their "stance".\n\nA dialogue system is also in place but a lot gets lost in translation - literally. Since the developer is French the game is localized for anything else and it's terribly done. You'll find countless examples of this when your character says something that doesn't even kind of sound like your selection and/or when another character reacts to you in a seemingly opposite or confusing manner. Additionally it doesn't help that the voice actors bring disgustingly wooden performances to the table as well.\n\nThe inventory system is barebones (perhaps 4 different sets of "armor" and maybe 6 weapons), the crafting/upgrading system is totally out of whack, despite having skill trees to that branch into RPG archetypes (rogue, warrior, magic user) the game almost seems to want you to max out everything and use everything in one playthrough, a romance system is there but is so poorly done it's easy to find yourself not knowing it's even there at all or glitching it/breaking it yourself, and finally the story (while pretty unique) is at times confusing, ill-paced, and withholding.\n\nHow/why did I finish this game? In the end perhaps it was it was a strange desire to see a good idea shoot itself in the foot with poor development and virtually no QA. Mars: War Logs is a yet another example of something that could've been great, that wanted to be great, but just couldn't.","July 2, 2013","false","12.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

While no game can be truly great in every respect, you still need to do at least one thing really well.  To me it seems the creators either didn’t know how to or simply couldn’t decide what to focus on.  The characters while unique in some ways are not well written and are easily forgotten.  The plot while trying to be edgy in some parts is just plain gone in others.  Oh and the writing, how many games have adult relationships described by 10 year olds.   Mary at one point goes from enemy, to friend, to sack mate in about 30 seconds of game time.   The game really peaked at the end of the prison camp, it’s clear the ideas and time was dedicated to that part of the game, what takes place after feels rushed and unpolished.  To be fair I think with another year or so of development the game could have been a gem but as it is Mars just is a subpar game that will be forgotten the day after you play it.

The combat is actually pretty good.  It's virtually all melee, and it sort of reminds me of Witcher 2 (as someone else already pointed out).  Lots of parrying, dodge-rolls, counterstriking, and dirt-throwing.\n\nBottom line, if you're looking for a deep, complex, Elder Scroll-ish kind of game, you should pass.

This isnt a bad game but it isnt particularly good either. It shines in the first half introducing a Sci-fi prison break sequence which is of great enjoyment but a tad long. During the first chapter you are introduced to a limited skill tree with either Brute or rogue as your choices becuase mage is left till you exit part 1. Story wise I actually really liked this game but the story left a longing for the epic backdrop painted in so many conversations. the war logs sounds like it should have an epic lore, but your left with a very mysterious character who never really gains a solid back story, in an environment that never seems to be more than a few blocks in the back of a big city. This man is trying to find freedom as a nomad rather than a techromancer, relying on his skills in combat to keep him out of trouble. The combat in the game was rather basic, assassins creed-esc parry, attack system, with crafting on the side. Overall this game is a nice pickup at a low price if your looking for a sci-fi rpg that is out of the ordinary. 5/10 Exceige","October 22, 2013","false","8.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

How you see it is really low, because I cancelled playing that game!\nAt the beginning I was absolutely happy about this game. It sounded so good: a RPG on Mars, every decision counts and an awesome story!\nThen the day came as I played it the first time. And it began to bore the hell out of me. First you see a cutscene without you are told where you are, what you do and why you do anything. This the most unsatisfactory thing in the whole game: missing information about anything. There are a lot of moments where you are just thinking: "What did the developers just think as they were programming this? Let's do a game, which doesn't give the player any information! Just tell a lot about it and say it could become awesome!"\nThe next point is something about the characters. I thought they would be awesome. Something new. And the developers deny that with saying "Nope"! You will play a guy, just a guy, a normal human, without any special abilities and one of your friends is a boy, who isn't manly, but needs to become manly. I don't know what you readers think about this. I think it's so normal that it can't be believable that the developers actually did it.\nAt least I will tell you about the spell-, skill-system or whatever it is. Some perks are really useful and will help you in fights, other are just useless. You can skill your melee or range abilities or you waste some point in sneaking (never worked for me, always got seen by guards with eyes on their back).\nI wrote a lot of words to tell you one thing.

The game engine is used in many similar games, so its a bit like the Spiders company can turn these out at whim.

Graphics and sound are both pretty good.  The story isn't groundbreaking, but it's far from horrible.  My only real gripes are about the controls and dialog / voice acting.\nFrom the beginning of the first chapter, this seemed like a promising effort from what I thought was an indie developer.  A few minor things, like stilted dialog, oddly-paced voice acting, and some weird collision issues niggled at me, but I was willing to overlook those as necessary evils of an indie game.  Then the second chapter started.  A single scene at the beginning displays possibly the worst voice acting I've seen in a video game -- you'll know it when you see it.  From that point on, I couldn't help but be painfully aware of every weird turn of phrase and every moment of odd prosody.\n\nFortunately, the mechanics and combat are fairly solid -- the game never actively prevented me from enjoying it.\nIt never quite rises out of the hole of mediocrity that it starts in, though:\n-Controls seem slightly non-standard to me.  For example, 'E' is only used to extract serum from and kill people.  In most other games that I play, it's used generically for object interaction.  The LMB does multiple-duty as initiating combat, attacking, object interaction, and NPC interaction.\n-With the exception of buying medkits, the economy is pretty useless.  Even at extreme difficulty, I never found a need to buy anything else.  Weapon and armor upgrades were always a side-quest or two away.\n-NPC followers are next to useless, so don't count on them to aid you in combat much.  They only seem to be good at distracting a single enemy for a few seconds before they're downed.\n\nAfter finishing the game, I learned that Spiders isn't an indie developer at all, but a French studio.  Which simultaneously deepened my disappointment in the lack of polish and explained my major problems with the game.  Whatever their budget for developing Mars: War Logs, the internationalization portion was inadequate.","August 7, 2014","true","24.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At the beginning it's quite frustrating, but once your character has enough experience, it becomes much better. You have a melee weapon, a nail gun and technopowers, which are plenty enough IMHO, each one becomes stronger and stronger which is better than having numerous weapons just slightly or not different at all.\nI liked the post-apocalyptic atmosphere.

Take out a bit of awesomeness from it. Add the russian guy from GTA IV (on acid) as the protagonist aaaaaand...\nCongratulations!... It's a "Mars: War Logs"! :D\n\nSo, this is a "safe" game... It picks up on stuff used succesfully countless times on other games of the same genre and repeats them competently. It doesnt have any "great new features", the maps or the history arent huge master pieces. Actually the questline that goes along with the story is pretty straightforward and the maps are short and simple.\nBut the graphics are pretty great, the game is well built all arround and it's fun!\nI mean.. Werent you furstrated when you ended The Witcher, or Fallout 3, or Mass Effect? I admit i got lost and purposeless! I was loving the games and they ended... So, i know it's not the same, but with this game you can pick up from that "orphan" feeling those great games left you with and keep the fun going a little while.\n\nAnd for the money it costs... It's worth it!\n\n7/10\n\n\nNow, the boring and long version.\n\nSo, this is the tipical 3rd person action RPG that takes role in an improbable future where mars was colonized and, naturally, there's conflict because every "major power" wants a piece of it. You start as a POW, inprisoned far behind enemy lines. As you work your way out of the prison, and after, running from your former cagers, you start unfolding a deeper plot concerning older inhabitants and their powerfull knowledge... Bla bla... Cliche... De ja vu... And "play it yourself to find out". ;)\n\nYou'd expect that a game happening in a future far planet has all sort of advanced weapons, rayguns, guided missiles and stuff but.... no... Its more like "Post apocaliptic future in mars", so you'll use mostly pipes, hachets, bones and such as weapons. Combat is mainly melee, ranged weapons are used more like a complement in combat and later in game you'll develop some "technomancer" powers. These are basicaly "Sorcerer's magic" but based on technology.\n\nI think the rate this game got with the critics is unfair. The game is not "epic" (as the graphics might suggest) but is very decent entertainment.\nThe story is engaging. The character leveling up keeps gameplay fresh and interesting. New skill and abilities are meaningfull and will keep you focused. As gameplay is concerned, you'll find it very familiar overall and will constantly relate to similar features in other games.\nThe characters are built well enough, although i confess i hasnt able to create any "deep emotional connection" to them. It was hard to feel empathy and maybe because of that i never really connected to the game atmosphere.\n\nConcluding, the game has all elements to keep you interested for a while (if you are into this kind of game). But you must be carefull and dont fall to the tempation of comparing this games to the "giants" of the genre or you might end up feeling and thinking the same as the critics that rated this game with a 5/10.\n\nAs mentioned earlier: a solid 7/10","August 10, 2014","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you go in with a low price and low expectations it can help tide you over until the next good CRPG comes along.\n\nWhile unpolished is the word of the day, there's something valuable under the ugly surface.

However, in each of these elements there exists a good idea heading in an interesting direction.  It's just not there yet.  In truth this game could have used a year or more of development.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sigfried/recommended/232750/","sigfried","Sigfried","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sigfried/","236 products in account","The story takes place in the distant future on Mars. Long ago in the history of the game Mars was a prosperous colony on a well terraformed world. Now it is something of a post apocalypse wasteland where the surviving remnants of civilization fight over continually dwindling resources. People known as Psychers use ancient technology to manifest magic like abilities serving as elite military personnel for the factions.\n\nThe protagonist of the game is a renegade Psycher who becomes embroiled in a plot to stop the Psychers from one of the factions from completing a secret project and taking control over society for their own mysterious ends. The story begins in a military prison from which the hero escapes with a comrade, then moves to a neighboring empire where you either ally with a band of idealistic rebels or a concerned faction of the establishment to stop the Psycher plot.\n\nGame play is two pronged. There is a branching story to navigate and you can form alliances with different factions and relationships with different potential allies. There are also various side quests to occupy your time. This shares about equal footing with the hand to hand combat encounters which are a mix of arcade action and leveling/gearing your character in various combat powers and attributes.\n\nThe storytelling and world building are the game's strongest selling points. Unfortunately both suffer a little from uneven writing in the dialog and plotting. At times the story can be quite compelling, especially in the game's first two chapters. As it moves on things get a bit more predictable and wrote and the end of the game is on the anti-climactic side. The same goes for the world building. It starts out very intriguing but before too long you realize you are only going to scratch the surface of it while playing the game.\n\nThe combat and character building are lackluster but not deficient. Most of the combat choices are decent and they do lead to different tactics during fights. The controls are a little on the awkward side and the combat animations are not the sophisticated sort you find in Witcher 3 or the Batman games. It is a pretty simple game with fairly simple mechanics.\n\nUltimately it feels like a game made by professionals but both a bit behind the times and on a very limited budget. The locations are linear and limited and the range of enemies is pretty small. There is a fair bit of detail in the art, but there isn’t all that much of it. I certainly got my moneys worth and personally I like a short game with a concise story. By the time it had started to show its weaknesses the game was nearly over.\n\nI recommend it for fans of the genre so long as you go in wanting a smaller simpler game than sprawling epics like Dragon Age but with the same sort of game play and in an unusual genre setting.","November 9, 2015","true","13.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have no idea of how bugged it was - apparently it was, according to other reviewers - but in my hands ran just smoothly.\nBased on such remarks, here are my opinions on the game:\n\nThe setting and the artwork are nice, with a flavour of steam-punk style. After all, Mars is the red planet.\nDungeons, caves, and maps in general are a bit repetitive.\nDialogues are just fine. Perhaps they lack a bit of depth, though they are just enjoyable as such. The story is nice and leaves plenty of room for other episodes.\nAnimations are well made. It is nice the way it slows time down when opening the wheel menu or while counter-attacking.\nIt is a pity that jumping is not available, although it would be useless considering the game mechanics.\nRPG mechanics are OK; the characters evolves by spending points in the three branches or potentiating already unlocked skills.\nCombat may be the weak element of the game. After getting acquainted with the commands and the combat mechanics, the most successful way is to evade all the time, hit'n'run. If AoE skills from the Technomancer's branch, that becomes even easier.\nEquipment is also lacking depth. There is a lot of different weapon and armour upgrades, though it is rather difficult to find upgradable pieces during the game. The nice point here, is that you can adjust your gameplay by choosing the desired upgrades - which, by the way, also change parts of the look of the upgraded item according to their stats.\nCrafting also appears to be incomplete and could be improved a lot.\n\nOverall, I believe this is not a "< 60 game". As already state, based on the opening remarks, I would rate this as a 65, at least.","February 1, 2015","true","24.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not that the idea of a cyberpunk RPG set on Mars didn't appeal to me. And other reviews had made it sound sort of average at best. Yet I'm not one to reject new ideas and so I decided to give it a shot. And it was only around twenty bucks.\nTo put it bluntly: money well spent.\nMars: War Logs is a pretty intense game, with a tight storyline and at least decent gameplay. Sure, its graphics don't have a prayer against the latest incarnation of CoD and the like, but they are pretty impressive on their own for an indie game.\nYou play as Roy Temperance, prisoner in a POW camp on Mars, in the aftermath of a war between two rival factions veering for dominance over the planet. The game begins with you saving a young man named Innocence from becoming a 'punk' and from thereon planning your escape from the camp.\n(For some reason I have yet to discern, every man in this setting is named after a virtue, Innocence, Temperance, Constance, Prudence... weird. But not bad. Roy is actually the odd man out in this scenario.)\nThis is an action-rpg, meaning your character, Roy, is already a somewhat badass mofo, and the rpg-elements only serve to give you a choice what kind of badass mofo you're going to be. It follows the standard fighter-mage-thief trinity, with fighter being self explanatory, thief being labeled stealth and covering also things like fast-talking and bartering, and magic being called technomancy. I don't want to spoil anything but you have to progress a while in the game to acquire the technomancy abilities.\nThere is a karma meter that influences what kind of perks you get, which influence your style of badass mofo-ery. You in turn influence the karma meter (or reputation) by your actions, specifically whether or not you extract water units from dead bodies. Extracting the water is bad, by the way.\nThere is also a crafting system that allows you to create health or mana potions, or to upgrade your weapons and armor. What I actually like is that the upgrades also have a visual effect on Roy. You only fight with melee weapons for most of time, but in best prison tradition you can turn a simple rod into the shiv to end all shivs.\n\nOne thing I have to say though: I think cyberpunk is not really the best way to describe the game. For me the game was more like a dirtier, grittier version of the Dune novels and the David Lynch movie. But maybe that's just me.\n\nOkay, bottom line: for an indie game, Mars: War Logs is pretty damn good. Sure, it cannot compare to the works of Bioware, Obsidian and Bethesda, but that is not the point. On its own merits, it works perfectly. I really recommend checking it out, because for twenty bucks you will get a lot more bang, so to speak.","December 5, 2013","true","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is fun, and has a few moments of really well done story. The Dialog is both really good and really bad, depending on the character. Innocence (strange heavy handied naming convention asside) Is a great character and the airy voice acting does wonders to enhance the character. The main character however is totally hit or miss, mostly because it's obvious the lines weren't read in order, so he reacts strangly or puts odd emphasis on lines.\n\nIf you need a TLDR, the worst thing I could say for this game is it's a bit unpollished. There are no big bugs that I've seen, but the game's a bit short, thin, and mediocre, when compared to the Bethesda and Bioware counteparts that are the obvious influences.

Set on a post-apocalyptic Mars, your character is thrown into a power struggle between factions. The atmosphere sort of reminds me of a steampunky dune, complete with electric magic, sneaky face-whacking, political backstabbing, a bit of romance, and even a sandworm!\n\nPros:\nThe atmosphere is interesting. Drab, desert-ish industrial themes, with little splashes of color or variation.\nThe commerce system is simple, but effective. You can buy ingredients to construct upgrades to weapons and armor, or scavenge them from the environment.\nThe combat system is different from anything else I've used, but easy to get the hang of. The first chapter is a bit slow, and gives you plenty of time to get your bearings before throwing you into the thick of it.\nThe general plot and main characters are interesting enough, but some of the voice acting (especially for minor characters) is less than stellar, and in a few cases, downright bad.\nThe perk trees are nicely done. Basic, but they allow you to tailor your approach to combat to suit your style of play. The perks come in three trees, Stealth, Ranged Attacks and Healing, Manual Combat, or Technomancy (magic). Each tree has a few tiers of perks that unlock as you purchase items in that string, and each perk has three upgradeable layers of effectiveness.\nCons:\nThe visuals are drab, and this can make it a bit hard to navigate, simply because you're visually bored.\nThe side quests can be too vague. I had to resort to a walk-through for one in particular...turned out I had already missed my opportunity to complete the task.\nIt's a damn short game. I took my time, and it only took me 10 hours to complete.\nThe alignment system is janky. It makes some actions (ex. harvesting serum from downed enemies) obviously "bad", but it doesn't give you any direction or input as to how to navigate these choices or check your progress. I made "good" choices all the way through, and still finished the game with a "neutral" alignment, preventing me from taking advantage of the various perks attached to either of the divergent character paths.\n\nOverall, a good diversion RPG game, to play in between titles like Skyrim and Mass Effect. Maybe not worth $15, but I'd recommend buying it when it's on sale.","July 15, 2014","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was in the mood for Fallout however I am not a big fan of replaying games I have already beat. I wanted something new with a post apocalyptic/science fiction style game with RPG elements and plot twists that will keep me interested. Mars: War Logs is a good vacation into that craving. Not as good as a Fallout however has some similar elements that I enjoy. If Fallout 3/New Vegas slept with Star Wars KOTR 1 & 2 and had a baby, and the doctor accidentally dropped it on its head than it would be Mars: War Logs. They do some really good things right in this game, I enjoy the combat system more than I thought I would, the crafting system is simply yet still has me looking everywhere for items to craft.\n\nIt has story line tasks while providing a little smaller tasks to keep you busy. The controls are easy and quick to pick up. The characters are well done with solid voice overs to help you follow along. I am only 3 hours into this game and will play it until I beat it. I do wish it was more open world like Fallout as the first chapter keeps you rather confined to a KOTR style area. Maybe as I get closer to the end it will open up more however that is really my only complaint. For what I paid for the game it was well worth my money. I am surprised however that this game did not get more attention than it has as it I have played more hyped games with worst design than this one. If I was to give it a star rating 1-5 I would say this is an easy 3 1/2 stars, 5 being the best. I will continue to dig deeper and this is well worth your time and money.\n\nThanks for reading,\nIce","July 17, 2014","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have no idea of how bugged it was - apparently it was, according to other reviewers - but in my hands ran just smoothly.\nBased on such remarks, here are my opinions on the game:\n\nThe setting and the artwork are nice, with a flavour of steam-punk style. After all, Mars is the red planet.\nDungeons, caves, and maps in general are a bit repetitive.\nDialogues are just fine. Perhaps they lack a bit of depth, though they are just enjoyable as such. The story is nice and leaves plenty of room for other episodes.\nAnimations are well made. It is nice the way it slows time down when opening the wheel menu or while counter-attacking.\nIt is a pity that jumping is not available, although it would be useless considering the game mechanics.\nRPG mechanics are OK; the characters evolves by spending points in the three branches or potentiating already unlocked skills.\nCombat may be the weak element of the game. After getting acquainted with the commands and the combat mechanics, the most successful way is to evade all the time, hit'n'run. If AoE skills from the Technomancer's branch, that becomes even easier.\nEquipment is also lacking depth. There is a lot of different weapon and armour upgrades, though it is rather difficult to find upgradable pieces during the game. The nice point here, is that you can adjust your gameplay by choosing the desired upgrades - which, by the way, also change parts of the look of the upgraded item according to their stats.\nCrafting also appears to be incomplete and could be improved a lot.\n\nOverall, I believe this is not a "< 60 game". As already state, based on the opening remarks, I would rate this as a 65, at least.","February 1, 2015","true","24.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's worth every penny.\n\nThe game is a mix of gameplay from Dragon Age and any MMORPG. It takes place on Mars, with 3 long chapters, and allows you to have one party member at one time. You only focus on your characters items and skills, the game handles the rest.\n\nThe game takes roughly 8 hours, including all side quests. This has a moderate replay value so you definitely find yourself wanting to change your choices the second time around. There are minor kinks that need to be worked out, but not very noticeable.\n\n4/5. Great game.","March 19, 2015","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am a sucker for anything sci-fi, and the concept and story were extremely intriguing to me.\n\nAre there a couple of rough edges to the game? Yes. Should you be impressed nonetheless considering this was made by such a small studio? I think so.\n\nI feel I've read some reviews claiming this is just a boring, linear hack and slash. I have no idea what they are talking about. I just beat it on Extreme difficulty, and I constantly had to plan out what enemy among the group I would need to take down first, throwing dust in one's eyes, wounding one of their melee fighters with a nailgun to slow him down, and then pound on their technomancer so I wouldn't be turned into fried chicken. Some of the battles I won almost soley out of luck.\n\nAnyway, I think the game is great. As I write this, it's only $3.74 on Steam.

If they would of spent (like i said earlier) maybe a few more months on this game, to give the graphics more "mmph", better optimize the game overall, fix the VO, add more skill tree depth, fine tune the combat system, and anyother things i may have missed, i would pay more than 3$ for it, but the way it is, im glad i only paid 3$. but ill still recommend it for those looking for something to kill the time to get over your 3 week SWTOR binge, while dinner cooks, or while waiting for your coffee to finish brewing. but do yourself a favor, and get it while its on sale if you are considering buying it.","March 19, 2014","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tearatherflesh/recommended/232750/","tearatherflesh","Heath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tearatherflesh/","192 products in account","For the price and considering this is a downloadable game, it's quite good...but nonetheless, this game makes me ANGRY. You see, I'm the kind of person who always plays games on the hardest difficulty, and in this case, you don't want to do that. The "extreme" difficulty brings to light all of the games flaws in the most glaring way possible...all of them in the combat system.\n\nAt first blush, the combat seems straightforward and responsive. You can hit, block, shoot, use powers and items (kinda like Batman or The Witcher 2). You can cancel any animation into a defensive roll or block, which I wish ALL melee-combat games did. It's great. So great, I bought this game for both PC and PS3 before getting very far into it. However, as you progress through the game, you will come across numerous situations that will leave you fumed (as in, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off).\n\nMostly, you will be in small areas with a large group of 5 enemies around you. YES, 5 enemies is a lot, considering this is a game where all enemies take multiple hits to kill. Imagine in real life you were surrounded by a gang of 5 people armed with pipes in an alleyway. Enemies will swarm you. They will dominate you. And most of all, they will kill you. And it's all thanks to this following list of things that can and will go wrong during a battle:\n\n- The camera will screw you over. It will position itself at the worst possible angle. You will not see enemies rush up behind you and deliver the final blow. Even in open areas, the camera is too close and you will often get blindsided if you're not careful.\n\n- The lock-on system will screw you over. When you are locked onto an enemy, using the right-stick to change the camera angle DOESN'T change the camera angle, it changes which enemy you're locked onto. Accidentally switching target in a heated battle often means swinging at thin air as the camera spins to face the new target, all the while giving an easy hit opportunity to the enemy right next to you who you were previously attacking. Just don't lock-on.\n\n- You will get stuck on the environment. This is mostly prevalent in the underground cave levels. Nothing is worse than getting stuck on a little rock or a rod that is pointlessly sticking out into the pathway...especially when a pack of 5-7 enemies is chasing you. When they catch up to you, prepare to lose half of your health.\n\n- The tactical pause menu will screw you over. During the battles, you can pause the game to use weapons and powers (kinda like in Mass Effect or Dragon Age). However, when you unpause the game, there is a small chance you will get a glich and NOT be able to move forward and backward for several seconds. During this time, if any enemies are nearby, they will kill you.\n\nAlso, sometimes, when you select a power from the pause menu, you may end up rolling forward instead of using the power. Not generally a good thing, especially when you roll straight into the pack of enemies you meant to throw a grenade at.\n\nLuckily, instead of using the pause menu, you can map powers to L2, R1, and R2 for quick use in battle. HOWEVER, L2 and R2 only work like 25% of the time. LITERALLY. You will have to jam on them repeatedly to work. Either that or my controller is messed up (but since it works perfectly fine for all other games...no).\n\n- Your squadmates will screw you over. Until very late in the game, your companions will usually go down within several seconds of starting a fight. Especially the character "Innocence." I thought he was a pretty good character until I saw him fight. Completely useless. Also, the commands you can give them are not very useful, especially "defend yourself."\n\nMost of these issues seem like they could be fixed given more testing, but alas, they remain, and only serve to deliver you cheap-death after cheap-death. It's why I died...a lot. I hear this game takes 6-8 hours to finish on wimp difficulty, but my final playtime was 21.5 hrs. Probably 95% of the countless deaths I had were just from cheap garbage like what was listed above, which is a shame. As I mentioned, the other elements of this game are quite good considering the price and scope.\n\nFor the good, the game looks spectacular on console. The art design is hit or miss, depending on your tastes, but technically it looks sharp and runs great. Very impressive. The story...has potential, is quite good at times and quite bad at others. There love interests in the game, but the pacing is very rushed considering how late partners come into the game, and how quickly the game ends.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game to the kind of person who plays the demo and likes it. There were many, MANY times where I hated this game and wanted to come on here and give it "0 out of 10" since it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off so bad, but I'm looking forward to the next game from this developer (Spiders) and hope they can refine the Action RPG formula they seem to be honing.\n\nFinally...don't play this game on "Extreme" difficulty","June 30, 2013","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If it was a movie the  word to describe Mars:War Logs would be "slight" and reviewers would be politely disparaging if they only watched Holywood blockbusters. Not to be too negative though- the game is a primarily fun with a reasonably interesting if short and slightly predictable story. Character development and voice acting are decent for a video game.

I purchased this during it's 75% off sale and I can say that it was worth the money spent, but had I bought this game for full price, even at the low price it is already at, I would have felt a little bummed out, but not enough to really regret the purchase.\n\nThe flaws in this game are few, but affect the immersion and gameplay pretty heavily. For starters, we have the most obvious issue of poor lip synching for the voice overs and poor voice actors. Now, I don't know about you, but when it comes to a game made in 2013, you'd think that you could at least have proper lip synching so that your game characters don't look like a bunch of puppets when they talk.\n\nThe voice acting side of things in this game also comes with another tag along flaw of horribly bad dialog and just general sloppyness of a story. It has a nice twist in the beginning which is refreshing when it comes to your main character, but that is about it. The voice actors in this game were not refreshing however...and at times, even right off in the beginning they showed their lack of skill at voice acting. This could have also been a result of poor direction as well, which would be understandable, but it's still significant enough that on my first playthrough I was skipping the dialog just so I didn't have to suffer.\n\nCompanion choices are obvious enough that you won't be surprised at all and the game does have you do a fair bit of running around for quests, which gets annoying at times, but not so much as to detract from the gameplay a whole lot. The game is extremely linear and I also felt that your reputation in the game meant all of ♥♥♥♥ when it comes down to it. My reputation was bad the entire time and it didn't affect anything I could percieve to be a detriment to my gameplay when it came to companion interaction or affecting the story. The only thing it did affect was that I couldn't get the companion bonus feat or the merchant price reduction, but that wasn't a big deal considering my companion was only good for distracting an enemy or two and that the game gives you everything in the game that you need. Vendors were pretty much pointless as a whole and the crafting system, while neat, was generally pointless as well as once you obtain the copper tube and leather outfit in the 2nd chapter you effectively have the best weapon and armor in the game.\n\nCombat is frustrating but fun, and stealth is a broken mechanic allowing you to typically take out 1-2 baddies before they notice you. Explosives are your friend and the blast power with the cone effect is really the only power I ever used since the shield and weapon powers take forever to cast.\n\nThe best thing about this game is the detail in the environments. This game looks gritty and dirty and it's great.\n\nI was expecting more, but for the price I paid I knew that I wasn't going to be super impressed with it, however I didn't hate it and if you are looking for a cheap game to beat then pick this one up during a sale.","March 25, 2014","true","9.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The world and characters are intriguing, although the game is a tad too short to really flesh it out. The combat could use some tweaks here and there, as there are big difficulty spikes: once you're comfortable with one class of enemy, a significantly tougher one is introduced. This is fine, except for the fact that these tougher enemies come in packs of at least 4, which can be overwhelming until you upgrade your gear.\n\nWould love to see more from this IP in the future, preferably a tad longer and with some more polishing.","April 6, 2014","true","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Purchased it at the regular price and don't regret it, only wish it would be a tad longer and perhaps allow somewhat greater freedom of exploration (though the most of the areas that appear throughout Chapter 2 are explorable from the get go).\n\nOne of the common gripes I can see in other reviews is the combat system. It's much different from what I have seen in most other RPGs, and I would say that it's challenging to master. In fact the difficulty level of some battles seems to be quite inconsistent, as I don't remember having many problems fighting my enemies in latter stages of the game (except for a boss fight in the latter portion of the game, which featured a completely unique type of enemy), but some battles in the beginning were frustrating and at times overwhelmingly difficult. Groups of enemies are really, really hard to dispatch at first, and the companions that we have available serve as little else than a distraction. They don't ever seem to get any better as well.\n\nCharacter developement is fairly straightforward, featuring three skill trees - Combat (meaning melee combat); Renegade (ranged weapons and explosives, stealth, healing and a very useful "blinding skill"); Technomancy (magic, sort of - this tree becomes available after the first chapter). I'm not entirely sure if they are well balanced, as a full focus on Combat with a few points here and there in the other two trees allowed me to be nigh invincible towards the end of the game. Combat is, in general, fast-paced and rather dynamic.\n\nWhat I liked most, however, is the way that the player improves their equipment. Crafting is possibly the only real means of improving ones gear, as both armours and weapons in their basic versions provide little improvement over each other. Their full potential is unlocked only by craftable upgrades. In fact, the main reason to acquire new armour or melee weapons is to get the ability to craft more advanced upgrades.\n\nVoice acting ranges from fine to downright terrible. I hear that the dialogue quality has lost a lot in translation from original French, and it does sound a bit odd at times, and some sentences actually don't make sense. Not a lot of that however, at least after the patch that actually included improved voice acting for some characters.\n\nThe story is so-so, although hardly groundbreaking or surprising. That said, it had one or two unexpected twists before getting to a rather predictable ending.\n\nThe general theme of the game is described as 'cyberpunk'. I would call it 'cyberpunk-ish' at best. There is little to no advanced/futuristic tech to be experienced, it just seems more like a dystopian vision of a forgotten space colony, whose inhabitants have slowly devolved.\n\nTo sum up: I would recommend this game to patient people, who would like to try their hand at something a bit different.

This isn’t to say this game is a complete write-off as I’m still playing it and enjoying it… most of the time. As I play it, I feel that the developers have taken great ideas from other games and then mashed them together, without fully developing any of them. The leveling up is based on experience gain and allows you to spent points on perks (like Fallout), and separate points on skills with a skill tree reminiscent of The Witcher 2. Though unlike The Witcher 2, there’s not real room for focus on one particular skill set as you need to utilise everything at your disposal such as dodging, blocking, attacking, traps, bombs, guns, technomancy (magic), healing and other party members to be able to survive through most combats. Because you need all of these, you need to spread your skill points evenly across the board. Though I will say that the skills have significant effects on what your character can do, as do the perks, meaning that your choice in either do matter.\n\nMars: War Logs aspires to be a lot of things, though doesn’t quite reach any of them.

The game can be a little buggy but nothing show stopping. The mechanics of the game, how the fighting system works and so on, not perfect but I'm not all about game mechanics. Take a game like Jade Empire, it's flawed mechanically but there's so much more to that game, it's great fun. This game is very much like that too. Jade Empire, Remember me, games like that are more about telling a story and the RPG elements and game mechanics are there to keep you interested while that story plays out.\n\nI don't like Mars: War Logs, I absolutely love it. Good science fiction tales are hard to come by in PC gaming and this is very much one of them. I'm also gobsmacked that such a small developer was able to pull off so much. So for me it helped a lot that I went into this game knowing a fair bit about the developers, what they were trying to do and forgave the problems the game has because of that.\n\nTake a game like Skyrim. A truly epic game with a massive budget and huge team of programmers  and artists. Even that game has many problems but I adore that game despite its problems. I love that they were trying to create a huge open world and fill that world with enough content, that at times it felt like I was in a real place, really role playing my way through it. Mars: War Logs is trying to do the same but with a tiny fraction of the budget of Skyrim. The fact there were plenty of times I also felt I was in another place, really role playing my way through it is quite astounding to me.\n\nBottom line, if you love a good Sci-Fi tale and want to be immersed into it, this game will give you that. On sale it's an absolute steal and a must have. At full price, I'd say you probably should avoid if this is going into a backlog to be played later as it will go on sale again. If you want to play it right now, the full price which is £11.99 as of writing this, I'd pay that.","June 26, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A prisoner of a war that is just about to be over. After coming to the aid of a boy named Innoscence you begin to gather up forces for an escape. The game has a reputation system and some perks are based off reputation. Besides the perks you also have access to three different skill trees. Gather up scrap to upgrade armor and weapons. You will also be creating nail gun ammo and kits. The real reason Roy wishes to escape he keeps to himself until the time is right.\n\nThe Good\nThe combat is actually good. Just remember that if you kill enemies to get serum they respawn depending on the area and enemy. I never tested sneak in the game so I can't speak on if that works well or not. The guns, weapons, and technomancer combos are pretty fun and very solidly implemented. The armor & weapon upgrade system looks freakin awesome and allows for quite a bit of a custom look even if there is essentially only two base armor looks to start from. The backstory on the world is pretty interesting.\n\nThe Bad\nBack and forth...back and forth.... back and forth... back and forth... The game makes you travel like constantly and when you reach the end of the first city you will be utterly sick of it. The loads tend to freeze up a little bit from time to time in the city area. The only monster enemies is the moles, and other then that its basically three types of human enemies. The game does endlessly reuse tiles, but that is a minor problem since they reuse them smartly. The story in the game doesn't really stand up to the awesome backstory of the world.\n\nConclusion\nHonestly this game was probably a bit to ambitious for such a low budget small studio, but the games got a good heart to it. The Mad Max without the vehicles feel the game presents is pretty awesome to boot.\n\nValue\nThe game by default is only $15, but I'd probably suggest waiting until its 50% off before going for it.","May 8, 2015","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have read some bad reviews about this game which I feel are unfair. The only gripe is that the animations are a bit clunky and some of the dialog doesn't always make complete sense; however this has been on rare occassions.  Once you can see past that this is a very indepth story driven game with some very cool features. The graphics and sound are good. The combat system is very strategic. All in all this is a very good game. If you are unsure wait until it is in the sale. If you like indepth RPGS and are not expecting AAA then you will probably really enjoy this game. I think it is very polished except for the animations and the odd camera issue. Nothing terrible here.

The best features are the story and narrative which is mature, dark and most often grim since I took the "evil" character route but it does let you still make positive choices and help out those you like. The combat is great, reminds me of The Witcher 2 and Dark Souls mixed in a way because you block, counter and roll dodge around most of the time killing fools with melee attacks because ranged combat is limited due to scarcity of ammo for your makeshift nailgun. Its not too long, I beat it in 12 hours and missed some quests and killed off a few annoying key characters but had a blast the whole way through once I mastered the combat.","June 2, 2013","true","12.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can choose between shooting (and letting your guard down), using powers (which requires so precious time), or just bash in with your "almighty custom made pipe of destruction". Do not expect much more than this (which is enough for my tastes), so do not expect to lose hours in micro management about every single move.\n2) The story is nice.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sigfried/recommended/232750/","sigfried","Sigfried","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sigfried/","236 products in account","The story takes place in the distant future on Mars. Long ago in the history of the game Mars was a prosperous colony on a well terraformed world. Now it is something of a post apocalypse wasteland where the surviving remnants of civilization fight over continually dwindling resources. People known as Psychers use ancient technology to manifest magic like abilities serving as elite military personnel for the factions.\n\nThe protagonist of the game is a renegade Psycher who becomes embroiled in a plot to stop the Psychers from one of the factions from completing a secret project and taking control over society for their own mysterious ends. The story begins in a military prison from which the hero escapes with a comrade, then moves to a neighboring empire where you either ally with a band of idealistic rebels or a concerned faction of the establishment to stop the Psycher plot.\n\nGame play is two pronged. There is a branching story to navigate and you can form alliances with different factions and relationships with different potential allies. There are also various side quests to occupy your time. This shares about equal footing with the hand to hand combat encounters which are a mix of arcade action and leveling/gearing your character in various combat powers and attributes.\n\nThe storytelling and world building are the game's strongest selling points. Unfortunately both suffer a little from uneven writing in the dialog and plotting. At times the story can be quite compelling, especially in the game's first two chapters. As it moves on things get a bit more predictable and wrote and the end of the game is on the anti-climactic side. The same goes for the world building. It starts out very intriguing but before too long you realize you are only going to scratch the surface of it while playing the game.\n\nThe combat and character building are lackluster but not deficient. Most of the combat choices are decent and they do lead to different tactics during fights. The controls are a little on the awkward side and the combat animations are not the sophisticated sort you find in Witcher 3 or the Batman games. It is a pretty simple game with fairly simple mechanics.\n\nUltimately it feels like a game made by professionals but both a bit behind the times and on a very limited budget. The locations are linear and limited and the range of enemies is pretty small. There is a fair bit of detail in the art, but there isn’t all that much of it. I certainly got my moneys worth and personally I like a short game with a concise story. By the time it had started to show its weaknesses the game was nearly over.\n\nI recommend it for fans of the genre so long as you go in wanting a smaller simpler game than sprawling epics like Dragon Age but with the same sort of game play and in an unusual genre setting.","November 9, 2015","true","13.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Your sidekicks are useless and you can only have one with you at a time. They almost without fail get knocked out early one in a fight leaving at time three or more enemies for you to deal with.

At normal price I'd draw a breath and suggest its not worth wasting time on.  It may keep you occupied, but it doesn't amuse or entertain. It's a bit clunky, there's a lot of scenery repetition, and only a shallow assortment of NPC faces, and uses a non-standard distribution of key assigments that makes learning it a matter of frustration.  But you do get used it its quirks after a trime, enough to realise its a simple, basic story that could do with a deal of creative input.  The game engine is used in many similar games, so its a bit like the Spiders company can turn these out at whim.  Once you have a game's coding set in stone, all you need do is change the graphics and presto, a brand new game.  Looks like that's what they've done here.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the-simian/recommended/232750/","the-simian","Sparkle Magic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the-simian/","722 products in account","Mars: War Logs\nIn the masterfully crafted "Mars: War Logs" (which is in fact a war-diary), we are transported to a martian "anti reality", where societal norms regarding sexual orientation are questioned and examined in series of autisticly voice-acted scenes populated with uncanny-valley robo-people. "The War", (referenced in the title), is actually culture-war being fought not only on the Martian landscape, but within ourselves.\n\nStory        10/10                Gameplay        10/10                Graphics        9/10                Overall        Like a million/10\nStory 10/10:\n\nIn this game, you play  a man metaphorically questioning his own sexuality whilst constantly being thrust into combat scenarios  where the only way to survive is to forcefully bludgeon others with handcrafted electro-phalluses.  Our  protagonist hails from a martian colony called "Aurora";  a symbol of cis-genedered norms. Aurora issues "virtue-names" to each inhabitant  like "temprance", "honesty", "morality", "steely-dan" and "jazz-organ" as if to imply a life of freedomless societal predestination.\n\nOur doucheburn-wearing antihero held rank in "The Source". "The Source" is a guild of "technomancers", a group of pick-up artists who have dedicated a lifetime of hot-gluing wires and glowsticks to their bodies in a misguided attempt at peacocking. Rejecting this worldview, he is cast down into a dirty man-prison festering with debauchery. It is in this gay-underworld that our protagonist takes his first steps in breaking away from breeder-culture and changes from his assigned name "Temperance" to "Roy", the name of a gay space-cowboy.\n\nAll is well in the Brokeback Mars Mountain-Prison until one day a strapping young bronco named "Innocence" appears one day, in the shower room. After defending him from an attempted ♥♥♥♥ (yes that's what happens), "Innocence" thanks you and becomes your new buckaroo-boyfriend. Innocence then keeps a scrapbook, where he draws fanart about the main character, and talks about his feelings. (This is where the game gets its name, by the way.)\n\nAfter bonding with Innocence by digging through trash bins, rubble heaps and rotten mushroom patches for a few hours, Roy and his young buck decide to "break out of the closet" by stealing a train, and returning to Aurora. Ideally, this is where where they will organize a "resistance" that will pridefully march in the streets and overturn societal norms.\n\nGameplay  10/10:\n\nThe gameplay consists primarily of combat and dialogue. The dialog feels largely forced, much like the expectation our protagonist feels to conform to society. Your character is almost entirely sent on errands, in an effort to highlight the meaninglessness of life without freedom. You are both figuratively and literally wasting away in a prison! This nihilist gesture is surely to underscore the overarching theme of resisting cultural assimilation and cisexual assumptions.\n\nIn a bold move, the extended metaphor of sexual discovery is manifest in akward camera angles during combat. The audience is constantly asking questions like "what am I really trying to see?" and "who am I, in all of this?". The camera encourages you to explore new ways of seeing reality.\n\nThe enemies you fight during combat consist of your sexual rivals in the prison, cave dwelling testicle-mutants and pick up artists wearing rave-gloves. Despite the fact humans have clearly terraformed Mars, you are restricted to fighting with nailguns and crude batons. You must therefore "assert dominance" over your foes by forcefully employing these erotically-shaped instruments in a symbolic display of fertility and potency.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=513841744\nThis half-man half-testicle is a visceral manifestation of your latent sexual urges.\n\nHowever, with the slow response speed and erratic camera movements, much like the theme of the game, the real enemy is yourself, thus highlighting the thematic motifs present in the story.\n\nGraphics  9/10:\n\nIn another bold artistic gesture, the developers decided to maek every mesh appear as robotic and lifeless as possible during the dialogue. This is clearly an allusion to a dystopian reality, where "every cog has its place" and personal freedom is stifled. Every landscape is a exercise in monotony and every texture is visual litter.  Everything, (even your clothing), is covered with the same blurry rust, soot and grunge; a clear attempt to give Mars a literal and figurative sense of 'uncanny valley', a fitting location for our symbolic tale.\n\nI feel like this Idea could have been explored more throughly, hence the 9.\n\n\nOverall  integer-overflow/10:\n\nIf you're the right kind of player, itching for a game to make you question yourself, social norms, and why you spend money on Mars: War Logs, this is a game that will raise the right questions. I have never seen a game so experimentally break the 4th wall by intentionally crippling core gaming features in service to a noble theme. Bravo!\n\nSadly however; I cannot recommend this game. I don't think most people are ready for this. Mars logs is simply ahead of its time.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=419706842","September 7, 2015","false","11.3"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","46","12","26","13","2"

The combat is tedious no matter what difficulty you play at. I got bored and quit several hours before the end of the game and I rarely do that with story based RPGs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zoffix/recommended/232750/","zoffix","Zoffix Znet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zoffix/","151 products in account","I definitely recommend the game. I got it on sale for $5, and after 1.5 hours I already feel I got enough fun for the money—and the game has only just begun. So, I think even the $17 for the game is well worth the price.\n\nIf you go in with right expectatoions into this game, you can definitely enjoy it. It delivers just what a $17 game should deliver; don't compare it to those that go for $40-$60.\n\nThere's no jumping in the game and you do occasionally bump into an invisible wall. There are some really grotesque looking people and I often want to find out what had happened to them, but alas, they just ignore you and there's no option to talk to them. Some characters stand in your way, [intentionally?] blocking your way. They're like furniture—no interaction with you at all—which feels lazy and lame on the part of developers.\n\nWhat irks me the most is the UI. Every time you pick up loot or ransack a corpse, you get a popup message telling you what you found, and you gotta click "OK" to close it. This really should've been a brief message at the bottom instead. Quests, on the other hand, flash by so quickly, you don't get a chance to read what you have to do, so sometimes you gotta navigate into your quest journal to read them.\n\nIf you don't have your weapon out, SHIFT makes you sprint. If you do, SHIFT makes you roll. The problem is if you have to go up/down a cliff or ladder, you have to position yourself in front of it and click your mouse. The area where that click actually makes you climb is small, so you often miss it, and get your weapon out instead. There's no button to hide it, so then you just wait for it to be put away just so you could sprint again. Annoying.\n\nVoice acting is mediocre in places, but the dialog is very well written.\n\nThe setting, story, and writing shine. I'm enjoying them so far. Combat system seems good too. It isn't a "click-until-they-die" stupidity, like in Skyrim. If you hit your enemy with the same thing repeatedly, they'll start blocking it. Dogs can't be damaged in the head, so you gotta try to get them from the back. There are stealth combat attacks, blinding sand throws, guns (though you don't aim to shoot them), and seems like a bunch of other "magic"-like attacks that you unlock later on. So I'm enjoying the combat.\n\nA few other reviewers dissed the graphics, but they look fine to me. You get an occasional model that seems to bob a bit too much when idly chatting, but that's minor.\n\nIn summation, this isn't a $50 top-shelf title; don't go into this game expecting it to compare to such games. It's a $17 game and it's worth every penny. Voice acting and user interface are the the weak points, graphics are fine, and combat, setting, and writing are the strong points.\n\nI definitely recommend this.","October 16, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The graphics aren't bad for an indie game, and the concepts behind it are fairly solid and intriguing. Unfortunately, there are a lot of technical details that mar the experience, but overall it's a game worth buying - if you're getting it cheap.\n\nCombat can (and likely will) be frustrating until you learn all the right tricks. You'll always be outnumbered, often four or five to one, and most foes need to be hit a dozen times before they'll fall - while just five or six hits will often kill you. Expect to spend a lot of time manically rolling from side to side as you try to evade them, or invest heavily in explosives to end combat as quickly as possible.\n\nThe voice acting is passable, but crude. A number of the voice actors adopt 'silly' voices as they leapfrog from character to character, and several of the actors actually say something entirely different from what the subtitles are saying. Although the main character's voice is decent enough, I found myself often skipping through awkwardly delivered (and profanity-riddled) lines with greater regularity as the game progressed.\n\nThere are moral choices present in the game, but they're generally very basic. Do you want to murder these people for a few extra dollar? Well then that's evil, and it will be reflected in your reputation. Do you NOT want to murder these people? Oh, well then you're a decent guy. Congrats. It rarely gets much more in-depth then that, though.\n\nOn the plus side, though, both the skills and the crafting system are fairly well done. Every skill you unlock gives you a very tangible benefit or ability, making it difficult to choose which one you want. Crafting is almost required to progress, and acts as an invaluable aid, both for crafting 'one-use' items like grenades or health injectors and for modifying your basic weapons and armor.\n\nAll in all, I'd give Mars: War Logs a 7 out of 10. Worth the buy, if you're getting it for ten dollars or less.","December 5, 2013","true","17.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

As a summary, I would say this is a game for sci-fi fans that prioritize story over game play and are not afraid to sacrifise game-play and graphic looks to delve into a slightly unusual universe and an OK story.\n\nWhat was good in this game: a) The story was in addition to dialogue and cut scenes told through diary entries, which helped keep up with what is going on. b) Good character and location descriptions. c) Technomancy replaced magic here, which is an interesting skill to master and play with.\n\nWhat could have been better: a) The game's graphics are very outdated, there are not many details to look at both when it comes to pure graphical looks, and immersive details. b) Almost all side-quests involve doing something and returning for reward: there is simply too much running from A to B, back to A and B again. If the world was more immersive, it might be more fun this way, but now it can be a little bit boring. A good thing is it doesn't take too much time to run like that. c) Voice acting could have been better in certain places to make the story more immersive.\n\nNeutral points to note: a) The game is majorly linnear, with a few exceptions. b) Fighting is basic and not very complex, but made more fun through Technomancy skill tree. c) The world is limited to the player, there are invisible borders here and there, but mostly there is walking in corridors between structures and rock walls.\n\nI chose to recommend this game, mostly because of the story and the way it was presented through diary entries and descriptions. Although the story itself isn't very immersive or more than averagely engaging, it kept me interested enough to finish the game. However, I would like to note that the story and universe they built in this game had several parts which would have been very interesting to learn more about. Simply put, there are some pretty interesting ideas, but it is a pity the game never explores them (more deeply).\n\nSo try this if you aren't bothered by above mentioned negative and neutral points.","December 30, 2013","true","14.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The plot is awesome but underdeveloped, the developers could make a bigger game it lasts a few hours, the story is linear going straight on without much details. By the way in my opinion that's a "must have" and I hope there could be soon some DLC or a sequel with more details. The gameplay is a little complex I ask one more hand to Santa last Christmas...but he didn't realized me so I get used to it and at the end it wasn't nothing I can't put up with.\nThe story is cold in a reality where only those who have not scruples survives, and where the strongest rule the weaker...it looks like the evil counterparty of a paralel universe of Mass Effect. So...enjoy the game :3 Hope to be helpful <3 See ya !\n\nHo apprezzato molto questo gioco :) e lo consiglio a tutti quelli che amano il genere sci-fi e GDR. La trama è bellissima ma poco sviluppata, i creatori avrebbero potuto fare un gioco più grande, dura poche ore, la storia è lineare e tirata a dritto senza molti dettagli. Comunque secondo me è un "must have" e spero che ci possano essere presto delle DLC o un sequel con più dettagli. Il gameplay è un po' complesso...ho chiesto a Babbo Natale una mano in più lo scorso Natale ma non mi ha esaudita...alla fine ci ho dovuto fare l'abitudine e ho scoperto che non era niente che non potessi sopportare. La storia è fredda in una realtà dove solo quelli che non hanno scrupoli sopravvivono, e dove i più forti comandano i più deboli...somiglia alla controparte malvagia di un universo parallelo di Mass Effect. Insomma...godetevi il gioco :3 Spero di essere stata utile <3 Ci si vede!","January 31, 2014","true","15.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The story was very interesting and kept me playing through somewhat tedious quests. The voice acting could have been better in some places and often didn't match the on-screen text, but it didn't detract from the playability or enjoyment, in my opinion. I liked the variety of melee weaponry and wardrobe, as well as the crafting aspects and skill trees. I would have liked at least one more type of gun, however, since there was only one (that I could find). Also love that it offered full controller support, always a big plus for me. I think a DLC or two could add a lot to this game and I would buy in a heartbeat.

This game is never get finished. the whole time you stupidly run again and again in nice designed but boring maps. you dont have alternativ ways to solve quest. its nearly always Kill-them-all or run trough and get some timewasting other stuff. The combat engine maybe would be nice, if the skills are where more balanced and the the fights where more interessting. If you played the first 3-5 fights you nearly see them all. very very boring! Stealth-kills are a nice idea but nearly never rougelike skills can be used to solve or evade fights. The complete camera is absolut crap and very anyoing. One of the realy good parts are the characters, the are very nice designed and emotional. The story is OK, not more not less. One of the most frustrating things in my opion is the loot system. you can loot enemys after you won the fight, but for what? The crafting of items are very very depressiv und quit useless. You nearly always get the same things - leather, scraps, ammo,... and than after you loot it, you can loot it again to gain some money/potions for trading. should be a good-bad thing with impression of the people, i dont see any of them any time. very very sad.","May 4, 2014","false","4.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deneric/recommended/232750/","deneric","Cooper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deneric/","370 products in account","Mars: War Logs is a cyberpunk rpg in which you fight the a corporation (or is a government?) called Abundance because they are the people that attack you.  Also you fight thugs and mole-things.\n\nGameplay - It's pretty lacking.  The only time you interact with the world is when you dig through the trash or talk to a merchant.  There are also side quests to do, but they're not interesting and don't really have any affect on the environment.  It's like played bioware games, thought they ROCKED, and then didn't realize what they liked about them.  The combat's also pretty underwhelming.  It's a brawler (in the vein of Sleeping Dogs, just without the combos or useful interface) which would be fine, except for this terrible ability every enemy has; the ability to not take damage. Every so often, usually when you're doing well, they'll choose to jump back and avoid all of your damage.\n\nThis is a pretty big deal since there's no way to counter it (even if they're already against a wall) and you're usually against a large group of competant enemies.  Choosing to attack an enemy is a risky decision since they can all suddenly start tearing through you at any moment.  It's not even an issue of difficulty, it's an issue of poor design.  You're forced to spend most of each encounter rolling around waiting for your technopowers to recharge\n\nStory - I feel like there could have been a really cool story here.  From what I gathered, it's based on a cool idea of corporate warfare on an unforgiving planet and the effects that can have on a population.  The problem is that the game does NOTHING with any of this.  It's like they start the game right after the end of a really cool game.  No part of the story is really explained beyond "these are the bad guys because just trust me" moments.  I mean, the whole first act of the game seems to only happen because of the main character's impatience.   I actually had to stop playing at the end of the second act because I was given a choice to make and realized that I had NO idea what anyone was talking about or trying to accomplish.\n\nActing - I feel like it's important to be forgiving here; how many indie studios could talented voice actors? It's entirely possible that it was just the developers.  To their credit, there are some characters that are voiced in a perfectly acceptable fashion.  They're even able to give emotion!  The problem is that most of those characters are pretty throwaway.  The MAIN cast, on the other hand, all sound ridiculous.  Either they're "bad ♥♥♥ female roles" that sound like 7 year olds or they're the protagonist who, oh my god, has not changed his tone once through the entire game.\n\nWorld Design - Like I said before, they really could have done a lot here. I mean, a dystopian, cyberpunk world set on MARS?  Instead they just made everything orange and dirty.  I actually had to rely on my map to get anywhere because the areas were so confusing and samey.  I also said this before, but nothing you do changes anything and there are only like ten characters that say anything in the whole game.\n\nRPG Elements - Pretty lack luster.  The progression trees mostly just boost damage or give uninteresting boosts like being able to react faster after being hit.  Then there's the feat system that gives four types of boosts; increased xp from enemies, increased loot from enemies, more crafting options (crafting's mostly just for upgrading your gear), and better stuff from recycling gear.  There are also some perks from the morality system but the only ones that are useful come from being a bad guy (the good guy perks involve slightly decreased prices from merchants which you NEVER use and increased damage/health for your companion, which is probably just going to stand there being hit anyway).\n\nAchievements - Nothing too hard, but it's worth mentioning that there's an achievement for doing all the side quests.  They're pretty finicky and will actually become unavailable if you do them in the wrong order.\n\nFinal Thoughts - I love when indie devs take on something that's probably more than they can chew; it shows they're driven!  So, for the first four hours I managed to ignore a bunch of the flaws with the game.  It wasn't until the end of the first act when a character who had no reason to die was killed purely to create dramatic tension (and failed to do so, by the way) that it really clicked with me that there was something actually WRONG with the game.  I can't really recommend this game, but I'd suggest you keep an eye on this development team; this game was bad, but it seems like a step in the right direction.","June 27, 2014","false","7.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Especially if you like studying games from a design standpoint. As a full (even if low) price story driven action RPG, Mars: War Logs isn't very good.\nStory never picks up, partially because of a rather bad translation, partially because everything in the game is fit into very claustrophobic locations and it's hard to take anything seriously. Characters go from "we just met" to "like family to me" in 15 minutes, with no indication if in-game time flies differently from player real-time or not. A lot of plot threads get hinted at as being important and grand, but then just kinda resolve in the most disappointingly boring way possible.\nGameplay-wise, it's also pretty badly put together. Combat has some nice ideas, but they never work properly. You constantly find a lot of crafting stuff and money, but there's almost never a need to buy anything and best weapons and armor for the chapter (of which there are 3) are available from the start, so when you can just wait to find or buy best possible stuff you need, upgrade it in the best way you need and play out the rest of the chapter without ever caring about it again. So, by the end of the game you have tons of money and stuff you don't need at all. Skill system is also rather weridly done, as the most useful skills are in the combat tree and by the end of the game you'll have enough points to max out it and about a quarter of another skill tree, so focusing on anything else feels like a waste. And one of the trees is not even available until the second chapter. And companions are useful only for diverting attention from you, but useless otherwise. Also, there is a morality system, which simply doesn't work. Or, more specifically, it seems that I did finish the game as a best guy ever, since merchants talked about giving me a discount (which is a feat for being "good"), but in-game menu always showed me as "neutral" and "good" feats were showing as locked.\nIt is a shame, though, really, since there are some nice ideas here and there and the game world seemed to have been put some thought into. Game also looks quite good, with its own distinct colorful style. But the game is so underwhelming and frustrating and most of the time simply boring, that it's hard for me to recommend it. Unless there's a big story RPG itch you have, and you can't scratch it with countless better games.

It's like played bioware games, thought they ROCKED, and then didn't realize what they liked about them.  The combat's also pretty underwhelming.  It's a brawler (in the vein of Sleeping Dogs, just without the combos or useful interface) which would be fine, except for this terrible ability every enemy has; the ability to not take damage. Every so often, usually when you're doing well, they'll choose to jump back and avoid all of your damage.\n\nThis is a pretty big deal since there's no way to counter it (even if they're already against a wall) and you're usually against a large group of competant enemies.  Choosing to attack an enemy is a risky decision since they can all suddenly start tearing through you at any moment.  It's not even an issue of difficulty, it's an issue of poor design.  You're forced to spend most of each encounter rolling around waiting for your technopowers to recharge\n\nStory - I feel like there could have been a really cool story here.  From what I gathered, it's based on a cool idea of corporate warfare on an unforgiving planet and the effects that can have on a population.  The problem is that the game does NOTHING with any of this.  It's like they start the game right after the end of a really cool game.  No part of the story is really explained beyond "these are the bad guys because just trust me" moments.  I mean, the whole first act of the game seems to only happen because of the main character's impatience.   I actually had to stop playing at the end of the second act because I was given a choice to make and realized that I had NO idea what anyone was talking about or trying to accomplish.\n\nActing - I feel like it's important to be forgiving here; how many indie studios could talented voice actors? It's entirely possible that it was just the developers.  To their credit, there are some characters that are voiced in a perfectly acceptable fashion.  They're even able to give emotion!  The problem is that most of those characters are pretty throwaway.  The MAIN cast, on the other hand, all sound ridiculous.  Either they're "bad ♥♥♥ female roles" that sound like 7 year olds or they're the protagonist who, oh my god, has not changed his tone once through the entire game.\n\nWorld Design - Like I said before, they really could have done a lot here. I mean, a dystopian, cyberpunk world set on MARS?  Instead they just made everything orange and dirty.  I actually had to rely on my map to get anywhere because the areas were so confusing and samey.  I also said this before, but nothing you do changes anything and there are only like ten characters that say anything in the whole game.\n\nRPG Elements - Pretty lack luster.  The progression trees mostly just boost damage or give uninteresting boosts like being able to react faster after being hit.  Then there's the feat system that gives four types of boosts; increased xp from enemies, increased loot from enemies, more crafting options (crafting's mostly just for upgrading your gear), and better stuff from recycling gear.  There are also some perks from the morality system but the only ones that are useful come from being a bad guy (the good guy perks involve slightly decreased prices from merchants which you NEVER use and increased damage/health for your companion, which is probably just going to stand there being hit anyway).\n\nAchievements - Nothing too hard, but it's worth mentioning that there's an achievement for doing all the side quests.  They're pretty finicky and will actually become unavailable if you do them in the wrong order.\n\nFinal Thoughts - I love when indie devs take on something that's probably more than they can chew; it shows they're driven!  So, for the first four hours I managed to ignore a bunch of the flaws with the game.  It wasn't until the end of the first act when a character who had no reason to die was killed purely to create dramatic tension (and failed to do so, by the way) that it really clicked with me that there was something actually WRONG with the game.  I can't really recommend this game, but I'd suggest you keep an eye on this development team; this game was bad, but it seems like a step in the right direction.","June 27, 2014","false","7.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Especially if you like studying games from a design standpoint. As a full (even if low) price story driven action RPG, Mars: War Logs isn't very good.\nStory never picks up, partially because of a rather bad translation, partially because everything in the game is fit into very claustrophobic locations and it's hard to take anything seriously. Characters go from "we just met" to "like family to me" in 15 minutes, with no indication if in-game time flies differently from player real-time or not. A lot of plot threads get hinted at as being important and grand, but then just kinda resolve in the most disappointingly boring way possible.\nGameplay-wise, it's also pretty badly put together. Combat has some nice ideas, but they never work properly. You constantly find a lot of crafting stuff and money, but there's almost never a need to buy anything and best weapons and armor for the chapter (of which there are 3) are available from the start, so when you can just wait to find or buy best possible stuff you need, upgrade it in the best way you need and play out the rest of the chapter without ever caring about it again. So, by the end of the game you have tons of money and stuff you don't need at all. Skill system is also rather weridly done, as the most useful skills are in the combat tree and by the end of the game you'll have enough points to max out it and about a quarter of another skill tree, so focusing on anything else feels like a waste. And one of the trees is not even available until the second chapter. And companions are useful only for diverting attention from you, but useless otherwise. Also, there is a morality system, which simply doesn't work. Or, more specifically, it seems that I did finish the game as a best guy ever, since merchants talked about giving me a discount (which is a feat for being "good"), but in-game menu always showed me as "neutral" and "good" feats were showing as locked.\nIt is a shame, though, really, since there are some nice ideas here and there and the game world seemed to have been put some thought into. Game also looks quite good, with its own distinct colorful style. But the game is so underwhelming and frustrating and most of the time simply boring, that it's hard for me to recommend it. Unless there's a big story RPG itch you have, and you can't scratch it with countless better games. Like Rise of the Argonauts, for example, which is actually a better game.","March 24, 2014","false","11.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There are many much better examples in this genre. I got the game in a bundle, so I can't moan too much, but would not buy it outright.\n\nI recall many games that looked a bit like this from my youth. Linear, slightly blocky textures, lots of running about and terse dialogue. Even the voice acting reminds me of those games, and the 8 hours of this I played reflect the nostalgia trip I was on. However, the lack of any real depth just had too great an impact, and I found myself dreading loading it up. That's when you know it's time to move this from the pile of shame in to plain old "not interested" category.\n\nThe story and characters are crudely drawn stereotypes, possibly done in crayon on the back of a happy meal napkin. That would actually be ok if the quest design was decent (again, like the golden era games I remember), but there is nothing but grind...run here, give this, kill that, run back. Another quest, and oh look, it's over where I just was, 15 minutes away through a maze of tunnels and streets. I found myself not caring enough about any of the people, or the world itself, to want to slog through this to find out what happens. The dialogue and quest branches are highly misleading, as are the on-screen dialogue prompts, so in as much as you have a choice about anything it is frequently routed in a direction you did not intend.\n\nUnfortunately, the potentially very cool technomancy and martian survival story (warring water companies are an interesting twist on an old formula) are left to the back seat in favour of following the personal stories of two of the most boring characters ever invented. "Roy", a possibly bipolar schizophrenic with violent tendancies and an inability to explain even his basic thoughts without a drawn out monologue ("Hmm, there's a door here. I think it's closed...yep, locked. Darn! Maybe later I can pick it or get someone to open it. Then I could go through, hmm, see what's in there. Because now it's locked, and won't open."). And then there's "Innocence", which is so on-the-nose it's silly...he's about to be ♥♥♥♥♥ in prison when Roy comes in and saves him (by beating everything to death with a heavy pipe). Innocence is the reflection of his name, and we're supposed to go on the journey with him more than Roy, though Roy is the player character, as he gradually becomes more grown up, whilst still anchoring Roy to his humanity. It makes for terrible, terrible dialogue, and really, they probably both deserve to perish in the wastes.\n\nTechnically, the game is very average, with a dodgy-ish but functional combat system, limited enemy variation, a dull skill progression tree, and extremely linear environments (after the first prison level, everything is quite small as well, possibly rushed out given the number of invisible walls and empty dead ends. The crafting is menu driven, and depends on random pick ups. It's finicky, but ok functionally...but again, essentially pretty boring and tacked-on so they could put "crafting" down as a tag for the game.\n\nSo overall, a disappointing experience. It seems the developer is launching a new game about post-apocalyptic Mars and Technomancers...seems basically identical in the premise. I would research it carefully before picking it up...and not bother at all with this one.","May 28","false","8.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Even though cyberpunk is very hard to classify and provide any rules to make it so, this game is not cyberpunk. post apocalytic, yes. and though it is said to be on Mars any planet would have done as earth was mentioned once or twice in passing and could have been completely left out. This could have taken place on Earth and it would not have made any diffference if the mentioning of being on Mars was left out.\n\nThe description also states water drives a company war. No mention of attaining water is present, only the acquiring of power lost since the cataclysm. So, no part of the description is accurate. Except maybe the part of being a RPG. RPG-Lite, yes. With a very basic and limited crafting system to upgrade weapons and armor you can still have some variety in how you upgrade these items. Basic but nice.\n\nThe Feats are not that creative but the Skills and the associated trees give a decent variety to choose from and also provide some replayability. this is good because to get 100% acheivement you will have to replay twice. once on the second hardest difficulty and once on the hardest. you will also need to choose either the resistance or a general trying to overthrow the government. different choice will give a different ending which is good.\n\nAfter about 18 hours played once through I will at some point revisit the game. Not to get the 100% but because I enjoyed it. I didn't expect to because as other reviews state it suffers from Bad to very, very, very bad camera controls along with some questionable voice acting and written dialogue. a few times I laughed at how bad it was but there are some characters that are voiced awesome and have great dialogue to make up for the bad ones.\n\nAll that said I would tell anyone about this game and how surprisingly good it is. Maybe the secret to my enjoyment was expecting a horrible experience. Far from my expectations. I look Forward to the next game I just learned is entitled Technomancer and hopefully will be out soon.","September 11, 2015","true","18.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The story takes place in a gritty, dystopian, almost post-apoc setting and spans 3 chapters. There are a lot of sidequests and character interactions, and the game tends to alternate between big open areas and linear levels, which in my opinion provided a nice change pace.\n\nPerhaps what I liked the most was the levelling and the combat. The fighting was incredibly fun, a little awkward at first, but easy to get used to. And the customization of your weapon and armour is great. You get to find various tools and crafting parts that you can use on your gear to give it additional bonuses of your choice. The levelling had 3 different mastery trees - combat, renegade (support abilities like healing and stealth), and technomancy (electrical powers). The levelling happened very frequently, which was great too, since you didn't have to wait for ages to get to the skills you've had your eyes on.\n\nThe story and setting are pretty interesting. I personally found chapters 1 and 2 to be brilliant, but chapter 3 fell flat on its face. It almost felt as though the game was rushed at the end. What was most interesting perhaps is how at the end of chapter 2 you get a choice of split paths to join one of the 2 factions, which changes some things in chapter 3, but ultimately you end up visiting the exact same locations regardless of which faction you go with. The premise of split paths for the final chapter is fantastic, but the execution resulted in a diluted experience. Going with the Resistance at least was a half-decent attempt at a conclusion that presented some more moral choices down the line. But going with the general felt like it was added into the game at the very last minute just for the sake of having this split path feature.\n\nThe game also had 3 romance options in it, but this too felt rather lacking and devoid of much dialogue. A few other NPCs felt like they should've gotten more screen time than they actually did, like the bounty hunter friend of the main character. But apart from that, most characters were rather interesting.\n\nOverall I'd recommend this game. It's a decent sci-fi cyberpunk RPG and I was immersed for the duration of playing it, even going as far as trying out both story paths for its somewhat disappointing conclusion.","March 19, 2015","true","13.6"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","3"

I had hoped this game would fill a small chunk of time with a decent RPG, and I wasn't expecting much really. However, I was expecting something better than this. The game itself doesn't look all too pretty, even on highest settings. The voice acting is really, really bad, and the characters themselves are really hard to take seriously (Of course the kid named Innocence has to almost get ♥♥♥♥♥ by a guy named Fatty...). When you have a character that is so driven to kill you that she abandoned her order, almost get herself killed, then gets saved by you and realizing you're not the monster she thought (with little to no insistence from yourself) you may think that yes, she may decide to join with you. What I don't expect is for her to wake up, spend 30 seconds in your presence (that's not an exaggeration), then offer to paint the taint with you since you are her new mentor. It wholeheartedly broke any respect for future character development I had for this game. Moving on, the back story is very poorly conveyed, the description states that water is scarce and wars are being fought over it, but I never heard mention of water once. The crafting system seems minimal, and the levels themselves feel like they are empty, even though NPC's meander about before you. I will say the combat system does feel similar to the Witcher, but isn't nearly as fluid or responsive. All in all I wasn't impressed. It's not a terrible, mind numbing experience, but it didn't hold my attention long enough to finish it. And to be honest that rarely happens.","August 21, 2014","false","28.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I had hoped this game would fill a small chunk of time with a decent RPG, and I wasn't expecting much really. However, I was expecting something better than this. The game itself doesn't look all too pretty, even on highest settings. The voice acting is really, really bad, and the characters themselves are really hard to take seriously (Of course the kid named Innocence has to almost get ♥♥♥♥♥ by a guy named Fatty...). When you have a character that is so driven to kill you that she abandoned her order, almost get herself killed, then gets saved by you and realizing you're not the monster she thought (with little to no insistence from yourself) you may think that yes, she may decide to join with you. What I don't expect is for her to wake up, spend 30 seconds in your presence (that's not an exaggeration), then offer to paint the taint with you since you are her new mentor. It wholeheartedly broke any respect for future character development I had for this game. Moving on, the back story is very poorly conveyed, the description states that water is scarce and wars are being fought over it, but I never heard mention of water once. The crafting system seems minimal, and the levels themselves feel like they are empty, even though NPC's meander about before you. I will say the combat system does feel similar to the Witcher, but isn't nearly as fluid or responsive. All in all I wasn't impressed. It's not a terrible, mind numbing experience, but it didn't hold my attention long enough to finish it. And to be honest that rarely happens.","August 21, 2014","false","28.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Meanwhile, some of his co-thugs take up formation behind him, partially blocking the way leading wherever our hero wants to go. Cutscene ends, and there we go.\nOne of the lesser thugs attacks our hero. It's a short fight, only lengthened by our hero's realization that staying in block stance causes him to take no damage, and the thug to keep tirelessly hitting him. Meanwhile, our shy friend picked up a metal pipe, but doesn't want to do anything with it. We click the thug with our metal bludgeon until he falls to the ground.\nThe thug leader then says something to scare us. Now another lesser thug is facing us, the only one with a health bar above him. The rest of the band is standing as a group, taking on the important role of the audience. The one up for fight seems scared, pointing his dagger at us. Standing there.\nStill standing.\nThe tension is incredible, as our hero, facing such danger, waits a few moments to see if the thug means business.\nBut when nothing happens, Hero Guy tries to walk on towards his destination. He reaches the band of thugs, all seemingly cheering on the "fight", looking entertained, facing the empty middle of the yard. The rhythm of the Mars War Drums loops on from some unseen radio, as our hero silently walks between the thugs who seem not to notice him. But he can't go far: an invisible wall is preventing him from moving on. He seems to be very frustrated by this, as this causes him to perform a strange running excercise while remaining in place. He gets angry, swinging his bludgeon at all the standing thugs, who seem to be entirely unaffected.\nHero then goes back to the dagger-pointing man with the red bar above him. This man doesn't seem to want trouble. Hero stands up close, letting the daggered arm pierce through his upper torso, unfliching. Nothing happens. After a while our hero gets too frustrated by being magically locked in with these entirely inactive brutes, and swings his bludgeon at dagger guy. This guy seems to parry everything, and not attack at all, no matter what. Ah, apparently he's the tutorial (we disabled tutorials in the settings menu) for our hero's "block break" ability. He will parry our heavy bludgeon (exhaust pipe part? not sure) with his dagger every single time, taking no damage, unless we kick or punch him first, disorienting him. The block break doesn't do any damage, our hero can kick and punch the guy across the room ten times with no effect. The extremely advanced combination of kick and bludgeon hit however seems to do the trick, dagger guy falls quickly.\nThe next generic thug is sent towards us. He actually wants to hurt us, and can, unless we're standing in block stance. Our hero runs to the other end of the yard, the thug takes a few seconds to notice, swinging at air first. This one can be disoriented by the block break, or the pocket sand abilities.\nThen the leader thug comes at us, along with one of his friends, relatively quickly killing our hero. Thus ends our Martian career as a... who knows what?\n\nFights in this game can be very challenging to survive, but I didn't find them interesting at all, rather quite frustrating. Yes, this first fight scene was clearly meant as a gradual introduction to more difficult enemies, but I just couldn't take any of it seriously. The scene completely broke immersion for me with way the characters acted and the way the scene was rigged to show us basic combat movements without any regard to believable characters.\nAnd there are the other problems.\nThe game pauses while you select the ability to use, and if it requires aiming, well, you're out of luck, your gun will be fired in the direction you were standing before pausing. Same with thrown weapons. Climbing a ledge is a slow cutscene, with your comrades teleporting to behind you after you're done. Animations are rough, collision detection is terrible.\nCharacters stare with empty looks on their faces most of the time. Dialogues are extremely slow-paced, over-stretched, full of unnecessary pauses. After a dialogue, you might see a long, slow camera pan to our hero. The game starts with a long monologue by the shy kid about how war is bad. Then we enter an attempted sexual abuse scene, distrupted only by our gruff, silent hero, about whom we know nothing. The kid looks at him with doe eyes, but those eyes are the same all the time.\nThe gameplay consists of a lot of looting, collecting scrap metal, and doing quests for vending machine-like characters. There are moral choices sometimes, the very first one being the following questionable situation (after we "stop the shower sexual abuse"): the kid thanks us. Here we have the option to say "don't mention it", "you're welcome", or "I just wanted to keep you for myself!". What a great moral conundrum there!\n\nDidn't have the strength to play it much more. Sorry for the rant, thanks for reading. Have a nice day.","September 30, 2015","false","2.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Not Mars: War Logs. You must sell everything one by one, even if you have fifty of them. Enjoy!\n\nCrafting objects that are way more expensive then just buying them: To craft a health injection costs 20 serum, to buy one costs 8. Do the math.\n\nPutting sick plates on your dusty clothes: Now you can look like an awesome post-apocalyptic warrior, or maybe you can look like Kevin Costner in The Postman.\n\nActually fighting: When you aren't busy gophering, crafting, and getting lulled into a rage-coma by the silly acting and storytelling, you can beat enemies with improvised weapons. Yes, we are far into the future, but due to apparent reason guns, laser swords, and fun weapons don't exist in this sparse world. You get to beat up on your enemy with light fixtures and mole creature bones.\n\nPros of Mars: War Logs: You will be momentarily distracted from all the evil in this world by this catastrophe. You will get to practice your digital gymnastic skills (except for jumping, because why jump over things when you can roll right past them?).\n\nCons: Playing Mars: War Logs is a lot like playing Solitare. It's basically a way to tell your friends and family that you are exceptionally bored and have nothing on your plate at the moment. It's inviting people to give you a menial task to do, much like the NPCs in Mars: War Logs.

The game is pretty decent, and once you figure out the combat problems and techniques (yes, problems), it's a decent play.  However, the ovewhelmingly big issue is technomancy.  Everyone in the game world talks about technomancers like they are gods.  You turn out to be one and can use these powers.  Except you will NEVER be able to use these powers.  They are amazingly slow, so there is no way you can ever use them in a fight, other than if there is a single opponent who is focused on your companion, and at that point you may as well just club them instead.  They missed a huge opportunity with this massive design flaw to allow you to play different styles of character.  This continues through the other combat options as well, they simply are not designe well enough to allow for anything other than one style of play, when there could be 3 easily.  So, if you ignore technomacny entirely, never waste skill points on it, never try to use it, just focus on grenades, sneaking, and melee as your main points of combat (the occaisional trap and nail gun attack are fine too), then it's a decent play.  Unfortunately the other major flaw is that side quests never show objective markers like main quests, so that's pretty frustrating as well.  Get it on 60% off or more sale, it's not worth paying full price, and there are probably more enjoyable games to blow time on.","January 24, 2015","false","6.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/warblingdeltoid/recommended/232750/","warblingdeltoid","Tom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/warblingdeltoid/","374 products in account","It's hard whether to reccomend Mars: War Logs or not.\n\nThe reason for this being it is flawed. It's not subtly flawed, it's in your face flawed. From the cringe inducing script, the abysmal voice acting, the weak plot, the dated graphics and the subpar combat it's a shambles.\n\nOr it should be a shambles, Mars: War Logs has a certain charm to it. I particulary liked the enviroment which, even with dated graphics, sucked me into the world. The rusted shacks, the red mars sky/floor, the seedy corridors, the trash all over the place. It really does convince me that this world is in a turmoil. Another thing I liked are the characters involved, although they could've been much better with more fleshing out and a better script. I can't really make myself symphathise with them much because there isn't enough time spent with them. I'm asked to make a choice between two groups of people after meeting with them once? That is poor.\n\nNow onto the gameplay since it is a video game. The combat reminds me of The Witcher, so naturally it's enjoyable. It isn't nearly as polished as The Witcher's combat but then again it is hard to top that. The crafting was a fun edition to the game as well, however there's limited choice of materials and there aren't as many items to craft as I hoped there would be sadly. The reputation system is nice, be a ♥♥♥♥ and you can intimidate people is something I liked from Mass Effect so I'm glad to see it here. The skill tree system is great, again it's like The Witcher, and there's many skills to upgrade which means there will be some replayability available since you can't possibly upgrade them all. There's not much questing in this game, so it's a short affair despite being an RPG. The world, whilst great, isn't nearly large enough which again means there's a larger limit on game time. If the developers had made larger areas and filled it with more quests this game could easily add a few more hours onto playtime.\n\nI have no complaints about the music, but there's nothing to really compliment either. It just does it's job without standing out.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm going to reccomend this game. It may be heavily flawed, but for the price I bought it for £2.99 I felt it was worth the money. So pick it up on sale, or if you're an RPG fanatic who's got the itch for a new game pick it up now.","March 20, 2014","true","9.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Not Mars: War Logs. You must sell everything one by one, even if you have fifty of them. Enjoy!\n\nCrafting objects that are way more expensive then just buying them: To craft a health injection costs 20 serum, to buy one costs 8. Do the math.\n\nPutting sick plates on your dusty clothes: Now you can look like an awesome post-apocalyptic warrior, or maybe you can look like Kevin Costner in The Postman.\n\nActually fighting: When you aren't busy gophering, crafting, and getting lulled into a rage-coma by the silly acting and storytelling, you can beat enemies with improvised weapons. Yes, we are far into the future, but due to apparent reason guns, laser swords, and fun weapons don't exist in this sparse world. You get to beat up on your enemy with light fixtures and mole creature bones.\n\nPros of Mars: War Logs: You will be momentarily distracted from all the evil in this world by this catastrophe. You will get to practice your digital gymnastic skills (except for jumping, because why jump over things when you can roll right past them?).\n\nCons: Playing Mars: War Logs is a lot like playing Solitare. It's basically a way to tell your friends and family that you are exceptionally bored and have nothing on your plate at the moment. It's inviting people to give you a menial task to do, much like the NPCs in Mars: War Logs.

I used the XBOX 360 controller to play the game.\n\nI can only recommend the game on sale, and if you don’t have any high expectations. You might be disappointed otherwise, like I was. I was more disappointed in the plot and characters as I got nearer to the end of the game.\n\nMars: War Logs (MWL) starts off great but will eventually fall flat and dull, with boring characters, story, and environments. RPG elements are great, and combat gets more interesting if you invest the points wisely. MWL looks good on top that helps immersion, unfortunately on closer inspection npcs and the environment look rough around the edges. MWL has a very linear corridor setup for you to travel around, and visually the game gets very repetitive.\n\nMWL does start with an interesting story, and characters. Mars itself has a robust background that really helps create immersion in the game, the same can be said for the characters, but it doesn’t last. The story feels uninspired nearer the end of the game, and characters feel rushed, flat, and placed to connect the plot. This is a shame because Spiders have done a really good job in creating the universe you play in, they just couldn’t hold it up.\n\nYour introduction to the protagonist, Roy Temperance is a little odd, as he doesn't react to the situation he’s in. He just stands there in silence, and the gang leader he’s confronting has a one way conversation with him. I understand that maybe the reason for this was to make Roy a blank canvas, so you could shape his personality with the conversation lines you pick. However they missed a good opportunity to introduce the conversation mechanic. You can also further shape Roy by either abandoning fallen enemies or killing them at the end of a fight, the payoff is more serum, serum is the game currency as well as a craftable for medicine.\n\nLike a lot of action games the fighting doesn’t get interesting till you unlock certain skills that compliment your play style. The same could be said for MWL, because when you unlock the technomancer skill set, the combat is a lot more fun. You can plan your skill advancements by looking at the locked skills, this really helped gain the skills I wanted on level up.\n\nFor everything the combat does right, it does something wrong as well, but at least it gives you options. You can go solo or go along with a side kick. You can control your buddy’s fighting style with defensive/attack nearest/ranged/or same as, but you can’t share items and tell them to use them or certain attacks, also you can’t heal them. Not being able to heal your party member will mean that they could fall during the fight. Mashing buttons won’t help you either, this will end up queuing the next selection while the current action is played out, a little thought and planning is vital to fights. There is the option to go in stealthy and hide enemies to avoid alerting others, your success may depend on your skill unlocks. Combat isn’t helped by bad camera angles, that can have you fighting off screen till it resets or you move it.\n\nFrom an RPG aspect a lot of game mechanics and details were added that really benefit the game. You can craft upgrades for your melee weapon or clothing, your conversation choices will affect the person you become and the reactions by npcs. Levelling up will give you skill points to use for combat, and in the trait selection. The trait selection offers an additional boost to non combat things such as looting and crafting. Cutscenes can be skipped as well. All these little elements enrich the gameplay and were thought out by an experienced dev team with gaming experience.\n\nVisually MWL looks good on top then degrades the further down you go. Roy Temperance, has a lot of detail and looks good. However thing start to look a little worse when you get to npcs and the environment itself. MWL really needed some variety in how it looks, the change in environment was occasional, but still bland at best.\n\nHopefully one daySpiders will  revisit Mars, they really do have an impressive backstory with a lot of potential to do more with, especially with the technomancy.\n","December 7, 2014","false","15.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The Left Stick controls movement, it also makes you go into a stealth crouch, in combat, when you are trying to dodge around enemies, you sometimes wind up motionless in a stealth crouch, while the enemies beat up on you and you cannot respond.\n\nAlot of combat revolves around dodging behind enemies to hit their weak spot, but oftentimes the dodge is slow to react or you dodge in the completely opposite way to the direction in which you intended to dodge.\n\nThe camera, while being quite jerky also seems quite close to your characters back, so it inhibits you from having a decent view of your surroundings, so when you are trying to follow the really childish and useless map, you spend alot of time trying to find a decent view of the area to see where you need to go.\n\nGraphics are servicable, but they can be quite bland, which at times makes differentiating where you can and cannot go a bit of a chore.\n\nStory is pretty decent, but the voice acting robs it of any intensity, the characters dont seem to care, which kind of rubs on to you after awhile, so you dont really care either. The characters names are quite bizarrre, but the main bad guy being called Sean doesnt tend to instill any sense of dread, but I guess it's not as bad as the names of the rest of the characters.\n\nI had to stop playing, I got sick of fighting the camera and the controls, the story gave me no motivation to ignore these factors, I got the game really cheap, (maybe 3-4 quid) and I still feel cheated.","September 2, 2014","false","7.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Try to play it like a hack & slash and you will die endlessly.\n\nCurrently, it has its share of tiny errors that can be easily missed if players aren't looking for them.\nTo avoid bugs/glitches, update your computer's graphics controller, audio controller, and verify the integrity of game cache before playing.\n\nComputer: Compaq Presario CQ57-439WM Notebook PC\nOperating System: Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit\nGamepad: Logitech Dual Action w/Logitech Profiler\n\nIn-Depth Review:\n//Level Design\nThe level design is so well thought out that the entire world feels expansive and every location feels like what it is. Mole caves feel like enclosed spaces with only one exit. Shadowlair feels like a city full of life and people going about their lives even if they aren't happy to be alive. The structures above Roy and the paths he isn't allowed to take, even though they are right in front of him, all make the world feel existent.\nAn hour into the game, the level design reminded me of Phantom Dust. Fourteen hours later, it still did. This isn't a negative trait in the slightest.\n\n//Combat\nCombat is challenging, but simple. Attack, guard-break, block, counter, and dodge make up the basic maneuvers. What players spend their skill points on after leveling-up make up the fun part.\nExcluding boss fights, players can flee to the next area of a level to skip combat altogether. This could lead to a need for grinding as the game progresses, unfortunately.\nThe response time prevents button mashing since doing so will prevent players from making the quick decisions that are a constant part of combat. There's basically a half-second delay for every movement Roy makes.\nParty members can hold their own, but not for very long. Their main purpose is to distract enemies while the Roy eliminates as many as he can before they inevitably fall unconscious. They cannot be healed by the player, but their health is fully restored at the end of every battle. This system forces players to engage in combat rather than hide and adds an invisible timer set to how long they have until every conscious enemy gangs up on them. Yep.\n\n>Technomancy\nThe Technomancer skill tree is a worthy investment due to how fun and powerful it is. Too many enemies? Electric Arc. A single enemy with a high armor rating? Charged Weapon. Feeling overwhelmed? Energy Shield. The more you experiment, the more fun you'll have.\n\n>Stealth\nStealth is worth investing in for players who prefer not to go on all-out frontal assaults and enjoy thinning out the enemy first. There are some very tricky levels where playing as a stealth-based character becomes a challenge, but figuring out who to eliminate first and when to do so is part of the fun. Enemies are alerted by fallen comrades and will alert others if players don't quiet them quickly enough. Only further down the Renegade skill tree can players invest in hiding fallen enemies from sight.\nParty members stay in place and out the way until Roy exits from stealth mode. Since a patrolling enemy can still spot them, players can push party members wherever they want by running into them.\n\n//Boss Fights\nTo my recollection, there are six challenging boss fights in the game. None felt misplaced or thrown in.\n\nMy only complaint is that, at the final level of the game, there should have been an actual boss fight before the endscene. One or two powerful technomancers that Roy and/or Mary knew from their past would have done the trick.\n\n//Quests\nThere are more than enough non-mandatory side quests that get players more engulfed in the game world. Not a single quest is dull and pointless. All bring the world together and add character to its many inhabitants.\nQuest can go anywhere from helping ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and mutants to stopping serial killers and spying on a political figure. Get ready for some odd situations you may not have been prepared for.\n\n//Party Members\nThe party members are interesting characters with their own motives, back-stories, and personalities. Personal favorite: Mary. She will say the darnest, hilarious, and most sad things.\nPlayers get a choice between three female love interests and gain five party members total. Only four of these five are available for each playthrough, however, and only one is allowed to accompany Roy at a time.\nParty members actually comment on Roy's decisions (serum extraction and dialogue) every now and then. Those moments help breath life into his character and theirs.\n\n//Dialogue\nConversations are well written and funny. There are even references here and there.\nPlayers get different options of what to say to NPC's. Some choices will cause Roy to engage in combat and others will cause him to evade it.\nGet ready for some hilarious conversations.\nThanks to the dialogue, I've found myself caring about the characters I met throughout the game. This really backfired when people died.\n\n//Ending\nI enjoyed the Aurora ending cutscenes I got, especially the last one.\n\nThe endlevel, on the other hand, was lacking in impact. I may have gotten the impression that this was it, but the lack of dialogue during the entire level made it similar to a non-boring grind without the need to level up.\nI'll give Spiders this much, they were successful in making a grinding level that was entertaining and barely felt like a grind. Unfortunately, they did not give it thrill, impact, or emotion.\nThe dialogue between Roy and his follower at the end was great, though. Just one more moment like or leading up to that beforehand would have done the trick for me.\n\nEven having Honour	 speaking out loud about the 'endboss', and adding backstory in the process, would have tremendously helped players care about what happened next. It would have also helped us understand the choice that was made in the first endscene.\nIt's a matter of character depth. More was given in the endscene for Honour and the 'endboss', but not quite enough. For me, the 'endboss' was the only character who lacked depth. All we really got were the reasons for said character's actions, which make sense and explain his/her villainy.\n\nOther than the lack of impact and a boss, the endlevel was perfectly fine.\n\n//Others\nPlayers must choose one of two factions (Resistance or Aurora) two-thirds of the way through the game. Both come with their own female party member / love interest.\n\nThere are multiple opportunities to end some NPC's lives outside of extracting Serum from defeated foes. This includes resolving conflicts for quests and actually killing one of the potential party members either directly or by abandonment.\n\nSerum extracting isn't necessary unless players want to do a 'Dark Side' playthrough, which affects the merchants' prices, intimidation skills of the player, and reactions of party members.\n\nThe actual war logs used in the game is a nice touch. It adds first person perspective immersion for those who are interested. Think of the journal from the Elder Scrolls series or, more accurately, Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magick Obscura.\nThere's even a bestiary that includes NPCs and locations.\n\nThe main menu and combat menu are both very well designed. It took me some time to remember which menu tab (equipment, stats, etc) had what, though.\n\nWeapon, armor, item, and component crafting adds an extra layer of strategy to the game. There are no wrong combinations. It all comes down to what works best for your play style.","December 1, 2013","true","31.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgthopsthefag/recommended/232750/","sgthopsthefag","It's 2016. Get With The Times.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgthopsthefag/","235 products in account","This game is a great example of what happens when a developer sets his ambition way too high, and creates something that he is not capable of creating. He might have had great ideas, but because his skill was not that great, he ended up creating something of mediocre worth rather than a grand masterpiece. And what a shame it is, because this game did indeed have some potential.\n\nGameplay wise, it is essentially Witcher 2 combined with Mass Effect, but without any of the things that made both games great. Much of the choices that you make don't really matter, and the morality system is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, as all the bonuses that it gives you don't really help at all, nor does the morality system majorly change the way people look at you. The bonus that you get for being a man with an excellent reputation doesn't help due to how useless your NPC party members are, thanks to the fact that the AI in the game for party members sucks ♥♥♥ and due to how quickly they die. Merchants are pretty useless unless you are trying to complete certain plot related quests that involve giving serum (money) to NPCs by selling off ♥♥♥♥ you don't need or are in need of serum for making meds to use in combat. You can pretty much get a lot of the items you need by looting enemies or by finding some junk piles or crates that are put across the map. Speaking of serum, it is admittedly an interesting kind of currency, but as mentioned before, it's only really useful for those two things, and just like most items, you loot it from crates and enemies. The way you loot it from enemies though is usually through a serum extractor, which apparently kills some guy who should already be dead after being beaten mercilessly by a pipe with a cleaver, and using the serum extractor on a guy who should have already been dead by now also lowers your reputation. Like that totally makes any sense. Had it not been for the skill level cap of three instead of two, it would have been safe to say that the game's skill tree system is an exact rip off of Witcher 2's skill tree. Now, character building is one of the better things about this game, but sadly there still are a couple of problems. For instance, the renegade skill tree has skills that suppossedly help improve the stealth in this game, but stealth is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing useless thanks to how poorly it's implemented. I know Witcher 2 has some questionable stealth as well, but at least that game didn't have you go out of stealth mode after attempting to knock out an enemy or had skills in the skill tree related to a mechanic that was pretty much pointless. The perk system is also pretty stupid. Do X amount of things several times and you can then wait till you level up a few times in order to get X amount of Character Perk Points just to purchase X perk. Why not give the perk after doing X thing several times, or do what the Fallout series does, and give out a perk every few levels. Some perks are also tied to your morality level, which is something that I find to be really stupid. Not being able to use charismatic and intimidative dialogue choices unless your character is (or was at one point) with a good or bad rep shows that the game's view on morality is worse than that of an elementary schooler. Of course, as mentioned before, most of your choices do jack ♥♥♥♥, so what's the point anyways? Combat is pretty much ripped straight from Witcher 2. Everything from the ability to slow down time and switch your skills to the roll n' doge - stab - block gameplay of Witcher 2, with the exception that you can actually heal during combat. It's too bad that the camera can cause you to ♥♥♥♥ up, and although not at the teir of Kingdom Hearts Camera Bad, it still is pretty shoddy. There are also bombs, traps and ranged weapons just like the ones from Witcher 2, but the variety is quite lacking. In fact, you only get one type of trap, one type of gun (a nail gun, which makes me question how they could only have those and not ♥♥♥♥ like machine guns and laser pistols), and one type or bomb. The game also allows you one AI-controlled party member (this is where the Mass Effect elements come in), though you might as well be playing without the AI, because about 95% of the time, I found the AI for party members to be one of the most incompetent things ever, as it dies faster than a still-born baby in the womb, and that's even when you tell it to focus on defense. Not being able to go through your party member's equipment in order to give them better weapons and armor doesn't make it any better. The game is also full of stupid invisible walls, and the enviorments are a bore to explore, as you can only enter places that the game deems important. You cannot even enter a single house that belongs to some random person. The civillian NPCs in the game must be the most ballin' people in the universe, because they don't get scared if you pull out your weapon in front of them! Side quests ♥♥♥♥ing suck, as they are primarilly the same boring fetch quests found in plenty of other RPGs, and their rewards usually aren't worth it. Finally, there's crafting, and cliche as it sounds, crafting is perhaps the game's best feature, though I do find it stupid that you can access the craft screen during battle.\n\n\nBefore I talk about the story, I would like to say that I wouldn't call the setting a cyberpunk one, as it looks more like an apocalyptic low-tech wasteland with some minor cyberpunk and space opera elements rather than a cyberpunk world full of men with cyberarms that act as weapons mowing down corparates from the local mega-corp. Having hi-tech gloves that let you shoot beams of electricity doesn't make it a cyberpunk game either. The game does however have an interesting setting, despite how generic of a setting Mars tends to be. Of course, the game has to have poorly explained lore that is extremely hard to follow, and this is despite the patch that was suppossed to fix a lot of the problems with the script. The characters? I didn't really like any of them, and the way the characters act is so unreal that I highly doubt that anyone could truly care for them. My least favorite charcters would have to either be Roy or Mary. Roy because he's the typical man with a mysterious past type of character, and Mary because she suddenly goes from being this ♥♥♥♥♥ who wants to kill you and hates your guts to this ♥♥♥♥♥ who wants to ♥♥♥♥ you just because you saved her, and she doesn't even have a hint of suspicion about you afterwards.\n\n\nPresentation wise, the game is what you would expect from a small studio. Not too bad, but there could have been way more colours than just orange, red, black and grey. Character designs range from okay to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking, Mary included. Enviorments tend to be boring as hell, and as mentioned before, are not very explorable due to how many invisible walls there are. The music is pretty forgettable as well. Finally, there's the voice acting, and holy ♥♥♥♥ is it bad most of the time. Sometimes, it's actually quite funny, while other times it's cringe worthy, and of course there's always the mixture of the two. Now, I should note that it is better than the voice acting that was in the game at launch, but it still is a long way from being good.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Mars War Logs is average at its best, and mediocre at its worst, and, at least in my opinion, is not worth its current price tag, nor is it an RPG that I would recommend to people looking for a great RPG experience. If, however, you still want to give the game a go, do what I did, and buy it on sale for really cheap. If I had to give it a rating, the most I would give it would be a 5/10.","July 26, 2014","false","9.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Your companions are next to useless, walking pylons at best, and you spend the majority of most battles leaping around the battlefield or blocking a flurry of blows in order not to get stunlocked.  I don't mind a challenge, Darksouls/Demonsouls are difficult games but there you at least feel like you lost a fair fight.  This game is just tedious.\n\nI'm going to refrain from commenting on the story, haven't experienced enough to give it a fair shake.

A few of the quests appear to have some branching paths, which I regard as a good effort, but ultimately aren't really used that effectively and end up being fairly bland.\n\nI might go back and give it another shot at some point, but at the moment I'm glad I only spend $5 on this.","October 15, 2014","false","2.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

We all want to see indie developers with nothing but guts and ambition show the big studios what-for. In this case however, it was just too ambitious for a small team. There's nothing outright offensive about the title, (other than the voice acting... Good God...) but neither is there anything noteworthy. The combat is a bad version of The Witcher 2 with only a few enemy types, the story is a bad version of Red Faction with little nuance and the dialog is... Awful in every way. There's no reason to play this game over the games that inspired it. Then you factor in a forgettable soundtrack, muddy graphics, awkward animations, and limited itemization and I can't really recommend Mars: War Logs to anyone. The highest praise I can give is that the crafting system is unique and highly customizable, but the itemization and combat are so bad that you'd rather just end the game quicker. Here's hoping that Spiders's next game is a hit!","August 9, 2014","false","8.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

You will routinely die after being repetitively teamed up on by enemies. You have mines, grenades, nail guns etc to try to break up the group attacks but it rarely works and you will be over powered again and again by unfair groups of enemies. Your companion, Innocence, is useless, and the character animations used to do something simple like place a mine or throw a grenade are painfully slow and leave you open to attacks that you can't roll away from.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KButz/recommended/232750/","KButz","Butzmansavage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KButz/","285 products in account","This game is a mixed bag.\nThe combat is decent enough, you can acquire a pretty large variety of skills to make unique playstyles.  The enemy's attacks have unusual hitoxes and will whiff if you're too close.  When an enemy takes too much damage at one time, they'll have a kind of "dodge timer" where they will dodge out of the majority of player attacks for set amount of time.  This feels like a lazy way to prevent infinite hitstun from player attacks and can sometimes punish the player for no real reason.\n\nDifficulty scaling is poorly done, enemy's health and damage increases dramatically and possibly activates dodge time more quickly.  Beginning game becomes rather brutal.\n\nPlot takes quite a while to actually develop.  More like 2 plotlines that are loosely connected.\n\nThe hub worlds are alright, although they start to feel more like a chore as the game goes on.\n\nThe equipment and skill management is where this game shines.  Each skill feels like it adds something major to your gameplan without making it feel like you simply "outlevel" encounters.  The equipment modification system is really nice and helps completement your skill build.  But, unfortunately your options are very limited until roughly halfway through the game.","August 9, 2014","false","12.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I understand that I have only play just under 20minets. But just hear me out.\n\nThis game was Relese in 2013. Expectations where high. But i do under stand the RPGs are really big games to build\n\nAs a pc gamer, I was expecting this game to be good from that trailer that Spiders Studios release. But this is where it has taken as complete U-Turn.\n\nPlay with as mouse and keybourd like that majoraty of PC plays. We began this game with as avrage cut scene to get some back story, befoer handed the controls. After going through 5mins of base story that explains who this character taht you will be getting the story through. We meet the character that you play.\n\nStarting out where i can now move it began to fall apart. I can see veay clearly that this game was 100% desihned for a controler not keybourd and mouse. normal that is not a really big problem for me but this game just felt really clunky through all the animation blending and hot the character respoind to the commands.\n\nCombat was very basic only need about 3 keys to fight Strick, Block and Block Breaking. A very simple fighting game style, but I felt it need something more something to stand alone from other RPG's. But saddly i had to stop after finishing of the first guy.\n\nAfter completeing just the little bit I was done.\n\nTexture where very low even on high I can see all the detail in the 512X512 maps. I was hopeing that they would have pushed it a little more.\n\nAnimations Felt like it was on the second pass of the Animation stage and need more time spent on. Considering there are lot of closes ups on faces and the lip sinking was off.\n\nControls really clunky, if going to play it controler you may get better game play.\n\nOver all if your RPG fan maybe try it if you have finished all other games from AAA companys. If your looking to buy it there are a lot better RPGs out there than this one. That is why i would NOT Recommend this on PC.","November 8, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

The environment design is strong, but the game itself is nothing special at all. There is only one type of gun, one type of melee weapon, and combat is very repetitive: dodge, attack, block, counter-attack. There is a crafting system that adds some value to the repetition of looting glowing crates and piles of junk, but it isn't especially robust. The principal voice actor is not strong and subtitles are poorly written. Run-of-the-mill scripting and frequent grammatical errors lead the voice actors to give bad line readings. Voice recording direction seems nonexistant, as they stuck with bad and awkward takes. Some elements just feel erroneous and low-budget; the leg animations for walking are awkward and unrealistic, for example. Legs sort of swing outward and roll forward. Really basic animation elements like these being punted contributes to the unfinished feel. Poor lip-synch and a lack of transition animations between sneaking, walking, slow walking, and sprinting seem to be a function of the low budget and small studio. Overall, this ambitious game does not deliver on its promises, which is really a shame.","November 10, 2014","false","1.1"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

The voice acting was pretty bad, the animations were anything but smooth, and while the graphics aren't bad, they're not good either. All that being said, this is a satisfying game as long as you're not expecting a mind-blowing experience.  You can genuinely feel for some of the characters and the story is very interesting, even though its rather simple. It is apparrent that the developers put all of what they had into this game, it just wasn't enough to make it great. Also as a side note, the combat system is rather frusterating at times but it doea have a satisfying punch behind it.","April 27, 2014","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Renegade being the rogue is very useful compared to many other games. Later on you unlock the Technomancer ability, which is sort of a caster style with lightning. It's pretty steam punk'ish.\n\nIn term of quality, then I'd compare this game with Of Orcs and Men. The graphics, sound etc. are fluid and run extremely well. When starting Mars: War Logs you more or less instantly pop into the menu. The only difference is that this game is somewhat more short, yet quite entertaining.","April 28, 2013","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Equally it has a choice driven story with actions changing the game progression. The combat is pretty fun, although once you have the mechanics down it feels the same every time. Theres also a leveling system although its not as intuitive as it could easily have been, and the explanations of how it works are fairely poor.\nThe game suffers from some very basic visuals, and poor oversight in its development, such as when I spared some people and it stated id killed them in the diary.\nEqually, some points of the plot are very poorly written, to the extent that on the spot you could come up with more feasible dialogue.\nDuring cutscenes or dialogue exchanges you can also notice the seams where bits are played based on your choices, which kind of kills the atmosphere. And the dialogue is very limited, with very few available exchanges or choices.\nPerhaps the most damning fact is the game is brutally short. For the time iv played it i would expect to be no more than a quarter of the way through it. It feels like it could have been so good, and at times you actually become interested in whats going on, but the development is so shallow, and as soon as you find something interesting the game rushes onto something else.\nHad I paid full price, this would be a down vote and id be pretty angry. But given I got it cheap on sale, and that it is a pretty small publisher im pretty happy with it.\nIf you can get it cheap, go for it. Otherwise id avoid it.","April 4, 2014","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You want to like this game\nThe story is good but also bad (thats explained in the bed section)\n\nThe Bad:\nThe combat in this game sucks huge. The timing is off and the UI is clunky. Many time syou will enter combat to find out you have no companion because he/she is stuck in the entrace still.\n-As said above, story is mixed bag of good and bad. Why its that is it makes these huge leaps forward in time with no warning or exlaination. One character literally went from hating me and wanting to kill me, to questioning her faith, to being in love with me, IN ONE CONVERSATION. So you end up doing adouble take and wondering what the hell just happened.\n-Thats the problem, the writers knew where they wanted to take the story, and its a good story, but instead of flowing from start to finish its jump jump jump and often in those juumps your left wondering how such a huge change happened.\n-Maps/zones are quit small in size and because of that you find yourself loading into combat befor eyour compaion joins in\n\nOver all I would give this game a 9/10 on potential\nbut a 5/10 on delivering and meeting potential\nThe concept is sound and appealing\nThey just needed better writers and more back story and lore to discover","December 18, 2015","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(mind peolpe, I'm the kind of person that read every single page of a diary, piece of codex, random book, signs and talk to everyone, even if my character is on fire and the NPC is an anvil, so try to take the critique about the story by the point of viev of a details lover)\n\nSwitching to a more technical side, MWL is a normal RPG, you gain experience by kicking butts, level up and then build you character choosing freely among three branches of specialization.\nThere is also a nice upgrading and crafting system for armor and weapons.\nThe gameplay is actually good when you learn not to freak out because of the game controls, it is similar to what I experienced with The Witcher, when you learn when you are suppose to hit, it goes all nice and smooth.\n\nIn the end I really liked this game, even if some potential on story, lenght and character development was wasted, it offer a nice min10-max15 hours of gaming and some intresting story and characters.\nI actually won't mind if Spiders would pop out a more detailed and longer sequel, the lore they have built is worth further depening.\n\n\n-Please don't mind my "monkey on acid" english-","December 21, 2013","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes the budget may have been like 2 cents and it may have been way too ambitious of a project but the end result is still very much worth checking out. If you are like me and don't really care about all the fluff Bioware has been adding to their games recently, but still like their stories and characters, this game is for you.\n\nImportant note: They got a lot of new voice actors and re did a lot of the bad voice overs. So the annoying voices in the trailers are not actually in the game (although LOL@ Innocence randomly getting a British accent)\n\nPros\n+Story very enjoyable. Not a huge grand adventure but still I found it interesting, and found most characters to actually be pretty good.\n+The setting is amazing and I hope at some point it can be revisited.\n+Visually very beautiful. (Design wise, graphics themselves are ok if you care about that lol)\n+The combat actually has a lot of fun elements to it, and I also enjoyed the character custimization. It doesn't play like most other WRPGs, but I didn't really mind although I know some do.\n+Roy is a preset character whose pretty defined but you still have a lot of flexibility with how he acts in conversations. Compare to auto dialogue mess Shepard from ME3? I'll take Roy/Temperance any day.\n+So many good ideas LOL normally I would not suggest this but a bigger company needs to buy Spiders and give them some $$$ and direction. Once they have those 2 things they could honestly be the new Bioware.\n\nCons\n-The game is small scale. There won't be a billion items to collect or places to explore. A lot of simplified elements but honestly who actually cares? I don't get much out of endlessly exploring desolate areas (Thanks Skyrim for bringing this awful trend back)\n-Combat can be wonky and annoying at times\n-Level design is... not the best. A lot of backtracking around the Jail/City/Other city depending on what act you are in\n\n\nThe game is pretty short which could be a pro or a con. Also I still don't know if I find the virtue names cliche or really interesting. Maybe its best there probably won't be a sequal, I can't imagine there are that many virtues left for them to pick from for new characters lol\n\nEDIT: I LIED A SEQUEL IS COMING LMAO.

The clunkiness includes voice acting, set design, and combat. Sadly, this short play time also means that the characterization of characters was pretty rushed, especially the companion Mary. So, the game could have been longer with better story and characterization or better gameplay, and I'd likely recommend it at full price if that were the case.\n\nWhat I did like was the setting and overall story, which means I'm looking forward to the sort of sequel in the works, Technomancer.  I did have fun with the gameplay more when I got into the full swing of the Techromancer powers. I liked the ability to craft armor, weapons, health packs, explosives, however this could have all been fleshed out more.\n\nI also particularly liked the titular premise, the game being the War Logs of the aptly named character Innocence. I think that shows some storytelling promise from Spiders.\n\nIf they learned from this game, I'm excited to see the results of their sort of sequel, Technomancer.

It's because the story was uninspiring. I lost interest in it about 3/4 of the way through. But there are some redeeming factors in the game:\n1. Boss battles are challenging\n2. The loot is finite which makes crafting ever so important\n3. And finally the combat is very atypical.\n\nThere are no real guns/weapons in the game. You can fashion a nailgun into a weapon but thats the only firearm in the game. However, you can make grenades and mines. You get different types of melee weapons that can be modified to enhance combat and your stats. Your armor is modified in the same way. But the most important combat is done using technomancy which is basically the ability to wield electricity and shockwaves.\n\nThe skilltree is huge and I was only able to fill 2/4 of the branches so choose wisely on your path.\nThe side quests pay very well in experience, but you'll find yourself asking why you accepted this mission (oh right, the XP).\n\nThe ending was very forgetable as were most of the characters.

As a game from a company I know little about I took a gamble and gave it a shot. Glad that I did. The crafting system is actually really cool, the story is already compelling and I am only about an hour and a half in, Good game thus far. Combat is a little clunky but the full controller support is a big plus.\n\nIf you have $20 and looking for something new, this game might be right for you.","May 5, 2013","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, there's high replayability since there are several paths to follow that lead to different endings (altough for that purpose, I highly recommend that you save prior to key conversations, as they do matter a lot in this game and the outcome).\n\nThe thing is... the combat sucks. Like, big time. But if you get hooked by the story, it's bearable and you can get used to it.\n\nThe game's got pretty interesting things actually, it does a good job at imagining a distopian futuristic Mars, and lets you build your hero/antihero with an fair enough skilltree. Not to mention that you can romance someone in it, as long as you're not a ♥♥♥♥ at a specific point in the story.\n\nAll in all, yes I do recommend it BUT keep in mind that the combat is real crap and that the game's a bit rough around the edges. AND buy on sale or bundled only.","May 29","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/232750/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","For whatever reason Mars: War Logs makes me feel like it’s coming from one of those hungry new developers that have something to throw out into the industry and make a noise. Mars: War Logs when going head to head with some of the bigger developers and publishers seems more like a poor man’s answer to Mass Effect. It comes away with a mixed bag of features that if you are not looking for King Lear you may find enough here to keep you entertained amongst the Hodge podge of entertainment values. This sci fi rpg style game has a nice enough mix to it in regards to gaming that players of some of the table top cyberpunk or other sci fi games will find some entertainment here.\n\nMars: War Logs takes place a century after some world changing event. The red planet is in turmoil and war. Water is now the most prized resource causing out right war for its control. In the middle of all this players start out as a prisoner of war. Shipped off to a POW camp the interactions begin to get rather tense here and it is here that you soon discover this is not a game for kids. When they warn of adult content and sexual innuendos they are not kidding. A young character almost runs afoul of a prison gang in the sand showers; they want to ♥♥♥♥ the lad. The dialogue is pretty straight forward about it as is the actions of the characters on screen.\n\nThe main character is multi skilled and like any good story is soon on a grand adventure. It’s in a world where the outcome really won’t make a huge impact; it’s more about making a crap situation into a tolerable one. Along the way players the character is developed more by not only the choices set forth, but also as the players choose different skills and perks to customize the character. There is also a crafting system that allows for creation and modifications of equipment. Early in the game you are able to craft either injections like a health pack, or ammunition which allows the player to create ammo for their weapons.\n\nUnder the skill tree there are only a few options to choose to branch from they are Renegade, Combat or Technomancer. Each one has interesting builds offering different play styles and strengths and weaknesses. Every time the character levels up the player will have skill points that they can spend to better the characters abilities. There are also equipment slots; players can customize the looks and stats of equipment for a better overall RPG experience.\n\nThe first part of the game is understandably easy, the first encounter acts as a tutorial when you mix it up with some fellow prisoners. Later on the enemy types get much harder to deal with and it takes some strategy to take them on. Depending on your play style there are some sections of the game that stealth comes in handy. You can even go so far as to say stealth is very important in some areas. Trying to max out the renegade skills having to do with stealth is a big help in these sections; especially if the player wants to try their hand at some of those stealth kills.\n\nStory and voice acting are not too bad; they fit the game style well. There are times throughout the story where the character dialogue is cut off, and they do not speak what is painfully obvious the full line they are supposed to speak. So if you run into this, having the sub titles on may be of some assistance. While on this subject in regards to story, avoid the temptation to jump past the story dialogues and cut scenes, a lot of the game is more enjoyable while having the story play out for you. Voice acting I suspect was done more on an individual actor by actor basis, rather than the actors running the scene together and being in the moment. For the most part it sells, it’s not stellar voice overs but it is not awful either.\n\nCombat in the game comes down to a lot of maneuvering, especially if the player draws the attention of several enemies at once. They will swarm you and attack as they see fit. They won’t line up and come at you in order to make it easy for you. Oh no, some strategy and hit and run tactics are in order here. After taking an enemy out don’t forget to search them for useful items.\n\nMars: War Logs is worth a go as long as you understand out of the gate it’s not a triple -A -title. But as a gamer, a true gamer, you may just find yourself some entertainment here.","March 18, 2014","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
