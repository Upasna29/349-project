"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimwold/recommended/207170/","grimwold","Grimwold","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimwold/","566 products in account","The basic premise of Legend of Grimrock is that it is a modern take on the classic grid-based,dungeon-crawling,RPG games of old, like Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder etc. You start out with a party of 4 adventurers (arranged in a 2x2 formation)... in this case convicted as criminals and thrown into a secure prison.. and must explore the prison/dungeon to learn its secrets and find a way out. Movement is directional, plus rotate left and right, around a series of 2 dimensional grid based levels. There are various monsters to fight and puzzles to solve in order to progress through the game. Fighting is done by means of clicking on the items equipped in your characters' hands, often whilst performing a "Square dance" with the monsters to avoid letting them hit your party\n\nThe graphics have been updated, especially the lighting engine, which is amazing, but repeating textures are still used widely, and the gameplay itself is very reminiscent of the early games. Objects are interacted with by click on the screen e.g. to press a button or open a door and items can be picked up and carried/used by your party of adventurers. The adventurers attack by left-clicking the items that are placed in their hands, and spells can be cast by choosing the right combination of runes for a spell the adventurer has learnt.\n\nThere are 4 races:- Humans; Minotaurs; Lizardmen; and Insectoids, and 3 character classes - Fighter; Mage; Rogue. and you can either play with a default party, or create one of your own.\n\nAccording to Steam I have racked up 410 hours of playing time on Legend of Grimrock... mostly that is because a dungeon editor was released and I have spent a huge amount of time working on my own creations. I have however also completed the main game at least 3 times. Firstly with a hand-picked party of 4 characters, then again with a special unlockable solo character, and finally a hard,old-school playthrough with no automap. I've also spent a large amount of time using the Dungeon Editor and writing scripts to create my own levels/puzzles/spells etc. My first play through took 19 hours 35 minutes of playing time, which took 26 hours in total according to steam (including re-loads and breaks).\n\n\nOverall.. I used to love the old DM/EOB games and I absolutely love this modern take... And what's even better is that the designers continued to support their creation by giving the modding community a brilliant dungeon editor that allowed those of us with an interest to exert our creative muscles.","November 28, 2013","true","410.4"," 283 of 293 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","283","293","0","3"

And sometimes older tricks are better than newer ones. Take the chess game as precedent. Or even better example: Horses. We still ride them, but now we don't need to drive them to death to catch up with something. Riding horses today can be educational, emotional, engaging boost of experience. It can even heal some poor hearts, you know.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls Arena was much like the Grimrock by the mechanics, but eventually we've got Skyrim, which gives a completely another experience than that brilliant of game design we're talking there. The Skyrim can get you on the top of the world... but in the Legend of Grimrock you'll get much more emotions per time spended. And more challenges, both of fighting and exploring nature.\n\nRemember Tomb Raider game (2013)? The sequence where Lara found an old bow, and a good notation from Roth? "You can have the best form and technique in the world, but it won't mean a thing if you can't focus"... Yeah, focus is the best thing that game can teach you about. There are so many hidden buttons, levers and other stuff, so if you're find it all, I'm sure you'll get your boost to perception. That's an education of kind, and we need something like that to experience at least from time to time.\n\nWell, do that. Buy the game and make sure you're finish it. It is not that long, but in my book that's a musthave item.

Instead of dying instantly from the fall, you find yourselves at the top floor of a strange building.  You must move down floor by floor, fighting monsters, finding treasures, searching for secrets, and most of all, surviving.\n\nThe game balances storytelling and action, as you find notes from someone who previously made this journey.  The notes provide invaluable hints to solving puzzles relevant to the main quest line.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nexiu/recommended/207170/","nexiu","Nexiu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nexiu/","274 products in account","Legend of Grimrock is a certain game of twenty years ago, dressed in modern clothes. The recipe for this turned out to be surprisingly simple - leave completely untouched form the core of the game, using new technology only where it is necessary.\n\nLegend of Grimrock has almost no plot. Yes, somewhere in the background, we have a story of four convicts who were thrown into perdition to inhabited by monsters and traps bristling labyrinth of dungeons. Throughout accompany us also to be found in various places notes made ​​by a man named Tooruma, who wandered through the corridors and halls before us. At each level during sleep appear "visions" with a few sentences. And that's basically all the elements of the story.\n\nInterestingly, it was one of the first elements so characteristic of the classic games of this type. At a time when the "stimulus feature films" are limited to a minimum, begins to work the imagination. With scraps of information, in an atmosphere of understatement, alone, almost automatically, we are trying to fill these gaps with our own conjectures. It builds sometimes much more evocative atmosphere than most told, "film" story.\n\nThe gameplay is based on three pillars: exploration, solving puzzles and fighting.\n\nWe move through the corridors and rooms in a classic style. Levels are divided into square segments. One press of the button allows traffic to pass a single field or a reversal in the direction of 90º.\n\nBy far the biggest asset Legend of Grimrock are puzzles. At each of the thirteen levels we will get at least a few of them. Sometimes, their accumulation can be intimidating. All puzzles rely on the use of several of the same components. We have a mandatory collapse, levers, plates react to the pressure, the buttons in the walls, or portals. An absolute masterpiece of ingenuity is their use.\n\nAlthough there are not too many types of enemies, they are diverse and properly assigned, so only at the end of the game started to be missing "something new". I like the fact that most of them require the use of appropriate tactics. Additionally, this old-fashioned and a bit clunky combat system perfectly conceals imperfections SI, which knows only two tactics: to follow and the encirclement. Moreover, developers have used these qualities even several times in riddles.\n\nI must commend graphic design, but here also I have a few objections. It's basically the only "modern" element of Legend of Grimrock but it is used quite well. Textures, dynamic lighting, models of opponents and their animations look great.\n\nLegend of Grimrock is a damn successful - I would say that close to perfection - back to the already-forgotten genre. Thought even the most hardcore enthusiasts oldschool and implemented the option to disable the automatic drawing of the map. For players remember the "good old days" and exchanging hand-trended on a piece of checkered maps, is a wonderful gift.","October 25, 2014","true","27.1"," 63 of 76 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","63","76","0","5"

Then the other night I started it up again and tried playing once more not expecting to get far or play to long. However I found myself playing for over an hour and was able to figure out what I couldn't before, so here is my review on a very awesome game.\n\nThe Legend of Grimrock, a game I bought on Steam a couple years ago during the 2012 summer sale event made by Almost Human Games[www.grimrock.net].\n\nThe game is an old school RPG that is not turn based but live action. In other words you are able to move, cast spells, select items from your inventory and rest without waiting for creatures to take their turn. As your trying to get your spell cast or looking for a throwing item in your inventory the creature will be attacking you and won't sit there and wait till your done.\n\nI really found this game to have that pen and paper D&D feel to it and I like the idea of selecting the option to not have the game do the mapping as I explore and then I can map it out with graph paper and a pencil (I didn't do this of course).\n\nThe character creation screen is very simple with 4 races and 3 classes to choose from.  The inventory and character screen isn't complex or confusing but very intuitive and easy to figure out and understand.\n\nThe spell's though are based on symbols and you have to select the right symbols or combination of to cast the spell. I found that you couldn't get the spell unless you found the scroll for the right spell but this could have been because I wasn't selecting the right symbol until I found the scroll.\n\nWhen venturing through the dungeon your characters will get hungry and there will be a symbol of food in there avatar picture indicating they need to eat. When you kill of creatures they will sometimes leave a meat chunk behind and you will want to get these to eat along with any food things you find along the way.\n\nDuring combat along the way some of your party member may die, take heart because they are not gone for good. You will be able to access their inventory while dead to. There will be these big blue floating crystals that when touched will restore your party to full health and energy and raid the dead. Remember where these ones are. Once they are used you will have to wait for a bit till it can be clicked on again.\n\nNow as for combat, where I originally had most of my troubles. To attack all you need simply do is right click on your hand under your avatar (wither their is a weapon in it or not). If your a spell caster you will want to keep at least one hand empty for right clicking to bring up the symbol window for spell casting.\n\nWhen you left click on a throwing weapon it will be attached to your mouse cursor and if you click with it again with your mouse pointer above the midline of the screen (the top half of the window) then it will be thrown. If you click below the midline (bottom half of the screen) then it get dropped on the floor.\n\nThis is a keyboard and mouse type game and no controller support.\n\nNow that I have been able to find out something about the game and how combat works, along with the abilities to make your own dungeon's and storyline and the Steam Workshop to try some community based dungeons, The Legend of Grimrock is one game to have in your collection. Its worth a play!\n\nI give this game:\nːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː","June 15, 2014","true","3.1"," 70 of 93 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","70","93","0","4"

It might be newer and easier compared to the old ones, but this was a very good take on an old genre that is pretty much dead these days. The RPG elements are fairly light, but they definitely work and it was enjoyable to kill things and level up while finding new and better gear. The puzzles were great and generally enjoyable...mostly logic puzzles with some small hints. The vast majority of them made sense instead them being seemingly random like puzzles in some games.\n\nThe entire environment is all tile-based, but looked very good. A few levels would look like mossy rocks and then a few floors down they would nice, clean stonewalls, while deeper down it would be even more different. The lighting is awesome as well. It definitely set the mood for this game. The music was decent, but nothing to write home about - mostly ambient stuff. The story wasn't bad, but it wasn't super in-depth either. It was decent enough to make you want to continue your journey though.\n\nI would have never played this game had it not been for a certain youtuber that showed me how awesome this game was. They ended up not finishing the game, but I'm very glad I finally finished it myself and I hope they do at some point as well.

You might ask, well a dungeon crawler is a first person game where you play as an adventurer, or usually a party of adventurers that delve into dungeons, level up and complete quests, what makes dungeon crawlers so much different from modern RPG's  is that dungeon crawlers often use complex puzzles in their level design, making it more of a puzzle game than a grindfest.\n\nThe game starts you off with a standard party of four characters that work well together, but you can create your own party of course!\nThe characters you play are outcast by society and have to fight for their lives to have their crimes abolished on the mountain of Grimrock.\n\nThe game looks simply gorgeous for a game in it's genre, even on my terrible terrible laptop it runs very smooth at the maximum graphical settings.\nThe combat system is a bit like the old Final Fantasy/Chrono Trigger combat system mixed in with the Dungeon Master/Shin Megami Tensei combat, you can move about freely in a grid of squares, while your attacks aren't turnbased, they just have cooldowns.\n\nThe challenge this game holds is above average, don't expect to blaze through it on your first playthrough, nonetheless it's a great game overall!\nThe puzzles don't let you get stuck for a long time, they're quite clear about what needs to be done, which is a good thing in my opinion.\n\nI could whole-heartedly recommend you this title if you want to play a casual game with a decent bit of challenge, especially when it's on sale, then it's definately worth the money.\nIf you're on the fence about this game, I'd say go and buy it, if you weren't interested before, this probably isn't your type of game, and I'd recommend you watching a let's play.","November 26, 2013","true","2.6"," 45 of 56 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","45","56","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aRkedos/recommended/207170/","aRkedos","aRkedos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aRkedos/","143 products in account","Legend of Grimrock is an old-school dungeon crawling game which is inspired by games like Dungeon Master oder Eye of the Beholder.\n\nThe game tells a story of four criminals whose crimes are forgotten by getting tossed into the maw of mount Grimrock. A massive mountain which holds a huge dungeon of untold horrors. No one has ever managed to escape this atrocity. No one but, well you might guessed it, you !\n\nYou are in control of the four criminals. You can either chose a preset of four ready-to-go characters or create your own party. Once you are in the Dungeon your job is to find a way out. You can move your party from tile to tile and can only perform 90° turns to the left or right. This sounds quite simple and to many quite boring, but Legend of Grimrock does a fantastic job of keeping things fresh and interesting.\n\nAs you progress through the dungeon you have to solve puzzles which become increasingly harder and sometimes force you to think in unconventional ways. But they are never unfair and can be solved with a decent amount of thinking and experimenting. The puzzles are the highlights of the game which are quite rewarding in most cases and keep you motivated as you progress deeper into the dungeon.\n\nThe combat system is rather simple but still challenging. As already mentioned you control four characters which are always standing on the same tile. On the bottom right of the screen you got the avatars of you characters which are also used to control you characters. If you left-click on a equipped melee weapon you will perform an attack with this weapon. The twist about this system is that the upper row of your characters represent the front row on the tile you are standing. Characters in the back row cant hit targets with melee weapons / attacks (with a few exceptions). So you are forced to build a solid mix of beefy warriors / melee characters that stand in front and weaker but also very useful range characters that stand in the back and cast spells or use throwing weapons or other types of ranged attacks.\n\nIf you have a mage in your party things really become interesting. The spell-system requires you to combine several runes in order to sucessfully cast a spell. And you have to do this during the fight in real time. So things can get a bit stressful if you fight off several enemies because you still want to use your other characters. There are no shortcuts you could use. You have to memorize the runes and the combinations to put your mage to use. To some of you this might sound disappealing but if you get the hang of it, it feels really great.\n\nTechnically the developers have done a great job. Some light effects in Legend of Grimrock are really great to look at, the textures are very sharp, the animations of enemies are great and fluid.\n\nOne of the downsides of this game is that it may lack a bit of variation. There are only 3 different looks in the dungeon. Some of you might think that this it no problem because a dungeon is a dungeon but even in that particular scenario you could do more than three different types of wall textures.\n\nAll in All Legend of Grimrock is a great expierence if you like solving challenging but rewarding puzzles and if you love exploration because you get to explore a lot. There are a lot of secrets to uncover in this vast dungeon.","October 4, 2014","true","48.6"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","0"

The atmosphere is fantastic, it feels exactly like going through a dungeon should be: dark, secluded, and frightening. Some of the puzzles are creative and fun to get through, although sometimes they like to replace puzzles with the "find the tiny hidden button game!" (< and that's really my only legitimate complaint about the whole game). They also do a good job keeping the dungeon from feeling too same-y. Although it is just one big dungeon, and it really feels like one big dungeon, you slowly learn more about the area you are exploring and the place gets more and more like a fortress the deeper you go. So there is a very solid sense of progression, even if you don't have any idea where you're going or even what you're going there for, which really adds to the overal mystery in that fantastic atmosphere I told you about earlier.\n\nIf you want to play a game for action, this may not be the game for you.

It's shorter, but there's much less time spent wandering.\n\nPlayed without the sequel in mind, this is God's gift to dungeon-crawl fans, taking all the old-school things you enjoyed and decorating them in modern graphics and sound.

Getting past traps, monsters and locked doors to the stairs is the whole game. Story, Cut scenes and character motivation are all minimal. Heck the textures, loot and sound effects are minimal too. Some may be bothered by that, But I wasn't.\n\nI couldn't resist "old school mode",  Break out the graph paper and DIY, Even for the first time out. Doing so, Mapping became the central focus of the game. The ambiance of the dungeon also became more pronounced as you don't want to get caught with a pencil in your hand and not a sword. I've played the old Wizardry and Bard's Tales and have always enjoyed the act of mapping. And I enjoyed it here as well.\n\nCombat is real-time. So click on your weapon to attack or click on your hands to ready a spell, then select the rune pattern of the spell and then cast the spell. That's a lot to do for a mage, But then again, Casting spells should be more involved than swinging a sword. Turn-based would have been more “old school”, But may have lessened the importance of the ambiance as a result. The “Prepare, Attack, Move, Repeat” pattern is acceptable.\n\nI found less than 50 secrets. I didn't try that hard as such things have never been a strong motivator for me in-and-of themselves. Getting through the dungeon had some tough spots. The worst of which was having to redraw a badly drawn map followed by some investigation/experimentation. The best of which was being thrown in a room full of nasties with my escape route closed off. Only option...run deeper into the dungeon. But you don't have time to map when your frantically running away.\n\nFor my party I decided to go sub-optimal and let a RNG choose my races, classes, initial attribute point allocations, traits (I did select a couple of racial traits myself) and pictures. I got 2 Minotaurs (A fighter and a mage) and 2 Insectoids (Both mages). Happily they all made it out alive. I'd be interested in taking another group of random criminals into the mountain.","February 20, 2015","true","47.4"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","2"

It's because this game is a modern take on old dungeon crawler games from the 80's and early 90's. They were made like this because of technological limitations but in my opinion they work just as well today as they did then and Legend of Grimrock captures the feel of that perfectly. You are 4 prisoners who have been accused of unknown crimes and tossed in to the dungeons of a mountain. As you were thrown in your crimes were absolved and if you can make it through the maze of tunnels, monsters and puzzles and come out the other side in one piece your crimes will be forgotten.\n\nYou can choose from 4 races (human, minotaur, lizard or insectoid) and each has certain differences that make them unique. Minotaur are very aggressive and strong and so make great fighters, for example. There are also 3 classes to choose from: warrior, rogue and mage. As you level up you can further customize your characters by spending skill points, so as a mage you can choose to focus on fire magic and become very proficient in that, or you can spread your points out evenly and be good at all schools of magic. Similarly with a rogue you can choose between missile weapons, throwing weapons or fast melee weapons/backstabs with daggers and the like.\n\nThe puzzles and monsters start off easy but get harder as the game progresses - all the clues to solve them are there though in the form of cryptic messages written on walls and notes left by other prisoners who have tried to escape before you. Each level has secret rooms that can usually be found by pushing a "button" - a loose rock hidden in a wall somewhere. They're not too difficult to find but you do have to keep your eyes open.\n\nI love this game and it reminds me of the good old days of classic dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder. If I was forced to say something negative about it (which I guess I am because this is a review) then it would be that some enemies are quite easy to defeat by hitting them and then sidestepping before they can hit you - though this is actually a valid tactic in games these. Even so, a mistake can get you killed, for example if you allow yourself to be cornered a troll - it'll wear your hit points down fast because they hit like a train. You need to give yourself room to manouver.\n\nI'd give it a 4/5. It's one of the best quality indie games you'll ever find, it is completely bug-free and it isn't a DLC/microtransaction cash grab like so many games are today. You buy the game, you get the full game. If you're tempted to try a Grimrock game I'd definitely try this one first. It's cheaper (because it's older) then the second one and if you like this then you'll definitely like the second one too, and if you don't then you won't like the second one.","March 27, 2015","true","27.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

The UI and general handling of the game is that intuitively that you know everything you need to know after the first minutes into the game. And the developers didn't make any major changes to the retro mechanics, but they polished them. Like you walk over a previous thrown distance weapon and it will be auto-equipped into the corresponding slot. I love such details.\nOnly tiny thing I'd wish for is a hotkey to toggle secondary weapons, because in the heat of the battle it's rather annoying to switch to a distance weapon (currently they are basically spamming my inventory).\nIf you like this genre this game is a must.","January 20, 2014","true","12.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

This is the first game in 15years that got me stuck on puzzles, it reminded me of the time when puzzle games where among the most played, and well made, games. For those of you who played games like "Eye of the Beholder", Legend of Grimrock will probably hit you in the feelings like a 1/2 ton truck.\n\n***GAMEPLAY 9/10\nThe gameplay is really simple, you move as if you're on a grid one step at time (up,down,left,right and rotate 90° L or R)\nYou have 4 characters that move together in a square formation, so you have 2 on front and 2 at the back, note that this also mean that you have 2 on the left and 2 on the right, which might seem obvious, but will become a problem if you get sandwiched between monsters. The combat mechanic is simple, but challenging. Your front row can attack any monster with any weapon, the back row can only attack monsters with ranged/missile weapons, or with spells. You can only attack monsters that are facing you, but monsters can sneak on you and easily kill your back row, so beware of how you move when fighting more than one enemy.\nWhen you are not killing enemies, you're probably trying to solve puzzles. This is the core of the game : how to reach the end of the dungeon. Your wits will be challenged, sometimes lightly, sometimes harder, sometimes you'll find the solution to a hard puzzle in no time and some other times you'll feel the king of all dumbs by realizing you had the solution under your nose for 1 hour, but you didn't see it... true story.\nWhy 9/10? I need to write this down. I'd normally give 8, game controls are good, game is challenging but not impossible, however, this +1 bonus comes from the fact that Legend of Grimrock resurrected the dungeon crawler mechanics that was abandoned long time ago. It demonstrates that old school can still kick asses.\n\n***STORY 7/10\nStory is almost a MacGuffin, it's there just to set things in motion and to give you a purpose. You're thrown into this prison/dungeon to die, but some weird voice in your dreams tells you that you can escape if you reach the lowest level... and so it begins. While descending the levels you'll find some scrolls that give you information about Mount Grimrock, which add a bit of lore to the game.\nWhen you finally reach the lowest level ... well, you'll see. I enjoyed every single bit of the story, even though it's really simple.\n\n***GRAPHICS 7/10\nGraphic isn't great, but it's good enough. A bit more variety for what concerns the levels wouldn't have hurt, but I admit it's not necessary. I mean, Mount Grimrock is a prison and a prison isn't supposed to be about beautiful hallways and rooms, so it doesn't feel weird roaming 4 levels that look the same. No glitches whatsoever.\n\n***SOUND 7/10\nGame is almost silent, music is just a feeble echo in the background. The monsters grunts and steps are what you'll hear most of the time. When you play at harder difficulties it creates an effect on the player, hearing wierd noises behind walls and corner almost make you fear for the lives of your characters.\n\n3) TL;DR\nOverall score 7.5/10\nLegend of Grimrock resurrects the dungeon crawler genre. If you are old enough to have played this kind of games before, you should buy this game, and even if you weren't old enough, and puzzle game are your thing, you won't get disappointed.","January 5","true","34.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Eye of the Beholder!  YES!!\nI've been playing Xeen since '92.\nWhy doesn't someone make a game like that again?!!\nNo seriously, let me know if you see one, because that's what this game seems to be going for but it sadly misses the mark.\n\nI would be more forgiving and I would even give this game a positive except that the mis-steps they took are downright bewildering.\n\nFirst what do I love about this title...\nIt really is incredibly challenging.  The puzzles, battles, and resource management is unforgiving which is a nice throwback to the "good old days".  I love that they took that risk here, because usually it makes the difference between a grind and compelling, rewarding gameplay.  Grimrock is a nice reminder of the days when games weren't all just an endurance contest, and not everyone could beat every game given enough time.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is that this game is fun. Actually, really fun.  You can jump right in without any help and start adventuring.  The puzzles feel like first-person zelda and the written "clues" are a great homage to the first-generation of PC rpg titles.  I love the creepy dream sequences, and the customizable party pics are a great touch that is long overdue.  The biggest issue this game struggles with slowly becomes apparent with the combat system.\nThere is a gaping hole in what should be simple mechanics and functionality of the UI and especially combat.  The spellcasting system is pretty original, but the act of casting like other actions just doesn't jive with "real-time" battle.  Every battle quickly devolves into a scramble to CLICK ALL THE THINGS and it often leaves the player feeling cheated when things go wrong, especially considering how clunky the menus can be.  The frenzy of battle becomes a tedium of switching gear, passing potions around, and constantly equipping new projectiles.\nThere are no hot keys, you pretty much have to rely on the mouse for everything.  The cerebral aspects of the game (puzzles, carefully managing resources, distributing skill points) is lost every time you encounter an enemy, because battle feels too much like a chore rather than fun.  To excel in this combat system you have to play a perpetual game of hopscotch with your enemies as you desperately try to click the next action square that lights up at the right time.  In addition, the characters here can't seem to hit the broad side of a barn.   Had this game incorporated turn-based combat or at least an option for it, this game still wouldn't be a home run but this would be a positive review.\n\nI love that these devs dusted off an sadly neglected style of RPG, but other than a nice facelift there's not much else to see here.  I respect the risks they took here but the potential here is tragically lost in the tedium of the clunky and frenzied comat system and a general lack of polish.\nYou get 4 party members and there are 3 classes.\nScarce resources is one thing I respect, but for an RPG the equipment is so scarce that your characters are still half-naked 8 hours into the game.\nThrown weapons, torches, and food all need to be perpetually "maintained", and inventory management becomes a chore.\nThere seem to be no status icons, save for "over-encumbered", which doesn't even seem to function properly as the numbers don't make sense.  Maybe as part of the homage to old games they decided to add a dash of "WTF" just for good measure I don't know what else to chalk some of this up to.\n\nThere's something here for those of us who remember this classic style, but this just feels like a poorly designed RPG reluctantly wedged into a brilliant dungeon puzzler.  Maybe it would be great on a tablet for poop breaks, but as a PC title it feels half-baked.  I haven't played the sequel yet but I'm hopeful that they learned some things from this release and improved on what is an intriguing foundation here.  I'm not giving up on this series.  Don't get me wrong, despite the mis-steps there really is a lot of potential here.\n\nI give it 2 out of 4 skeleton archers, with skeleton-shaped shadow lurking in the corner chattering "tuuuuurn-BASED!!" and another chattering  "statusssss iconssssss...master warp portalsssssss between levels...one or two more classsesss......chchchchchchchhc"","December 30, 2014","false","12.3"," 57 of 94 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","57","94","5","0"

It's good because it's a near-perfect implementation of a specific class of game; the old PC dungeon crawler.\n\nIf you love finding secret wall switches, solving puzzles and finding loot, and eating a giant roasted maggot-on-a-stick because you're desperate to eat, then this is the game for you.\n\nIf you want a fantasy FPS with lots of jumping and airducking, this isn't for you, GTFO.\n\nLegend of Grimrock doesn't try and improve much on the old classic dungeon crawler game design, I think that works well for it, and I don't think they do anything really new or crazy that hasn't been done in dungeon crawlers before. They just put modern graphics and sound together into a game and implemented it well.\n\nThe game doesn't have any music beyond the title screen, but the ambient background through the game is pleasant and detailed. Turn the volume up, because sounds of the dungeon will alert you to nearby foul beasts and secrets.\n\nThe background story is compelling and interesting, but nothing too deep. Secrets are found in the dungeon, and a reason for being is evident, but they leave the details up to your imagination, which is probably for the best. You can't climb back up. Your only way out is down. The story is your journey along the way.\n\nThe last few levels are spooky and the game has a very fulfilling final battle.\n\nSecrets are plentiful, so pay attention. There were a couple of puzzles which had me really baffled, including two that were required to proceed with the story. I don't recomend ruining the challenge for yourself by reading a walkthrough online, but if you get stuck in the story, it's there for you. The best thing to do is sit and think. With two specific exceptions that I can mention, most of the puzzles are evident if you just use your brain for more than thirty seconds.\n\nI do have a complaint regarding the final puzzle in the game (Minor spoiler warning): There are four items which need to be placed around a single block in a room. Two of them are pretty easy to figure out, but the small gear in particular has a non-obvious arbitrary placement location which should be fixed. Even if you have the right item on the right wall, you have to click it on a very specific small area that doesn't offer any clue that it's the right part to go in the right place.\n\nAlso, the level 9 riddle room had me really stuck for awhile. I just didn't get the clues and had to randomly guess at it until I figured it out.","January 7, 2015","true","47.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","1"

Legend of Grimrock gets it right by keeping the premise simple and making the game easy and interactive while making sure to put the challenge in the combat and the puzzle solving.\n\nYou were four prisoners who were shoved into the depths of Mount Grimrock to atone for your crimes, you are free the moment you fall, however you have to escape Grimrock if you want to enjoy your freedom, and that’s the story. There are tidbits of lore and story in scroll, text on walls and various objects you find throughout Grimrock, its simple and that’s honestly for the best.\n\nThe game plays up the survival part well with needing to keep your guys fed or risk of getting hungry, health and energy regenerate although slowly, you can rest but risk getting attacked while resting.\n\nGraphics weren’t top notch for the time it came out, but they don’t feel dated or old, they’re more than adequate and the style of the dungeon and its inhabitants is very realistic in tone.  There is no music throughout most of the game; instead you get this creepy ambiance similar to Amnesia or Penumbra games. It isn’t meant to scare as much as it is to create a tone of dread from  hearing ‘things’ in the distance, again the game feels like it’s going more for a realistic immersion.\n\nCombat is much more interesting and tactical, your team is in a 2x2 formation, two in front and back, the two in front are taking the brunt of the damage while the two in back are support, you can switch these positions easily and you often will in order to save companions from death or to rotate dealing damage, spells are cast by selecting the correct rune sequence, you can do this as long as your skill level lets you and you know the combination, you can find scrolls that tell you correct rune combinations, but these aren’t required, you can find them through experimentation, or if you don’t care about finding it out, the internet.\n\nYou can also craft in this game various potions from the reagents you find in Grimrock, potions can be simple healing or energizing potions to better damage or even invisibility, again you can find the correct combination through experimentation or scroll and recipes.\n\nFinally the puzzles in the game are much more challenging, there are a few simple and easy ones to begin with, but, even in the first room you start in there are various secret switch to hidden treasures, and as you progress the game starts putting more challenging riddles up for you to solve, some necessary to progress others to great treasures to help you survive. Overall, I felt the puzzle solving in this game was a good balance between challenging while also not needing to be overly difficult.\n\nLegend of Grimrock is a great throwback to dungeon crawling RPGs, it shows that this type of game can easily be done and be fun if done well, it’s simple and easy to get into and actually gave me quite a challenge and I was really impressed once I finished the game, it took me about 20 hours to beat the game, and for $14.99 USD that is not bad at all. I highly recommend this game if you’re looking for good ole fashioned role-playing games, or just something different from the standard fair now-a-days, if you need that more action oriented role-playing game, Grimrock may not be for you, although I still feel it’s just as fun, if not more.\n\nTL/DL; Legend of Grimrock is a classic dungeon crawling RPG with up to 20 hours of gameplay at only $14.99 USD, it’s a steal and well worth the price, its challenging, creepy, and interesting, it’s simple in its gameplay and story making it easy to jump in, it’s worth checking it out of you enjoy RPGs in general, if you need more action oriented RPGs, it may not be for you, but, I encourage you to check it out, you won’t regret it.\n\n-Double Thumbs Up from Royial\n\nVideo Reviews: https://www.youtube.com/RoyialNetwork","January 12, 2015","true","1.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I never played much in this FPS style when I was younger but that doesn’t take away how much fun this game was to play.\n\nYou have a team of 4 characters and move through a grid based dungeon you were locked up in. You can create your characters with a variety of classes, powers, and skills to whatever playstyle fits you best. There are many floors to travel through and many secrets to find on the way. There are plenty of great challenging puzzles and enemies to keep you occupied for a good time.\n\nThere is also plenty of replay value with different difficulties and even an old-school mode where you lose the AutoMap and you can pull out some grid paper and make your own. Then there is also the added Steam Workshop where you can install mods to give you more challenges and fun to last you a long time.\n\nThe game is fantastic looking with some cool character design and great sound to go along with it. Going through the tunnels when your torch is flickering out and you can hear the skittering of an enemy somewhere nearby made for some cool moments in the game.\n\nI played through on easy mode as I’m new to this style of RPG and figured I could get the hang of it better. It was still a decent challenge and enjoyable for me. I would highly recommend Legend of Grimrock if you like the old-school RPGs or even just want to play a well-made fantastic game. This is Almost Human’s first game and you can tell they put a lot of love into it and it was only a 4 man team too.

The Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder series were much better games than this one. Let me list the good and bad  points:\n-- Good --\n- The graphics are sharp. Thumbs up in this department.\n- The monsters actually behave differently depending on their type, giving you the idea that they aren't just sacks of hitpoints charging at you.\n- A lot of secrets to uncover.\n- Most levels have a healing crystal that will instantly heal your party and resurrect fallen members.\n\n-- Bad --\n- The magic system is terrible. Both DM and EOB had a rich magic system with a lot of useful spells, both combat and utility. This game has essentially 6 or 7 spells. (There are actually more than this, but in essence a fire arrow spell is the exact same as a lighting/poison/frost arrow, so I am calling it one spell.) Of these, the only real utility spell is a light spell. No healing spells, no create food spells, no detect secrets spells - nothing. This was my #1 biggest complaint with this game.\n- The puzzles are mostly of the 'hit a switch and race to this location to hit another one' variety. I want puzzles that test my cunning, not my reflexes.\n- Most of the monsters in the game are about impossible to stand toe-to-toe with. The game relies heavily on the 'attack and sidestep' school of combat. It's wasn't fun in EOB, and it isn't fun here. I understand it for a boss fight, but here it is necessary with most monsters, at least until you are way over their level.\n- THERE ARE NO HOTKEYS! You have to use your mouse to manually click each party member's weapon in order to attack. Come on guys - even Might and Magic had combat hotkeys! This is annoying with melee attacks, but downright aggravating when it comes to magic. To cast a spell, you have to right-click your wand, select the runes (up to 3), and then click again. Want to cast that spell again? Ok, 5 more clicks coming right up. All this while trying to sidestep and manage 3 other party members' melee attacks.\n\nMy recommendation is go back and play DM or EOB. They are much better (although uglier) games.\n","May 1, 2015","false","10.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Old-school dungeon-grinding, with a bit of new-school twist.\n\nFor the record, I haven't played many games like this in, well, almost DECADES...so just to clarify, I'm not really up with what the kids are into these days, first person dungeon-wise (bar the aforementioned Elder Scrolls nonsense).  I am pleased to note, however, that this is more than a mere "dungeon hack"...there's lots of puzzles and traps and/or interesting and strategic ways to fight and handle monsters, so it's already ten times more intelligent than, say, a Borderlands game (not that that's any great feat, but bear with me).\n\nIn case you're wondering how it all works, your party moves through the dungeon in a limited version of a first person perspective (you can only move forward, left, right, and back; then turn to face in a different direction, ninety degrees at a time) and the combat is half-way between a turn-based approach and a more real-time urgency.   What this all adds up to, best as I can tell, is a bit of a best-of-both-worlds approach to dungeon-delving: That is to say, it's not TOO much of a game of reflexes and/or hand-eye coordination, but still has more moment-to-moment suspense and atmosphere than one could muster with a strictly turn-based situation.  It also offers a nice middle ground between so-called "casual" gaming and something a bit more involved, not to mention a decent compromise between "lighter" fantasy elements and something a teensy weensy bit "darker"...so if it's a game with that kind of balance you're looking for, then by all means, step inside.\n\nMe personally, I was in the market for a bit of a nostalgic dungeon crawl with some slightly spiffier, more modern graphics, and that's precisely what I got; so for the price of three bucks (on severe sale) I was well-chuffed.  In all honesty, though, it's probably worth the full asking price even if you play it through just the once - it's certainly LONG enough! - and it furthermore has a fair dose of replayability, thanks to customisable characters and multiple difficulty levels and so forth.  It's far from the Second Coming, and gets awfully grind-y at times, but it's pretty darn good for what it is.  Know what you're signing up for, and chances are you won't be disappointed.\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","April 25","true","23.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

You'll be hard-pressed to find a modern game like Legend of Grimrock any time soon, but with a game of this quality, you won't need one.In a way, The Legend of Grimrock is a lot like Dark Souls. The game rewards calculated, meticulous play and any severe injuries or deaths are likely a result of not taking in your surroundings. There are a lot of ways to die in Grimrock and if you're not paying attention, taking the time to search out better gear and learn to craft potions, you're going to have a difficult time with it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joachim18/recommended/207170/","joachim18","Joachim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joachim18/","802 products in account","Legend of Grimrock is best summarized in its manual: "The game features dungeon exploration, puzzles, secrets, combat, magic and role playing elements."\n\nThe game's enjoyment comes from navigating the dungeon, avoiding traps, finding hidden switches and looting treasures. Combat is fairly simple, it consists of avoiding attacks by maneuvering around your adversaries, and the only tactical element is picking a place with enough room to do so (also being mindful of pits and other enemies cornering you). All in all combat is just another puzzle element in this game, the experience points and skills you earn a different form of reward.\n\nThe game's overall difficulty is rather involved but lenient, it requires patience and attention to detail. There is a lot of diversity in puzzles, I've never come across two identical ones. They will test your memory, reflexes, and creativity, so you are bound to appreciate some of them while finding other tedious or unremarkable. Only in two instances did I get stuck. On the other hand the designers can be quite devious at times when it comes to traps, especially towards the end of the game. Some might find it frustrating, but I see it rather as playfulness and awareness of the exploits used in that genre of games.\n\nThe game's visual and sound design, while polished, lacks diversity. Being quite lengthy (20-30 hours depending on difficulty/old school mode settings), but only comprised of two different kinds of environment (with a third on the tiny last two levels), the game can seem quite bleak after a while. The loot also becomes more scarce and less exciting, supplies more numerous, making it less rewarding to search for secrets. The lack of new enemies and puzzle elements adds to an overall fatigue building up until the two bottom floors. The final boss requires mobility and precision, also some ingenuity but most of all calm. It reinvigorated my enjoyment of the game, as the end fight was unexpectedly innovative.","September 23, 2015","true","57.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just recently I realized Eye Of The Beholder itself was a reincarnation (or what some people would call "a clone" or "a ripoff") of a similar game called "Dungeon Master" from the 1980s (which I've never heard of until recently), but 'nuff said about that.\n\nBack to Legend Of Grimrock -\n\nThe game is a first person dungeon crawling Action/RPG. You play a group of 4 adventurers (aka convicted criminals, but nevermind about that :P), whose goal is to survive the dungeon by means of solving puzzles and fighting monsters while staying alive in the process.\n\nThe default party consists of two fighters (one human, one minotaur), one wizard and one rogue, set in a fixed formation of two rows - two characters in front, two more behind them. You can choose which character to place where and change it while playing, but you can't change the formation. The idea is that the two front characters use melee attacks, while the other two need to attack from long range (either magic, throwing weapons such as knives, or missile weapons such as bows).\n\nUp until now (8-10 hours ingame), I'm really having fun. Technically, everything looks and feels good. There's nothing overwhelming about the graphics or the music, but they are definitely good enough. Come to think of it, there's hardly any music ingame, and I think it's a really good idea. The lack of music makes the game feel more realistic, and it lets you pay the worthy attention to the sound effects, which just like with Eye Of The Beholder, play an important role, as they serve as warning signs from certain enemies.  The controls are simple and intuitive (left click to move items, right click to attack when it comes to battles). Some of the puzzles are very easy, others are more difficult. I did find it necessary to look for help online in a couple of incidents so far, but I did manage to solve most of the puzzles myself (up to where I am at the moment, can't say anything about the puzzles I haven't reached yet).\n\nAll in all, this game is fun. If you like dungeon crawlers, get it. It might not be a masterpiece, but it is fun to play.","January 8, 2014","true","10.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

It is a spiritual sequel to the old game Dungeon Master from the 80s, but with modern graphics and updates like better AI and an automap. If you like dungeon crawls, get it. You wont be disappointed.\n\nIts a dungeon crawl like Eye of the Beholder. Graphics are very nice with the traditional square tunnels and chains hanging on the walls, moss ect. Theres alos the occasioanl cool statue or art on the walls as well. Step, turn, strafe and so forth. The puzzles ramp up in difficulty nicely. They are the typical find keys, secret buttons, pull levers in order, run quickly, and so forth. But defintely not stale. Theres also some interesting and unique ones too.  Combat is heavily reliant on the step dance just to survive, a feature I'm not too thrilled about. Unless youre a minmaxer, going toe to toe with an enemy of the appropriate level (on Normal) is not recommended.\n\nYoure going to be freezing the enemy and/or dancing all over the place if you want to stay alive. The enemies hit hard. I would say that this is the games major flaw, as I'm way more of a fan of toe to toe melee than swinging and running all over the place till the enemy dies. Its too bad cuz the AI is nice for a square based dungeon crawler. The enemies will actually try and sneak up on you.\n\nDMs levelling system was better too. In LoG, theres 4 races and 3 classes. Minotaur, human, lizardman, and insectoid, and mage, rogue and fighter. Once you pick, you're that class. Fighters cant learn magic, and mages cant fight (or seem to do much of anything). And you get XP, just like typical RPGs.\n\nContrast that with DMs "practice a skill and level in that class" style and it just seems...lesser. Also, the game really lends itself to specialization. Pick 1 weapon, 1 magic school. Jack of all trading as far as class skills seems to really hurt in the late game.\n\nThe sounds and music are nice, typically dungeon-y without being too intrusive. There really isnt too much of a plot in the main game, but thats not why you're here. You're here for the awesome exploration, wondering whats around the corner and seeing if your condemned prisoners will ever win their freedom.\n\nAll in all a great game and definitely worth picking up for any dungeon/RPG fan. Theres a custom dungeon I have, not sure if I d/led it or it was installed in a patch. Its really great. Uses the same assets, but theres a lot added. For instance, theres way more story. Your character actually speaks to his/her self and when you find more party members, you can chat with them. And you only design one char, picking from the 4 races, but also 4 classes, each with 4 subclasses all slightly different.","April 12, 2012","true","73.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

The secrets, the combat, the atmosphere, it sucked me in and I just had to complete it, and so I did. I'll share my experience now.\n\nAbout it's mechanics, you control a party of 4 characters. You're able customize their race, class, attributes and set custom portraits, I myself made an epic party with my closest friends. The battle formation is a square, so 2 characters lead and the others stay in the back, this encouraged me to balance my party members with melee or ranged attacks. The combat happens in real time and you can only move in tiles, each character have two available slots that you can place weapons, potions or other items into, you click these slots to perform actions, ones that depending on your char skills may "cool-down" faster. ( One of my chars had max level sword ability, so he could strike twice as fast ). I enjoyed the combat A LOT, and after a while getting used to, you'll be predicting enemies actions and flanking them. Just be careful not to end up cornered, I can still.. hear.. their.. screams.. *arghhhhhh*.\n\nThere are potions to be crafted, magic to be discovered, secret areas which may grant you powerful unique weapons or a headache in case you didn't save often. Puzzles are well crafted, I didn't feel the need to "google" my way trough the game, though one or two times I was stuck searching for a solution.\n\nThe graphics are Okay considering you spend all your game time inside of a dungeon, there will be variety as of three or four ambient styles for about 10 levels and another metal based theme at the end game. It does a good job making you believe that you're really trapped inside a place and there is no way out, they nailed atmosphere! Sound is of good quality as well.\n\nI don't have anything bad to say about this game, honestly. The dungeon's ambiance may get repetitive for some people, or the combat may be hard to get used to, but I enjoyed the whole game since each level is clever and has it's own set of characteristics, puzzles, etc... Can't wait to play the second game now!\n\ntl;dr\n\n+ Puzzles and more puzzles\n+ Replay value ( try new builds or custom maps! )\n+ Length, not too long, not too short\n+ Nostalgia aspect for some people\n\n- Managing consumable items during combat can be a painfull thing","January 11, 2015","true","36.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yet this isn't necessarily a negative. The is a constant trek through a single dungeon, with little respite or change in scenary. You constantly have to worry about health, energy and food while fighting enemies, evading traps and solving puzzles. But it feels rewarding in a way. You really need to pay attention and work out scenarios to go foward. Though an obstacle may seem impossible at first: an unbeatable enemy encounter or an unsolvable puzzle, all you gotta do is step back, prepare and use quick wits to get past it. Time and time again you'll pull through in the search of the next floor or secret loot.\nThe controls are a little awkward at first, especially the rune-based magic system, but I feel it's part of the charm. The combat is simple, but requires you to be quick and composed while paying attention to enemy patterns. The puzzles do a lot with very little, simple switches and floor pads are used to create some clever riddles without delving into Myst or La-Mulana tier arcanery.\nThe biggest drawback would be the low production values, due to the small developer. There are only 3 tilesets for the dungeon, one of which you barely see. The main menu theme is great, but the actual game is mostly one ambient track, which is effective for building atmosphere but can get tiring after awhile.\nOverall, LoG is a great game for those wanting a tribute to the old school dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder, or anyone wanting a somewhat challenging change of pace.","March 5, 2015","true","48.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Definitely worth a look if your idea of fun involves being thrown in a hole with nothing but your underoos and stabbing your way through dark tunnels full of inexplicable logic puzzle-based security systems with no real goal beyond "survive to the next room."\n\n-----\n\nAfter about... what, two years? I haven't been counting... I've finally beaten this game. And I admit with zero shame I used a walkthrough to find all the secrets, as I was going for achievements and the only way you're getting all of them in one playthrough is prior knowledge, a walkthrough, or going through every brick in the dungeon with a fine-tooth comb.\n\nThere's not much to say that isn't summed up in that opening paragraph. Legend of Grimrock feels like Tomb of Horrors Lite in terms of surviving by the skin of your teeth through dark, miserable corridors specifically designed to make advancing painful, with some truly clever and sadistic puzzles, some more one than the other.\n\nUltimately my only major criticism is that the final boss is quite possibly the most annoying boss in any game I've ever played, mainly because the arena is litered with swarms of minor enemies that serve no purpose but to be mobile walls to keep you from fleeing, and their mere presence in the room feels so arbitrary that I'm almost certain they were lazily tossed in during beta testing when the devs felt the boss was too easy.\n\nSo yes, rubbish boss, but altogether a fun old-school dungeon crawler.

Most of the puzzles work around pushing lose stones that protrude out from the walls and the combat style is of dancing around in a grid motion around the enemy.  There is no tank and spank strategy here unless playing on easy difficulty.\n\nThe game will take 20+ hours to complete depending on whether or not you spend the time to do the puzzles and/or find all the missing treasures that can be used for achievements or just upgrading you characters with better equipment.  The graphics are well done and the animation is quite well too.  There is an unlockable character that you must find in the dungeon which will let you run a new game once found with all new traits that will be different compared to the games regular 4 person party you've played with.

I think it's beauty lies in it's simplicity - it's basically just a 2D grid environment with 3D perspective graphics. Your party of 4 adventurers take up one tile and can only move one tile at a time either north, south, east or west. Combat is basically hack n slash but there is quite a bit of timing involved and strategy with how you use your 2 'front row' characters who can melee directly as opposed to the 2 'back row' characters who can either use ranged attacks/magic or perks to do melee attacks from afar.

So, when the game came on sale I instantly bought it. So, what did I think?\n\nA really big WELL DONE! It takes me back to my childhood, playing Dungeon Master and other titles like it with my dad. The nostalgia instantly washed over me, bathing me in that happy feeling. The game is simple in its execution and layout, but does employ various puzzles the deeper you travel into the game, making you think. Combat is good and easy to manage.\nThere is an absence of speech in the game. By that I mean that the four prisoners you command do not engage with each other or say anything. The enemies don't seem to either. Not a problem as it's not that kind of game but at times when the only sound is your footsteps it can get boring. This may have worked twenty years ago but not now in 2015.\n\nAll in all a great game and a great homage to those early dungeon crawlers.\n\n7/10","July 5, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This 13 floor, heavy puzzled, medium combat gameplay title does an excellent job at presenting new comers and old to the maze like dungeon of the Mountain of Grimrock.  Most of the puzzles work around pushing lose stones that protrude out from the walls and the combat style is of dancing around in a grid motion around the enemy.  There is no tank and spank strategy here unless playing on easy difficulty.\n\nThe game will take 20+ hours to complete depending on whether or not you spend the time to do the puzzles and/or find all the missing treasures that can be used for achievements or just upgrading you characters with better equipment.  The graphics are well done and the animation is quite well too.  There is an unlockable character that you must find in the dungeon which will let you run a new game once found with all new traits that will be different compared to the games regular 4 person party you've played with.  If enjoyed this alone is great replay value that extends the life even further to this gem.\n\nLooking for a great grid style dungeon crawler look no further to The Legend of Grimrock!","November 29, 2015","true","44.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't be fooled by the trailer and teaser videos though.  You can play through the game at that speed but you will almost definitely get killed if you try to rush through it.  Take your time and don't charge head-first into enemies.  Watch out for traps...and use them to your advantage too!

If you ever played Eye of the Beholder or Lands of Lore, you'll feel right at home. :)\n\nThe premise is similar: here, you have a grid-based first person RPG with real time battles. You control 4 characters, 2 in the front row and 2 in the back, and explore a huge dungeon full of monsters and puzzles. Its VERY similar to the first Eye of the Beholder, but with a better interface and an automap feature (that can be disabled, if you feel like it).\n\nThe graphics are great, the enemies are varied and the challenge is quite high. And the puzzles... Ahh, those can range from "I had to think a little" to "WHAT THE HELL DO I DO HERE?!?!". And believe-me: they are FUN, and give a feeling of accomplishment when you finally solve them. The sound effects are great, with realistic ambient effects that give a nice scary mood to the dungeon crawling. The only issue I have is that the game doesn't have music. But thats not a BIG issue (EoB  also didn't have music. ;) ).\n\n\nAnyway, this is one amazing game. Can be frustrating if you don't like puzzles too much, and the battle system can become repetitive after a few hours. But hey, its an amazing game that can take more than 20 hours to beat, and you can even download usermade dungeons to make the playtime even longer.\n\nThis game is very recommended. ^^","February 23, 2013","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But to me, it was mostly the gameplay that I really liked about this one. I really loved fighting in this game. It started so slow. I wasn't even sure I was liking it at first, but after an hour or so. Bam. I was in. I was in it for good. Nothing else really interested me. All I wanted was to level up, gain abilities, gear my characters, kill more stuff, walk further, discover more secrets, and of course get confused by the puzzles.\n\nGrimrock is a perfect example of a typical indie game that takes an old 90's (even maybe late 80's) gameplay design and redo it in our modern era. It is kind of a slow game. Every time you move is tile by tile and when you attack or so you click on the attack, do it on front of you, wait for the cooldown and repeat. But in the end, it's only like if it would be a turn based combat system, but sometimes, you can get a turn faster than your opponent. Also, it gets pretty hard. You can facetank the first level or 2 but the gameplay gets pretty crazy pretty fast. You discover new types of weapons and new monsters. You have to kite them in order to survive. They are hard. You have to act fast and think fast too. You are not always fighting in the same environment. It's a really great mechanic. Any limitations you may have, the monsters have them too. You have to learn their pattern, and execute yours.\n\nThere is just so much stuff to discover. The whole world is begging you to find the hidden stuff everywhere. You will have to face really hard puzzles just to keep going on the main tract. They always comes with clues, so it's really fair. But some of them are really obnoxious and if you are not in it for the puzzles, you might want to consider looking for a guide. Or maybe just relax and take notes for an hour or two because some of the puzzles really require you to do so.\n\nIt might be a good idea to look for character guides too before starting to play. The way you build and play your character really matters. Like you might completely ruin your run if you put stats in stuff you end up not using. The game gets pretty hard later. You have to have good gear and especially specialized characters. So if you consider playing, but you only have time for 1 playthrough. Do a bit of research, look out recommendations, and get the game because it is really fun to play.\n\nI give it 8/10.

Whilst in many ways Legend of Grimrock is a homage to those early games it's worth buying not just for nostalgia but because it's a great game in it's own right.\n\nIn updating the classic formula they haven't changed much, grid-based movement, advancing one tile at a time with 90 degree turns. The party consists of four different characters spread across three classes, the fighters in the front row and the more vulnerable mage and Rogue in the back row. The two in the front row will deal the most damage and take the most damage via melee combat, the two characters in the back row can use magic and ranged attacks. It's a fine balance and timing is key in order to keep your party alive.\n\nCombat suffers from the same limitations as it did in the games Grimrock is trying to re-create, wait for the enemy to enter the tile in front of you before unleashing all of your attacks then back away or strafe sideways before they have a chance to return damage. Rinse and repeat. There are obviously times this strategy doesn't always work such as being surrounded by three or more enemies or backing into a dead end but it's the strategy you'll end up using the most. It worked back in the 90s and it still works now.\n\nThere is a story loosely attached but it's not really important, this is a dungeon crawler at heart and the fun comes from fighting your way through and solving puzzles in each new level of the dungeon. There are no quests to speak of other than to survive the dungeon. During the game you pick up clues and lore via letters left by a previous prisoner called Toorum, it's a simple but effective way of building up some atmosphere and history to the adventure.\n\nIt's a bit too easy and a bit too short. I completed the game twice unlocking all achievements, completing my second play through on Hard Boiled and Doin' It Old School and even then I completed it with little effort. Aside from making the game longer I felt it would have benefited from a few NPCs, something Stonekeep did to great effect. It would have broken up the game play a bit and offered something different. However these are fairly minor disappointments to what is otherwise a superb game.\n\nLooking forward to Legend of Grimrock 2.","March 7, 2014","true","45.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Your characters need to eat occasionally or they start to recieve negative effects, forcing you to keep moving deeper towards your own doom.\n\nEverything seems well balanced, though it is balanced towards difficulty.  In order to do well in combat, you are expected to perform a ballet dance, attacking the enemies from the side and sidestepping them before they turn to face you.  You will probably end up dying a lot, so save often.

Even on easy, the puzzles become daunting, the monsters brutal, and your party's resources frighteningly scarce. If you're not careful to level up your characters efficiently right out of the gates you'll find yourself trapped in grinding mode until you're able to progress...but be warned: your food dwindles at an alarming rate and is every bit as elusive as any other form of aid. It's a no-joke type situation, and a person would do well to get into this with the mindset of committing to a hardcore adventure.\n\nNonetheless, I find the challenge a good thing. It's refreshing to have to think in a video game again and quite rewarding when you manage to proceed to another floor.

Stat based dungeon crawling. No mouse twitching skills required. No pseudo-choices that have no gameplay effects. No dialog pretending to be grey.\n\nThis is pure RPG gameplay. You create your party and fight through a dungeon of monsters finding new equipment and leveling up their skills and stats as you go along.\n\nDespite the fairly oldschool grid based gameplay it is a pretty game, with good sounds, great exploration, hard to find secrets and frustrating puzzles. The combat might seem simple from the outside but movement will play a major part in the harder battles and particularly on the harder difficulties.\n\nIf there was something bad to say about this game it was a relatively short main campaign but the addition of Steam Workshop fixed that.\n\nA great buy.","November 7, 2012","true","98.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Playing on computers since commodore 64 I have always loved games. One genre that sucked so much of my life away as a kid was dungeon crawlers. Floor after floor of single step adventure, never knowing when something will cross your path. The terror of when something is standing deep in that barely lit hall. Every step followed by theres until the faceoff tells who will step once more.\n\nThis games has it all wrapped in new beautiful graphics. EVERY thing that I loved, All that I hated.

The combat in the game is for the most part decent, it can get a little boring agaisnt single enemies, since running around em is usually enough, but when multiple enemies are present it becomes really challenging, since you must maneuver the environment skillfully to avoid getting trapped and having your weakest party members killed. Your party members can belong to 4 races and 3 different classes, each with their own characteristics, the mage class is a standout, offering the most interesting and challenging combat of all classes. The game in general is very hard but fair, with only a couple of traps and situations id describe as cheap\n\nWhen it comes to graphics, they are somewhat simple but pleasing to the eye, with an adequate amount of detail on screen and a good art direction, its understandably claustrophobic but this goes well with the game's setting and mechanics, i guess one flaw on this regard is the fact we are dealing with the overly familiar middle ages fantasy setting here\n\nthe game has a very long campaign, it took me around 19 hours to finish the main campaign and i didnt even find all the secrets, you can start a new game with different party configurations and the game has steam workshop support with over 700 custom dungeons, this thing has some serious replay value\n\nfantastic game overall, my mayor complain is the fact a game like this begs for randomization and yet it has none, it could really benefit for random dungeons with random loot, random spells, random enemies in random locations, but well i guess the game couldnt have these brilliant puzzles otherwise, and the steam workshop support does alleviate this shortcoming a bit","January 11, 2014","true","24.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

I loved it!  It was a gateway game to harder dru...erm, games like D&D, Vampire, and other table top games and eventually back to board games (I'm a proud board game geek).  Coincidentally, I also began to take a second look at dungeon crawlers.  Before this time, my largest exposure to first person RPGs of the like was Bard's Tale and I hated that game.  I bought "Eye of the Beholder" and "Shining in the Darkness" back then.  I dabbled with them, but quickly moved onto other RPGs.\nFast forward twelve years later and I picked up and finally beat Shining, giving it more respect and reigniting an appreciation for that style of RPG.  Two years after Shining, I beat Phantasy Star.  Two years after Phantasy Star, I beat Shadowgate and now Legend of Grimrock.\nI love top ten lists, cause I'm a sucker for order. Given the four dungeon crawls I beat, Grimrock would rank second after Shining.  The game is great, but I'm not sure it was enough to pull me back for more.  I enjoyed the opening music and the sound effects were atmospheric.  Graphics are decent and are done well for being programmed in Lua, but the effects do make certain reflective surfaces appear artificially shiny.  Gameplay is pretty straightforward.  Find better gear and attack bad guys.  The battle system is very simplistic as it really just comes down to right clicking.  The joy in combat actually comes from side stepping and dodging enemies to smack them.  It really is pleasing to be able to pull this off flawlessly after some practice. If done correctly, you can go floors before even getting hit.\nI played on Hard and Old School mode and it hurt me emotionally. I ended up getting lost several times, despite best efforts at maps and some enemies made me swear bad things against their offspring.\nThe story is nearly nonexistent, but tidbits of flavor in the form of Toorum's notes and the ever detached presence pushing you forward is enough as the story takes back seat to the puzzles on each floor.  "You're dumped into a dungeon, find your way out," is what is it comes down to.  The final boss was unexpected until you got down to the 12th floor and the battle wasn't overly difficult, but was a tad too long as I would dish out a few hits, drop down to the lower floor, heal, save, repeat.   The artwork for the ending is well done and I was surprised that a game this well made was done by four people.  It's worth a play if you're into this type of thing.","April 22, 2014","true","43.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Just make a great game and leave it at that.\n\nGrimrock is a modern dungeon crawler that puts age old mechanics to good use. Your goal is very simple. Guide a party through a nasty dungeon while avoiding traps, fighting monsters, collecting better equipment and leveling up.\n\nThe game is comfortable and easy to play despite the difficulty ramping up after the first few levels. For those who enjoy exploring and getting lost there's an option to switch off the automap. There are secret areas aplenty and some puzzles require a bit of thinking. Most of the time it's enough to just look everywhere and figure out how to make use of things like pressure plates, teleports or timing mechanisms.\n\nThe enemies are quite cruel and your party will become overmatched pretty quickly. Fortunately it's possible to close gates and block off some areas, and it's not necessary to kill everything. If you must kill things to progress, usually there's a way to make use of the dungeon itself and make it easier.\n\nI have played a lot of dungeon crawlers and have liked some of them. Ishar 3 was good though i never finished it. I loved Captive but finished it even less... Albion was interesting, though not exactly a classic example, and neither was Whale's Voyage. Hired Guns was incredible for it's time and hard as hell for good measure. Never could get into Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder much, though EoB was ok. Anvil of Dawn was pretty impressive. I think there's a few games i forgot, but anyway...\n\nMaybe i'm weak for Hired Guns a bit more but Legend of Grimrock is the most awesome of the bunch!","September 13, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Elements from Dungeons & Dragons and like games have been incorporated into the Legend of Grimrock and with great success. Coming from a person who normally doesn't like dungeon crawlers, this is definitely an amazing game! As if it could get any better, a dungeon editor is available, which allows players to build their own customizeable dungeons and share their creations with other players. This game contains many features for the player to explore and customize, as well as stimulating puzzles that can really boggle your mind.

The combat is very well done, and although its turn based, the fact you can move around to avoid damage is very good.

I made to fighters  with one being really tanky and the other one having a bit more damage to go in my front line and a mage and rogue for my back line, and I find it a very good setup. Theres 4 races. Human, Minotaur, Insectoid, and Lizard man, and each has their own strengths and weakness. Human is balanced all around, but isn't the best at one specific class, Minotaur is more tanky, but has low dexterity so they have a low starting hit rate, making them good tanks, Lizard man has high dexterity, but lower strength, making them better rogues, and Insectoid has higher willpower, making them better mages.\nOf course you don't have to make a character based off their stats. You could for example make a Lizard man fighter that has high dexterity, but lower strength, or a Minotaur rogue that has more health and damage, but hits less,  or all humans for all around classes.

Even in the age of Witcher 3, this game shows that grid-based movement can still be fun. I have a hard time explaining why but here are some possible factors:\n- Enemies feel more menacing because you can't circle-strafe them, play with aggro range or exploit pathfinding bugs against them like in most free movement rpgs/fpss. So the dungeon feels more claustrophobic and menacing... I definitely don't feel that in Skyrim dungeons.\n- Mapping out the dungeon square by square and paying close attention to your environment for secret buttons and switches feels great, and it's not the typical modern RPG experience. A free movement game can hardly hide a button somewhere on a wall and expect you to find it, here with the constrained views it works.\n- The grid system allows for some very smart puzzles, I have to admit I sometimes give up and consult a walkthrough, but I enjoy their presence nonetheless!\n\nAnd you get to control (read: juggle) 4 characters, so four times the RPG goodness!\n\nAll in all, you'll like it if you liked old-school RPGs like Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder and Lands of Lore: Throne of Chaos. But if you haven't played those games you should try it anyways! You might very well find that grid-based movement is a bit like pixel art: originally born of technical limitations, it can still bring a unique and interesting twist to a game.\n\nOnce you're done with this one check out Grimrock 2! It's bigger, more varied visually and less linear. The modding scene is also flourishing for both games, though I suspect mods for the second game must be better, modders have more material and a more advanced engine to work with.","December 28, 2015","true","17.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At least, I think that's the correct definition.\n\nThis took me several attempts (and a guide or two!) to get right, it's a deeply satisfying game but can also be brutally punishing as well.

I clicked "new game" and made a minotaur warrior named Finkleheimer Jones. I then noticed to option to create more characters. I said "What? Ok I guess." I made a super sneaky man named Freddy DInkledick. I decided to make 2 more people. I made a horrible bug abomination named "SHIMONA HEE HEE".\nHe is good with magic. And then I made a girl. Her name is girl and she was good at fist fighting. I started the game and realized "Ohhhhh..... it's not like I expected.....". Never the less, I got used to the controls and made it through some on the dungeon. I found a note that said "Loose rock". I couldn't find out what to do so I looked up a walkthrough. It turned out that I was supposed to find a brick with a very small crack in it. A little while later I found a wierd head that said "Help me reclaim my eye sight.". I fought some very easy snails and found a blue marble. I put the marble in one of the statues eye socket and went somewhere else. After fighting some weird tree-mushroom things I found some gear and another blue marble. I headed back to the statue and put the marble into the eye socket. Then a door opened. A skeleton with a spear and shield.

Unfortunately most of the underwhelming puzzles require hugging the wall and hunting down hidden wall switches.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are pretty barebones. The combat consist of mindless clicking and side-stepping. You'll most likely never reach the end level class skills in your first playthough without excessive grinding. The only redeemable aspect of combat is the spellcasting system. In Grimrock, using magic spells require you enter the correct combinations of runes, as if you are dialing them on a keypad. Learning new rune combinations through the scrolls found in the dungeon is always an enjoyable treat.\n\nI only beat the main campaign but it took me roughly 10 hours not counted on Steam as my internet connection was down for a period of time. The user submitted workshop dungeons could hypothetically add even more unique playtime with this but I haven't had a clue if they are as good as the main game. Grimrock is well worth the full price by itself, though.\n\nOne final note is that if you are of faint of heart you might not enjoy this game as it throws you a ton of creepy creatures that run around in the darkness of the dungeon.","December 1, 2013","true","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Legend Of Grimrock starts you off with 4 prisoners, in a mountain, consisting of 13 levels. These levels are filled with puzzles, evil creatures, traps and more and, obviously, it gets increasingly difficult along the way.\nHowever, the difficulty is a bit random at times. Near the end it took me literally minutes to take down one enemy, even though I had some proper spells and weapons. There are moments where you will be overwhelmed by quite a few enemies. Remember to save often, and try not to lose any of your party members before you reached the end of a level. I had to finish a level with just one rogue and it took me 3-4x longer than it should've.\nThe game can be finished in about 10-12 hours (in-game time) but in reality it should take you about twice as long.\nYou will die several times, and some puzzles require thinking, experimenting or just plain luck.\nBut despite the difficulty, I did have a great time with it !\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","April 27, 2012","true","17.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Blending a close to perfect mix of horror, suspense, mystery, puzzles, and combat, Legend of Grimrock enticed my inner adventurer. The game itself is quite enjoyable, the grim-dark atmosphere lends itself perfectly to the setting, and the tile-based movement adds an interesting mechanic to it all. The is a game where you will make mistakes, there’s no avoiding that, you will fumble and fall and lose party members and grumble as you backtrack to a crystal. You’ll jump and curse when spiders sneak up on you, groan and rage as traps trigger and surround you with enemies, and kick yourself for not saving more often. You’ll experiment in the skill tree and find out that you’ve invested in something useless, or that you’ve given points wrong, or expended one-use items on the wrong character. Sometimes you’ll wish you’d taken the other loot, or wondered what was in the other locked room, so you’ll reload and find out, then compare before reloading again and deciding. You’ll rage as monsters surround you, you’ll rage as you find a character suddenly out of ammo, mana, poisoned, or just plain dead. You’ll rage as you run from Ogres, you’ll rage as Fire Elementals hit your back-row characters, you’ll rage as you’re confronted with new horrors the dungeon has to offer. But most of all, you will rage at the puzzles.\nThe game does not hold your hand, which is both beautiful and mildly infuriating at times. There’s a lot of trial an error when it comes to solving puzzles, and you will die a lot trying. But that’s what this game is, a lot of trial and error. It can be harsh, but it’s never unfair, so long as you use your brain and save every 5 minutes. The only genuine complaint I have with the game is the inventory/loot system; space was simple to manage so long as you saved your sacks and boxes, but the weight mechanic was a little challenging at times, when I discover that the Kayran Nipple I just looted and put in a character’s inventory has weighed them down and has made the party slow as hell. What really got me was that there was no loot selling or anything like that, things just became obsolete and you had no reason to keep them, other than maybe convenient replacements for rocks.\nAll in all I love this game to death, and had that rare compulsion to play it every second I had free time, though the game is best enjoyed, in my opinion, in longer sessions. That way you remember all the little details you were going over and you don’t miss out on something. That being said, I went over the entire dungeon with a fine-toothed come and still managed to miss some secrets, as the statistics will tell you. Half-way through my first playthrough I realized my lizardman rogue was relatively useless when I could have just gone double fighter mage combo, since I had teched him into ranged and throwing. And that was a mistake. You MUST specialize your character if you want to survive, if you choose to go down swords, you stick with swords, if you want axes, don’t switch out for maces because you found one and it was better, and try to keep to one or two disciplines of magic.\nFor anyone who likes grim-dark fantasy, dungeon crawling, RPG’s, mystery, puzzles, and/or tile-based combat, Legend of Grimrock is definitely a must. Your inner loot-♥♥♥♥♥ will be pleased, your inner puzzler will be perplexed, and your inner adventurer will be grinning all the while. Enter Mount Grimrock, and make your way to the horrors within, best of luck.\n","February 13, 2014","true","36.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

These kinds of puzzles may have its place in the hardest difficulty settings, when tring to get optional but desireable artifacts, and on low specs machines, but definitely not in the easiest difficulty settings, not to get artifacts that are required to finish the game, not in a computer well within the specs recommended. The forums recommend lowering the video settings, but no player should have to go to that lengths. Said time puzzles totally ruin the game. I wish I could get my money or my time back, but can't. I will, however, never buy from you again.","April 6","false","26.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game sticks to its classic roots. There is a smooth and simple skill tree, races (that dont play too much of a part), and plenty of suprises and new foes to keep the game intresting. The game also supports Steam's workshop, to share and try out new dungeons. I had lots of fun scanning stone temple walls for hidden buttons, finding out new puzzles, such as a pressure plate that needs to be weighed down with a rock, in order to pass through.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to alot of my friends, but the old-school genre isn't for everyone. If you are used to a game such as Dark Souls II or the Elder Scrolls V, this may not be for you.\n\nMy rating 8.5 / 10\n\nKeeps you coming back for more!\n","July 22, 2014","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's really old school with lots of modern elements.\n\nSo, what's the story? Well, there sort of isn't a story, ok, yes, there is, but it's not so essential to the main plot. The plot is that three people accused of crimes are thrown into a dunegon and must escape. So they must survive while there are monsters everywhere, disgusting food, a strange dream that happens sometimes when you rest, creepy sounds and amazing atmosphere. The graphics add so much to the atmosphere too because they look very amazing and somehow this game runs very well on my terrible PC. I wish more games did that.\n\nThere are 3 main parts to this game and I will review each aspect one by one:\n\nCombat\n\nPuzzle Solving\n\nExploration\n\nCombat-The combat in this game is an old school style one, you're party is in 4 people all linked together and you walk on square tiles. You have to gather up weapons from monsters, hidden rooms and exploring the place as so. The magic combat system and the magic system in general is you have to combine a certain combination of runes. You can find these combinations on scrolls which you find and by leveling up the certain types of skills in the game. Speaking of the skills, the skills are pretty much subclasses in classes. The 3 classes in this game are fighter, rouge and mage. (There's a fourth one too but you will have to discover that for yourself) Each class has different abilities, attributes, purposes, uses, etc. There's also traits you can have on each character. There's lots to choose from and some races have their own trait. The 4 races are Human, Minotaur, Lizardman and Insectoid. Each are good for their own class, like how the Lizardman makes a good rogue and how the minotaur makes a good fighter.\n\nPuzzle solving-The puzzles in this game are diffucult. I had a LONG time trying to solve them. But after solving all of them, it was all worth it since it was fun and rewarding.\n\nExploration-Without exploration, I don't think this game would've been so great. There are TONS of secrets everywhere. Some are easy to find, some take forever to find. For all those loot lovers out there, you will love this game because of all the loot and what it takes to get it. To go into a little more depth of exploration is the moving system, to turn you can't just turn all the way around, to do that, you would have to turn sideways and look sideways again since you look always in a 90 degree angle.\n\nTo conclude, I would love to say Legend of Grimrock is a great modern day game and I would recommend it to anyone.","December 21, 2014","true","136.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Great puzzles, great combat mechanics, great story and (most of all) IMMERSION. It's saddening so many games lack this. You actually feel like you're trapped inside the dungeon; you actually feel scared when you know there's a stronger enemy ahead, instead of simply being more careful; you actually feel that if you take damage you're screwed, unlike some games *ahem* CoD *ahem*. Honestly, the only not so great thing that I can think about this game is that *sometimes* you move 2 squares instead of 1 because you tapped w twice by accident, which may cause you to fall into a pit.

I tried going back and playing older ones like might and magic games but they just don't cut it over time. All I can say is Legend of Grimrock is EXACTLY what I've been waiting for. It takes all the fun, excitement, and strategy out of those old games and brings it to the current level of gameplay. It removes all the buggyness of older games, it replaces the confusingly blurred graphics where it's easy to miss an important item with beautiful design, poor puzzles with strategic challenges, choppy fighting with challenging battles, etc. I LOVED this game, I had so much fun playing it, and with the added function of a popular mod community and a dungeon editor it is really a top tier experience. If you like RPGs, or dungeon crawls, or have been craving what I have then look no further: this game is TONS of fun.","August 1, 2013","true","34.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Somehow I assumed it would be shorter since it has downloadable levels through Steamworks.\n\nI enjoyed playing it since it is a throw back to the original days of PC gaming and RPG's.  Took me about 17 hours to complete with breaks/getting lost.  I tried not to use any walkthroughs but I had to at the last area only to go... duh....\n\nThe combat is slow pace to start but by floor 8 out of 13, you need to start being fast and moving around monsters or you'll die.  You can create your own team/race/class set up with four chars and create your own playstyle.  I had two tanks (sword/mace) and two mages (fire/earth).\n\nThe downside is I started to get bored around floor 9, but decided to rush to the end and beat it.  Luckily floors 11-13 are somewhat qucik.  Cool if you dig old PC gamestyle, but most will likely be turned off by a game like this.","January 8, 2013","true","17.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I may be the exception to the rule, but I think even a player new to the type of game can find it enjoyable.

But the thing it excels at is the puzzles. The creators have achieved just the perfect level of difficulty. Plenty of puzzles that are not easy enough (plague of modern games) but not too tough on the other hand to make you quit the game. You get the satisfaction of solving a puzzle without hitting your head on the wall (except for maybe a couple of cases :)), one of the cornerstones of great gameplay.\n\nOverall the game is great and cannot recommend it enough!

As an avid retro-gamer that still boots sometimes DosBox to relive the classics, LoG is a wonderful homage to the old RPGs. The game is a fresh breath in a world where FPS like games take over all GENRES. This game just brought back my Eye of The Beholder nostalgia back. Its solid, simple and some of the secrets and puzzles are actually fun. If you expect this to be a "spam the attack button for lootz" game, go somewhere else. This is a slow, leisurely stride in the pools of nostalgia. Well worth it for me, a craver of the "classic" taste.

I myself haven't been brave enough to give this playthrough a try yet, but I still find it to be a wonderful option for true gluttons of punishment.\n\nAs deeply rewarding as it is challenging, with lots of replay value, and great Steam Workshop options to keep the game new for even the most frequent players, LoG is a for sure winner. I'll be eagerly awaiting the release of the second game, ready to brave the dangers between the dungeon walls once more.","June 11, 2014","true","25.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have never had a game ever before take me back so very far into my gaming past. Way back, there was a game called Dungeon Master. It was the first adventure game I played, and this game replicates it perfectly in terms of gameplay. The game engine, the puzzles, everything about it just screams that this is one game that will take up a lot of your time.\n\nThe gameplay itself is solid. You move on a grid, everything happens in real time, you have to eat, you sleep to regain health and mana, your torches burn out. So much management that most modern adventure games seem to miss, that add to the experience. The puzzles are well thought out, take effort to solve and are satisfying to get past. Combat is fast paced, requiring thought as well as a fast clicking finger.\n\nThis is one game that remains true to the classic, old adventure games of gaming yore.

Legend of Grimrock combines an old-school dungeon crawler mixed with puzzles and RPG elements.\n\nSynopsis: You control a group of 4 prisoners trying to escape Grimrock by solving puzzles and fighting monsters. Puzzles can be as simple as a hidden button on a wall or as complex that things may take time and patience to solve.\nGameplay: The best way I can describe this game is if you mixed D&D and Myst, with tons of aggravation. The Legend of Grimrock isn’t as one dimensional as the art style and movement may lead you to believe. Many of the puzzles will leave you scratching your head and swearing there isn’t a solution. The other aspect of the game which I believe could use some work is the battle system. As intricate as the puzzles can be, the system to fight monsters throughout gets repetitive and leaves a lot to be desired. It’s a mix between real time and turn based, with a focus on the formation of your team. If your characters use all short range abilities, you have to swap one of the two, for the one you want to attack. Many monsters can be defeated without much strategy and sometimes become a hindrance to trying to solve a puzzle. There are four classes you can choose from as you customize your perfect party, but very little direction or tutorial on how to use each class. I found myself having to look up a guide on how to use a mage to even understand what magic could be used. I have logged thirty-eight hours on this title (some of it was afk during a multiplayer game), but at less than $5, 20 hours of engrossing gameplay and a strong community following, this game is more than worth it.\n\nPositive:\n+Challenging puzzles are intricate enough to make you feel clever\n+Game can be saved at any point.\n+Large community following where content can be downloaded.\n\nNegative\n-Battle system can get repetitive.\n-Not all classes are created equal.\n\nArt Style/Graphics:  Think old school, first person, dungeon crawler. This game is a great blend of classic nostalgia with a jolt of current 3d graphics. Much of the game in spent in the darkness with two to three walls around you, but this doesn’t mean the creators were lazy. Attention is paid to simple cracks in the wall, to how the light bounces off each wall. To speak more about the lighting; this plays a huge role on the tone of the gameplay. The torches on the walls (or the ones you drop on the ground) limit vision to what can be around the next turn, which makes you feel like you are actually there.\n\nPositive:\n+Lighting is engaging.\n+Can be played on lower-end computers.\n+Can be played in Windowed Mode\n\nNegative:\n-Characters and enemies could be upgraded.\n\nSoundtrack/Sound effects: This was one of the biggest negatives to the game for me. For the 20 hours I played, much of the time was spent trying to solve puzzles. To solve puzzles you have to explore the dungeon, often falling to lower parts. Hearing my characters yell as they were falling, over and over, got very annoying. This is only increased by the often reused sounds of the characters attacking and grunting in every fight they encounter. On a positive note, the minor sounds of metal doors closing, walls moving, or crackling of the fire, add a realistic aspect and can be heard in surround sound.\n\nPositive:\n+Simple sounds of environment\n\nNegative:\n-Repetitive\n\nCost: I personally bought this game in a Humble Bundle (only paying $5), but that being said, I would wait for this game to go on sale. $14 (full price) is a bit too much for the amount of gameplay in the standalone. At 75% off ($3.75) a case can be made. This does not include the amount of community related additions on the workshop; which is extensive\nPositive:\n\n+HUGE community created content\n\nNegative:\n-Full price not worth standalone\n","December 13, 2013","true","38.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you've ever heard/played a game called Stonekeep (late 1990s), you'll enjoy this game too.  Well designed, immersive, and an absolutely beautiful sound track.  Some skill is required to be a magic caster / use magic in your party, but if you get good at it, you really feel you've earned the title "mage."\n\nOverall Score:  Worth Getting (Niche game)  -- ( 79/100)\n\nGameplay:  (56/60 points)\n\nMechanics (35/35 points) – rules/physics/noticeable glitches\nI have never encountered any bugs while playing Grimrock.  The rules of the world fit very well with the challenges you face and you never feel like the game is cheating.\n\nControls (8/10 points) – ease of operation / button dynamics\nControls are very basic, left, right, back, forward, casting is difficult, but in a good way where you feel really good when you successfully cast a spell.  My only beef with the controls was inventory managment.  Trying to maintain 4 peoples inventory was very cumbersome at times.\n\n\nDifficulty ( 5/5 points) – how hard is it to progress & does this difficulty work for or against the player\nThe game trains you as you go.  The first few levels are about learning how things work.  It's a good build up and by later in the game, it's about exploration, adapting and facing challenges that force you to use everything you've learned up to that point.\n\n\nImmersion ( 4/5 points) –  very subjective:  Being drawn into the game\nThe environments are realistic enough and the sounds and music will make you forget about everything around you.  The desire to save as often as possible and searching for secrets areas and having to look up a few solutions was the only thing that broke immersion for me.\n\n\nFun ( 3/5 points)– very subjective: other enjoyment factors\nVERY fun, but not so fun that I actually finished the game.  It was still excellent though, I've gotten further into this game than most.\n\n\nContent:  (20/35 points)\n\nStory (13/15 points) – Does it exist, coherent, presentation of, and does it enhance game play?\nThe opening was excellent, there's little scraps of papers and books that tell you more of the story thorugh the ponderings of a former "inmate."  Also every level of the game tells a different story and as you move further in, the very walls and status hint at darker things that have gone into the formation of Grimrock.  I can't say that the story is deep, but it is enjoyable.\n\n\nCharacters (5/10 points) – Interesting, well developed, work with gameplay and story\nThe characters are fairly standard fare for your Dungeons and Dragons -esque setting, but the manual had some great backstory on each.  It doesn't play into the game, but was good flavor text.\n\n\n“S.S.D.D.” value (2/10 points) – abilities, roles, tools, NPCs, and general world setting uniqueness\nVery typical for a dungeon crawl.\n\n\nGamer Parent Factors:  (3/5 GOLDEN points)\n\n- (WIN) Ability to save / pause and come back later to pick it up right away again\n\n- (WIN) Ability to progress during short gameplay sessions (30 mins – 1.5 hours)\n\n- (WIN) Replay value and game length not related to required repetitive grinding to increase stats\n\n-  (NO)  Ability to play game with spouse or offspring\n\n-  (NO)  Availability on multiple platforms\n\nGamerDad Game Reviews -- Purpose and Criteria\n\nThe purpose of GamerDad Game reviews is to evaluate ‘aged’ games that have been on the market long enough to experience a substantial price drop from their original industry standard price.\n\nReviewing games towards the end of their life cycle will offer an updated consumer valuation of the game based on if known issues have been fixed since release, value of optional DLC (Downloadable Content made available after initial game release) to gameplay, and if the entertainment return on investment is worth the new price point.","April 12, 2012","true","20.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You're dumped on top of a mountain and have to fight and puzzle your way through a series of dungeon levels in order to get to the exit at the bottom. There's an opening graphic about being condemned to the maze and offered a slim chance at survival as punishment for unspecified crimes, like eating puppies or promoting Justin Bieber's music or somesuch. Unimportant; it's a reason for your four-person party to wind up stuck in a dungeon. Players of the Recent Might and Magic X: Legacy will find it has less involved, less tactically sophisticated combat but much tougher puzzles (it pains me to admit that I got stumped fairly early on); you look for a hidden switch that opens a door somewhere on the other end of the level that leads to a dead end with another switch disguised as a torch sconce that when pulled opens the gate you saw three turns back which leads to a scrap of paper with a password on it for that magical barrier you couldn't get past before...\n\nI've given Legend of Grimrock a thumbs-up because it seems to do what it set out to do: it provides a series of tougher and tougher dungeon puzzles for the player to obsess over, with some simple combat to leaven it. The game's a bit like extra-dark chocolate in that respect: people who already find it to their taste will love it, while people who don't will find it has a bitter, gritty flavour that sort of reminds them of something they like.","September 12, 2014","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Great dungeon crawler with a good story and RPG elements.  Fun and interesting levels to explore that are fortunately not so complicated that you'd need graph paper for mapping.  The only thing I didn't like was that to defeat enemies past a certain point you often have to sort of strafe and attack to kill them - I don't mind fighting like that in a more action game, but for a game like this, that mechanic felt a little out of place.  Still, a great game for an old school type dungeon crawler RPG.  Highly recommended.","October 27, 2015","true","36.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PezOfDoom/recommended/207170/","PezOfDoom","PezOfDoom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PezOfDoom/","283 products in account","Summary:\nGrimrock is a first person (first party in this case) dungeon crawl.  If you've ever heard/played a game called Stonekeep (late 1990s), you'll enjoy this game too.  Well designed, immersive, and an absolutely beautiful sound track.  Some skill is required to be a magic caster / use magic in your party, but if you get good at it, you really feel you've earned the title "mage."\n\nOverall Score:  Worth Getting (Niche game)  -- ( 79/100)\n\nGameplay:  (56/60 points)\n\nMechanics (35/35 points) – rules/physics/noticeable glitches\nI have never encountered any bugs while playing Grimrock.  The rules of the world fit very well with the challenges you face and you never feel like the game is cheating.\n\nControls (8/10 points) – ease of operation / button dynamics\nControls are very basic, left, right, back, forward, casting is difficult, but in a good way where you feel really good when you successfully cast a spell.  My only beef with the controls was inventory managment.  Trying to maintain 4 peoples inventory was very cumbersome at times.\n\n\nDifficulty ( 5/5 points) – how hard is it to progress & does this difficulty work for or against the player\nThe game trains you as you go.  The first few levels are about learning how things work.  It's a good build up and by later in the game, it's about exploration, adapting and facing challenges that force you to use everything you've learned up to that point.\n\n\nImmersion ( 4/5 points) –  very subjective:  Being drawn into the game\nThe environments are realistic enough and the sounds and music will make you forget about everything around you.  The desire to save as often as possible and searching for secrets areas and having to look up a few solutions was the only thing that broke immersion for me.\n\n\nFun ( 3/5 points)– very subjective: other enjoyment factors\nVERY fun, but not so fun that I actually finished the game.  It was still excellent though, I've gotten further into this game than most.\n\n\nContent:  (20/35 points)\n\nStory (13/15 points) – Does it exist, coherent, presentation of, and does it enhance game play?\nThe opening was excellent, there's little scraps of papers and books that tell you more of the story thorugh the ponderings of a former "inmate."  Also every level of the game tells a different story and as you move further in, the very walls and status hint at darker things that have gone into the formation of Grimrock.  I can't say that the story is deep, but it is enjoyable.\n\n\nCharacters (5/10 points) – Interesting, well developed, work with gameplay and story\nThe characters are fairly standard fare for your Dungeons and Dragons -esque setting, but the manual had some great backstory on each.  It doesn't play into the game, but was good flavor text.\n\n\n“S.S.D.D.” value (2/10 points) – abilities, roles, tools, NPCs, and general world setting uniqueness\nVery typical for a dungeon crawl.\n\n\nGamer Parent Factors:  (3/5 GOLDEN points)\n\n- (WIN) Ability to save / pause and come back later to pick it up right away again\n\n- (WIN) Ability to progress during short gameplay sessions (30 mins – 1.5 hours)\n\n- (WIN) Replay value and game length not related to required repetitive grinding to increase stats\n\n-  (NO)  Ability to play game with spouse or offspring\n\n-  (NO)  Availability on multiple platforms\n\nGamerDad Game Reviews -- Purpose and Criteria\n\nThe purpose of GamerDad Game reviews is to evaluate ‘aged’ games that have been on the market long enough to experience a substantial price drop from their original industry standard price.\n\nReviewing games towards the end of their life cycle will offer an updated consumer valuation of the game based on if known issues have been fixed since release, value of optional DLC (Downloadable Content made available after initial game release) to gameplay, and if the entertainment return on investment is worth the new price point.","April 12, 2012","true","20.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewizardkiller/recommended/207170/","thewizardkiller","The Chosen One","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewizardkiller/","115 products in account","A throwback game to old-school Dungeon Crawler RPGs, Legend of Grimrock easily succeeds at that, with a feature that, I feel, should’ve been in all those old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear. It plays like one, it has absolutely no music, but rather, ambient sounds like none of them, it has hard fighting monsters like one, and in this review, that’s only scratching the surface. Let’s dig a bit deeper, and see what this game really offers.\n\nGameplay: As mentioned earlier, Legend of Grimrock is a throwback to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of the late 80s to the early 90s (or at least, I think that’s when these games were hot) and it succeeds at what it set out to do, too. It’s setting is that of Mount Grimrock, a large dungeon inside a mountain, and every bit of it is in first-person. The combat is somewhat fast-paced, but not so fast that you have to be faster than greased lightning to be able to get through fights. Their are helpful hints, if a bit obscure in places, that tell you how to proceed, and plenty of puzzles and traps to slog your way through.\n\nStory: The story in Legend of Grimrock feels a lot more fleshed-out than those games from which it takes its inspiration, such as the Dungeon Master games. Basically, though, the whole story amounts to this: you and your party members are prisoners convicted of an unknown crime, and you have been promised your freedom if you can escape from the dungeons of Mount Grimrock. Problems is, is that no one has ever managed to escape from Mount Grimrock, or at least, those who’ve been pardoned in this manner never have. It’s cliché, yes, but it works as a good driving force, because you’ll want to see what the King or whoever it is that sentenced your party to be pardoned in this way since you’ll inevitably be the first ones to ever escape this fate, right? But it actually goes deeper than that, because your party has dreams telling them of an original prisoner in the dungeon who knows the way out. I won’t say anymore on the story, because then I’d have to spoil it for you, and that wouldn’t be any fun, now would it?\n\nMusic: As I said earlier, this game only has one particular song, and it only plays on the title screen. It’s pretty good, too!\n\nGraphics: The graphics look like about what you’d be expecting from a Dungeon Crawler that takes its inspiration from Dungeon Master, but with a modern day take on them. They look like graphics that you’d see in a modern day game.\n\nNow, that’s everything that’s in the game itself, but the game’s true strength really shines with the built-in Dungeon Editor. That’s right! Now you can make the Dungeon Master dungeons of your dreams with a bit more interactivity, thanks to Lua scripting and the Drag-and-Drop editing power of the Dungeon Editor for Legend of Grimrock.\n\nOverall, an amazing successor to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear, Legend of Grimrock is an obvious success, and it’s one in which I hope you can escape the shackles that will undoubtedly hold you to it and keep you coming back for more!","May 6","true","16.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This will bring back fond memories of the dungeon crawlers of yore.  They even have a mode where there is no automap so you can sharpen your pencils and get out the graph paper (with an achievement for completing the game this way, naturally).   The setup is basic - you create 4 characters, chosing between classes (Fighter, Rogue, Mage) and races (human, minotaur, insectoid, and lizardmen).  You have the basic stats such as strength, dexterity, willpower, and vitality, and are given a pool of points to assign them at the beginning as well as selecting a couple of traits to your character (Athletic, agile, strong mind, etc).  Your initial stats will only be increased by leveling up skills - and they display the complete tree and bonuses earned with each level so you can plan accordingly.\n\nFor the base game, there is a good mix of combat and puzzles to solve, though items and maps are static - no random loot here.  However, the game comes with a dungeon editor and there is a healthy selection in the Steam Workshop to give you plenty of replayability.\n\nI've beaten the game twice - the second time was a bit of achievement farming as well as trying different character builds.  The sound is adequate - no award winning voicework apart from some grunts, there are just a couple of cutscenes, all of which can be clicked through very quickly, and the bones of the story are pretty bare.  You're all convicts that have been awarded a pardon - which you receive once you are cast into the pit at the top of Mount Grimrock.  From there, you are working your way down, following the path of some other criminal who left notes behind that provide a little bit of background, clues to puzzles, and so on. This is NOT turn-based - you click each character's action and wait for the cooldowns to expire before that character can act again. As such, you can maneuver around in combat, dodging, moving out of range, or even circling around behind the enemy for a backstabbing attack (if your rogue has that skill).\n\nI recommend the game for fans of the old RPG crawlers.","May 2","true","59.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've played them before, and roguelikes. Against all expectations, I beat the hardest of hardcore modes on Dungeons of Dredmor, I went through a couple playthroughs of Dark Souls, all that stuff. When I lose in those games, I feel it's because I did something to mess up, missed a move or made a wrong decision.\n\nWith this game, there is no wrong decision to make, because no matter what you decide, you get thrown up against a difficulty spike that you can't possibly be ready for until you die at least once to it. If it isn't the obtuse puzzles that only make sense about half the time, it's the enemies that pop out of nowhere, can take forty times as many hits as any of your characters, and deal out damage that can kill you in seconds in a straight fight.\n\nI know a lot of people may disagree with this, and they certainly have a right to. But to me, this game isn't a challenge, or a dungeon crawl. It's just mashing my face against random walls in the hopes of finding a hidden switch, and getting killed a dozen times by the same overpowered monster group until I find the hidden cheese tactic that somehow lets me go down another floor.","May 10, 2014","false","19.5"," 43 of 88 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","43","88","0","1"

The base systems it sets up are sound, their levelling and RPG and class/team building mechanics are all solid and interesting.\n\nThen the combat throws all that out the window and makes you essentially try and play an FPS on a grid by circle strafing and dodging and such. There is little sense of type weaknesses, formation shuffling, tactical considerations, or any other interesting RPG type mechanics; just running around enemies and tapping the attack buttons until they die.\n\nThis gets progressively worse throughout the game, with more and more "bullet sponge" enemies, until what might be the worst final boss fight I've had the displeasure to experience in a long time, in terms of lore, mechanics and comprehensibility.\n\nMaybe try that new Might and Magic game if you want an actual dungeon crawler, instead of a gridlocked FPS.","February 10, 2015","false","23.1"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

If you hold down a movement key you can over shoot the spot you wanted to stop at. This because a big problem when dealing with timed puzzles and traps.\n\nThe one thing that made me drop the game is that timing is directly related to screen resolution and graphic card power.  There were traps and puzzles that were impossible to get through without lowering my resolution to reduce the speed of the trap.   Now this is mainly a hardware issue for people that good graphic cards.

However, combat nothing but tediously waiting for cooldowns to finish so that I can click for the next attack. Enemies have way too much health, so fights are too long (hint: more enemies with lower health makes for better games). Making the game real time rather than turn based was a major mistake, because it turns everything into a reflex clickfest.

Furthermore, this review is going to be different from most of the others, in that I'm going to focus on the controls. Read on and you'll see why.\n\nEssentially, this is the most awkward-controlling dungeon crawl I've ever played. It shouldn't be actively difficult to get my characters to do what I want. A lot of people defending the control scheme will say that this is how the old games played. Which old games, exactly, had controls like this? I played the old Wizardry. I played the old Might and Magic. I played the old Ultima. Those are the first in the CRPG genre, and they all managed to be much easier to handle than this. FFS, the old Wizardry games made you type out the spell names! No, scrambling to manage a UI during real-time combat doesn't simulate the rush of combat--it just serves to frustrate me. Having to click on a small area of the screen with speed and accuracy isn't nostalgic, since all the firsts of the genre didn't have mouse input. It's scientifically-proven bad design. Yes, there's real science behind it: it's called Fits's Law. Maybe if you're a twitch gamer you'll like this, but I just found it frustrating and tiresome.\n\nI grew up playing the firsts of the genre, and Grimrock doesn't resemble them at all--or if it does, I wasn't able to get to a point where I could appreciate it, because the controls are so bloody difficult. This game was an exercise in awkwardness and frustration that I haven't felt while gaming in a very long time. Don't confuse bad game design with challenge: the two are distinctly different.","December 21, 2015","false","2.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

Not amazing, or fantastic, but very good. The puzzles can be diabolical, and the boss fight at the end can be a frustrating test of patience, but overall, Almost Human did a great job with it.\n\nCombat is almost always fast-paced and hectic (trying to click on the right runes for a mage while trying to dodge attacks from multiple enemies is a blast), the graphics are rather impressive, the puzzles are satisfying (for the most part), and the variety of enemies is very welcome indeed.\n\nMany games of this genre can get boring, as they are truly turn-based, and you can take your time, but not with this game. Your characters have a food (hunger) bar that continually shrinks, even when standing still. Add to that the fact that food is not by any means a common find in the dungeons, and you have a real motivation to always keep moving.\n\nThere were a few places where you could grind for food, and I wish I hadn't discovered that fact, as it took away quite a bit of the urgency of the situation. If/when you play through, I would strongly suggest you not take advantage of any grinding opportunities you come across (they won't be too easy to find anyway), as the game is fair about food, and will give you as much as you need. With my grind, by the end of the game, all my characters were slightly overburdened with food that I refused to throw away.\n\nCharacter designing is a lot of fun, and trying different combos of teams adds quite a bit of replay value, although certain teams work a lot better together than others.\n\nPuzzle solutions are always sensical, although some of them are rather esoteric. Clues on pieces of paper and random items you find are almost always relevant to puzzles, so keep your wits about you.\n\nOverall, this game is an example of just about everything done just about perfectly. It's not an easy game, but it's not punishingly difficult either. It never asked for more than I could give, but it was always close.\n\nPlus, indie team. Always awesome.","February 17, 2013","true","11.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Puzzles in general would be fine, but they're mostly just walking the wrong way until you find the right one. Rarely there are real puzzles to solve.\n\nThere are some good things I can't deny, the game looks great and would be a real blast if it would be a real dungeoncrawler. A good thing is you can play the playermade dungeons.\n\nThe original game though just gives me the feeling it was designed this way, to mislead the player into thinking the game had decent length. (really short)\n\nI bought the game at full prize, because of the overhyped reviews people give and the misleading promoting the makers give on their side, I quote directly from their website: " The ultimate dungeon crawling RPG", which isn't the case. (too short, nothing inovative, monster fighting is boring)\n\nHope this helps someone, expect alot of puzzles! And by a lot, I mean a lot! If it's something you don't mind. Then feel free to buy it, its great if you like to play puzzle into puzzle into a bit dungeoncrawling into more puzzles.\n\nAtleast the Custom maps are worth a try!\n\nTLDR: 80% Puzzle 20% Dungeon, not the other way around!

By that I mean theres little depth to the RPG elements or they simply do not properly work. Playing a rogue for example, putting points into Missile weapons gains you Dex points, which affect your ability to hit in Melee, but not from a distance. Ranged attacks always hit something in front of you. Dex does not increase your damage with ranged atacks so by extension if you focus on using a bow for one of your characters, you'll build a stat that is nearly useless to them. This is by definition bad game design.\n\nFurthermore, I admire loot being hard to comeby, but not supporting all builds from the outset is dumb. If you're doing the above and making one of your characters an archer, then I hope to god you find the secret bow on level 3 or else you've been literally screwed. This is a game that should promote and reward exploration with better and special equipment but instead twists your arm into looking up secrets online to get the most basic of equipment.\n\nOverall, if you love the concept of this game then buy the sequel or stick to user made dungeons.","May 12, 2015","false","6.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I had fun while playing it for sure, but the visuals are reptetitive, the interface is weird, and the controls are awful—trying to be cute and nostalgic by only allowing you to turn 90 degrees at a time.  But the worst part is that a game so full of secret buttons and levers and rooms requires you to find most of them.  This is a HARD game, and I can't imagine being able to complete it without finding a decent chunk of all of the tiny little hidden buttons in the walls, which means carefully inspecting every single surface of the dungeon, often with some sort of time requirement, or alt-tabbing to a guide (this one's awesome by the way: http://guides.gamepressure.com/legendofgrimrock/ ).

If you are looking for an old-school RPG this is not what you're looking for.  I would go so far as to say the suggestion that it is an old-school RPG is borderline false advertising.\n\nThis is a puzzle game wrapped in the trappings of an old-school RPG, and played in real time rather than turn-based.  Combat is a dance puzzle with button mashing.  There are no tactics.  Magic is encumbered with rune selection, which must be done in real time, making casters a liability.  Rogues are just another combatant, there is no thieving.\n\nThere is no story to speak of.  When you're not solving puzzles, you are seeking hidden buttons and pattern differences in wall tiles.\n\nIs it fun?  Yes, it's not bad as far as puzzle games go, nor is it anything special.  Yet, it's nothing but a puzzle game and that wasn't what I wanted.  I usually avoid Indie games, and now I will never buy an Indie game again.  I feel like I was conned, and robbed, and that this game has been intentionally marketed to fool old-school gamers for profit.","March 15, 2014","false","8.5"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","0"

Really, I did. I'm all about old school RPGs, it comes with the Jim Sterling seal of approval, and I enjoy games that let me throw my own content in a bit, like with the portriats...\n\nThat said, I couldn't do it.\n\nThe combat is tiresome, tedious, and unrewarding. The interface is clunky and amatuerish. The bestiary is lifeless, the puzzels are unfulfilling, and worst of all, there's no dialog for all intents and purposes. This is as souless of a dungeon crawler as I've ever seen, devoid of wit, story, motivation, and wholly undeserving of the level of hype it's gotten.\n\nI can put up with it's old timey grid gimmick - maybe even enjoy the novelty some. But that's all that it brings to the table, and it isn't anywhere near enough. The interface needs a complete overhaul, the combat needs a lot of work, and for the love of Skyrim put some plot and dialog in! A straight up dungeon crawl can work, but you really need to frame it better - give me more of a world, give me context and a story. Give me details and motivation and reward me with more than a set of stairs and a big spoonful of the exact same thing I just did.\n\nI gave it a chance, and it isn't for me.","November 2, 2014","false","9.2"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","0"

It's realtime, although most enemies' movements have LONG delays. You navigate on a strict grid and cannot cut diagonals. The combat consists of clicking weapons and hoping for special attacks, or clicking magic and casting your own damn spell. Not that the rune system really helps you.\n\nGraphics: look closely and you'll notice that the texture on the face of every wall is exactly the same. The graphics, even aside from the walls, are pretty lazy, although the monsters are fine. However, the headbobbing of moving around is a wonderful way to get sick.\n\nAudio: no music. Just generic, boring ambience and a single audio effect for each monster that you get to hear 20 times a minute.\n\nDifficulty: dungeon crawler. It has difficulty settings, although I have only played one difficulty thus far, so I've no idea what the difficulty affects.\n\nSynopsis: hardly worth $15(but I got it cheaper) unless you're really into dungeon crawlers.","January 7, 2013","false","6.0"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

The game almost perfectly emulates  the gameplay of the classic series while bringing the visuals nicely up to date.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nSimilar to another Classic Series (Elder Scrolls), LoG casts you in the role of Prisoners being exiled for unknown reasons into the catacombs of Mount Grimrock. The focus of the gameplay is on combat and puzzle solving, the latter of which can sometimes be maddeningly frustrating, but very satisfying when you finally work it through.\n\nWhile you have complete freedom to go anywhere you want within the dungeon movement is grid based and fixed to the cardinal directions, up, down, left, right, and turning.  Some people (mostly new school gamers) find this limitation madden and arbitrary, but it plays an important role in gameplay and tactics.\n\n\nSTORY\nThe story is there, but is very, very light. There are lots of little bits and pieces of info scatterd throughout (esp the story of former dungeon Denzien Toorum). You're ultimately left with more questions than answers, but you don't walk away feeling unsatisfied, and that's what the expanded Story in Grimrock 2 is for as well.\n\nIn general if you are fan of or think you will enjoy the old grid based style then you'll like this game.

What do you mean you don't have much spare money, and this game is all you can afford, and you expect more from a developer. You just can't appreciate games based on values which were developed under the extreme restrictions of old hardware, and which are entirely outdated. No you're upset. You just don't understand.

Why you ask?  Because I seem to solve puzzles differently than how the game developer intended in Legend of Grimrock.  The game itself is fairly good for a dungeon crawler, with decent graphics, simple gameplay, and not too demanding hardware specifications.  The game relies on solving a series of puzzles and finding things to advance to the next level.  The game is linear, and if you don't solve the problem in the exact manner intended by the game developer, you WILL BE STUCK, like I've been.\n\nThe first time I time I played, I used a custom party of 1 fighter, 1 rogue, 2 mages, and I found the mages to be useless cheerleaders due to a lack of access to spells.  No problem.  Start a new game.  Second round of 2 fighters, 1 rogue, 1 mage seemed to be a better fit for the challenges awaiting me on level one.  However, there was a portion of the dungeon with 1 pit and 2 pressure plates, with snails waiting behind the gate.  I got past the pit with no trouble, and the gate lifted.  However, during the encounter I moved off the plate, and the gate slammed shut, with no way to lift.  From my previous playthrough with my abandoned party, I knew that this area was important in order to advance to the next stage.  With no way to lift the gate, I was stuck.  Thus, I needed to restart the level.\n\nMoving on to level 2, I almost cleared out the entire dungeon, if I could only find the two keys for the keyholes to the left and right out of gate, with a portal beckoning me to enter.  Unfortunately, I got stuck again.  Why? Because at the portion of the dungeon with two hidden rooms, I did not realize there was a second hidden room, with a key located there. I found 1 key in the room past the teleport trap, and used it.  When I retraced my step, I couldn't get the door to the second hidden room to open no matter how many times I pressed the hidden switch.  It appears that by using the key, I broke the script.  So now I've put five hours into the game, and I'm looking at the prospect of a third restart of the game.  Not worth it. :(","March 31, 2014","false","8.1"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","8","25","0","10"

A group of prisoners are sentenced to certain death by exiling them to the secluded Mount Grimrock for vile crimes they may or may not have committed. Unbeknownst to their captors, the mountain is riddled with ancient tunnels, dungeons and tombs built by crumbled civilizations long perished now. If they ever wish to see daylight again and reclaim their freedom the ragtag group of prisoners must form a team and descend through the mountain, level by level.\n\nThe game brings back the oldschool challenge with highly tactical real-time combat and grid-based movement, devious hidden switches and secrets as well as deadly traps and horrible monsters. Legend of Grimrock puts an emphasis on puzzles and exploration and the wits and perception of the player are more important tools than even the sharpest of swords could be. And if you are a hardened dungeon crawling veteran and you crave an extra challenge, you can arm yourself with a stack of grid paper and turn on the Oldschool Mode which disables the luxury of the automap!

Unfortunately, they failed to take into account that there is a reason I don't play those games anymore: that retro gameplay sucks.\n\nEven back in the day, I hated the ridiculous maze-like levels and the "find the hidden button" puzzles, and looking for keys to open the next area is a trope so old that even Duke Nukem made fun of it. The combat is mildly entertaining, but - having long mastered the attack/strafe techniques in the early '90s - it lacks challenge.

Now that I've played Legend of Grimrock through, I decided to change my vote to Recommended with some qualification. There is a great deal to love about LoG. I only wish the developers had reconsidered a couple of design decisions.\n\nUnderstand that LoG is a dungeon-crawler not truly an RPG. There is no role-playing and very little story. The only RPG elements are that you can generate your own party and determine your characters stats as they level. You interact with no other characters and converse with no one, not even your own party members. Where LoG succeeds is in its retro style and feel, but with contemporary high-quality graphics. Additionally, LoG has plenty of difficult battles, many fun and intriguing puzzles, and considerable switch-hunting (be warned). LoG is not a turn-based game as you might expect for an RPG; it's real-time. Depending on your expectations and playing style, this feature can be annoying or thrilling, because monsters can attack you unexpectedly as you view your map, manage your inventory, or even as you level up. I loved this aspect of the game.\n\nBe aware, though, that if you have only average manual dexterity, the game can at times become very frustrating as you load, reload, ad nauseum, trying to "solve" running/timing puzzles that occur in the game. A couple of these puzzles can be bypassed, but then you will miss some of the game's most coveted items. A few are required to progress, however, and these can be game-stoppers. Worse, the movement system is not really geared to running/timing puzzles because you move one square at a time, and it's quite easy to overrun your mark--yet these puzzles require precise timing without any room for error. I found it irksome that I could understand a puzzle, but couldn't "solve" it because my fingers weren't fast enough. This dimension of the game made little sense to me; after all, the game purports to be a dungeon CRAWLER, and this genre traditionally relies on wit, thought, and tactics, not rapid finger movements like a platform game. I finally was able to deal with the two worst of these puzzles. For one of them, I found an AutoHotKey script that with minor adjustments did the work for me; for the second, inspired by the script just mentioned, I developed my own AutoHotKey script. That was more challenging and satisfying than endlessly retrying a puzzle my fingers just wouldn't do.\n\nIn another odd design choice, the developers required some commonplace items to solve a puzzle essential to progress in the game, but then didn't include the items on that level. These were the kind of items players might have easily ditched as useless levels earlier. Being compelled to trudge back several levels to search for discarded items is not fun. Fortunately, you can use the LoG console to generate the items if you don't want to bother backtracking levels.\n\nStill, once you get beyond these issues, Legend of Grimrock is an enthralling game. If you're new to dungeon crawlers, don't expect something with the strong character interaction, huge world, and depth of story of, say, Dragon Age. That's not what Legend of Grimrock is about. But if the idea appeals to you of a dungeon-crawler/puzzler with heaps of combat, secrets, and wicked traps, go for it. You'll love Legend of Grimrock.","December 21, 2014","true","175.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is well-balanced but does NOT hold your hand-- this is not for your little sister to play, even on normal difficulty.\n\nWalking on a grid system took some getting used to, but the game is well-paced enough that by the time it hits its stride you're a master at it.\n\nThe game is going to give your the best experience during the FIRST playthrough only, though. As it is a puzzle game at heart-- the puzzles don't change. Going back through a second or third time would only be for the over-achievers that want to find all the secrets, hidden items, skulls (yes skulls), treasures and so on. I got 22/40 achievements just playing it through the first time. I only had to look up the solution to two puzzles in the entire 20hrs of gameplay, and felt halway clever the rest of the time. The game does a good job of coyly telling you what to look for, then letting you walk RIGHT past it soon after and NOT getting that cool sword that's hidden in the walls.\n\nBe patient, Be smart, Be methodical. Grimrock IS out to get you. Food is scarce and some enemies are a bit overpowered--- again, tough but fair. You'll have a blast wandering down its tunnels.

One of my favorite games of 2012 so far.","July 12, 2012","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kind of like a mix between Myst and Zork with great, tense combat. Scariest game I have played in a long time. It can instill a primal fear at times. Things are coming to get you!

A great little RPG/Dungeon crawler/puzzler.  Well worth the admission price.\n\nPros:\n-Fantastic Atmosphere\n-Figuring out Puzzles make you feel like the smartest man (or woman) alive\n-Linear levels, but still manages to make exploration rewarding\n-Great community support (e.g., dungeon editor).\n-Challenging without feeling unfair\n-Can be very rewarding\n\nNeutral:\n-Decent replayability - the dungeon loses some of it's magic on subsequent playthroughs (which is one of the strongest points of the game) but interesting party possibilities exist.\n-Small number of weapon upgrades for each type\n-Interesting perspective being a party of characters rather than 1 character or being an omniscient controller of the party.  Some will enjoy it, some won't.\n\nCons:\n-Combat takes some getting used to and feels slightly archaic\n-RPG elements (i.e., skill trees) are a weak point, imo.  They seem poorly thought out for the vanilla game\n-Some abilities/skills/stats are blatantly superior to others (particularly on higher difficulties)\n-A bit of a learning curve","December 30, 2014","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
