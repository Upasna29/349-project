"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IdealMind/recommended/422630/","IdealMind","Temperr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IdealMind/","38 products in account","This review has been thought up over a course of a week or two.  All controls will be listed below.Firstly, I would like to compliment the music to which the game has been implemented with.  During the gradual progress of building, it provides a calming and relatively relaxed atmosphereic feeling to the player.  Given the current models, it seems next to anything can be built, from single rooms to cities and worlds (Provided you have the time, or desire for it.)  All while being free, with nice graphics as well, you get the benefit of both creating something with any tool at your hands, to bragging to your friends about the next Wonder of the World you've created.  There are, however, some misconceptions.  During the reviews, it is said that the game does not automatically place things in the center, which can lead to items being off with the previously placed object.  The game has a 'snatch and place', system, from what I can tell.  Items that are placed on one another generally stack in the center, although it is possible for them to stop stacking provided the angle you're working at.  I believe this allows for players to move things at a bend, perhaps if you wanted to create the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or a statue.  A railroad, even.  The 2nd snapshot provides an example of its system, allowing you to create large, or small, items which lean either way.  At some points, however, you do have to focus on an item in order to allign them correctly, perhaps through a small crack of sorts.\n\nHow can I see the controls in-game?If you wish to change the controls, press "esc", then "Settings", click "Input", and click "Reset to Default."\nThis will show you the controls.\n\nCurrent Controls.Horizontal Movement - A+D\nVertical Movement - W + S\n"Run" - Left Shift\nMove Up - C\nMove Down - Space\nRotate B.I.T. First Axis (Changes the object) - Q\nRotate B.I.T. Second Axis (Changes the object) - E\nAction - E\nMain Menu - Esc.\nSimulation Time Shift  - F (Drag your mouse when holding F, left or right.  The sun appears on different sides based on which way you move your mouse)\nAction Modifier - Left Shift\nUndo - Ctrl + Z\nToggle Construction UI - Tab\n","January 19","true","4.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I really love the game, everything fits together nicely and I love the different kinds of materials and block types. However I do have a few suggestions to make the game better(if that is possible) 1. Remove the ability to place blocks under the ground. 2. Make the ground collidable. 3. Make the sun and certain materials like diamond ec. better. Thank you for reading this review, I really enjoy this game and I am really suprised on the fact that this game is only a few(almost 3 as I am writing this) months old.
