I think you'll enjoy this sequel as much as the first one. Recommended.\n","May 26, 2015","true","7.3"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","15","25","0","1"

It plays the same as the first game.\nThe unique but sometimes annoying magic crest system is still here as well as the frequent party member changes.\n\nI came into this sequel not expected much difference from the first game and that's exactly what I got.\n\nThis game follows the same storyline right after the first game, but nothing else has changed with the gameplay or graphics.\nOne of the unique features of the first game was the Rojak Fragments which were hidden throughout the world and added replay in the quest to find them all.\nThis game however, has no side quests like that, or at all.\n\nBasically, this is a rather generic but fun turn-based RPG, with rather ugly dark graphics, bad and forgettable dialogue, and ugly character design.\nThe usual limitations of an RPG maker game remain here as well, which means no broadcasting, screenshots, overlay, or chatting with your friends without the use of alt-tab.\n\nThe gameplay is the saving grace here, as I enjoyed the battles much as I did in the previous version.\n\nThis is one of the better RPG maker games and one of the better developers.","March 5","true","14.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This one did seem to let you roam around a little more than Vagrant Hearts (which is good), but there were still some issues with the characters and the character interactions. I would still recommend, but maybe get it on sale?","September 28, 2015","true","13.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"
