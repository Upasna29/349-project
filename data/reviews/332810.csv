I just don't know what.  The other games in the series (same game play time) felt more engaging and engrossing, but this one just lacked some ompf.  Game play changed slightly from the earlier games, with voice overs (I had to switch these off), and there seemed to be less hidden object puzzles and the problem solving games didn't seem as challenging.  This game certainly felt more linear than the other games in the series.\n\nI'd recommend it, but only when it's on sale due to the lack of overall engagement and challenge.","December 26, 2014","true","4.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Unfortunatly, from the opening scenes to the main menu into the gameplay all it did was lag. lag, lag, lag. the opening scene which should only take a few seconds to get through, took 5 minutes. I tired skipping through thinking maybe just the opening scenes were the problem but I was wrong.\n\nMy excitement to play this game turned to disappointment when I couldn't get it to run without lagging. Hopefully Steam will let me get a refund.","June 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
